[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.400]   Boy.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.400]   You read of my mind.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.400]   >> Great minds.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.400]   Well, we both went to the same fine educational institution.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.400]   >> That's true.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.400]   >> As did Colton.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.400]   >> As did Colton, who is calling me, but I'm going to call him.
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.400]   >> Oh, okay, man.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.400]   >> And I called him earlier, and he rejected me.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.400]   But let's see if he'll accept now.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.400]   >> Did he?
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.400]   He's a prickly fellow, you know.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   >> Is he-- you guys-- were you roommates or just friends?
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.400]   >> Just friends.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.400]   He lived a few floors below me.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.400]   >> You're in the same--
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.400]   >> No, it's Phelps Hall.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.400]   >> Oh, the God, there he is.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.400]   >> You're in Phelps.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.400]   >> No, no, no, I wasn't saying anything about that.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.400]   >> I was in Derphi.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.400]   >> Oh, really?
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   >> Derphi Hall.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.400]   >> Yeah, I remember that one on the other side.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.400]   >> Derphi's across from-- yeah, it's on the other side.
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.400]   >> Phelps came.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.400]   >> Right.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.400]   >> Firemer correctly, yes.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.400]   >> Phelps is where the women first stayed when they let women in to a Yale.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.400]   >> Well, I had a co-educational bathroom.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.400]   >> Yeah, see.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.400]   >> I speak connected to the-- there were two suites and there were co-authors.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   There were two suites and there were connected by a bathroom.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.400]   And the R suite was a male suite and the other suite was a female suite.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.400]   And so we shared a bathroom, which was quite a progressive thing to do.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   >> Well, think about it.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   It was a scant 10 years before that women were allowed to actually go through the gate.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.400]   >> And oh, the scrapes we got into.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.400]   That became the sitcom, "Three's Cut" actually.
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.400]   >> That's right.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.400]   Jonathan Colton is also on the line.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.400]   Also--
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.400]   >> I am.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.400]   >> Are you both in Brooklyn?
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.400]   >> Yes, we are.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.400]   >> And you're probably within feet of each other and yet?
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.400]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.400]   >> We're--
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.400]   >> No, Jonathan lives in the north part of Barkslope.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.400]   >> Do people still play stick ball in Brooklyn?
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.400]   >> Not people like us.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.400]   >> No, heaven for fans.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.400]   >> What does that mean, Jonathan?
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.400]   >> Well, I assume you're asking about poor people, Leo?
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.400]   >> No, no, my dad played stick ball when he grew up in New York.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.400]   >> No, you know, I don't see stick ball particularly.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.400]   That is the great old game.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.400]   >> Willy--
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.400]   >> Jonathan--
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.400]   Jonathan Leitham in his book "Fortress of Solitude" talked about all sorts of old Brooklyn games
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.400]   that they would play with pinky balls and ground up broken glass.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.400]   That was another game they played.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.400]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.400]   >> Roll a child down the street, that sort of thing.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.400]   >> So, we did not do any preparation for this and true to my, you know, true to my--
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.400]   tradition, I have no idea where we're going with this or anything, but I just thought it would be kind of--
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.400]   >> Just like the holidays themselves.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   >> Yeah, it fits in, doesn't it?
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.400]   >> No, I think so.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.400]   Did you get the eggnog?
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.400]   >> I have the requisite eggnog.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.400]   Do you have eggnog?
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.400]   >> I do, Jonathan.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   Do you have eggnog?
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.400]   >> I have eggnog as well.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.400]   >> Fantastic.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.400]   That's all that matters.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.400]   >> We're all happily nogged.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.400]   >> Suddenly, it's a holiday.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.400]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:14.400]   >> Why drinking something that is thick and sweet would make this a holiday?
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.400]   It's very strong.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.400]   >> Posh, do you have alcoholic eggnog?
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.400]   >> Mm-hmm.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.400]   I don't know.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.400]   Can you tell?
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.400]   Sometimes you can't tell with eggnog.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.400]   It all tastes alcoholic.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.400]   The trick is to use alcoholic eggs.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.400]   >> Those are the best.
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.400]   >> All right, I've saved this.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.400]   I deferred opening the gift.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.400]   >> Jonathan, you didn't send me a gift.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.400]   >> You haven't opened it yet.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.400]   Yes, Jonathan, did you send Leo a gift?
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.400]   >> This is from both of us, Leo.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.400]   >> Oh, thank you.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.400]   >> Oh, it's not from both of us.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.400]   [laughter]
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.400]   >> Oh, it was so kind of you.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.400]   You shouldn't have.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.400]   >> I paid for most of it.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.400]   It was John's idea, but I paid for most of it.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.400]   >> First of all, I have to observe that it is wrapped in butcher paper.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.400]   >> Yes.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.400]   >> And tied with twine.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.400]   >> It's a steak.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.400]   >> It could be a--
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.400]   >> It's a flat-iron steak.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.400]   >> It's a steak.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.400]   Delicious.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.400]   >> I have to say, it's a little bit given away by the sticker on the front.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.400]   >> Which says what it is, of course.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:19.400]   >> Which says it's-- but I can't-- I scarce can believe my eyes.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.400]   That it's what it says it is.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.400]   [laughter]
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:28.400]   So I guess I'll open this and we'll see if it really is what it says it is.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.400]   >> I'll give the listeners a hint.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.400]   >> Aside from it saying what it is, it also says it is 100% acrylic.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.400]   And then it warns do not eat.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:41.400]   [laughter]
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.400]   >> You might be tempted to because it is in fact a bacon scarf.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.400]   >> Yes.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.400]   >> Oh, so festive.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.400]   >> Not a scarf made of bacon.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.400]   >> No, but look at that.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.400]   >> A scarf that resembles bacon.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.400]   [laughter]
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.400]   >> A scarf--
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.400]   >> A scarf, because it's much less greasy on your neck.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.400]   >> I was going to say a scarf made of bacon doesn't have much warming effect.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.400]   >> Well, it depends.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.400]   It depends on how precious it does.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.400]   >> It's a bacon.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.400]   >> It's a bacon.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.400]   >> It does.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.400]   >> Exactly.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.400]   It also has horrible disfiguring burning effect too.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.400]   [laughter]
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.400]   >> Oh, but you taste good for days.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.400]   >> Well, so we thought we'd do kind of an unusual to it, not really talk about tech news at all,
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.400]   but in fact celebrate the holiday season.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:26.400]   The days are getting shorter and the weather is getting a little nippy and we've all got eggnog,
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.400]   so that can only mean one thing.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.400]   >> It's holiday time.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.400]   >> It's that time you--
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.400]   >> That's right.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.400]   >> You guessed very good.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.400]   Congratulations.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.400]   [laughter]
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.400]   >> I had a feeling that's where you were going.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.400]   >> You could--I was trying to think of a joke, but actually I thought maybe sometimes, you
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.400]   know, if you don't have a joke, the truth will out.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.400]   It's just--
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.400]   >> Yes.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.400]   >> It's a good way to go.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.400]   >> That is my policy, typically.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.400]   Just tell the truth and usually it's hilarious.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.400]   [laughter]
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.400]   >> That, with fact, is how the books came about, I'm sure.
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.400]   >> Did you know that "Nog" is part of the name from the word "Noggin" in Middle English
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.400]   phrase used to describe a small wooden carved mug?
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.400]   >> So it describes the vessel as opposed to the drink.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.400]   >> I suppose that's why a head was referred to as a noggin as well.
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.400]   If you had an empty head, you had a noggin for a head.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.400]   >> Oh, how interesting.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:22.400]   >> I found out probably from the same source that you're using right now, I suspect, that--
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.400]   >> I'm using the Encyclopedia Britannica 1922 edition.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.400]   >> Exactly.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.400]   >> I'm saying that's what I thought.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.400]   >> Exactly.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.400]   >> It's only one you can trust.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.400]   >> Right.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.400]   >> Subsequent editions were absolutely polluted by.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.400]   >> By vandalism because anyone could write in it.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.400]   >> Right.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.400]   And also by modernity.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.400]   >> Yes, exactly.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.400]   >> Modernity is polluting.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:55.400]   So the piggy bank, also interestingly enough, refers to the vessel, not the pig.
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:02.400]   A pig was a ceramic vessel that you-- P-Y-G-G.
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.400]   >> Yeah, that makes a lot of sense because that's a salt pig.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.400]   Do you know what a salt pig is?
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.400]   It's a piece of crockery.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:10.400]   I've lost you.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.400]   >> No, you haven't.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.400]   >> Are you there?
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.400]   >> I'm still here.
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.400]   >> I can hear him.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:19.400]   >> This happened-- I have to tell you, Jonathan, this happens every time I talk to Jonathan
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.400]   Skype.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.400]   >> I think he's making it up, maybe.
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.400]   >> He thinks I'm gone.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:29.400]   But thank goodness you're here this time to prove that it isn't me, it's him, isn't it?
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.400]   >> Hello, I'm back.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.400]   >> He is back.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.400]   >> What happened?
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.400]   >> What were you saying about me?
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.400]   >> Nothing.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.400]   >> What happened?
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.400]   >> What happened?
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.400]   >> Why did you go away and why did you come back?
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:51.400]   >> Well, I'll tell you, I went to synchronize my cellular telephone and that caused my headphones
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.400]   to be a little bit more quiet.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:57.400]   >> You did that in the middle of a-- in the middle of a twit?
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.400]   >> Yes, he did.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.400]   >> What?
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.400]   >> It's crazy.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.400]   >> It's crazy.
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.400]   >> He took a sinking your iPhone right now?
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.400]   >> Well, how do you know I have an iPhone?
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.400]   >> Oh, I hear they are fantastic, by the way.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.400]   I hear their wonderful products.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.400]   I might get one for Christmas for somebody.
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.400]   >> Oh, wouldn't that be nice?
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.400]   >> That's--
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.400]   >> Somebody would be more than grateful.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.400]   >> Did you say, "Well, I was away."
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.300]   >> Merely, that this happened to me the last time I talked to you, you would just
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:25.300]   say, "Are you there?" and would disappear.
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:31.300]   >> Yes, it's actually-- well, the problem is I'm being visited by ghosts as well as people.
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:35.300]   >> Also, it's your habit to sink your iPhone every five minutes.
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.300]   >> Well, yes, you never know what might be unsinked in life.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.300]   >> Actually, I confess to doing that, as a matter of fact.
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.300]   So, I'm looking in the Oxford English Dictionary.
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.300]   This is the 1928 edition.
[00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.300]   >> That's acceptable, borderline, but accept.
[00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:54.300]   >> It's a little bit of modernity might have crept in, but not much.
[00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.300]   >> And what does it say in there?
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.300]   >> A pig is a type of orange clay used for making pottery.
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.300]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:00.300]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:06.300]   >> So, what I was saying before I went away is a salt pig is a kind of ceramic container where you keep salt when you're cooking.
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.300]   >> Perfect.
[00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.300]   >> None of this having anything to do with the animal.
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:12.300]   So, it's just sort of, I guess, that followed.
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.300]   They said, "This is a piggy bank.
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.300]   Hey, some marketing genius said, "Hey, let's make it shaped like a pig, too."
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.300]   >> Well, get ready for this.
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:29.300]   This could be an eerie coincidence, or it could be proof that aliens, in fact, did, you know, cause evolution to happen in the planet Earth.
[00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:38.300]   Strangely enough, the Indonesian term, "salengang" is also used in the context of domestic banks.
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:42.300]   "Salengang" is a wild boar.
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:47.300]   So, the etymology of "piggy bank" in both English and Indonesian.
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.300]   >> Oh, wow.
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:50.300]   Completely separate linguistic development.
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.300]   >> Or "alien invasion."
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.300]   >> That's true.
[00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.300]   >> You'd be the judge.
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.300]   >> Obviously, aliens.
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.300]   >> Obviously, no.
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.300]   >> But in Indonesia, they don't use the term "piggy bank."
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.300]   They use the term "alien head bank."
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.300]   [laughter]
[00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:04.300]   Because they keep their money in crystal skulls.
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.300]   >> Ah, the crystal skull once again.
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.300]   >> Surprised you did not know that.
[00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:13.300]   Now, do you have some crystal skull? Did you get some?
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:18.300]   >> I gave, you know, I gave, in the spirit of the holidays, I gave my crystal head vodka away.
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.300]   >> Oh, no.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.300]   >> Just this way.
[00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.300]   >> I had a few sips of it.
[00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.300]   >> I remember your review on "Boring Boing."
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:32.300]   >> It was given to me, it was given to me by my book editor, Mr. Sean McDonald, who had ordered it, I think, quasi-legally from California.
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:34.300]   It's not for sale in New York, as of yet, I don't believe.
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:35.300]   >> Oh, really?
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:38.300]   >> And it was shipped to him, quasi-legally.
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:44.300]   And I enjoyed it, and I sipped some of it, so that I might do a taste test for it for "Boring Boing."
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.300]   And I enjoyed it quite a bit.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:56.300]   But then I had lunch with my fond acquaintance, Mr. Christopher McCullough, also known as Jackson Public Creator of the Venture Brothers cartoon, which features a lot of skulls in it.
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:01.300]   And he was very excited about "Christmas and Paga" and he told me he had been looking for it and looking for it and looking for it.
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:08.300]   And like a sort of holiday, crystal head skull miracle, I put it in my messenger bag and brought it to lunch and gave it to him.
[00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.300]   So now I'm on the hunt for some more.
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:21.300]   In California, when Jonathan and I performed together in Los Angeles last month, I put on Twitter, please, if anyone can find some Crystal Head Bodka, bring it to the show.
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:27.300]   And it is quite available in California, apparently, because I think we got four or five bottles of it.
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.300]   In a way, that was too much crystal head skull.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.300]   I don't think so.
[00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:37.300]   It just enhanced the psychic resonance of the entire evening.
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:41.300]   I was receiving messages from all over the solar system at that point.
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:45.300]   Once you drain the head of vodka, do you keep the skull?
[00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:49.300]   You smash it in the fireplace, I think.
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:59.300]   What you do is after you drain the crystal skull of vodka, you put it into a crate and then you walk it down into a storehouse full of identical crates.
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:04.300]   And very slowly wheel it down and hide it among the other crates.
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:08.300]   All your other rare artifacts and mystical items.
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:13.300]   See, there's a real flaw in that logic because it's so heavily magnetized that you just...
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.300]   Exactly.
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.300]   Exactly.
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.300]   It just doesn't work.
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.300]   So heavily magnetized that you...
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.300]   Boy, I really don't want to talk about that.
[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.300]   No, enough.
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.300]   I was just doing it so upset.
[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:39.300]   So you guys, one of the reasons I want to get you guys on is, first of all, I think people who don't realize that John Hodgman, who is very well known from his appearance in the fabulous movie Baby Mama, is primarily well known.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:41.300]   I think mostly that's why people might have seen you.
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:53.300]   Or maybe because of your fabulous books, two of them now, the areas of my expertise followed by basically a clone more information than you require, minus the hobo names.
[00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.300]   I prefer the term an augmented continuation.
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.300]   [laughter]
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:59.300]   There's sequel.
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.300]   And by the way, in Booksters Now it makes a fine holiday gift.
[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:19.300]   But you and Jonathan Colton, best known for many wonderful songs such as Christmas on Chiron Beta Prime and Code Monkey, were friends at college and have remained friends ever since, except for that period in the 90s.
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:27.300]   Yes, the period in the 90s when we did not speak to one another because I grew a better beard than John.
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.300]   It's all about the whiskers.
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.300]   It was a very nice beard.
[00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:34.300]   It was an incredible beard.
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.300]   God, it still makes me angry to think about how you grew a beard.
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:38.300]   I know, I'm sorry.
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.300]   But you know what, Jonathan?
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:43.300]   Look, it's been a long time. It's water under the bridge now. It's the holidays.
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.300]   I'm going to tell you something.
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.300]   The beard was fake.
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.300]   [laughter]
[00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.300]   Are you kidding me? That wasn't even a real beard?
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:58.300]   No. In fact, I'm kind of surprised that you thought it was a real beard because all I did was just steal a beard off of a New York City Corner Santa Claus.
[00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:03.300]   Yeah, it was a long white, long white, it was a long white bushy beard.
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.300]   It was 100% acrylic. I warned you, do not eat it.
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.300]   Yeah.
[00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:11.300]   And it didn't match my hair at all.
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:14.300]   I did think the color was unusual now that you mentioned it.
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.300]   Yeah, well, I thought it was a joke between us.
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:27.300]   I thought that I came to go see you play at the governance that night at the open mic night back when you were just starting out when no one would come to see you except me and my crazy fake Santa beard.
[00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:32.300]   And I wore that just to make you think that someone else was coming to hear you sing.
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.300]   Yeah, two fans.
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.300]   Yeah, so you thought.
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.300]   One with the beard and one without.
[00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:40.300]   Yeah, because I would sit there and I would listen and I would drink my nog, of course.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:48.300]   And then I would say, "Oh, Jonathan, before you play this next song, I'm going to go to the bathroom and go put on the fake Santa beard and come sit out.
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.300]   This is going to be my big present to you, like to surprise you."
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.300]   Like, "Oh, look, there's a guy with a great big beard."
[00:17:54.300 --> 00:18:02.300]   And I'd just go back and forth like that, but you realized it was me and you thought I was growing a beard in the bathroom every time, then you got very angry about it and I didn't know how to explain to you it was fake.
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.300]   Well, now I feel bad for two reasons.
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:07.300]   One, because I obviously misunderstood your intentions.
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:17.300]   And two, because you're telling me that the falling out we had for several years in the 90s was based on a misunderstanding that you just never chose to clear up.
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.300]   I just didn't know how to tell you until now.
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.300]   Yeah.
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.300]   Well, I can see it is complicated.
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:27.300]   And now I realize the best way to tell you was to simply explain what I had done.
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:28.300]   Great.
[00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.300]   And here we see again how hilarious the truth is.
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.300]   I know.
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.300]   It's another lesson for the holidays.
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:43.300]   This is a time when people come together and put aside old arguments and old fake beard schemes and remind themselves why they like one another.
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:45.300]   So I'm sorry, Jonathan.
[00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:47.300]   Well, I'm sorry too.
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:51.300]   Actually, I'm currently wearing a fake beard right now and I'm going to take it off.
[00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:52.300]   I feel bad about it.
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:59.300]   I'm just, this is exactly what I was hoping for in the spirit of the holiday we could have in a special holiday edition of Twit.
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.300]   It is.
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.300]   There's going to be a lot of a lot of the grievances aired.
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.300]   Yeah.
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.300]   A lot of the warmth exchanged.
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.300]   A lot of the spirits come.
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.300]   The spirit gum.
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.300]   That's probably where the name came from.
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:13.300]   Yeah.
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.300]   It's the spirit gum of the season.
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:15.300]   Yeah.
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:21.300]   So you guys went out on book tour together when John's new book came out.
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.300]   More information than you require.
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:25.300]   Published by Dutton.
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.300]   And for the previous book.
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.300]   Oh, that's neat.
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:32.300]   And it was when we are on book tour that I requested the Crystal Head vodka.
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.300]   Right.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:37.300]   And not only did I get four or five or I guess I should say we get four or five bottles of the Crystal Head vodka.
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:41.300]   One of them was signed by its creator, Mr. Dan Acroy.
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.300]   Wow.
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.300]   Someone had gone, you know, because it is Dan Acroy.
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.300]   It's privately.
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.300]   Right.
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.300]   Of vodka, the Crystal Head vodka.
[00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:53.300]   And a fellow had very kindly had brought it.
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:58.300]   His brother owns a liquor store and Dan Acroy was signing bottles and he got one and he brought it and he gave it to me.
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:19:59.300]   But I could not accept it.
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.300]   I could not accept such a gift.
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.300]   There are some gifts you cannot accept.
[00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.300]   Which is another thing about the holidays you have to realize.
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.300]   Some gifts are too generous.
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.300]   That is, well, should I, you want the bacon scarf back because.
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.300]   A little bit.
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.300]   Yeah.
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.300]   I think that's kind of what I'm saying.
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.300]   Yeah.
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:17.300]   Okay.
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.300]   I'll just keep it right up.
[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.300]   And I was a little...
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.300]   Keep it leo.
[00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.300]   It's from both of us and I say that you have.
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.300]   I'll send a half to him and keep the other half.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.300]   It'll be a short bacon scarf.
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:31.300]   If you were to do that, you would have to send me a little bit more than half because I paid for most of it.
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:44.300]   I know that Mr. Colton appears on the audio recording of the areas of my expertise, singing free old rock lobster and performing behind these 700 hobo names.
[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.300]   Yes.
[00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.300]   Does he have a...
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.300]   Will he have in the audio recording, which I'm sure is imminent of more information than you require?
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:53.300]   Will he have a place there?
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.300]   Well, certainly.
[00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.300]   I hope so.
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.300]   But it depends on what his schedule allows, Jonathan.
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.300]   Are you planning to...
[00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.300]   Yeah, I think...
[00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:06.300]   Between the tour of South Africa and then the Indonesian Crystal Head Piggybank tour.
[00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:07.300]   2009.
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:12.300]   I think the 700 mole man names really will need a soundtrack, frankly.
[00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:18.300]   Well, that's the problem, though. We haven't been able to figure out what soundtrack, you know, with the 700 hobo names, it was obvious.
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:21.300]   Big Rock Candy Mountains, the famous old hobo song.
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.300]   How many times did you have to play that over and over to match?
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.300]   I have never counted...
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.300]   Just counted.
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.300]   Yeah, I mean, however long... I don't know.
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.300]   I've never counted how many iterations there were, but there were many.
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:37.300]   It was quite... I have to say, I did not expect it to be as physically taxing as it was.
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:42.300]   But by the end of it, you know that feeling when you come home from the grocery store and you've been carrying heavy bags and your fingers are all...
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.300]   Yeah.
[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.300]   ...knotted up.
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.300]   No, I don't know that feeling.
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.300]   Well, John doesn't know I know.
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:49.300]   He has very soft hands because he's never done it on a stay.
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.300]   I have my groceries delivered by orphans.
[00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.300]   Yeah.
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:59.300]   But that's how I felt at the end of it. I had to, like, claw on my left hand.
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:04.300]   Did you scream at the end of the recording session, "I've got blisters on me fingers?"
[00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.300]   [laughter]
[00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.300]   I should have. That would have been good.
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.300]   Wasn't it an opportunity?
[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:13.300]   You know, I actually... I made that reference in a blog post.
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.300]   I was just thinking this the other day.
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.300]   I made that reference in a blog post.
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.300]   I was complaining about how I had been playing guitar a lot.
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.300]   And then I did that.
[00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.300]   I said that sentence with an exclamation point.
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:25.300]   And I got a lot of comments that were like, "Ooh, sorry to hear about your blisters."
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.300]   Oh, geez.
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:29.300]   I feel like nobody... everybody takes me very seriously online.
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.300]   I don't know.
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:32.300]   You're a jokester.
[00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.300]   And it's time people finally realized that.
[00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:36.300]   It should be clear.
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:37.300]   Yeah.
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.300]   You know, without the context of the sound of your voice,
[00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:44.300]   it may be hard that you're making a joke when you say, "I've got blisters on me fingers."
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.300]   Because people presume that you're maimed in some way
[00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:49.300]   and you suddenly started talking like a sailor.
[00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.300]   [laughter]
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.300]   They don't know your whole life history.
[00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:56.300]   They don't know that you grew up in Colchester, Connecticut, and went to Yale with me.
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:02.300]   And that we then moved to New York and worked, you know, day jobs very near each other.
[00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:08.300]   And we tried to convince one another to quit our day jobs and do something more creative with our lives.
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:09.300]   You were a literary agent.
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.300]   Jonathan was a programmer.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.300]   That's correct.
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.300]   And you... but were you both commissed?
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:14.300]   Did you commiserate?
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.300]   Did you gather and say, "Why are we doing these stupid things?"
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:20.300]   I would just say to Jonathan, "Why are you doing this stupid thing?"
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:21.300]   Right.
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:22.300]   Because I...
[00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.300]   Yeah, that makes more sense, actually.
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.300]   I didn't...
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:25.300]   Yeah.
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.300]   I'm a professional literary agent.
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:28.300]   This is fantastic.
[00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:29.300]   You were doing quite well.
[00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:30.300]   Yeah.
[00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.300]   I was doing quite well.
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:33.300]   But I remember...
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.300]   Did you actually represent...
[00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:35.300]   While I was a people...
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.300]   Did you actually represent anybody?
[00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.300]   Yes, I did.
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:44.300]   I represented the novelist Darren Strauss, who wrote Chang and Eng, the novel about the Siamese twins,
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.300]   for whom the term Siamese twin was coined.
[00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.300]   Right.
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:52.300]   I represented the famous B-movie actor Bruce Campbell, star of the Evil Dead and Evil Dead II,
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.300]   and the third Evil Dead movie, Army of Darkness.
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:59.300]   So, really, Jonathan also was commiserating with you.
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:06.300]   Yeah, I was working through my own dissatisfaction with my life that I was afraid to admit to myself
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.300]   by telling Jonathan everything he was doing was wrong.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:15.300]   And Jonathan frequently uses me as a...
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.300]   He tells me to do the things that he really wants himself to do.
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:20.300]   That has happened many times in the past.
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:21.300]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:24.300]   You're my guinea pig, that's all.
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.300]   Yeah.
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.300]   My friend and my guinea pig.
[00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.300]   But in those days, we would frequently...
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:33.300]   We would frequently, I feel like, as our group of friends would always say to each other,
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:34.300]   "Why?
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:35.300]   Why?
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.300]   We have a lot of talented people doing creative things.
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.300]   Why don't we just do a thing altogether?"
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:40.300]   Right.
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.300]   And then we'd have another beer and it would be late.
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.300]   Egg dog.
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:44.300]   False.
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.300]   So, who did it first?
[00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.300]   Who left the mainstream first?
[00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.300]   Well, Jonathan...
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.300]   Yeah, Jonathan would not take my advice and quit his job with no prospects.
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:54.300]   So...
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.300]   You had to.
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.300]   You had to leave it first and started writing for magazines.
[00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.300]   I had already been writing for magazines.
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.300]   Now, this is where the bacon scarf comes in because you...
[00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:08.300]   At least one of your articles that you kindly sent me a clipping of was about fried...
[00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:09.300]   Fair food.
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:13.300]   Yes, almost all of my articles were about fried fair food and unfair enough.
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:14.300]   Interesting.
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:19.300]   My first job after being a professional literary agent was to write a food...
[00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:24.300]   A food and drink and non-wine alcohol column for Men's Journal magazine.
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.300]   Why non-wine?
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.300]   I find wine to be very confusing.
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.300]   Too hard.
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.300]   Too hard.
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.300]   Booze.
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.300]   Simple.
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.300]   Well, it is comparatively simple.
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.300]   It's either brown or clear.
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:41.300]   Unless it's like you're talking like Perno and it's kind of slightly green tinge.
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:46.300]   And then you add water to it and it becomes cloudy and murky like it has a terrible secret
[00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:47.300]   it wants to hide.
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:48.300]   Ooh.
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:52.300]   Are you pleased that Absynth has returned to the marketplace?
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:59.300]   Well, insofar as I am glad all hysteria finally falls away and we return to reason and we
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:03.300]   realize that we're not all going to cut off our years just because we drink Absynth.
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:04.300]   Wormwood!
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.300]   Wormwood, I think.
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.300]   It's just Massestiria.
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.300]   Yeah.
[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.300]   It was Massestiria.
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:13.300]   It was the same reason that red M&Ms were banned for a while.
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.300]   And also Nichols.
[00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.300]   Really?
[00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:17.300]   Yeah.
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.300]   Oh, do you remember?
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.300]   In 1978, everyone became convinced that Nichols were cursed.
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.300]   And they outlawed them.
[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:24.300]   They didn't make them until 1984.
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:25.300]   Nichols.
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:26.300]   That's because George Washington's head.
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:30.300]   And I always thought this looked a little bit like a crystal skull.
[00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.300]   You mean Thomas Jefferson's head, Leo?
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.300]   Whoever.
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:34.300]   Whatever.
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.300]   You know that guy.
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.300]   Oh boy.
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.300]   I guess we know who's the Nemismatist here.
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.300]   I'm just going to say we've got a closet and a Nemismatist in our midst.
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.300]   And you try saying that three times fast.
[00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:45.300]   I refuse to do it.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.300]   Did you ever collect coins?
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.300]   Either one of you?
[00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:52.300]   My uncle passed down a collection of pennies.
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.300]   I didn't have to say that.
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.300]   A collection, maybe not a collection exactly.
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:57.300]   Oh no, they were in folders.
[00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:01.300]   They were in folders and everything, including the wartime steel pennies.
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:02.300]   Oh.
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.300]   Because copper.
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.300]   Right.
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.300]   The thing I said about Nichols was obviously not true.
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.300]   What?
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:13.300]   But the copper was apparently useful for the making of bullets and airplanes and guns.
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.300]   And so the wire.
[00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.300]   So they stopped making copper pennies for a while instead.
[00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:20.300]   They made them out of steel.
[00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:23.300]   Instead they made them out of Nichols.
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.300]   They made them out of Nichols and they made dollars out of marble.
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:32.300]   Hard to fold up in that money clip, but much more durable.
[00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.300]   I'm sorry, hinged marble.
[00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.300]   Oh, all right.
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:38.300]   There was very handy.
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.300]   How many pennies did you have in that collection?
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:45.300]   Well, it was just given to me by my uncle and I never.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.300]   No, I know.
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.300]   But it was like 100 pennies or?
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.300]   Yeah, 100 pennies.
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.300]   It was a dollar worth.
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:55.300]   It was a dollar worth of pennies.
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:28:01.300]   I had a coin collection that was passed to me as well from my grandfather.
[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.300]   I don't think he was a particularly serious collector.
[00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:09.300]   But there were a few silver dollars in there and some rare Nichols and things.
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:11.300]   Did they come to you in a paper bag?
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:13.300]   Was that the hint that he wasn't?
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:15.300]   Wasn't that serious?
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.300]   No, they came in a purple velvet case.
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:21.300]   They were all very carefully laid away in their cases.
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.300]   It was kind of, I enjoyed it.
[00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.300]   I never expanded the collection at all.
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:38.300]   But there was a book I used to look up what their value was and sort of rub my hands gleefully over the $16 that I was going to collect when I finally decided to go to a coin collecting convention and sell those suckers.
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:43.300]   They're all now worth about one millionth of a euro.
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.300]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.300]   Well, is it everything?
[00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.300]   You know where those coins are right now?
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:51.300]   I know where they are.
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:53.300]   No, I couldn't put my hands on them immediately.
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:56.300]   My best guess would be in the attic of my childhood home.
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:58.300]   This is the holiday.
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.300]   Yeah, some gifts become a kind of burden.
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.300]   Yeah, see?
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.300]   Holiday lesson number three.
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:08.300]   I'm glad someone's numbering them because I don't have time for that.
[00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:13.300]   Well, you've done enough numbering in your fine book more information than you require.
[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.300]   Well, that was smoothly.
[00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:23.300]   Jonathan, when you and John go out on tour, by the way, I want to get a little topical.
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.300]   Twitter is not only a very topical show.
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:26.300]   No.
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:30.300]   Have you seen the video of President Bush dodging the shoe?
[00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:32.300]   No, I don't think I have.
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.300]   So it's on CNN.
[00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.300]   They've been running it over and over all day.
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:40.300]   Apparently, President Bush has visited Iraq as farewell to Iraq.
[00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:44.300]   Somebody and gave a press conference or somebody in the press conference took off both his shoes
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.300]   and shived them at the president's head.
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:50.300]   But the thing that's most remarkable, first of all, the aim was excellent.
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:55.300]   The president was very nimble and dodged both.
[00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.300]   With a quick truck.
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.300]   Sure.
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:58.300]   Well, he's physically fit.
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.300]   Very physically.
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:01.300]   I was it was remarkable.
[00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:06.300]   I think I can think of any president in living memory who would have been able to do that.
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:10.300]   Yeah, shoe ducking is a big sport, Texas.
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.300]   Oh, maybe that's why.
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.300]   Yeah.
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.300]   He had practice.
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.300]   I think you're, isn't it duck-shoeing?
[00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.300]   Sorry, my mistake.
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:18.300]   You can't shoe a duck.
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:20.300]   That's why it's a sport.
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:23.300]   I'm watching the video now.
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.300]   You see?
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.300]   See what I'm saying?
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:26.300]   Right.
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.300]   So he's shaking a hand and here it comes.
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.300]   Look at how fast, how quick his reflexes are.
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.300]   Whoa, there's one.
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:34.300]   Yep.
[00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:35.300]   It's romantic.
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.300]   Do you know something?
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:38.300]   I don't find this amusing at all.
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:39.300]   No.
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:44.300]   I think that that probably had to have been one of the most frightening moments in which is like terrifying.
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:45.300]   I don't wish.
[00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:48.300]   Not my candidate for president and either election.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:52.300]   I do not, I would not wish for him to feel that he was about to be killed at any given moment.
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:53.300]   No, absolutely not.
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:56.300]   That's a terrible thing.
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:31:00.300]   I don't even like it when they hit him with a pie.
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:04.300]   But I couldn't help but note his agility.
[00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:05.300]   I'm serious.
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.300]   I don't think there's any president in living memory who could have done what he did today.
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.300]   Do you think that he was a youth?
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.300]   He was bitten by a radioactive cobbler?
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:17.300]   He was really, he was like, whoa.
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:22.300]   If ever I were to field a dodge ball team of former presidents, he would be my first pick.
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:24.300]   Or a dodge shoe team.
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.300]   That's so strange.
[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:28.300]   They must have ended the press conference immediately.
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:29.300]   I fell off-stake.
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.300]   No, that's the other thing.
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:33.300]   The fun interesting if you watch the video is he stays there.
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.300]   They wrestle the guy to the ground.
[00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:40.300]   I think that in future press conferences, reporters will not be allowed to wear shoes.
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:45.300]   Well, I think for security reasons that's only sensible.
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:51.300]   But President Bush, it's interesting, stays at the podium and watches with interest as they wrestle him.
[00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:52.300]   He does not.
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.300]   The secret service does not, you would think the first thing it is.
[00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:57.300]   That's what I find surprising that he was not hustled way immediately.
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:58.300]   Yeah, that's kind of weird.
[00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.300]   And isn't the secret service supposed to take the bullet?
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:04.300]   If they can't, if they're fast enough to take the bullet, why can't they be fast enough to take the shoe?
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.300]   Aren't they supposed to get in the way?
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:10.300]   You know, this video raises more questions than it answers.
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:12.300]   It's the zapruder tape of our time.
[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:16.300]   I think that you actually raised a very interesting point.
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:19.300]   What, that seems like he was maybe set up.
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.300]   Oh, you think that was intentional shoe flinging?
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:24.300]   Oh, no, I'm just saying.
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:27.300]   I would have a long talking to it, those secret service agents.
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:36.300]   Well, you know, I suppose that they, when they're in a room like that, I would guess that the security measures are involved with keeping, you know, making sure there are no guns in the room.
[00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:38.300]   And once they do that, they sort of...
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:39.300]   Well, that's right.
[00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:40.300]   That was a step away from them.
[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:43.300]   But they're not there to jump in front of shoes.
[00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:49.300]   I'm told by our chat room that in fact in Iraq, it is considered a great insult to throw your shoes.
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:50.300]   I mean, that is...
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:51.300]   Oh, okay.
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:53.300]   There is some sort of cultural precedent.
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:54.300]   Yeah.
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:56.300]   That explains a lot.
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:59.300]   It explains why people have been throwing shoes at me at my readings.
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.300]   Do not go to Iraq.
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:02.300]   My...
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.300]   Iraqi.
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:05.300]   All the Iraqis who come to your readings show up for shoes.
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:08.300]   So describe to me what the readings involve lately.
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:10.300]   What have YouTube worked up together?
[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:15.300]   Aside from me scamming bottles of Crystal Head vodka off of audience members?
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:19.300]   Which is certainly not something, you know, I mean, that's a valuable thing to do.
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.300]   I'm not...
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.300]   Oh, yes, absolutely.
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:23.300]   I...
[00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:24.300]   I...
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:25.300]   Well, let's see.
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.300]   What else would we do, Jonathan?
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.300]   I can't think of anything else.
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.300]   I think just the vodka, wasn't it?
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.300]   Do you stick?
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:31.300]   Okay.
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:32.300]   So let me imagine the scene.
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.300]   The store is jammed, crowded with thousands of fans.
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:41.300]   Some of them wearing zombie makeup or carrying strangely mutilated unicorns.
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:42.300]   Others...
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:43.300]   You're talking about...
[00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.300]   Right now you're talking about a Jonathan Colton concert.
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:47.300]   Yeah, I've been the one.
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.300]   I know.
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:50.300]   My fans are much more civilized than Jonathan's.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:53.300]   Well, I'm saying the other half, it's like a wedding.
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.300]   There's one half of the aisle is that.
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.300]   The other half of the aisle they're wearing suits and their hair is...
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.300]   ...brillantined and they're very orderly.
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:07.300]   A lot of chunky glasses, a lot of blazers, a lot of briefcases.
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.300]   So do you...
[00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:13.300]   A lot of ironic briefcases, a lot of high school kids, a lot of high school boys.
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.300]   Dude, people is...
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:16.300]   Guys, I think you're very well...
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:21.300]   You're very well known for the Daily Show, but I think the probably best known for the Switchads, the Apple Switchads.
[00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:22.300]   Do people...
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.300]   Is there like a catchphrase?
[00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.300]   Do they say...
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:27.300]   Do they look at you and say, "I'm a PC?" or...
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:30.300]   They say, "Hey PC."
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:34.300]   I wouldn't call that a catchphrase exactly.
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:36.300]   More of a greeting.
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.300]   Hey, PC.
[00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:39.300]   Yo.
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.300]   Yeah, you know, people will...
[00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:44.300]   I was in Philadelphia last night at a wedding.
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:48.300]   And we went out after and at the bar a couple people came up to him and said, "Are you a...
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.300]   I'm a Mac or...
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:52.300]   Are you a Mac or a PC?"
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.300]   That's funny.
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.300]   They make a...
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:58.300]   Do you watch their eyes glaze a little bit as they try to think of a clever...
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:01.300]   ...you know, way to say that and make some joke out of it?
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:05.300]   I don't look into their eyes because I'm afraid they're going to steal my brains out there.
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:06.300]   Always a mistake.
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.300]   Always a mistake.
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:08.300]   My father taught me that.
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:11.300]   That's what I'm primarily concerned about when people approach me on the streets.
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.300]   No, the two things my father taught me that I will never forget.
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.300]   His rummies have no wind.
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.300]   So don't worry.
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:17.300]   You can outrun them.
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:18.300]   I'm not kidding.
[00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:21.300]   Rummies a big problem in your name.
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:26.300]   I guess, apparently, he had spent much time thinking about this.
[00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:28.300]   So don't worry about Rummies.
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:29.300]   They have no wind.
[00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:33.300]   And he also said, "Never catch the eye of a hobo."
[00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.300]   What?
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:35.300]   Wait a minute.
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.300]   Is that wrong?
[00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.300]   Did your father...
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.300]   No, no, no.
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.300]   I just need to say...
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:44.300]   First of all, Rummies have no wind.
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:47.300]   Did your father say, "I've got to give Leo some advice.
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:52.300]   What's the most weird and poetic way I can put this?"
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:53.300]   Drunks can't run fast?
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.300]   No, no, no.
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.300]   That's not good.
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:57.300]   Rummies have no wind.
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.300]   That's it.
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:00.300]   And I've really carried this with me.
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:01.300]   I'm not joking.
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:02.300]   This is something I've carried with me.
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:03.300]   I actually have a hobo.
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:04.300]   And never...
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.300]   You're doing the Great Depression, Leo?
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.300]   Well, he made out of Call them hobo's.
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:09.300]   What do you call them nowadays?
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.300]   You know, bums, I guess.
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:14.300]   Well, a hobo is a very specific sort of subculture.
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:15.300]   That's important.
[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.300]   I think that's important.
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.300]   People understand that they're a hobo.
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.300]   A bum is not all bums are hobo's.
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:27.300]   Well, when I refer to the hobo's in my previous book, The Areas of My Expertise, and talk
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:32.300]   about their attempt, a successful attempt to take over the United States government for
[00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.300]   a brief period of time in the '30s.
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:38.220]   You know, I'm talking about a specific subculture of people during the Great Depression, who
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:42.820]   self-identified as hobo's and chose a life of wandering and drinking and wearing the same
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:43.820]   pants all the time.
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:46.700]   I'm not talking about the contemporary urban homeless.
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:50.180]   Did you at any point when you gave up the literary career or the...
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:54.700]   Jonathan, the programming career, consider a life as a hobo?
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:55.700]   No.
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:56.700]   No.
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:57.700]   It doesn't sound very nice, actually.
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:58.700]   Not anymore.
[00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:00.700]   It's extremely dangerous, actually.
[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:01.700]   The train...
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:02.700]   And the fact...
[00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:07.540]   I remember when I was working as a literary agent, a lot of news came out because there
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:12.260]   are still people who do ride the rail, so it's much smaller community than it ever has
[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:13.260]   been.
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:14.260]   And someone was killing hobo's.
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.460]   I mean, there was a hobo serial.
[00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:17.460]   Wow.
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:20.820]   So, and you know, you fall off trains and then the bulls...
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:23.100]   The bulls, that's the name of the word I was looking for, the...
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.460]   The railroad police getcha.
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:25.460]   Yeah, the bulls.
[00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:26.460]   I really...
[00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:32.660]   You know, and there's a new movement of sort of young anarchist kids who, you know, self-identify
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:34.180]   as hobo's and we'll ride the rails.
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:38.860]   And I'm talking like young teenagers and into their late teens.
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:39.860]   And they're...
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:40.860]   They're...
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:42.660]   You know, I don't advise that to anybody.
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:43.660]   Yeah.
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:44.660]   I think it's dangerous stuff.
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:45.660]   Yeah.
[00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.660]   So that's my holiday gift to the youth.
[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:52.940]   You know, I think CNN is actually listening to this show because now on CNN, they're discussing
[00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:56.980]   why the Secret Service did not, in fact, block the shoe.
[00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:57.980]   Oh.
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.540]   And what is the answer that is given?
[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.740]   They were in the back room.
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.740]   That's not acceptable.
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:04.740]   Oh, okay.
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:06.740]   Not an acceptable answer.
[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:07.740]   I'm afraid.
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:08.740]   Yes.
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:10.940]   You know, and they're using a tellestrator.
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:11.940]   They're actually...
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.660]   Now we see we're chasing people off on the live version.
[00:38:14.660 --> 00:38:18.300]   The numbers, the audience numbers are actually plummeting as people run to this watch CNN.
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:23.060]   But they're using a tellestrator to show where the Secret Service was at the time.
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.700]   And they all emerge from the back room.
[00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.060]   I'm going to watch the...
[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:28.060]   Oh.
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:30.940]   All right, more eggnog while we consume this video.
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:34.780]   And by the way, I would like a count of how many times they've shown this on CNN because
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:38.980]   it seems to be in a continuous loop for the last six hours.
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.260]   I have a little drinking game.
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:43.980]   Every time someone throws a shoe at a president, I drink the egg mug.
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:44.980]   You don't drink much, do you?
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:47.740]   Oh, but I guess if you were watching today, you'd be very, uh, non-
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:48.740]   I know.
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:49.740]   You know, it's...
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.820]   I devised that game, so I would never have to drink the egg mug.
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:58.620]   And it's really, really bit me on the behind today.
[00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:02.660]   Let's, uh, so do you, Jonathan, do you sing songs when you do the book tour?
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:04.580]   Or are you just there for moral support?
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:05.580]   I'm sorry, Jonathan.
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:07.300]   We still haven't answered your question.
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:08.300]   I have a terrible answer.
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.300]   I don't mind.
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:10.940]   I don't mind because we're known on all of these shows.
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:14.140]   And I know you've never heard them, but if you'd ever have heard any of our shows for
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:17.540]   digressions, we, uh, Merlin Mann likes to call them rat holes.
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:18.540]   Yeah.
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:20.940]   Well, you, unlike a rummy, have plenty of wind.
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:25.060]   You've been preparing that for some time, haven't you?
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.060]   Did you not?
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:27.060]   Did you write it down?
[00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.980]   Yeah, you wrote it down on parchment and calligraphy before you said that.
[00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:33.660]   I have, I have here, I have here a piece of paper next to my computer and it says possible
[00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:36.220]   callbacks, question marks.
[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:39.180]   Under there I've written rummy equals no wind.
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:43.020]   Now, uh, in the chat room, they're telling me that these are bromides.
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:44.020]   Bromides?
[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:45.020]   Bromides.
[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:46.020]   What's that?
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.020]   These a fory?
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:48.020]   I'm going to be a bromide after the second.
[00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:49.020]   Yeah, they're like aphorism.
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:54.940]   A bromide is, uh, is a kind of a, it kind of implies kind of an old chestnut, you know,
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:57.660]   than has been said many times.
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:01.100]   But are they saying it's bromides such as look at us, we know the word bromide or are
[00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:05.780]   they saying these are bromides that we have all heard before your father, Leah was not
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:06.780]   particularly original?
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:09.140]   No, I think, in fact, that's not what they're saying.
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.340]   I think let me let me scroll back and see.
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:15.380]   As if they're just showing off that they know the word bromide, I don't have to take
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:16.380]   issue with that.
[00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:17.940]   It's, it's, it's Veremia.
[00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:22.540]   He says Leo, are you sure your father wasn't himself a rummy hobo when he told you these
[00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:24.540]   bromides means a rum.
[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:25.540]   A robo.
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:31.780]   I'd be curious to know what other strategies, uh, your dad's father was terrified of
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:32.780]   the rummy.
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:37.060]   He was terrified that there were, Leah, were there rummies and hobo's in your name?
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:38.060]   There must have been.
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:40.020]   I don't think so.
[00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:43.260]   I think your dad had a complex.
[00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:47.220]   I grew up in Providence, Rhode Island, which is not known for rummies or hobo's.
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:49.660]   There were quite a few mafia dawns, maybe.
[00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:51.980]   Quite a few stuffies.
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:52.980]   Stuffies?
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:53.980]   What's that?
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:55.780]   What you have stuffed clams in Rhode Island.
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:56.780]   Stuffies.
[00:40:56.780 --> 00:41:00.420]   We probably have another word for them because another thing about Rhode Island is that they
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:03.980]   have a different word for everything than, than the rest of New England.
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:07.860]   For instance, you know, you might call it a milkshake in Brooklyn.
[00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:09.340]   I'm not a cabinet.
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:10.420]   It's a cabinet in Rhode Island.
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.420]   How did you know that?
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:12.420]   You're absolutely right.
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:13.420]   I know things.
[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:16.020]   You're very smart.
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:17.020]   You could call him a clam.
[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:18.020]   We call him a quahog.
[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:21.020]   What a terrible word.
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:27.260]   No wonder we in Massachusetts conquered you people.
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:28.260]   Did you?
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:32.980]   Was there a hundred year war between Massachusetts and Rhode Island and which Rhode Island lost?
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:37.140]   Rhode Island was formed, of course, by Roger Williams, who was chased off by the Puritans
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:41.620]   for daring to want to treat Indians similarly.
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:42.620]   He was hit.
[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:45.180]   And compensate them for the land that was taken from them.
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:49.820]   I have to say we do when I was growing up in Rhode Island in school, they make a point
[00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:53.940]   of saying we're here because Massachusetts was intolerant.
[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:56.300]   That's true.
[00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.780]   Intolerant of Rhode Islanders.
[00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:01.380]   And we remain so.
[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:03.580]   So did you put the --
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:05.220]   So you walk up now, would you --
[00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:08.620]   I need microscopic state.
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.860]   It's small, but good.
[00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:16.420]   When you walk up -- so you're Connecticut, Jonathan, and John, you're Massachusetts.
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:17.580]   That's right.
[00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:18.580]   And I'm Rhode Island.
[00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:21.220]   So I don't believe Connecticut and Massachusetts is happening.
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:22.220]   You're winning.
[00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:23.220]   What do you mean winning?
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:24.980]   For the most letters in the name, what?
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:27.020]   No, in the New England Derby.
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:29.100]   Most Northward state?
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:30.100]   Most.
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:31.100]   Best.
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:32.100]   Best.
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:33.100]   Most S's.
[00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:34.100]   M-A-W-S-A-C-H-U-S-E-W-T-S.
[00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:36.940]   Oh, come on, guys.
[00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:42.740]   Look, first of all, we all know Rhode Island is not going to win the New England Derby.
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:43.740]   What?
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:46.260]   It's a mascot.
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:47.780]   Sidekick.
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:48.780]   It's a mascot state.
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:49.780]   It's a sidekick.
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:50.780]   Exactly.
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:51.780]   It's number two.
[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:56.420]   It's Rhode Island, the state that actually has a super long name that is never used.
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:57.420]   Yes.
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:58.420]   Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:00.420]   That's what the --
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:01.420]   That's what the --
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:04.780]   The official name is the state -- I'm not sure the -- I'll have to Wikipedia it, but
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:07.140]   I know Providence Plantations is in there.
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:08.140]   I think it's something like --
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:09.140]   It's a coffee milk growing up.
[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:10.740]   A lot of coffee milk.
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:11.740]   Yeah.
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:14.980]   How'd you know about that?
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:16.820]   Do you must have come over the border?
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.460]   You must have once in a while snuck over the border.
[00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:20.460]   I was a spy.
[00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:25.540]   A spy for the Massachusetts anti- Rhode Island militia.
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:30.020]   I posed for many years as a Rhode Islander.
[00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:32.020]   And I came in.
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:34.740]   By slightly adjusting my cap to the left.
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:36.300]   I looked like a Rhode Islander.
[00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.380]   No beard involved or bacon scarf.
[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:39.380]   I lived among you.
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:41.740]   No beard, no bacon scarf.
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:46.420]   Just a nice coffee milk made with autocrat coffee syrup.
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:47.660]   Wow!
[00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:52.820]   The only coffee syrup named for a dictatorial position.
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:55.820]   Oh, but I used to --
[00:43:55.820 --> 00:44:02.380]   I always preferred dictator or benign despot coffee syrup.
[00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:06.140]   But autocrat is the one that has become most popular.
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:08.180]   We used to drink hegemony soda as well.
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:09.180]   That was always --
[00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:10.180]   A gemany soda.
[00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.180]   Yeah.
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:13.080]   Very fine, Bruce.
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:17.240]   Let me mention, since we are in the middle of a show -- and one of these days you guys
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:22.480]   are going to tell me what you did at the book signings -- while you think about that
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.500]   and come up with that, I do want to mention our fine sponsors Audible.com.
[00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:28.920]   Do either of you listen to audiobooks at any time?
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:29.920]   Yes.
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:30.920]   Constantly.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:31.920]   Really?
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:32.920]   You don't have to say that.
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.960]   I'm like, "I'm like, all the audible audiobooks."
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:36.960]   Audible.
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.880]   Or released my first audiobook.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:41.880]   We know that.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:42.880]   Yes, that's right.
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:46.880]   And Jonathan, you listen to Heinlein?
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:49.040]   No, I said, "I'm lying."
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.040]   I don't have to go out here.
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.560]   I was trying to give you a second chance to --
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:53.560]   Thank you.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:54.800]   No, I don't listen to your show.
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:58.680]   I have decided that I would like to become an Audible subscriber.
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:44:59.680]   There you go.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.680]   That's perfect.
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:01.680]   Because it's true.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:02.680]   Audible?
[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:04.280]   You guys have sold me on this.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:05.280]   Good.
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.880]   It's on my to-do list and has been now for several months.
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.240]   Get off, you should -- look, go to audible.com.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.480]   Okay, I'm going to give you two different ways to do this.
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:14.880]   Actually, I'm going to give you a really good deal.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:15.880]   How is it done?
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:16.880]   How is it done?
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:17.880]   Let me explain.
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:18.880]   That's my question.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:19.880]   Okay, we have various deals.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.480]   For the holidays, what we're going to do is send you to audible.com.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:28.160]   You have your choice, but you could go to audible.com/twit749.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.880]   And there's a reason for those three digits.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:32.120]   749.
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:36.840]   When you sign up, you're going to get your first three months books half off for $7.49.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:39.000]   Oh, I see.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.400]   I thought it was some weird numerology thing.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.400]   Well, there's a reason for that number.
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:44.400]   749.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.400]   This is a master book.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:46.400]   Yes.
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:47.400]   Go on.
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.400]   I don't know.
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:49.400]   No, it's true.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.400]   Yes, okay, very good.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.400]   749.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:55.040]   They don't -- you may sound like a price, but there's a reason for the price, you understand.
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:56.040]   Right.
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.040]   I'm not sure it is.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.120]   It is part of the mystic order of audible.
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:04.080]   Many people don't know, but audible was founded by masons.
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:10.680]   So audible.com/twit749, you get your first three books three months half off.
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:15.120]   Now -- but for you, Jonathan -- I mean, John, I think -- well, Jonathan too, because he's
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:16.120]   never listened.
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:18.280]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:19.280]   And he's a musician.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:23.400]   We have another -- a holiday thank you from Audible that's absolutely free.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:24.440]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.480]   You don't need to be a member.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:31.480]   There was a series -- you might know about this series, Jonathan, as a musician called
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:33.160]   33 and a third.
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:40.560]   They were -- it was a book per album, you know, talking about in great detail about some of
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:44.480]   the great albums of all time.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:49.000]   And it's really -- if you're interested -- well, the one we're going to give away, one of the
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.320]   greatest albums of all time, Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisited.
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:57.440]   I'm sure, Jonathan, you, given your songwriting style and abilities, must have spent some time
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.440]   listening to Dylan.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:59.440]   Who's Bob Dylan's purpose?
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:04.720]   You neither of you like Bob Dylan.
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:08.160]   You know, I don't want to start a whole thing here.
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.360]   I know that I should like Bob Dylan.
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:13.160]   He's never -- he's never really excited me that much.
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:14.160]   Really?
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:16.720]   Now I'm going to be in trouble with a lot of people I know.
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:18.800]   I know girls don't like Bob Dylan.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.360]   Well, maybe that's why.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.200]   You have a beard and everything.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:25.520]   Could be fake.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:28.160]   We've established that it's pretty easy to fool someone with a fake beard.
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:34.760]   This is what Harold Bloom, the literary critic Harold Bloom, would call the anxiety of influence.
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:37.760]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:40.040]   The Yale literary critic Harold Bloom.
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:43.680]   Jonathan wouldn't know that because he was too busy smoking dope in college.
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:46.480]   What was your major in college, Jonathan?
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.040]   I was a music major.
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:49.040]   Oh, good.
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:51.040]   And my minder doped my whole head.
[00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:52.040]   You know what that means, don't you?
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.040]   A lot of those.
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:56.040]   Rummy windings, we call it.
[00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:57.040]   Rummy windings.
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:00.960]   He was breathing the old rummy wind.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:03.920]   And you, Mr. Hodgman, what was your major?
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:04.920]   Artini drinking.
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:08.680]   There's the dichotomy right there.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:13.160]   So the left hand of the aisle is your marijuana users on the right hand of your aisle.
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:14.160]   It's all gin.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:17.800]   Just a bunch of dick cavities as we like to follow.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:22.560]   No, I think it's an awful lot of overlap among our fans.
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:23.560]   Probably.
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:25.080]   And they'll get along just fine.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.520]   They'll like each other very much.
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:27.520]   You know, what's going to mean?
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:32.680]   Whether they're high on marijuana or drunk on martinis really guarantee you do enjoy
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:33.880]   our show makes little difference.
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:36.680]   By the way, Harold Bloom's how to read and why he is on Audible.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:40.680]   That might be a good one for you, John or Jonathan as you're trying to catch up with
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:41.680]   John.
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:42.680]   Yeah, you might want to check that out.
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:43.680]   Maybe I'll start there.
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:44.680]   Yeah.
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:45.680]   Harold.
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:46.680]   Right around.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.680]   Highway 61.
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:53.240]   I think you should listen to this one of the great records of all time.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:55.240]   These books kind of go into it in great detail.
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.200]   Listen here.
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:01.000]   We tried out various locations and stopped at a clothes store and bought outfits for
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.040]   Bob, but the ones he wears on the cover of his own.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:07.480]   So they're talking about the famous cover shooting him in the picture to give it a song
[00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.480]   by song that is second.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.480]   This is yours free.
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:11.000]   You know, it's a good way to try Audible.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.920]   It's four hours and 26 minutes.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:16.800]   If you like that, they have Neil Young's harvest, the kinks, uh, village green preservation
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.000]   society.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.240]   I know, I know, I know, I got one for you.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:22.000]   I bet you're a Nick Drake fan.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.320]   Aren't you Jonathan?
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:25.320]   He's all right.
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:26.320]   God, God.
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.320]   God.
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:28.320]   God.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:31.920]   No, I'm a huge, huge Nick Drake fan.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:33.920]   Yeah, I don't care.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:34.920]   You've lost me.
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:35.920]   I'd be honest with you.
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.400]   Let me ask you, Leo, did Billy Joel ever write a book?
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:40.200]   No, don't say it.
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:44.120]   No, there's no way he's ever written a book.
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:45.120]   I guarantee it.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:46.120]   Billy Joel.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:49.960]   So these books are written by experts on the albums, not by Dylan, for instance, or Neil
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:50.960]   Young.
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.800]   It's the 33 and a third series.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:57.040]   We're going to give you one free and I mean, and this is actually a great listen.
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:00.880]   Highly recommended if you're a fan of Dylan, if you're not, forget it.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:01.880]   Get it free.
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:02.880]   Now, wait a minute.
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:05.880]   Now, for that one, you have to go to audible.com/twit33.
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:08.400]   The number is different.
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:12.440]   That's, that's where they make it easy for you.
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:15.080]   I really like this one on Paul's boutique.
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.080]   Beastie Boys Paul's boutique.
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.080]   That looks good.
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.080]   There you go.
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:19.080]   You like Beastie Boys.
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:20.280]   I'm forgetting you guys are younger than me.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:21.280]   You're youth.
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.280]   You're youth.
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:23.280]   You're the youth.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.280]   We're nearly 37 years old.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:26.280]   You're the youth.
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:27.280]   The youth today.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.280]   The youth of today.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.280]   Come on old man.
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:30.280]   Get out.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:33.280]   Paul's boutique from 1991, man.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:36.840]   That's when it was happening.
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:37.840]   1991.
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.880]   Do they really have that Paul's boutique?
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:41.120]   33 and 33?
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:42.120]   That's awesome.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.120]   Okay.
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.120]   So there you go.
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.120]   So there's a huge variety.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.120]   These are, this is a really great series.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.960]   The one that's free though is the Dylan.
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:51.560]   We've, we kind of maybe overshot our audience on this one, but we'll give it a try.
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:54.080]   Bob Dylan's Highway 61 revisited.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:56.640]   All you do is you go to audible.com/twit33.
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:59.480]   So now if this is not too confusing, there are two links.
[00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:02.480]   If you want to sign up for Audible and I do encourage that, you can get your first three
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:08.000]   books for the first three months of books at half price by going to audible.com/twit749.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:14.200]   If you want the 33 and a third series, Bob Dylan's Highway 61 revisited free, no signup
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.200]   required.
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:17.840]   I think, now I have to say this is US for sure.
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.840]   It may not be available in other countries.
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:23.480]   That is not Audible's fault that has to do with the publishers and the deals they have
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.480]   in each nation.
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:32.000]   As John Hodgman well knows, every country has it as a whole different system for publisher.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   That's true.
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   And only one of them includes me.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.520]   But listen, are you published in but one nation?
[00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:42.080]   In but one nation, the United States of America, including Rhode Island.
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.080]   Well, that's nice.
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:45.440]   We just got into Rhode Island last night.
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.960]   That's very generous of you.
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:47.960]   Congratulations.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:51.520]   My real question is when you're going to have this new one, more information than you require
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:52.720]   on Audible.
[00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:59.000]   As soon as Colton and I can get in together into a studio and record it.
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   So that's nice.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   That's real loyalty.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.840]   You won't do it without them.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:09.280]   No, and believe me, I've been asked specifically to do that.
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:14.680]   But we had a very special guest on the last audiobook, Paul Rudd.
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.680]   I love him.
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:16.680]   Very funny guy.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:17.680]   The cameo on the last audiobook.
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:20.880]   And I saw I ran into him and he's...
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:22.800]   I hope that he'll do another cameo.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.720]   I'd love to get a cameo from Bruce Campbell.
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:26.720]   We'll see.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:27.720]   I'll have to email him.
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:29.920]   He's in the habit of saying no to me.
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:30.920]   So I met him.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:32.720]   That's because you used to be his agent.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:33.720]   Yes.
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:34.720]   I don't have to do what you're saying.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:36.160]   He has no respect.
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:41.120]   But while the folks are waiting for that, may I make an Audible recommendation?
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.120]   Please do, Mr. Hodge.
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:43.320]   I am quite thrilled.
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:46.360]   I consider this frankly a holiday miracle.
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:52.760]   I'm quite thrilled that Audible offers a book called Don't Point That Thing at Me.
[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:57.560]   Not as hilarious as it sounds.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:03.000]   It's actually an extremely funny British mystery from the 70s.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.960]   It is one of my absolute favorite books.
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:08.680]   Jonathan David Guillen recommended it to me at first.
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:10.200]   It sounds like a young recommendation.
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:12.760]   And it is not easy to find.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:15.360]   But it is really, really wonderful and...
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:17.000]   It's a Charlie Mordecai mystery, right?
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.560]   It is a Charlie Mordecai mystery.
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:19.560]   Do you know the book?
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:20.560]   Not at all.
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:21.560]   No, okay.
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:22.560]   Are you looking online?
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:24.560]   Written by Kirill Bonfioli.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:25.560]   Yes.
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:26.560]   Very nicely pronounced.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:28.560]   And narrated by Simon Pribbly-blibbly-blibbly.
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:32.960]   Let's listen to a little bit of the Don't Point That Thing at Me.
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:33.960]   Let me explain.
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:39.840]   This is the story of a dissolute art dealer who accidentally becomes a detective.
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:42.160]   He's an art dealer in art thief.
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:47.480]   And he has got a sort of gigantic, Jeeves-like butler named Jockstrap.
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:51.480]   They get involved in scrapes.
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:53.280]   I bet they do.
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.920]   And if you like this, you'll love the sequel.
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:57.280]   It isn't it nice out.
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:58.960]   Now why don't you put it away?
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:03.880]   So this is Don't Point That Thing at Me, a Charlie Mordecai mystery.
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:08.480]   Here's a little bit of Simon Pribbly.
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:11.120]   Listen, Martin, I said evenly.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:15.720]   If I had lifted that goyer or fenced it, you can't really think that I'd bring it here
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:17.720]   in its frame for God's sake.
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:19.560]   And then burn the frame of my own head.
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:20.560]   No!
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:21.560]   No, you're not a darling!
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:22.560]   I'm not a darling.
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:23.560]   I'm not a darling.
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:24.560]   I'm not a darling.
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:25.560]   I'm not a darling.
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:26.560]   I'm not a darling.
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:27.560]   I'm not a darling.
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:28.560]   I'm a darling.
[00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:29.560]   I think we can all agree.
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:30.560]   Virtuoso!
[00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:31.560]   Oh yeah, he's proud.
[00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:32.560]   I love his stuff.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:36.920]   Yes, but I don't think that that quite gets you the flavor of the book.
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:40.640]   This is about a crazed drunken jerk.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:41.640]   I love it.
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:44.680]   Who's the most wonderful character in the world.
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:46.960]   And it's very saucy, I dare say.
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:50.040]   So if you're under 13, have your father read it to you.
[00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:52.880]   They also have something nasty in the woodshed, which is another.
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:54.080]   That is the sequel.
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:55.080]   Yes.
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:58.200]   So I'm going to add both of those to my cart because I just happen as an audible platinum
[00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:00.600]   subscriber to have two, yes, two books.
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:02.600]   I'm getting on a long plane flight on Tuesday.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.000]   This is going to be fantastic.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.840]   Well, I hope you enjoy it.
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:08.640]   I'm putting it in my cart right now based on your recommendation.
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:09.640]   Thank you.
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:12.360]   The only person I ever knew, this is a holiday miracle.
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:15.720]   The only person I ever knew who liked this book as much as I do besides the guy who told
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:22.000]   me about it, is a crazy and wonderful eccentric cook named Kenny Shotsen.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.560]   And indeed, the bacon scarf comes from his store and restaurant.
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:26.560]   I knew it!
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:27.640]   I knew I knew that name.
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:29.240]   It's right on the cover there, yeah.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:35.640]   And so this scarf is designed by his incredibly talented daughter Mara Shotsen.
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:37.720]   And they were on this, do you know the store?
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:38.720]   Shotsen's general store?
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:39.720]   Have you been there before?
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:40.720]   Where is it?
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:41.720]   No, I haven't been there.
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:44.440]   Well, it was for a long time in the West Village and now it's in the Essex Street Market
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.080]   in New York City.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:51.400]   And it's an extremely eccentric family restaurant run by an extremely eccentric family led by
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:58.160]   the gigantic, sweetums-like, sort of, id-powered cook named Kenny Shotsen, who's got a very
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.600]   foul mouth and a very sweet nature.
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:04.040]   And he has five children, many of whom still work with him every day in the store.
[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:08.520]   And he just put out the most remarkable book that unfortunately is not unaudible because
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:11.120]   it is primarily a cookbook and I don't think that would work.
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:12.760]   They have some cookbooks on there, but you're right.
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:13.760]   It's not a good idea.
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:14.760]   Well, they should put this one on.
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:19.800]   And this book is called Eat Me, the Food and Philosophy of Kenny Shotsen.
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:23.240]   And that is going to be my big holiday gift this year.
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.240]   Eat me.
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:25.240]   Eat me.
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:32.520]   So if you want a bacon scarf or you want some philosophy about cooking crazy foods in a
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:38.920]   very small kitchen while yelling at people, Shotsen is the one-stop shop for you.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:42.680]   You can go online, I think, shopsins.com, I think.
[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:43.680]   Check.
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:44.680]   That's fantastic.
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:47.480]   We'll send them a bill for the advertisement if you don't mind.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:48.480]   That's it.
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:49.480]   That's okay.
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:50.480]   They're already paying me.
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:51.480]   Oh, good.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:54.240]   As long as someone's getting something, I don't care.
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:56.080]   A lot of mine.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:00.440]   I didn't even know we were supposed to bring our sponsors tonight.
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:01.920]   I didn't bring them.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.640]   It's worth it for the bacon scarf.
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:05.480]   I'm sorry, but I didn't mean to be fruit, but I was just, you know, all these things
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:06.480]   suddenly clicked.
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:07.640]   I'm like, oh, no, no, no.
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:08.640]   That's wonderful.
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:11.440]   Don't point that thing at me in the bacon scarf and my favorite books here.
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:12.440]   It all goes together.
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:15.840]   Does his daughter do other bacon accoutrement or is it?
[00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:18.000]   No, the scarf is the only bacon item there.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   She has a lot of other very cool items that you can see.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.280]   The nice thing about the bacon scarf, and I will say this, is that it's just a nice
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:26.280]   festive scarf.
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:30.360]   It doesn't necessarily say bacon, you know, loudly.
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:31.360]   Yes.
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:35.640]   You have to really, you have to sort of show, you have to unwrap it from your neck and show
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:36.640]   it off.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:38.640]   And then it looks like a giant piece of paper.
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:39.640]   Yeah.
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:41.400]   A particularly large, just nice red and white scarf.
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:42.400]   Right.
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:45.840]   Or I think if you push the button, it will say bacon loudly.
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:49.040]   Oh, I didn't put the batteries in.
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:50.040]   That's why.
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:52.040]   You're going to put the batteries in and I'll put the button.
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:53.040]   Okay.
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.040]   Okay.
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:55.040]   I can.
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:56.040]   Where does it just go?
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.040]   Every once in a while.
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:58.140]   That'll be sufficient.
[00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:06.420]   So on the left, people using marijuana, dressed as zombies with strangely mutilated monkeys.
[00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:13.440]   On the right, people in fine brown suits with brown shoes and brilliant, teen hair, holding
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:14.440]   martinis.
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:17.160]   A cast of mad men.
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:19.000]   And up, did you come up the middle aisle?
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   Do you go around the side?
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.560]   How do you, how does this work exactly?
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:24.360]   We generally come from backstage.
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:25.760]   Oh, yes.
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:32.320]   Or, or, you know, next to next to the Sudoku books, if we're in a book story, we'll be
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:36.120]   hiding behind the Sudoku books typically and then we'll jump out.
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:40.520]   You know, I got a Sudoku book at book passage that the first three were half filled out.
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:43.160]   And I think it was you.
[00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:44.560]   The passage and courty Madera.
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:45.560]   Yes.
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:46.560]   Yeah.
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:47.560]   Well, we did a show there.
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:48.560]   I know you did.
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:53.360]   And for that one, for example, we came out and we Jonathan sang my theme song.
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:55.160]   What is your theme song?
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:57.960]   It's, it's the John Hodgman theme song.
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:58:59.560]   I don't think he has a title beyond that.
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:01.160]   No, I guess it doesn't have a title.
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:02.560]   Do you have a guitar there, John?
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:07.040]   Jonathan, you could play it for us.
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:10.360]   I don't know if it comes through the Skype headset exactly.
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:11.360]   A good question.
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:13.360]   I don't know if I have the tech to make that happen.
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:14.360]   We'll see.
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:18.360]   Didn't, didn't, uh, Hodgman tell you that, that you would have to play his theme song?
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:19.360]   Was that?
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:22.360]   I assume, I always assume that I have to play the theme.
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:25.360]   My holiday present to Jonathan was that he didn't have to play my theme song.
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:26.960]   Well, Hummit, then.
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:27.960]   How does it go?
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:28.960]   Is, are there lyrics?
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:29.960]   Here he comes.
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:30.960]   There are lyrics.
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:35.920]   It's basically, it's about, it's about how, uh, it's about how John is, is, is saving
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:37.560]   the world with his books, essentially.
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:38.560]   Oh, wow.
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:41.320]   That's, you know, it's, these are, these are very important books.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:44.360]   It's written by a very important man who has very important things to say.
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:45.720]   That's essentially the gist of it.
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:47.000]   Do we have it on?
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:51.520]   I mean, it's an, it's an adaptation of the areas of my expertise thing song too.
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:55.080]   So if we have that, if you have that on audio book, candy, you can probably hear it.
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:56.800]   Oh, oh, I do have that.
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:57.800]   I don't know.
[00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:58.800]   Let me see.
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:02.080]   Because of course I, I did purchase your book areas of my expertise.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.560]   Well, maybe, maybe it's not a book.
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:05.600]   Is it at the very beginning of areas of my expertise?
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:06.600]   It is.
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.680]   I think it, I think it opens with it.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:09.680]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.680]   I've deleted it.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:12.680]   Oh, that's embarrassing.
[01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.440]   Oh, we threw it right back on you.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.440]   Another holiday miracle.
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.040]   You caught us up short.
[01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:22.240]   What play of music song?
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:23.240]   What?
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.960]   I don't, I don't know how can we do such a thing?
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:25.960]   We don't have the tech.
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:26.960]   There you go.
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:27.960]   Why don't you do this?
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:28.960]   Oh, I can't find it.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:29.960]   It's like an Oh Henry story.
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:30.960]   It is.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:31.960]   It's perfect.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:32.960]   And by the way, I.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:38.560]   I do have some Colton Christmas music and one of which does in fact make a veiled reference
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.680]   to an Oh Henry story.
[01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:42.160]   And you name that song.
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.320]   I'm sure Jonathan can.
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.320]   I certainly can.
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:48.000]   Christmas is interesting by Jonathan Colton.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   Is there a right?
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.960]   Is there a Christmas interesting song?
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:51.960]   That's right.
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:52.960]   That's what it's called.
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:53.960]   Christmas is interesting.
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:54.960]   Yeah.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:55.960]   I do.
[01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.040]   I, I, I, yeah.
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.400]   I alluded to it in a vague sort of crazy way.
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:00.400]   I like it.
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.400]   Look, here we go.
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.840]   It's on, it's on YouTube.
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:05.920]   Jonathan singing the Hodgman theme song at book passage.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:06.920]   Oh my God.
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:07.920]   Oh my God.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:08.920]   Let's find it.
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.920]   I do have access to YouTube here.
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:12.480]   Can you hear it if I play it?
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.480]   I don't know how this is.
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.480]   No, don't you play it.
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.480]   That would be very bad.
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.480]   Thank you.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.480]   I think your iPhone now that way.
[01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.480]   Yes.
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:21.400]   I think you think is in progress by the way, just so you know.
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:23.440]   All of my calendars are updating.
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.040]   I wait to see.
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.040]   I heard adjustments to my contacts.
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:31.040]   It's the last time I synced five minutes ago.
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.200]   Directed some zip codes.
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:35.320]   You have a lot of songs on YouTube.
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:37.320]   You have 10 pages of songs.
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:38.320]   I do, yeah.
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.320]   On YouTube.
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.840]   Well, a lot of people take video at shows.
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.440]   And you don't mind if people do that?
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.440]   No, you kidding me?
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.440]   I love it.
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:49.480]   When is that DVD coming out that I'm on?
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:52.640]   That DVD, I'm glad you asked.
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.040]   That DVD is going to come out in February.
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.480]   Can't wait.
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.480]   I know.
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:58.480]   I'm very excited about it.
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.480]   It turned out great.
[01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:03.800]   The show itself was a really good one.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.240]   There's a lot of great footage from fans who brought their cameras.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:11.960]   And of course, there's you and Merlin and Veronica playing rock band with me.
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.360]   It's a very cool thing.
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:14.360]   I'm glad it exists.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.720]   Hey, guys, is anybody going to play my theme song?
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:18.720]   Oh, my man.
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:23.120]   I thought we were going to play my theme song and all of you talking about blah, blah,
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:24.360]   blah, dvd stuff.
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.360]   I don't understand.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:40.520]   It's short.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.080]   It's a very short song.
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.680]   It's just there were technical problems.
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:45.080]   Oh, that's right.
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.080]   It's like three bars.
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.480]   I'm glad this is on YouTube.
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:48.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:49.880]   I think we're just going to have to live with it.
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:55.200]   So we can live through a actual book reading.
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.200]   All right.
[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.200]   All right.
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:01.680]   Heaven's name is somebody upload that to YouTube.
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.680]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:04.680]   Yes, John?
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:08.880]   There's a material from this particular appearance.
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.320]   I see here they have me beatboxing.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:15.320]   Someone asked me to beatbox after they heard me on Twitter beatboxing last time.
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:17.480]   You're now famous for your beatboxing.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:18.480]   Boy.
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:21.920]   And then I played that by the way several times again.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.160]   I mean, I've I've I've yeah, I feel that that is.
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:28.440]   Now kind of a part of Twitter history.
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:32.560]   So right there in court in Madeira, that was a good example of a bookstore appearance.
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:37.000]   People who are looking at it now, they could see me at a podium wearing a tuxedo naturally
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.440]   because I'm not a monster.
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:45.000]   And then you see Jonathan wearing dungarees as beard and everything.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.440]   Some kind of hair shirt or something.
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:49.640]   I can't really tell and playing his little strumstick there.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:53.080]   And he's off to my off to my right without a without a podium.
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:54.920]   Because he he has nothing.
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:56.960]   He keeps it all on his head.
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:00.800]   And then he sings a theme song and I announce the book and then he stands there awkwardly
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:03.080]   while I read portions of the book.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:07.080]   And then occasionally, you know, I will accuse him of being a feral mountain man and he will
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:09.080]   deny it.
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:14.720]   And then and then we come to that I had a piece in the in the new book about how I had
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:19.080]   I had become a famous minor television personality accidentally and we had talked about that
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.080]   on the Twit last time.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.400]   Yes, yes, yes.
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:26.920]   And and how I how I had ended up making a cameo appearance in an upcoming episode of
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:28.920]   Battlestar Galactica.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:32.200]   And then Jonathan sang his own version of the Battlestar Galactica theme song and then
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:36.720]   we take some questions and answers and then Jonathan sings some songs and and then we
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:37.720]   go out to dinner.
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:42.720]   We put on our bacon scarves and collected by the way that chapter how to be famous was
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:43.720]   a revelation.
[01:04:43.720 --> 01:04:46.240]   Yeah, was a revelation to me.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:47.240]   Was it why?
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.480]   Well, I'm I'm ready to go.
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:52.480]   Please.
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:55.200]   I feel it's almost an instruction book.
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:59.160]   I think I think I've learned more from you than you from me.
[01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:03.120]   I particularly enjoyed the line that was my introduction to Los Angeles, a traumatic homosexual
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:06.000]   silent comedy date rape.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.760]   That line really should be put in context.
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:15.000]   I think that it would make a lot more sense.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:21.960]   Some inflammatory people understood that hurt to a time when I was visiting Universal Studios
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:26.840]   tour as a 12 year old child with long hair and was approached by a man dressed up as
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:31.400]   Charlie Chaplin who thought I was a girl and thus wanted me to kiss him on the cheek.
[01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:32.400]   And I did.
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:35.240]   All I can say is Rummy's have no wind.
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:37.240]   Rummy's have no wind.
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:51.520]   You know what I really like about this is the humility with which John Hodgman stands
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:54.000]   and listens to the song that his his theme.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.360]   I mean, you just I wasn't I wasn't listening.
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:57.360]   Oh, okay.
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:59.600]   You were thinking about other things.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:02.760]   I'm thinking about where we're going to have dinner that.
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:06.160]   I mean, you're just you're standing there just taking it all.
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.760]   You're not even looking at Jonathan.
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:11.680]   No, he doesn't like to.
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:17.280]   He doesn't like even looking at you.
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.840]   Good evening.
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:25.600]   My name is John Hodgman.
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:32.120]   As you heard in my theme song, some years ago I wrote a book entitled The Areas of My
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:36.000]   Expertise, a Compendium of Complete World Knowledge.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.400]   Well, this is on YouTube.
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:42.760]   So I'll leave it to to our intrepid listeners to figure out how to find that clip and listen
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:43.760]   to the people.
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:47.920]   Yeah, people do ask quite a bit about the audio book and the reality is that Jonathan
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:52.760]   and I I very much wanted to go out and tour the book around and perform it a little bit
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:56.920]   so that I could hear how the book sounded and also so that we could get recordings of
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:00.920]   some of the material so we could perhaps do some, you know, include some live material
[01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:01.920]   in the audience.
[01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:02.920]   Great.
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:05.280]   And maybe you'd record a voice in it.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.280]   Anything you'd like.
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.280]   Anything you'd like.
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.960]   I could be the announcer.
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:11.840]   I could be a red shirt number two, whatever you want.
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:12.840]   I'll be in it.
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:13.840]   Maybe you should do the whole thing.
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:14.840]   Maybe that would make it a lot easier for us.
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:15.840]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.200]   That would make it a lot easier.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.160]   Do you get along with Paul Rudd?
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.160]   Okay.
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:21.800]   Never met the man, but I'm sure I would.
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.000]   I think it'll work, Jonathan.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   I think we got a deal.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   So great.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   We can go on a patient.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   Fantastic.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   Thank you for reaching.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   I would love to actually.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.120]   You will have to do the 700 mole man names by yourself.
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.040]   That could be a problem.
[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.600]   Just bring a wrickele.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.920]   That's all I have to say.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:46.400]   You did a, I have to say that the areas of my expertise is much better.
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:49.000]   Listen to than read because you do such a good job of delivering it.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.440]   I just don't think that I could, I could do that.
[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:56.800]   Well, you know, that's very convenient because under a special arrangement with the publisher,
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:59.920]   if you buy my book, you are no longer obligated to read it.
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:00.920]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:01.920]   So that's good.
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:05.200]   So that way, that's that way you can, you can get out of the whole thing.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.720]   Buy, buy the, buy the copy of the book and then buy the audio book and then you don't
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:10.280]   have to read the one that is on it.
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:11.520]   Would you like to just before we go?
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:14.200]   Because we're going to wrap this up and I do want to thank you so much for making my
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.200]   holiday extra special.
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:19.240]   I would consider this your gift to us, Leo.
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:20.240]   Oh, thank you.
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:22.920]   But would you like to read a little portion of the book?
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:27.640]   Is there one that you, a little, a little snippet to give people some idea of how wonderful
[01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:31.080]   this book, more information than you require is?
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.800]   Yes.
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:33.800]   Thank you.
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:35.280]   Speaking of Christmas.
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:36.280]   Yes.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:41.960]   While I am personally not a religious man, I am nonetheless induced by the trappings of
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:42.960]   the season.
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:47.160]   Even as, even as I write this, I am enjoying my famous eggnog, secret ingredient, alcoholic
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:48.160]   eggs.
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:52.000]   And I've lit a merry little yule log here at my feet where I'm roasting chestnuts to
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:56.120]   give the inevitable carolores, then Persian, Magi and crippled English children who come
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.840]   to my door this time of year.
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:03.640]   I've decked my study with bows of holly and of course, poinsettia, or some say poinsettia,
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:07.880]   though actually it was pronounced ponsia.
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:09.440]   Did you know that it is a Mexican plant?
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:10.440]   It is.
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:13.600]   Named for the renowned ambassador to Mexico, James, poinsettia was brought to our country
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:19.200]   in 1828 and quickly became favored over its predecessor, the Christodendron, which was
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:24.080]   a very similar plant to the ponsia, the subject to spontaneous stigmata and thus considered
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.240]   overly dramatic for the holiday table.
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:31.960]   Did you know Leo that much of our nation's early Christmas was sombre and austere occasion?
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:35.920]   Both Oliver Cromwell in England and Governor William Bradford in the Plymouth colony forbade
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:41.920]   any observance or revelry other than a literal mass for Christ, hence the name Christ mass?
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.880]   And so for many decades, the sole Christmas decoration in most American homes was a child
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:51.920]   made to stand silently in the corner to contemplate damnation while holding a burning log.
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.920]   That is all.
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:56.440]   That's a little segment.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:57.440]   Beautiful.
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.440]   That's really touching.
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:09:59.440]   Yes.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:03.920]   And Mr. Colton, I know you're not actually technically able to perform in any way your
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:06.600]   label prohibits it.
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:07.600]   That's right.
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:08.600]   Yeah.
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:10.640]   But I'm sure he would beatbox for you, Leo.
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:14.080]   Is this where you gained your beatboxing chops, Mr. O'odham?
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.480]   I don't have an answer.
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:18.360]   I have got no beatbox in me.
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:19.360]   What?
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:21.960]   I have very little funk in my body or my brain.
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:27.560]   Actually, beatbox chops is actually the name of his style of beard.
[01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:28.640]   Fox chops.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:29.640]   That's right.
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:32.160]   For 1880s, I believe, right?
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.160]   Yes, exactly.
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.160]   So, yeah.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:36.160]   You know what?
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:40.320]   I do, if you don't mind, I do have something I can plug aside from the DVD.
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.320]   Please.
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:42.320]   Because I know that's what you were fishing for.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.240]   You were like, please, please, will you plug something?
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.600]   Well, it is that time of year.
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:50.520]   You know, when we sit back, a lot of people think that Christmas is about, you know, presence
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:52.040]   and tinsel and Christmas trees.
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:55.640]   And I think we all know that it's really about something deeper, something bigger, something
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:56.640]   more important.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.640]   It's about products.
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:10:59.640]   Yeah.
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:00.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:03.600]   And speaking of gifts, what a lovely gift this would make.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:04.600]   Just imagine.
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:09.040]   There's a CD out now called Joko Looks Back, which is my greatest hits.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.040]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.040]   Isn't that a little premature, Jonathan?
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:14.280]   Well, you know, it is.
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:15.280]   It felt wrong.
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:19.320]   I've only been a professional musician for three years.
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:21.160]   You got to retire first.
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.400]   But I know, I know.
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:27.760]   But you know, the problem is that when I sell CDs, it shows you either have Smoking
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:30.480]   Monkey, which is the CD that's several years old.
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:33.120]   That features the fine Christmas is interesting.
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.120]   Exactly.
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:39.680]   Or you have this thing a week box set, which is four CDs and 52 songs.
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:42.240]   And that's a little much for somebody who's just starting out.
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:46.040]   And Jonathan, you're forgetting the extended play CD.
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.040]   With the 700...
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.560]   Oh, Bob, Bob, Bob, names.
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:49.960]   Yeah, that's actually not an...
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:50.960]   That's not in print anymore.
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:52.960]   You're talking about where tradition meets tomorrow.
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:55.480]   Where tradition meets tomorrow is not in print anymore?
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.480]   That's not in print.
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.920]   What did you burn or break?
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:58.920]   What?
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:11:59.920]   Not in print?
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:03.760]   Well, you know, it's a five song, it's a five song CD.
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.400]   You could burn a copy for somebody.
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:06.400]   They could...
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:07.400]   You know what?
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.600]   You should do what I did.
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:13.960]   If you go to Jonathan's site, Jonathan Colton, C-O-U-L-T-O-N.com, Jonathan is not spelled
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:17.680]   with any odd letters, you can download...
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:18.760]   It's still $70, right?
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.160]   The entire herb.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:21.160]   The whole set.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:22.960]   Am I saying that right?
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:24.520]   All of my work.
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:25.520]   All of my work.
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:26.520]   Yeah.
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:27.520]   I did that.
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:29.080]   That's what I did, so I would have the complete set.
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:31.000]   The entire French egg.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.000]   Not of...
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   Not of...
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   Earth.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.400]   Earth.
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.040]   Was it alcoholic French egg?
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:44.160]   Yes, the entire French bacon scarf.
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:48.440]   Maybe wrapped around your neck of holiday need and desire.
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:51.720]   It is a total of 88 songs, I believe.
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:52.720]   Something like that.
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:53.720]   Unless I've deleted some.
[01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:57.960]   No, I think you only deleted my audio book.
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:58.960]   That's the only thing.
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:12:59.960]   I never saw...
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:02.800]   That would be crazy.
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.800]   I think you can listen to over and over.
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:08.840]   Yes, and I think that people should download that.
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:09.840]   Yeah.
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:12.520]   But the CD, where can we get that, Mr. Colton?
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:15.160]   The CD is available from CDbaby.com.
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.160]   Oh, good.
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.120]   Does that mean it's also on iTunes?
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:22.280]   No, you know it's not on iTunes, but the songs...
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:23.720]   There's no new songs on it.
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:24.720]   I thought CD...
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:25.720]   Shh.
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:29.440]   This is your retrospective of your life's work.
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:30.440]   Yeah, I know.
[01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.000]   It's another holiday miracle.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.800]   Old songs become a new CD.
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.400]   A new CD with no new material on it.
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.080]   It's a beautiful package though.
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:43.200]   I think it's a perfect gift for somebody who is just becoming introduced to Jonathan Colton
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:46.320]   and perhaps maybe someone who does not know to download.
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.040]   Oh, this hurts.
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:49.240]   It's out of stock.
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:50.240]   It's out of stock.
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:51.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:52.480]   It just says that.
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:53.480]   I know.
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:56.000]   Because it's a long story.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.840]   There are more coming.
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.240]   The burner's been Monday.
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:00.240]   All right.
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.960]   I think that's a perfect holiday gift.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.720]   It's a perfect stocking stuffer.
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:05.720]   Yeah.
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:06.720]   Yeah.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:07.720]   That would stop me.
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:12.040]   If you order it today, will you get it in time for Christmas?
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:14.320]   I believe so, yeah.
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:17.920]   You'd have to ask CDbaby to be sure, but I would imagine so.
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.480]   They ship pretty quickly.
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:22.560]   If not, Jonathan will come and deliver it personally.
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:25.240]   Just let me know and I will bring it to wherever you are.
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:27.120]   Old Saint Pete Box chops himself.
[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.960]   We'll drop it down to chimney.
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.960]   We're only good in the Tri-State area.
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:33.240]   Offer only good in Rhode Island.
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:35.120]   Offer not an offer.
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:36.760]   Not an offer.
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.080]   Offer not available anywhere.
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.160]   Voidware unavailable.
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:41.120]   Well, good.
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:42.120]   Yeah, this is great.
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.520]   I highly recommend Jonathan's music.
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:47.480]   And I'm going to end with a song that you did for podcasters, very generously some years
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:50.040]   back with podcasters.
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:51.040]   Right?
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:54.800]   Did they actually record their parts or did you make them all up?
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:55.800]   No, those are all...
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:56.800]   That's all me saying.
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:57.800]   Oh, too bad.
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:01.640]   I thought it was really Adam Curry making a mess of things.
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:02.640]   No, I wish.
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:03.640]   I wish it was.
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:09.600]   No, I wasn't famous enough to actually even get podcasters to participate with me.
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.600]   That's so sad.
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.800]   The idea came from podcasters.
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:20.240]   I think it was, I don't know if it was Len Peralta or C.C. Chapman, whose idea it was
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:25.720]   to do this, a pod safe Christmas song, which I decided should be in the style of the cheap
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:26.720]   monks.
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:27.720]   Well, enjoy your eggnog.
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:29.640]   Gentlemen, I'm so glad we could talk.
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:34.600]   And I thank you so much for making this special Twit Holiday special so good.
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:39.880]   I dressed as Pericomo for the event in my red sweater and my bacon scarf.
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:41.480]   I dressed as a druid.
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:43.400]   Ah, very appropriate.
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:45.680]   I have a Christmas tree costume on.
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:47.120]   It's very hard to move around.
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:49.040]   It was a little rustling I heard earlier.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:51.440]   You're also incredibly flammable.
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:55.920]   I'm really hot in here, too.
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:56.920]   It's so festive.
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:00.520]   And I hope you've enjoyed the synthetic sounds of Yule Log burning in the background during
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:01.520]   the whole show.
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:03.360]   We've added that in sweetening and post.
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:04.360]   Oh, fantastic.
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:07.960]   I was wondering what that was.
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:10.160]   I thought there was a horrible fire in your house.
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:11.160]   Crackle, crackle.
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:12.160]   I'm so glad.
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:13.160]   Crackle, crackle.
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.400]   Thank you guys.
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.280]   John Hodgman's newest is more information than you require available everywhere.
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:20.040]   It is not too late to get it for Christmas.
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:23.720]   And if you, if the loved one in your life loves to laugh, it's a must.
[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:24.720]   I would get both if you don't have it.
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:28.280]   Or your child or your childhood college, for example.
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:31.280]   The college students would come to my readings and say, "My poor."
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:33.760]   But oftentimes they would walk like Tiny Tim.
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:34.760]   They were on a crutch.
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:37.280]   And they would say, "Please, sir, I want some more."
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:39.000]   But they could not buy it for themselves.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:44.360]   So parents, please think of your poor Tiny Tim crippled children in college who require
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:47.320]   a Christmas goose and my book for the holidays.
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:50.920]   And when he mends Christmas goose, he means nothing like the date rape experience at
[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:51.960]   the Universal Studios.
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:53.960]   That was something completely out of it.
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.960]   You're ringing that up again, Leo.
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:56.960]   Thank you forever.
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:00.480]   Jonathan Colton, Joe Coe, looks back is on CD, baby.
[01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:04.640]   Go to Jonathan Colton.com for the entire French egg.
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:05.640]   Another twit.
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:07.720]   It's in the can.
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:08.720]   Okay, guys.
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:09.720]   Everyone ready to sing the song?
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:10.720]   Yeah.
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:11.720]   We're going, baby.
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:12.720]   Right.
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:15.800]   Now, remember, it's almost Christmas and nobody has any pod safe Christmas music.
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:17.720]   So that's your motivation here.
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:18.720]   C.C. Chapman, you ready?
[01:17:18.720 --> 01:17:19.720]   Ready.
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:20.720]   That's all it is.
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:21.720]   And Lenna Nora from Jawbone.
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:22.720]   Good to go.
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:23.720]   Let's do it!
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:27.200]   Adam Curry, Skyping in from the helicopter flying somewhere above your golden palace.
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:30.720]   You all patched in there, Adam?
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:31.720]   Adam!
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:32.720]   Adam!
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:33.720]   We want a perfect Christmas song.
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:34.720]   We want a song that's made to play.
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:35.720]   Don't take us to read or want a get to die.
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:36.720]   That's all that we are.
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:37.720]   We have been good all year long.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:38.720]   We want a Christmas song.
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:39.720]   We want a song that's made to play.
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:40.720]   We want a Christmas song.
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:41.720]   We want a song that's made to play.
[01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:42.720]   Don't take us to read or want a get to die.
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:43.720]   That's all that we are.
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:44.720]   That's all that we are.
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:45.720]   That's all that we are.
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:46.720]   That's all that we are.
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:47.720]   That's all that we are.
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:48.720]   That's all that we are.
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:49.720]   That's all that we are.
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:50.720]   That's all that we are.
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:53.720]   All year long.
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:57.720]   That's all that we are.
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:00.720]   That's all that we are.
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:05.720]   That's all that we are.
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:08.720]   Okay, pretty good guys except Adam.
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:11.720]   You sounded a little bit like you were rushing in there at the end.
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:13.720]   You know what I mean?
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:14.720]   Buddy?
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:15.720]   What?
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:16.720]   I don't do.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:19.720]   I can't say care for the attitude but you know, just pay attention next time.
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:22.720]   Now, as a recipe, I just wanted to go over it.
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:25.720]   Adam, did you say something to me?
[01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:26.720]   No.
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:27.720]   That's funny.
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:28.720]   I thought I were going to say something.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:30.720]   No, I did it.
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.720]   Look, I don't want to go through this with you.
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:35.720]   We're here to sing a song about hot, safe Christmas music.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:37.720]   I just want everyone to do their best, you know?
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:39.720]   I mean, you just give me a little effort?
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:40.720]   Shut up, CC.
[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:43.720]   Adam, just give me a little effort, okay?
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:45.720]   Adam?
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:46.720]   Adam!
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:47.720]   Adam!
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:48.720]   What?
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:52.720]   We want to have a Christmas song.
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:57.720]   We want to have a Christmas song that's made to play.
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:04.720]   Don't think that's too weird or more like it's too bad or go back behind.
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:09.720]   We have been good or all alone.
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:14.720]   We have been good or go back behind.
[01:19:14.720 --> 01:19:21.720]   We have been good or go back behind.
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:23.720]   Hey, nice job, you guys.
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:24.720]   Really?
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:25.720]   You nailed it.
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:26.720]   You nailed it.
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:31.720]   I want to speak to you soon, but we may have saved Christmas.
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:34.720]   Special thanks to you, Adam, for paying attention.
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:35.720]   That's for you.
