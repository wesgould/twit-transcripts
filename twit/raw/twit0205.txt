[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I'm Leo Laporte and joining us today around the table we've got, so pleased, from the UK, Mr. Pete Cashmore of Mashable fame.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Great to have you back, Pete.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Thank you. Good to be here.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Thanks for being here.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Also here, the man who helped me get elected president of the internet, Jason Heiner of Tech Republic,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   the editor-in-chief. Hi, Jason.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Hey, Leo. Glad to be here.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I have to tell you, I listen to a lot of podcasts and I always come back to Buzz Out Loud, Twitter, and Cranky Geeks.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   So being on Twitter is kind of like checking something off my bucket list.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Now, if only Pete would do a podcast. Do you do a podcast, Pete?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   No, it's not really. I mean, you've got that market sewn up, Leo.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Good. Thank you. Keep up the good work. I appreciate it.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And also here, first time ever on video, which is really remarkable.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   It's not the first time I've ever been on video.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   No, but on this show.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Yes, I got a camera out there glued up to the wall.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   So folks, if you listen to the audio of the show, which most, which is like 99.99% of you do, you're missing out.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   You can watch the video. We produce it live 6 p.m. Eastern every Sunday.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   We don't release the video. We just produce it, but we never release it.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   And it's kind of a treat to see you, John. Well, thank you all for being here.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And John, thank you for filling in for me when I was in China. I really appreciate it.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Yeah, that was fun. And by the way, this when you go to the commercial this time, you can see when I leave to go base the meat.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   I know. We'll know. You'll know.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   There'll be no mystery about where John has disappeared to.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Yeah. Yeah, you did a great job with Becky. You had Natalie Delconte, Becky Worley, a bunch of people in there.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Yeah, it was Carlos from Mevio, who's a producer. I think he worked at Tech TV for a while.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   But yeah, it was actually worked out OK. Natalie was I'm glad that people get to watch this on video because for some reason,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I mean, she's pretty anyway, but she looked really good. She did look good. Good lighting, good camera, good everything.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Yeah. Well, China was amazing. You told me it would be and it was. I didn't get to Shanghai, but boy, Beijing blew me away.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   It did not seem like the place I was expecting people in Mao hats. Exactly.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   The first time I went, which was long ago, we were expecting this was before they even turned over Hong Kong.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I was expecting Mao hats and Mao jackets. And we went around looking.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   We actually asked to see if we can get some as souvenirs. And they said, what are you kidding us?
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   They haven't sold those things for decades. They don't have peasants in the middle of nowhere.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I have all of them. And then we had to actually scrounge around to get a Mao poster.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   My son bought a my son turns out to be an amazing bargainer. I didn't know this.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   He can handle Iran. Yeah, yeah. He's good with that.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   And he went he he haggled a Mao shirt, which says something in Chinese.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   And I have no idea. I'm a little nervous about it. But it's got Chairman Mao on the shirt.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   And he was going to wear it as we were leaving the country.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   I said, you know, Henry, maybe you want to change it to something that says Levi's instead.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Yeah, really an unknown Mao slogan.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   We are back from Red China.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   So anyway, we found some guy who got into the library archives and found some of the original old posters.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   And he pulled about five or six of them out and we took those.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And but I was all the time I'm there thinking, wow, the souvenir opportunities for the Little Red Book and all because, you know,
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   American tourists are looking for that stuff, even though it's, you know, I guess it's offensive to somebody.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   I don't think it offends anybody. I want to I want to Mao's mausoleum.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   You know, I waited in line to see his body and thousands of people that get there two hours before it opens.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   The line was two hours long from from getting there an hour ahead of time.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   And people are putting chrysanthemums on his grave.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   I think that for a lot of people, even though, you know, if you if you look at his history, this guy was as bad as Stalin, as bad as Hitler.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   I mean, this guy was awful. I mean, he he he was the author of the World's
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Worst Famine. Twenty million people died during the quote Great Leap Forward.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   I mean, this guy was a nutball. Yeah, you're not going back.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   So I guess not now. So let's talk about can I briefly mention congratulations to the Netflix prize winners?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Have you been following this horse? It's changed. I was just following that.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   I think that just changed at the last minute. And then we got yes.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   So story go up on Mashable. It just changed. So what happened?
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   You know, this is Netflix. Oh, that must be annoying.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   That must be so annoying. Oh, these like a million dollars. Yes.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   So Netflix wants to make its recommendations better.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   So when you know, when you go to Netflix to run a DVD, it says you might like this movie, too.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   And there are, you know, these recommendation engines suck. They've always sucked.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   I've never seen it worked. But Netflix said we're going to put up a million bucks for any artificial intelligence team or whatever
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   that can figure out a way to make this 10 percent better.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Now, I don't know how you measure 10 percent better, but they had some metric and a team called Bell Corps Pragmatic Chaos.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   You might recognize Bell Corps. That's the old AT&T Labs name.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And in fact, members of the team were from AT&T Labs and others got it up to 10.08 percent.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   My editor just pinged me and said winners not announced yet.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   There are two scores calculate. We don't yet know who's going to win.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   So it's kind of down to the last minute. I thought Netflix, I thought announced that they had a winner.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   But in any event, so Bell Corps was now the way the rules worked.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Once you broke 10 percent, that started the clock ticking.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And then all the other teams had 30 days to beat your result.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   And this this the second place team yesterday. Came up the ensemble with point oh one percent better.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   I think Bell Corps had 10.07. Then they came up with 10.08.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Bell Corps, about an hour ago. This is really sneaky.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   They held onto it and they put up 10.09 percent.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   The ensemble comes back four minutes before the closing time.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   But these guys get all their experience from eBay.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   It's like sniping. Four minutes before closing time.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   At 1838, 22 and they put up 10.10 percent improvement.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   I don't know if they have I don't know if they've if they've announced it.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   But I think I saw that the Netflix had said that we do have a winner.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   But I'm looking at the website now NetflixPrize.com and they haven't said.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   So I don't know what the latest is. But isn't that isn't that amazing?
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Wow. It's been going for ages as well.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Suddenly this. You know, so we kind of assumed that once you had the 10 percent, oh, they're going to win that surely.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   I mean, if you've been working on this for how many years, it just seemed like there would be the obvious winner.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And then how come all these two groups should get together and split it?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Well, that's what happened initially is that the Bell Corps was AT&T commando, Yahoo research, pragmatic three,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   a group of team member, different competing teams, compooled their results to get this result.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   You know who the winner is, though? It's Netflix. Oh, man. Yeah.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   They're going to make way, way more than a million dollars out of this.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   You know, think of all the media attention.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Firstly, everyone's been writing about it.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   But secondly, just like it would have cost you more than a million bucks to improve your recommendations by 10 percent.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   How much is that worth to them in terms of, you know, bottom line?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   It's well, way more. Oh, it's well worth it.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   So I think it's a lesson for other companies.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   You know, if you can't be bothered getting developers on something for years, just start a content.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I think the novelty is going to fade, though.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   I think you're not if you do another Netflix prize type thing for another company, it's going to have the same media.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   It's worked for space exploration with the X Prize and Google put money now into the new X Prize, which is what I can't remember what it is.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Getting to the moon, right?
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   They want to do moon exploration.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   The interesting thing is you should.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   These guys obviously are master strategicians.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   It should have been in hindsight obvious that they would hold off to the last minute.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   They would hold better results back and fire away at the last minute.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   But they blew it because they fired too soon.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   This other team, the ensemble came back and said, no, we can beat you by point one percent.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   I would this is I love this story.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   I just think that's wonderful. And you're right. Big winners.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   And hopefully it'll be finalized eventually.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   Hey, there's one of the stories on your list that I wanted to talk about.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Yes, sir.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Microsoft tweaks ad after Apple complains.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Yeah, you know, we talked about this last week.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Now, I would love to get your opinions on this.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   So Apple, you know, well, it starts with Microsoft.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   It starts with a Microsoft guy saying, oh, Apple's lawyers called me to complain about our ad.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   And they said that it wasn't true anymore. And he said, I never had such a good call in my life.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   I was jumping up and down, running down the halls, yelling at everybody because, you know, big victory for Microsoft.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   But that Apple was complaining that Apple was so upset about the ad.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   But it's my opinion that Microsoft, this guy made this up.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Apple didn't call him. I just would.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   That's kind of the thing. I think I'm pretty sure Apple did call and Apple tell them, you know, look,
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   you're you've got our price wrong for the machine that you're comparing.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   No, first. OK, this is the story.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Last week at Microsoft's Worldwide Partner Conference in New Orleans, COO Kevin Turner
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   said he did quote cartwheels down the hallway after getting a phone call from Apple's legal department
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   complaining about the campaign. We're just going to, he says, we're just going to keep running them and running them and running them.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   First of all, is it a sales conference? I think it's BS.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   It's a developer conference. It's a partner.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   This is BS. Apple sends a letter. They don't make a phone call.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. No, I'm sure it was a letter, not a phone call.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   The whole thing's suspect. Yeah. Well, for one thing, it wouldn't be a phone call because you wouldn't know who to call 90 percent of the time.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   Yeah, no doubt. Not at Microsoft. Right. Oh, let's call Kevin. He'll know.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Yeah, sounds like bogus. It sounds like a bogus story. What's he cartwheeling for? Is he 12?
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   In any event, apparently, Redmond has quietly changed, according to advertising age, the ads because remember the laptop
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   hunter ads kept saying that MacBooks were $2,000 or more.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Apple's dropped the price, so they just kind of they snipped that part out. Big deal.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   I think this is all just publicity for Microsoft. Even this story is just more pro-Microsoft propaganda.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   But it's lousy propaganda because those ads, for one thing, suck.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   They're not selling Microsoft. They're selling laptops.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Microsoft, I hate to bring it to their attention, but they don't even make a laptop.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Yeah, I do think it hits Apple where it hurts, though.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   And I do think that that's why Apple has reacted to this.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   And the fact that Apple has knows that it hits them where it hurts is that right now people perceive them as a premium brand.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   And in this economy, you know, premium brands are are taking a little bit of a beating.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   And that's how they're pitching them. And Microsoft should have been doing this.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   I agree. The ads are actually lousy, but they are.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   The strategy is right. The execution is wrong.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Well, I'm in so far as premium brand is concerned, I can't imagine anybody being more cost conscious than my son,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   who I wrote a column about, I guess, in PC magazine saying my son bought a Macintosh because he bought one of the MacBook Pros, the unibody one.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   13 inch. Yeah, I think so. Sweet. I like that. Yeah, it's a nice little thing.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   It's got a little SD card thing in it and the whole thing. It's got little buttons that show you the battery.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   It's got a lot of interesting features. I actually like the machine and it's light.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   And, you know, he could have bought something cheaper.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   But, you know, the thing is, he got the thing for like just a little over a thousand dollars.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   I was thinking I'd buy this myself. It seems like a good maybe if Apple's got a complaint is that they're not as premium as you might think they are.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   I don't know if you want to go any cheaper, to be honest with you. According to NDP, the analysts at NDP,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Apple's got 90 percent of the quote premium laptop market. Yeah. Yep. Yep.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   But you could have got something. I mean, your son could have gotten something a lot cheaper, John.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   I mean, he could have gotten probably for what you get in that machine. You could have got a five or six hundred dollar machine.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   But it would have been crap. But it would have been crap. Right. And Apple, what Apple's done well is say, look, it's not just about price.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   They don't say spend a little bit more. But that's what they're saying. You spend a little bit more with us.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   But you know you're going to get the good support. Here's why this story is really bad news for PCs.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   First of all, when we're going to get to it, the results for PC makers and Microsoft were horrendous this quarter.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Yeah. But nine out of NDP for the month of June, slightly more than nine out of every ten dollars spent on.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Now, we say premium any computer over a thousand dollars. Apple got 90 percent of the buy.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   That means whatever PCs are selling are these kind of low end sub thousand dollar PCs.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Low margin, too, I might add. And probably most of them are netbooks. Yep. That's where all the money is.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   The ones that Apple selling when I saw that, I mean, I'm still a little skeptical of that report, to be honest.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   But I think it's probably the numbers are close. But that's where all the money is.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   I mean, I was kind of shocked when I saw that it shows that Apple is just stealing the best part of the market from all of these PC makers.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Average sale price of a Windows laptop, if you exclude netbooks, five hundred sixty nine bucks.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Average sale price of a Mac laptop, fourteen hundred bucks. Geez.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   I mean, this is much better news for Apple than it is for PCs.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Even you know, and it's why probably Cupertino doesn't even care about market share. Who cares?
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   No. Yeah, exactly. They care about margin. They've always been a margin oriented company.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Always. They've never market share is just an embarrassment to them, but it's not what they're all about.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   They've always been big on margins. I mean, Microsoft's kind of the same way.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   I've only they don't sell any hardware, but they're huge on.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   I mean, they're margin because they're just selling a twenty five cent disc, you know, that they stamp out and mass produce.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   It's all margin. Two, three hundred dollars. I mean, it's like, holy crap. Talk about margin.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Yeah, I'd rather be in that business, to be honest with you. For the first time ever.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Microsoft reported its first year over year decline in sales in company history.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Now, they still made money. Fifty eight point four billion dollars.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Yeah. Yeah, those poor bastards. Well, you're the one.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   And we're going to get to this who wrote the article in MarketWatch saying it's all over for Microsoft.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Yeah, I know. I heard you earlier because I was listening in while you're trying to communicate with me about how I've been saying it's all the more excessive.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   You've been saying it for years. Back in 1903.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   No, no, I won't say that. But I think for in fact, for a while now, I think it's been at least four years you've been you've been proclaiming the death of Microsoft.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   Well, they haven't focused for 10. So four is I think that's reasonable.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   All right. Well, they lost Mojo ever since the DOJ went after him.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   I mean, Microsoft has been on defense and they've been playing zone defense.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   It's not like they're playing aggressive man to man. They're playing zone defense.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   So, you know, sports analogies. Yeah, they're playing.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   No worse than that. Let's take a move at the football. They're they're playing prevent defense.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   Exactly. Exactly. That prevents you from winning.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   Yeah. Now, but I do think they're doing they are getting a little aggressive. I mean, I wrote something last week saying that, you know, has Microsoft switched from defense to offense?
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   I mean, with Bing, which they've wasted a zillion dollars on and the Microsoft stores, you know, all of these things, at least the, you know, push forward.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   I think they're pushing forward on the wrong stuff. They've taken their eye off their their core market, which is similar to what John is saying.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   But at least they're acting a little aggressive again and just not sitting back and letting people come apart.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   I personally don't see that them being any more aggressive than they were with the pen computer that Bill Gates is going to take over the world by, you know, twenty two or two thousand three.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Or they were any more aggressive than they did every once in a while. They get a kind of they get a bug up them.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   And it's all of a sudden they've got to, you know, they they get all jazzed about something like Bing and they get all worked up and then they let it slide.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   And they go on to something new. I mean, my column was about not so much about Microsoft fault, you know, ending at the end of the rain.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   It's mostly about the fact that they they're letting the cash cows languish and they keep jumping from one thing to another.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Yeah, Bing is really hot for them right now. And then they're going to look at the numbers at some point.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   It's going to be the same numbers they've always had from search.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   And then they're going to do a deal with Yahoo. And that's they're going to be buzzed about that.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   And then that'll languish. I mean, it's just one. I mean, I just it's the same. That's why I keep predicting the demise, because it's the same story.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   I've seen it forever and I don't see it changing.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   And at some point when the numbers start to turn like they just did, it could be the beginning of the end.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   Yeah, they're wasting a lot of money. I mean, they're wasting money and effort and focus.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   I mean, they have not focused on their core businesses, windows and office and servers.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Actually, the big winner in Microsoft's lack of focus is Oracle because they're going in and they're running roughshod over the whole business software market
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   where Microsoft actually has some decent products and could undercut Oracle and make a lot of money with products like SQL Server and Windows Server and all of this kind of thing.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   And Oracle is just going and running roughshod over that whole market and making a zillion dollars.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   And Microsoft is out there, you know, messing around with search engines and antivirus software and all this kind of stuff.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   And I agree 100% with that. That's actually the thing I left out of that article.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Now that you mention it is that element, the fact that they could actually take Oracle on head to head.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   But, you know, again, it's you know, there's just they kind of got into the database business on a offhanded way.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   They bought Fox Pro. They, you know, they saw this other people making money in it.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   So they got interested and then everything folded. And so they kind of lost interest.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   And, you know, meanwhile, you're right, they could probably because they do have a good product they could easily take on Oracle if they if they had a mind to they don't they don't care.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   Pete, you were going to say something.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Oh, I don't have any insights into Oracle versus Microsoft. I was going to say either.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   So I remember I remembered on the consumer side, at least I remember the survey from back in May.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   And, you know, John saying that maybe those ads are kind of useless.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   If you look at the stats that came out, there's a report by a company called Brand Index that was Microsoft versus Apple consumer value perception ages 18 to 34.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Essentially, you know, which do you think is a value brand?
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   And you look at when they started that campaign, there's an article on Wired called Survey Microsoft's Laptop Hunter Ads are hurting Apple.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   And it's pretty clear that the value perception score for Microsoft went way, way up and the value perception score for Apple went way, way down.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   In other words, you know, young people look at these two brands and say, I've seen those ads and I kind of think that I'm getting more value from, you know, a PC than a Mac.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   I think if you look at if you look at those ads, John Hodgman's way more sympathetic in the Mac ads than in the Mac.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   So but nobody would contest ever in history that the value proposition is better for Windows.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Well, people who have Macs think the value.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   I mean, why else would you buy a Mac? You think you're getting people don't buy just for value, but quality is value.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   I mean, if it's a high quality product, then I bet if you asked, though, see, I think that's a different question.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   If you ask people, what's the better value proposition windows?
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   What's the better quality? What are they going to say?
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Mac. Well, of course, they're going to say Mac.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Definitely. I think that's the same question. I think, you know, Macs are better value, but I think the perceptions change.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Yeah, that's a British. The British are more likely to think of good quality because it lasts longer than Americans.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Americans are into disposable more than the English.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   And so your your commentary there actually matches your culture because, you know, no, seriously, people buy like an eight hundred dollar pair of shoes in England
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   because they know they're going to last 15 years and we won't do that.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   We buy plastic shoes. We invented McDonald's. We buy dorks on.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   I don't think I don't think you do buy crocs anymore. Do you?
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   No, you buy the clones. You know, I was surprised, though.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   You know, who's buying Crocs? Chinese. There's a there was a Crocs store in China.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Wow. Interesting. All Crocs in one store. Oh, it's such a fad, isn't it?
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   I don't see the long term in that at all. How did we get to Crocs?
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   I think Crocs just killed it. I think it was a British.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   No, but I think that you're well, I mean, we're the land that invented the the the Big Mac.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   I mean, I think you're right. We're the disposable society.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   However, Apple does better in the U.S. than it does in any other country in the world.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Right. Well, like that's that's I think it's a marketing issue of channels.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Sorry. You know, that was on the consumer side on the PC versus homeac debate, which is never ending.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   But I don't know anything about the Oracle debate.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   I think on the Web site, which is where I have kind of knowledge, I think, you know, things are good products, good search engine.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   People, you know, I think has beaten expectations.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   So if you look at how dominant Google is in that space, no one would have imagined that Microsoft could have a player.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   The tech industry said, you know, that's actually quite good. It's OK.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   It's a contender. It's not going to beat Google.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   But, you know, they've made more headway than you might expect.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   We'll have to see what happens when the kind of the initial spike wears off from that huge ad campaign they've waged.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   But on the Web in general, no, they're losing that battle.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   They're going to continue losing that battle.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   And seeing as the Web is the entire operating system battle going forward, they've I agree with John overall that long term, they're kind of done.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   They're they're coasting on prior revenues.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   They don't really have a direction on the Web. They don't dominate that space.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   It's pretty obvious that Google is going to dominate that space.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   With Chrome OS, you think?
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   I was thinking a bit more holistically than that.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   I you know, that's TBD.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   See, the thing at Microsoft, the problem Microsoft has is they want to be on all.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   I think John said it best in his Market Watch article.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   It's like they go after these shiny objects and they get, you know, caught up in that.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   And Bing is the one right now.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   The only thing Bing has done for them is it's kind of be a bee in the bonnet of Google.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   Google's, you know, they've taken some of the buzz around search engines and they've taken that.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   But, you know, a four or five billion dollar bee in the bonnet of Google's.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   I don't know. Not sure if that's a really good value investment.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   But if Microsoft would just step back and try to say, look, we're going to be more of a background player, we're going to provide the software that people want, we're going to be a great software company.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   They could still be a great player for decades.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   And but they're not doing that.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   They want to be the coolest kid on the block.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   They want to be the one who has all of the shiny stuff and the one that gets all of the attention.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   And it's like at some point they're going to lose if they don't just say, you know, we don't care about getting all the attention.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   We want to create great products and make money because we're a public company.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   If they do that, they still have a shot. It's not over for them.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   John, do you have a set of speakers open?
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   It's really echoing back in here.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   Now, can you hear it fine?
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   Much better.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   Good. Sorry.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   Yeah, you don't have to turn down your speakers.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   Phenomenal. You know, I got to fix the studio up because the speakers are unfortunately not the best thing would be to wear headphones because there's always going to be a little echo coming back at us.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   I don't mind wearing headphones, except I, you know, wearing them in over an hour show.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   It just bugs.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   I know it gets sweaty. I know.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   I'm wearing them too.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   But I'll put some on next time.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   Okay. If you want to take a break, you may.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   We're going to come back and talk more about Microsoft.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   We're going to talk more about shoes, of all things, and Google privacy.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   There's a lot to talk about.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   AT&T, the iPhone.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   But first, I want to talk about audible.com.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   Audible, of course, our great sponsors, the folks who do those audio books that I am so hooked on.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   You can get a special deal right now.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   The audible platinum deal gives you two free books when you sign up at audible.com/twittoo.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   That's the platinum.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Two books when you sign up for the platinum plan.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Audible, of course, is kind of the ultimate in online bookstores.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Even the content's digital.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   And it's not, no, it's not like a Kindle.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   It's audio content. That's what I love about audible.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   I listen to audio books all the time in the gym, on the plane.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   When I was traveling, it was just a lifesaver.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   And I want to encourage you to give it a try.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E dot com slash twittoo.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   That's the place to sign up for the platinum account and get your first two books free.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   I'm just looking through my audible collection here to see if I can find a good book for you.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   Nelson Mandela's favorite African folk tales.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   That's for John. You're going to love that.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   The panic. He's still there.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   The panic of, how about this one?
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   The panic of 1907.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   Lessons learned from the market's perfect storm.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   Did you know that there was a, you knew, you know that John.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   I'm back, yeah.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   1907.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   1907? Yeah.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   It was a whopper.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   1907 actually matched perfectly, going by my 80 year cycle.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   It's an interesting year because 80 years later, of course, we had 1987, which was exactly the same.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   It was a, and this happened, by the way, 80 years earlier.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   You had a market collapse that there was no real explanation for at the time, but it was always, you know,
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   these collapses always reverse engineered.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   They keep looking at them.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   Maybe it was because of this monetary policy and they would go on and on.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   But the panic in 1907 is an absolute classic and it's beautiful because it's right on the money.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   People don't, you know, everybody knows about 1929. Nobody knows about 1907.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Oh, 19, no, that's a, that's a, that's a big one. In fact, and you can expect the same thing to happen in say,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   26, 20, 80 years from 1987, you know, exactly the same.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   None of us will be here to prove you right or wrong.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   You can put this in a time capsule, ladies and gentlemen, just sell around June of that year.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   There you go.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   Well, was this year an 80 year cycle from something? 1929, 19, 2009.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   I guess it was. Yeah. And take a look. Why 80 years though?
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   That makes that seems very mechanistic. No, I know. No, no. It's not though.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   Well, I mean, if just another reminder, I got to finish my little tome.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   So please finish your tome. But meanwhile, until then, the panic of 1907, lessons learned from the market's perfect storm.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Robert Bruner, Sean Carr. What are you laughing at?
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Lessons learned is what I get a kick out of. Like we learned anything.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Nobody's learned anything ever. Not a thing.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   It's a good book to listen to anyway. Hey Leo, I've got a pick. Yeah, sure.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   It's actually not, you know, Ottawa has more than just books. They've got some other stuff too.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   They've got one. I don't know. I'll hold it up to the camera if you can see it.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   It's a, now it's to, it's called The Course of Human Events by David McCullough.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   It's actually a lecture. I love David McCullough. I do too.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   Just fantastic author. And this is about the founding fathers. It's about 40 minutes long.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   And his point is great in this. It's like, look, these guys, it wasn't just that, you know, they were these sort of gods that knew everything and had it all together.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   You know, they argued with each other. They couldn't figure out a lot of this stuff.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   And, you know, they were, they were really just trying to figure it all out.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   But also some of their imperfections balanced each other out. And then, you know, in Unity, they came up with some great stuff.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   So anyway, it's a great lecture by McCullough. It's in, it takes place in DC. It's to, it has some really great stuff in it anyway.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   You're absolutely right. I mean, it's more than just books, lectures, comedy performances, radio shows, even podcasts.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   But this, you know, they have a lot of McCullough stuff. The Johnstown Flood, which I haven't read. John Adams, which I did, which is incredible.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   And on some of the best of them, he narrates them because he has the best voice ever.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Did you just say I haven't read? Yeah. Johnstown Flood. I haven't read the Johnstown Flood.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   No, but you haven't, but you listen to these things. No, you're not going to be one of those pedants who says you're not reading, are you?
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   No, I'm just saying. I'm reading them by listening them in my, pouring them in my ear.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   It's every, it's the same. It's, it's, look, it's the same thing. It's the words on the page, but somebody's reading out loud. Isn't that having read a book?
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   No, I don't believe so. I listened to it. All right. Well, I haven't listened to this. I'll tell you why, because writers, in fact, our writer is up there.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   We'll have to agree with this. Is that when you, when you read something out loud or reading to yourself, you get a different impression.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   You get ears, far better impression. You, you absorb it. I'm not going to say it's better or worse. You know, when I read your column, John, I hear your voice.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   And I think any good writer, I think you should see a doctor. Any good writer, you hear that I'm standing behind you.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   I hear John. Well, I've, I've known you for so long, but I mean, I think that that's true. If you knew, I think when I read David McCullough, I hear his cadence, his rhythm.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Yeah, no, he's got a good voice. Just call it voice in writing. Yeah. Anyway, yeah, it's voice. In fact, I was always told that when I write, I should read it out loud before I fit in, before I'm done.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   That's one of the final things you do. Yeah, that's for editing purposes. I do that too. I do that. It's kind of old school, but I had a real old school journalism teacher.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   And so, and so I do that. And if it's well written, it will scan. It will read well as well. Yeah, I think. Well, anyway, this is a little odd.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   I usually read it to my cat. And if the cat doesn't get up and leave, it's a hit. Do you read it to your plants? You know, that's supposed to help plants grow. That's a good one. Yeah.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   There's a joke in there. I'm not going to use it though. There are two books that we recommend you get to. That's nice. Audible.com/twittoo. Get the Course of Human Events.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   David Bacalla's great speech about the founding fathers. And you can also get 1907 Lessons Learned from the Great Crash that Nobody Remembers.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   But you know, that's just two of 60,000 titles. Audible.com/twittoo. We thank them so much for their support. And they owe me now about a thousand dollars for that extra long commercial they just got.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   They're on Twitter as well. They are audible_com. Yeah, that's awesome. And I also just found this UK version. If you're in the UK, audible UK is their Twitter handle here. I don't think your code's working in the UK.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. But they don't pay us. I will try. I will get back to you on that one.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   This is a really classic issue in general, which is that advertising agencies are at best national. So they have a budget and they don't care, right? The fact that 30% of our audience is outside the US, they don't pay us for that 30%. They don't care. And it just drives me crazy.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   It's the next stage. They've got to figure that out. And some of the smart ones will and they'll leapfrog their competitors when they do.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Well, I think they know and they just say, hey, we're going to save 30%. But you know, some of our sponsors are paying for the full international audience. Almost all of them, except audible has been with us so long that we let them get away with murder. Yes.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   Listen to Jason's voice and tell me who you think he sounds like. Jason Calacanis? No, Jason Hiner. Oh, Jason, talk to me a little bit here. As we go. He sounds like somebody we know? Yeah. Yeah. But I have not been able to nail it.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   All right. Huh. Huh. All right. I'm usually pretty good about that. I know that Pete sounds like Sean Connery.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   Do I? I'm told that I don't really have a Scottish. It comes and goes. It's like a bit more Scottish. There's a little Scots there. There's a little Scots. I like it. I like it. So Amazon, as long as we're talking results, Amazon also reporting bad results. In fact, weaker than expected earnings.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:26.000]   That's always bad. You don't want to disappoint the market. It's okay to have bad earnings as long as they thought you were going to have bad earnings. A steep decline in its flagship business of selling media products, books, music and DVDs. Net profit down 10%.
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   You know, when you mentioned what was it Microsoft made in the year? 54 billion or whatever. Amazon in its quarter only made $142 million. Chicken feed. Yeah, nothing compared to what Microsoft's made.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   And then they had to have warehouses. Second quarter, revenue up 14%. It's a more normal business. That's right. Yeah. Analysts thought earnings would be 32 cents a share. Well, they were 32 cents a share.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Part of it was the legal settlement to Toys R Us. Now Amazon spent some money this week. They bought Zappos. I found that peculiar. Because Amazon sells shoes already. Yeah.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   And Zappos was the one company I thought that could really push Amazon online. I mean, Zappos has got great customer service. They really know what they're doing online. One of the few great e-commerce retailers out there. And I was like, this is the company that's going to kind of come up and nip Amazon.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   That's why they bought them. I think that's the point. I think it's take out the biggest competitor. I mean, what if Zappos suddenly said, hey, we're doing shoes really well. Because they're not really a shoe company. They're a marketing and customer service company.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   So if they suddenly say, hey, you know, there's all these verticals that Amazon have got. Let's start doing books and music. And they'd have a real chance there. So I think it's removing the biggest threat online to Amazon's business.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   Why do Zappos sell, you think? Well, apparently this, you know, I don't want to weigh in too much, but apparently the CEO wasn't perhaps on board and the investors were kind of pushing for it.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Tony Hsieh didn't want to do it. Yeah, but he's not talking, so who knows. Yeah. I think he's part of the secret to the success of Zappos. Where did they, they have a unique corporate culture. I mean, it really is customer focused.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   It is very, I mean, you go to the Zappos offices, it's very different from anywhere else. Very web 2.0. And I think his Twitter presence had a lot to do with the success of Zappos.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   So he's a very important part of the whole picture. I don't know if you could duplicate the culture in a bigger company.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   Well, how much are they? Well, they've done very well culturally. You know, their revenues are so significant that I would be hard pressed to put it all on Twitter. I think that's kind of our perception because we see them through the lens of Twitter.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   I think it's far more significant online presence than just Twitter. Well, they do a lot of stuff. You know, the fact that they, you know, when I buy shoes from them every once in a while they say, "Hey, we thought we'd FedEx your package for free." You know, just surprise you.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   They do a lot of little stuff like that. ZDN had actually just did a special report on Zappos and their social marketing strategy.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   And I think they said that they spent like 300 grand a year on the social media stuff. They never, Tony said they never tried to put ROI on that. They just felt like it was part of being out there, being connected with customers.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   And they just took that as part of doing business and being, like you said, Leo, web 2.0 company. But, you know, they were making, so according to their revenue, the revenue is I think like 1 billion, if I remember right.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   Yes, they turned themselves into a 1 billion dollar company like almost overnight.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   Almost overnight. So it's pretty impressive that they weren't spending a whole lot of money or putting a ton of energy. You know, Tony, even in this report, which is great, I'd recommend everybody read it if you're interested in Zappos.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   And they're a fascinating company. You know, they said that, you know, like I said, no ROI and they were just trying to get their name out there. And still, he said the best social networking is with phone and email.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   He said Twitter, Facebook, none of them compare to phone and e-mail, which I thought was pretty wild for him to say.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   And also they're a very established company and Twitter's only really grown significantly in the last kind of six months. So I was supposed to be the social media guy. I wouldn't put too much of that emphasis on Twitter.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   I think they must have had a very strong business.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   I admit to being completely myopic because of course that's how I found out about Zappos. You know, my engagement with Tony Hsieh on Twitter is what kind of made me like Zappos.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   Oh, cool.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   And, you know, okay, you're right. I mean, that was maybe how many people did he reach? 30,000 or something. And not enough to make a billion dollar company for sure.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   However, I have to think it's had some significance. And now do you think Pete, going forward, now that Twitter is much bigger, it could conceivably be a tool that companies could use to gain that kind of market share?
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   You know, $800 million. Geez.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   Well, what did Dell do? Did Dell not come out with a report recently that said they'd done about $3 million in revenue?
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   From their Dell outlet.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   Their Dell outlet.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   Yeah, we don't have that many numbers. I mean, it's single digit millions for Dell.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   Yeah. Not billions.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   I think going forward, Twitter is growing like crazy. And a lot of those accounts have critical mass in the sense that, you know, everyone knows them, everyone on Twitter is marketing for them.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   I think, I don't think it will be that big, but I think it's going to become more significant as an outlet.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   And the key to Twitter, I think, is reaching influencers like you, Leo. I mean, Zappos, you know, Tony getting connected with you, connected him then with a lot more audience. Right.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   So influencers are key to Twitter, I think.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   No, I think you're right.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   By the way, I got Jason's voice. I finally figured it out.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Who is it?
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   Well, you probably don't know him, but I think anyone who's listening to the show, who watches a lot of sports will pick it up.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   And then they'll be amused because it's so good that I think we could actually use him to punk somebody.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   He's a dead, he's got the dead ringer voice for Max Kellerman, who used to be on ESPN, now he's on HBO Boxing.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   Do you know Max, Jason?
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   Yes, yes. That's hilarious. I've never gotten that before, but that's very cool. I'm a big sports fan, so I love it.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   Well, I'm going to have to find Max Kellerman in this.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   When you hear it, you're going to go, oh my God.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   I've always wanted to do a tweet where everybody sounds exactly the same.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   There was either a family guy or a Simpsons episode where they had all these guys who sounded, you know, around the table sounding exactly the same.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   It was very confusing. Very confusing in audio.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   Oh, yeah, totally.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   So here's a story that just will not die. Yahoo's board of directors, according to the Wall Street Journal, met Thursday to discuss an ad sales deal with Microsoft search ads.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   Industry analysts expect the deal is close. I love this. You know how you know a deal is close because Carol Bartz is saying, I just love that Bing.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   Yeah, that's a pretty good sign.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   That's the giveaway. She says, quote, Carol Bartz, the CEO of Yahoo was brought in to save the company, quote, I think actually Bing is a good product.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   I don't know how you say this with a straight face.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   It actually extends sort of the experimentation around search and how people use it instead of just thinking like a standard blue link, she said.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   I think they've done.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   She said, by the way, she's saying this Leo as she's doing a calculation on her stock.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   Exactly.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   I think they've done a good job.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   I think Microsoft should be given kudos for Bing.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   I think they've done a nice job.
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   It's pretty strange.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   It's like Larry Ellison saying complimentary things about Balmer.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   No kidding. That Balmer. He's a good looking guy.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   Wow. Go ahead.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   Jason, go ahead, Jason.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   I was just saying my colleague Larry Dingan wrote an article about this too, about the whole.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   He was on the call where Bartz was very complimentary and he's like, what's up with this?
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   Because she doesn't. That's just not her take usually.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   And so, yeah, it's got to be.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   There's got to be something going on there.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   But still, it's one of those stories, like you said, that just won't die.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   I remember talking about this and a lot of people felt like it was never going to happen anyway.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   And now maybe the business, them buying the search business makes more sense than them buying all of Yahoo.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   I mean, it's still a massive distraction for Microsoft.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   But I don't know. What is it? Calacanis?
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   Why would they want it?
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   Yeah, it's a dying. Why would you want to buy something that's dying?
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   Although, while Microsoft's profits down 29 percent,
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   Yahoo actually, this is weird.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   I guess it's because it was so low to begin with that their profit was up 8 percent.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   Yeah, their profits were up, but their sales were down.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   I mean, this is the let's fire everybody. We make the profits look.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   Oh, I got it. So they got the bottom line up.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   Well, Yahoo still has good businesses.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   It's not that Yahoo doesn't have some good business.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   I love Yahoo. I use Flickr. I use Delicious.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   I mean, they're raking in the dough from that.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   I know they've got a problem. OK, they've got some good properties.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   They just haven't figured out what the hell to do with them.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   Well, they're making they're making good money off, you know, these these broad mass market CPMs,
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   you know, because they do so much broad traffic and they're they're making.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   Yeah, buzz, you know, all of these things, the meat and potatoes of the Internet is some of what Yahoo does.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   And they make money, you know, decent CPM money off of that.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   Right. One of our chatters, Kishkaman says Yahoo.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   I don't know if this is true. See if you can you confirm this.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   Yahoo has a patent that Google is using and Microsoft wants the patent.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   Oh, yeah. You know, I wrote about this actually about this when this thing first developed.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   Somebody sent me a note about this patent and I wrote it up.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   And this was like early on in the negotiate.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   You know, they were first talking about this rumor.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   And I can't remember what the patent. There is a really important patent.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   And it's something that that Yahoo seems to just they bought some other company and that patent came with it.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   This is what I kind of vaguely remember the story.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   The patent came with it and they've kind of kept it on the shelf.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   But it's needed. I think something Google's doing in particular, I think it has something to do with AdSense
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   or the way you present ads by by doing the keyword search.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   That's what it's all about. And so they both everybody needs this patent.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   And I think Microsoft would love to get a hold of it because the way I understood it when I wrote this was they could put the screws to Google.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   I'd love to read more about that. That's interesting.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   That's a very interesting story. I can dig that column up and post it.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   Cool. Yeah, I'd be very curious about that.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   When we come back. Yes, go ahead. We're going to add. We're going to add. Don't interrupt the ad.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   No, no. I want to speak about MySpace when we when we move on.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   They have a whole new thing they want to try.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   I also want to talk about the Palm pre it's on between Apple and Palm back and forth.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   Fascinating story there and some complaints to the USB folks over all of this.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   But before we do that, I'm going to mention the folks at Squarespace dot com.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   Squarespace is more than just a blogging tool.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   Squarespace is your future on the Web.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   In fact, lately we've been thinking more and more about moving everything to Squarespace.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   Squarespace dot com slash twit. Take a look at it.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   It's it's you know, it first you might say, well, this is like a blogging tool and you could certainly use it for that.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   In fact, if you are a blogger, you're going to like the fact that you could try Squarespace for free.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   No credit card necessary. And it imports from all the major blogging tools.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   So it's a very easy way to try Squarespace.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   It'll import all your blog comments, all your blog posts, removable type, WordPress, type pad blogger and export.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   So you're not you're never stuck, but it has all sorts of additional tools that make it really useful for any kind of website,
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   including form building, data collection, incredible statistics, photo galleries,
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   complete integration with all social media without third party scripts.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   You know, Discus, I use Discus for my comments.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   And that was the first thing I said. There's a Squarespace iPhone app.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   I said, do you use do you support Discus? No problem.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   Just a little JavaScript snippet. Try it for free.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   I think you'll like it 10 percent off if you use the coupon code TWIT and if you decide to buy, but you don't need a credit card.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   You just need to go to Squarespace dot com slash TWIT and you can try it out for a few weeks and see what you think.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   Squarespace is actually a really awesome platform. I've been checking it out.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   And you know, this is where blogs are going in terms of, you know, it's not quite this defined thing where it's just like,
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   I'm going to write some text. It's pulling all the social media stuff.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   It's you want to discuss comments. So you want to bring in all the comments from everywhere else.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   And you know, I think in calling it a blog platform might be kind of limiting its scope.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   It's kind of more like a it's more like kind of a basis for starting your whole presence online.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   So every time one of our servers goes down, which it did at the beginning of the radio show today,
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   that's kind of why the server goes down at the rate during the radio show.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   And it's not, you know, just but I think in fact, Bear, our assistant man said, why don't we move into Squarespace?
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   The virtualization technology they use, they put more bandwidth online.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   You're you're not on any one machine. It's it's it's it's cloud hosting.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   It's very interesting what they're doing. These guys are brilliant.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   This is the future of apps, by the way, I think so.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   Virtualization and the failover and all of this kind of stuff.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   Everybody is putting big money into this right now. It's Squarespace.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   I don't know how they did it. Just a bunch of smart guys really trying to get this together.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   But they actually leapfrog a lot of really big companies who've been trying to do exactly what they figured out.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   Interesting. Well, I don't know if you guys remember when everyone started blogging, we had to, you know,
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   install a server and then you get dog or something and your site will go down.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   It was a pain. You don't want to deal with all that stuff.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   So the I have the patent number here, John. Anyway, Squarespace dot com slash twit.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   And somebody in our chat room has put up a Valley Wag article.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   I always go to Valley Wag for the most trenchant. Yeah, yeah, that's that's where I go for my facts.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   Patent comment and especially enjoy the tinfoil hat. I don't know what's going on here.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   But but but apparently there is a funny looking article.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   Apparently there is a there is a patent. Yeah.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   And the number is six million two hundred sixty nine thousand three hundred sixty one. Thank you. Web six three seven.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   Can I do a big product product call out? Yes.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   Because the reason I didn't get up to Sonoma was because I went to a camera swap meet in Hayward.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   How fun. Yeah, my daughter thinks I'm a complete nerd.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   So so I the reason was because I was looking for this lens, which I got,
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   which this is one of the new this is the new. Do you love your EP one?
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   You love that camera. I find it's a great travel camera.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   I'm really interested. It's a little pricey. It's a three quarters frame. Right.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   No, it's four thirds. I mean, four thirds.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   Wait a minute. Four thirds. They don't have a mirror in it.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   So that allows them to have a little more room. And so they have these adapters.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   This is what's cool about that. I think this is the adapter for the thing.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   It's a so you could put a Leica lens on it or anything on it.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   Right. This lets me use an O.M. one lens. Oh, I love that.
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   I'm so I tracked down this guy here, which at the swap meet this very small 50 millimeter O.M.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   one basic how fast focus less.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   But this is the one that says made in Japan. The outside is extremely famous lens.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   Yeah. So I got it for 20 bucks. Whoa. Wow.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   So I put it on here and I took some sample photos and holy crap.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   I mean, this thing you're making me want this camera. This is not an ad, folks.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   This is just no, I'm just as a product review.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   Then the review is the camera, you know, cameras, a great little camera.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   But the product review is for this cheap lens that you can buy a camera swap meets because nobody wants a film camera.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   The O.M. one was, I think, one of the best film cameras ever.
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   Yeah, it's a great camera. It's all tremendous.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   So this little lens, by the way. So what you do with a camera like this is you set it to aperture only.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   And then you set whatever you want for your aperture on the lens. You do have to auto.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   You have to focus it. I was going to say because it's a manual lens.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   You can't. It doesn't do all the electronic stuff. Right.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   Well, yeah, it's a lot of it was an auto focus lens on those old cameras, not on this.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   So essentially, but when you put it on a for aperture, then you just set your aperture to what you want.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   Typically eight. And then you can just focus it and shoot.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   And this is in the camera itself will adjust the shutter speed so you get the exact right.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   I might have to get this camera because my wife is one of those people who's a film buff, has an old has an old Olympus that she loves and would be, I think, very interested in moving.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   Oh, yeah, because with this camera, you can put all those old lenses.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   Yeah, this guarantees my wife will actually watch the show. My wife's a photographer.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   So now I can tell her, look, Dvorak talks about this really funny thing.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   So you got to listen to to tweet this episode. We're going to do a Derek story.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   He was a photographer, was on the the geek cruise with me, also has a EP one and is going to we're going to do a whole show on it because it's really a neat camera.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   I mean, they're not cheap, though, right. They're like 800 bucks.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   No, I think if you shop around, you get for the high sixes.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   That's not too bad. No, it's not cheap.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   But it's a really well, it's not a it's not a cheap camera.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   There's a really it's actually it's all metal and it's it's a rugged camera.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   I dropped it on a cement floor already. That's a loner, though, right?
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   Is it yours or is it a loner? That's I'm borrowing it for the moment.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   So who cares? Drop it all you. Well, I didn't do anything.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   There's like there's like a small nick. It was astonishing.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   Any other camera been shattered. Yeah.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   It's kind of like the MacBook Pro with the unibody.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   I'm angling, for one. Oh, good. Will MySpace become My Video Game Space?
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   Poor MySpace. You know, I just got talking to products.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   I just Clarion sent me their new GPS, which is has built in Wi-Fi.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   And the idea is that this thing is going to be kind of a GPS and a little computer.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   It's got an atom processor in it.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   And but the sad thing is they must have designed it a few years ago because,
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   yeah, it's got Wi-Fi so you can get weather and other stuff.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   And it it you can get on MySpace with it.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   Yeah. Oh, wow. What's the market for that?
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   So I'm thinking, well, they must have designed it like, you know, there's a cycle.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   I probably designed it a few years ago when that would have been a good thing.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   No, I thought, oh, maybe it has Twitter. No.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   Facebook. No. Friend feed. MySpace. Anyway, MySpace integration.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   What is happening to MySpace? Are they going to survive, Pete?
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   MySpace is in a really difficult situation strategically.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   You know, one of the problems with these social networks is that you know,
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   we saw the same thing with Friendster where it suddenly becomes uncool for whatever reason.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   There's a better option, you know, and by the same way that, you know,
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   you go where all your friends are, all your friends move.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   This is Exodus, which has happened from MySpace.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   I don't understand, frankly, Pete, why this didn't happen years ago.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   That's the most ugly, dysfunctional.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   There wasn't really an amazing alternative. I mean, Facebook's come a long way.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   I guess not. But it was MySpace is discussed every time I look at it.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   It's just the worst. MySpace made LiveJournal look good.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   Yeah, it made GeoCities look good.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   Plus, it's just there's so much crap on there. And, you know,
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   my son uses it, my foot, my 15 year old uses it.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   And I don't know why, but I guess it's because as you said, his friends are there.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   Maybe he likes to collect animated GIFs.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   There's definitely a demographic.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   You know, it's the same myopia that you were saying on that we have,
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000]   or at least we have this different lens that we know that Facebook is very much
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   kind of college kids, people like us, people in tech.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   And, you know, maybe we have a slightly different perspective on it
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   because we know the demographics of using MySpace are kind of more minority
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   or, you know, just a completely different cultural and social setup
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   to the sites that we use. So I think, you know, maybe we're not seeing it.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   But by the same token, no one disagrees that MySpace is kind of in decay.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   What would you do if you were going to save them in this new thing to become a gaming?
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   This is actually not a bad idea.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   So the idea is they're going to start becoming a video game portal.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   This is Jonathan Miller's brilliant idea.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   Yeah. So, you know, he's saying they want to become a video gaming platform.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   And it's true that nobody has really taken that market yet.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   I mean, where do you go if you want to play games socially?
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:30.000]   What is the YouTube of gaming?
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   Yahoo! Games.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   Right. So there's obviously an open opportunity.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:42.000]   I think this is the kind of gaming we're talking about, you know, not the kind of the Xbox kind of market,
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   but the more online gaming. It's a huge market.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   There's money in it because you can, you know, get people to pay for these things
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   in a way that's not necessarily gambling.
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:59.000]   So and remember MySpace, I started covering MySpace years ago, like maybe three years ago
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   when they were doing kind of gaming things and they were actually,
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   they had this kind of partnership thing where you could play games with your friends.
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   It didn't really work out.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   My kid plays like the Mob Wars games and stuff like that.
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   These are kind of asynchronous, almost move based games.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   They're not very exciting and yet they're kind of compelling social games.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   Is it that kind of game that you think they'll do?
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   I think they're going to do flash games, but I haven't.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   Like hearts.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   I haven't been through the whole story, but I think if the story is they're going to do flash gaming,
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   I think there's definitely a market for that.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   I think Facebook, unfortunately, is already getting some traction there
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   because it's got the app platform.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   There's not that many ways to get your games.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   This is a dumb idea.
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   What's your idea for saving MySpace?
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   You can't. It's too late.
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   Well, I think what they have to do, for what? Let's start with what they can do.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   Can I just point out though, they have 125 million users.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   And nothing so recently they were dominant in the music,
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   or at least we perceive them to be dominant in the music space,
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:07.000]   where if you're a band, you're creating MySpace page, you go and push your MySpace URL.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   And some people still think they're salvageable, although we put out stats,
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   I think it was maybe last week saying they're losing in music and entertainment now as well,
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   that market's kind of going away from MySpace as well.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   This is what I think the mistake is.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   You don't jump from one thing to something crazy like MyVideo games.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   It's too different. You're going to lose all of it.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   You're starting from zero.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   They were the dominant factor, and I don't see anybody that's really replaced them in this music scene thing.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   And what they should do is ask their users what they can do to improve their situation,
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   make the thing more appealing, and maybe push the music thing even more so they just own it.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   I agree with you. I think that's the opportunity.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   I don't think jumping around like this is nuts.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   Well, start a gaming site and call it MySpace Games.
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   You don't have to change what you've got.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   They've already done that in the past. It didn't work too well.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   Oh, what did they do?
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   I don't recall, but they definitely had casual gaming.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   By the way, I'm just reading through this.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   It's not really clear on whether they're going to be doing casual gaming or not.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   I think I'm with John. It's possible to salvage the music thing.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   Oh, I think everyone agrees that it's possible to...
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   The music is their only remaining core. It was always their core.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   It's why they were started in the first place.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   Facebook has absolutely no play there, and they should by now.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   They're kind of lagging on that. There was obviously... I liked to cooperate really quickly.
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   People who use Facebook are too old.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   They should just do a social network for music, which is...
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   So labels... I mean, the great thing is that they did was they let indie artists skip the whole...
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   They let them basically give the finger to the music industry and say, "You know what? Forget you.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   We're going to go up. We're going to put our music for free or some of it for sale on MySpace,
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   and we're going to show you when our events are and when you can come see us,
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   and we're going to make money on it." And you know what?
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   We'd rather do that than sell out to the music industry and let them give us pennies on every piece of music we make.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   If they kept pushing that culture and keep doing that and let the big artists come in if they want,
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   I mean, they've still got a wide open field ahead of them.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   I agree, but here's another thing that's completely missing from the model,
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   which is where is the publication that is part of MySpace that helps people find the music on the site?
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   I mean, if I wanted to look at new bands of a certain ilk that I like to listen to...
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   Oh, no. You can't do that.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   I couldn't find one on MySpace unless I knew the name of the group to begin with.
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   They don't help these people at all. There's no marketing angle.
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   And there's also... It's a very poorly designed site. They've never gotten out in front of that.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   They've never built a good search. They've never built a good directory.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   And there's no excuse for as long as they've been around that they haven't done that.
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   And so for all the problems that they're having, they really deserve them because these are things they should have solved.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   It's the worst platform ever.
[00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000]   Well, I think they're almost in a position that's harder than new players coming into the market
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   because not only do they... They have this challenge where they've had this horrible code base.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   They are essentially having to...
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   People who start from scratch almost have more opportunity to define the space.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   I think MySpace is just really going to struggle here.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   Music is, I think we all agree, the direction they need to go in.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   You know what? They've got so many... They've got baggage.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   I think that's the word I'm looking for with this horrible code base.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   We all think it's horrible.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   If a new player came into the music space, we'd give them a chance.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   MySpace, we're kind of already against it.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   So I think they've got a lot of baggage right here.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   There's also a huge security issue which has yet to explode in their face.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   But I think any day now, the security flaws on that site,
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   the number of unsophisticated users, mostly kids who are using it,
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   it could be a vector for a horrible infection.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   Do you mean like cross-site scripting?
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000]   That was the biggest issue they suffered because you can essentially put your own code in there.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   Exactly.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   But that was why it took off in the first place.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   They had this system. So they almost, in a way, defined this whole...
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   What we now have is APIs and very structured and hey, developers can build stuff.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   They did that way before where they...
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   Paste arbitrary code in your profile.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   Well, they say it was accidental, that it was actually a security issue,
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   but for whatever reason, this widget thing sprung up and we had sites like Slide.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   Remember Slide came up. We had ImageShack. We had Photobucket.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.000]   All these sites built on the top and it was kind of like the first version of what we now have with the Twitter API
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   where there's just thousands of applications.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   So that was both a blessing and a curse because you had this huge security hole,
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   which still hasn't really been solved.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   And then you also have this idea that people could just paste code that made a theme.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   And then we have this issue where you're going to have to take that feature away because people hate that.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   They think they go to the pages and they're slow loading and they're ugly and they have all these animated GIFs.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   So then they have to backtrack. Now they've tried to make clean profile pages,
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   but they don't want to take away the features they've already given to the users who really like those pages.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   So that's where all the baggage comes from.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   There's all these users who want the features that aren't going to work going forwards
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   and how can you keep them on board but change it dramatically?
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   They're screwed.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   I think they're in a difficult position.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   You know what happened with Friendstone?
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   And these were the guys that were before them.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   They went in a different direction.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   Friendstone reportedly is doing quite well, but outside of any of the markets that we ever cover,
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   so nobody knows about it, I think.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   They'll probably go off on a tangent.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   Maybe they'll bring back with the music thing.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   They've obviously peaked unless they can really turn around this music thing and do something huge.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   But iTunes has just deleted that.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]   It is interesting because there is this network effect.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   And so Friendster, solely because everybody in the Philippines uses it,
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   can become a success in the Philippines or could, because everybody uses it in Brazil,
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   can become a success in Brazil and there's this kind of localized network effect.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   Yeah, but it can keep a site alive long after everybody...
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   In terms of the MySpace complaints that I keep hearing, which just seem to be technical,
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   why can't they use two code bases?
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   I mean, there's no reason they have everything running on the same code base.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   They could start from scratch.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   God knows Murdoch's got enough money to say hire a hundred good programmers and start from scratch.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   Yeah, dude, second code base, have them run in parallel,
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   and as people start slowly abandoning the old one for the new,
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   they have the same URLs, it wouldn't make any difference.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   That can all be dealt with and then you just pull the plug on the old one.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   By the way, I don't think MySpace is going to do the same thing as...
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   Oh, the chat room wants us to move on.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   I don't think MySpace is going to do the same thing as Friendster and go into other markets.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   They don't have any real significant international reach.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   Facebook has the international reach there.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   I mean, if you're right here in the UK, people are using Facebook.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   They've sort of been transitioning from Bebo, which was very big.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   MySpace was big as well.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   Is Bebo losing ground?
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   Oh, it's just not a player.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   I mean, after the AOL acquisition, that was pretty much...
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   People just started a whole exodus from Bebo to Facebook.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   Facebook is the dominant platform.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   I just saw 300 million in this article.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   300 million users now.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   Unbelievable.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   Of course, there are more... I was just reading this statistic.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   There are more internet users in China, John, than there are people in the US.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   Yeah. Why can't we find some way to sell them something?
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   338 million.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   That's what everyone said.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   Oh, we opened the Chinese market.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   I remember hearing this years ago.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   When the Chinese market is so good, all we have to do is sell every Chinese person one pair of shoelaces,
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   and we make all this money.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   Meanwhile, they ended up... Yeah, it opened up all right, and they ended up selling us everything.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   We never sold them anything. We got ripped off.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   They're smarter than us, John. That's the truth.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   So are we ready to talk about the Palm Pre thing that Palm Sink did?
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   Yeah, this is an interesting story.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   So when Palm actually...
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   I mean, John Rubenstein said this.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   He said, "And among our other features, when Palm first announced the Pre, it will sync with iTunes,"
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000]   which I thought was a very bold thing to say.
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   Remember, Rubenstein used to work on the iPhone team at Apple.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   In fact, most of the Pre folks did.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   So when the Pre ships, first thing I did when I got my review unit is plug it in.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   Sure enough, it shows up on iTunes.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   It says it's a Pre, and I can synchronize it.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   I thought, "Does Apple... Are they... Is this licensed?"
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   Apparently, they found out.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   Apparently not licensed. I think that's the thing is that apparently Palm did this.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   They didn't license iTunes, and they synced it.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   They sort of did it, you know, said, "Hey, it made it look like an iPod."
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   Now, it doesn't sync anything with DRM, but obviously, or anything I think bought in the store,
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:46.000]   you know, so you can burn your CDs and stuff and then sync those.
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   But what's interesting, and there's an angle that I'm trying to follow on this story,
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   so I was hoping we'd talk about it, is that BlackBerry does the same thing.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   BlackBerry desktop software syncs with iTunes.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.000]   So I'm trying to dig this up, like, "Okay, did BlackBerry actually license it?"
[01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   Because they're not trying to shut BlackBerry down.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   Well, why would Apple, who is trying to survive against BlackBerry,
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   who's, you know, the Palm, the Pre is completely aimed at the iPhone,
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   why would Apple cooperate in any way?
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   No, wait a minute, what are you thinking there, Leo?
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   I thought, my impression is that Apple would be more concerned about Pre,
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   because Pre came out as a, you know, targeting Apple.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   I think BlackBerry's shown no ability to go against the...
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   Oh, that's not true at all. It's the number one smartphone.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   You know, I realize it's the number one smartphone, but it's not,
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   but I think that market is discrepant.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   I think there's a different type of target.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   I think there's a different type of user.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   I don't think it's the same person.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   Yeah, all right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   I mean, I could be wrong.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000]   No, you have a point. I think it probably is.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   In fact, after reading this account of the hacker who said,
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000]   "By the way, the iPhone is completely insecure. It doesn't encrypt the data.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   As soon as you log in, your data is fully unencrypted.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   It's completely inappropriate for enterprise use."
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   I'm sorry, somebody in the chat room said that what the difference is,
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   is that somebody, BlackBerry, made software that communicates with iTunes,
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   whereas Palm Pre made the Palm Pre look like an iPod.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   So it's taken a different approach.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   Well, Apple ships iTunes 8.2.1 this week, and it stopped syncing.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   Palm makes a very interesting change.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   In fact, Palm complains to the USB folks, whoever this is.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000]   The USB, the working group that does the USB?
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   Yeah.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.000]   Saying that Apple's acting inappropriately here,
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   that you can't block an individual USB user.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   You either allow people to use it or not.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000]   You can't say, "Well, is it a Pre? Well, forget it."
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000]   Then meanwhile, Palm comes back and solved, by the way,
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   completely reverses the block by announcing itself as an iPod.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   They modified the Palm software. They shipped out an upgrade to the Pre.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   Okay. Well, is that any different than the early versions of Opera
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   telling the servers that it was minus of IE?
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   Well, you're not supposed to do it.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   According to these rules, whoever these USB people are,
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   because you have IDs and stuff and they assign an ID,
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   you're supposed to identify as who you are.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   So the Palm Pre now says, "I'm an iPod."
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   Although the USB, but it's not over yet because somebody's pointed out
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   that the USB hub still identifies as a Pre.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   So iTunes may come back with 822 looking at that,
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   and Palm will have to change that.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000]   So we're in a little shooting war here.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   It sounds like fun.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   I like it.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   I mean, you got to like a company that's going to stand up to Apple.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   Well, and what's best? I mean, I'm going to assume everyone's kind of
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000]   supporting Palm to some degree here.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   What's best for the consumer?
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000]   Exactly.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000]   Do you want integration between these things or don't you?
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   Of course you do. So it's kind of anti-consumer by Apple.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   Apple obviously always like this bubble.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   They don't want anyone else kind of, they say,
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   "Oh, we're trying to maintain the consumer experience.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   We don't want people ruining the experience.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000]   What if this Palm breaks?"
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000]   That's going to reflect badly on us.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   But really it's about, you know, protecting their asset and--
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000]   It's a monopoly.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   Let's say the M word. It's a monopoly.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000]   Pre-M word.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000]   Yeah.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.000]   So what's the real root of this story is we're all kind of rooting for Palm
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000]   and hoping that they're going to keep fighting that battle.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000]   Let me defend Apple in this thing.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000]   It's my understanding that from the get-go,
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   even though Apple makes a lot of money and they have a lot of downloads,
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   is that the whole orientation, it was a razor blade scheme to begin with,
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   and it was actually iTunes that was the lost leader designed to sell more hardware,
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000]   their expensive phone and the iPod, both high margin items.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   So now some interloper comes along and takes advantage of the lost leader.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   In other words, you know, they're losing money by running the service in the first place,
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   and they don't want them on there.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   It's just like there's money out of their pockets. It's ridiculous.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   I don't blame Apple for being upset about this.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   Palm says that Apple should not be allowed to set iTunes to respond only to devices with the Apple USB codes,
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   and so they have gone to the USB implementers forum to complain.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   However, the USB implementers forum says a vendor ID used by a product
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.000]   must match the ID code of the company producing the product. Palm is not doing that.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000]   They're saying, "No, I'm an iPod."
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   Yeah, I think Palm's strategy is really flawed here.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   I mean, they really, anything they do with this, they're really reinforcing sort of Apple's position in the market.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   And they can't win in the long run, can they?
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   And they cannot win. No, exactly.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   Well, they could win in the EU if somebody cracked down on it.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000]   That's true. That's true.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000]   But I mean, they really just need to come up with their own software that pulls in,
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:02.000]   just use their desktop sync software, pull in like the MP3 store from Amazon, pull in AAC files.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   You can get AAC files. These files are unlocked now.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   They don't have DRM locking them down.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   You can take those files and pull them onto the Palm Pre and play it in their software.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   It'd be a much better move for them just to create some really good desktop software that pulls the stuff in.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000]   It's kind of childish, to be honest with you.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000]   It is. It is.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000]   It's kind of an odd thing for a company to do.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   We can do it. We can sync.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   And it's not that important really for the functionality of the Pre, let's face it.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000]   Yep.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000]   I don't think they need to do it.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   Let's see here.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:48.000]   iPhone will not be exclusive forever, says AT&T CEO, kind of admitting to the world that AT&T isn't going to be able to own this phone forever.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   In fact, Verizon's CEO is kind of intimating that they're going to have the iPhone soon.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   And now we're seeing from Apple Insider what they say is we believe, given our source, that this is absolutely true, that the Apple tablet has been approved for the first quarter of 2010.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   Maybe this will be a device that ships on the Verizon platform. Verizon's pushing its new 4G.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000]   The tablet?
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   Yeah, a 10-inch.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   The one, the big old thing you get to hold up to your ear? Hello? You get the dial on it?
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000]   I don't think it'll be a phone. I hope not.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   Here we go again.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:29.000]   I hope not. I think it's supposed to be a computing device, but maybe not. I don't know.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   How about this story, by the way? Skype singled out a threat to Russia's security. Did you do that one?
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   I throw those in so I can use my Russian accent. That's the only reason.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   Ah, fantastic.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   It's all I do. I look for a story that says Russia. Russia's most powerful business lobby moved to clamp down on Skype and its peers this week, telling lawmakers Internet phone services are a threat to Russian business and national security.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   How is this? What's their logic?
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   This makes no sense. You know, the former world champion of chess, Gary Kasparov, who's become a very political, in fact, ran for president in Russia, he said, "If it weren't for Skype, I'd be in jail right now." He said, "Whatever the modern equivalent of the KGB taps all my calls. I only use Skype because of the encryption."
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000]   They're looking for his moves.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:37.000]   It's not safe out there. It's dangerous. With government without government restrict. This is really crazy. This is crackpot. Without government restrictions, IP telephony, they say, causes certain concerns about security.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:48.000]   Most of the service operators working in Russia, such as Skype and ICQ, are foreign. It's therefore necessary to protect the native companies in this sector and so forth.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:14:01.000]   I don't know. I kind of wonder if there's something under the surface going on here. I mean, Russia has a lot of serious hackers and cracking rings tied to the mafia. They have a really bad organized crime problem.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:11.000]   I don't know. I kind of wonder if maybe this is about, you know, trying to keep those, you know, those organized crime rings from getting out of the...
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000]   Maybe. Maybe they know something we don't know. Yeah.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000]   That's a possibility.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:29.000]   Speaking of communications and security, can we do our daily Twitter segment, weekly Twitter segment, the Twitter app that someone created for Twitch skips past?
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000]   Sure.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000]   Because we haven't mentioned the T word at all.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   No, I've...
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   Yay!
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000]   We're doing really well.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:39.000]   John, it makes me nervous to mention the T word with John in the house.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   Well, now I have to say the real devour, ladies and gentlemen, go ahead. I'm trying to get my numbers up a little bit, but they just seem to be stagnant.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000]   A lot of people lost followers this week as Twitter clobbered some spam.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:15:07.000]   Yeah, there was a big drop. We had a couple of stories on that and just crazy amounts of people piling in and I think like a thousand comments on the stories about, you know, obviously people seem to really watch that number and, you know, be kind of offended that they lost 20 followers.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000]   That wasn't the story I was going to pick up on actually.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000]   What is the story you want to talk about, Pete?
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.000]   It was that you put in this Twitter ban from the White House story.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:40.000]   Ah, yes. Well, of course, the White House has a Twitter account, as does Barack Obama. They use it for PR, publicity and so forth. However, I don't know how exactly they're posting. According to Read Write Web, Robert Gibbs, the press secretary, mentioned casually to CNN that Twitter is blocked on official White House computers.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]   Well, that's censorship.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000]   That's censorship. How dare they?
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.000]   Now, censorship, it's horrible.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000]   If I was running the White House, I'd block Twitter.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000]   I would as well.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   You know, I'm supposed to be the social media guy.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:16:01.000]   Everybody's a big talker about the Internet and all this and then you want to block stuff left or right, but if the Chinese do it, oh my God, they can't put up with that.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:06.000]   I don't see the value out here of using Twitter in the White House. I mean, all it's going to do is leak stuff.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:12.000]   If you're the individual to make the decision, you can fire somebody, monitor them, but I think blocking is a bad thing.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:18.000]   Now, that's true. That's a good. You just have a policy. Maybe it's better to just have the policy and say, look, if you do it, we're going to fire you.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.000]   A lot of businesses block social networks, not for security.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   They block Dvorak Uncensored, for God's sake.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000]   You're blocked in China, by the way. You're blocked in China. I couldn't get to your site in China.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000]   You didn't even try.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000]   I was so going with withdrawal. It was so tough.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:37.000]   71% of IT departments block social networking.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.000]   You bet. Not because of security. Because it's a time sink.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000]   It's censorship.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   No, it's a time sink. I block Twitter here at the cottage.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   I think that's different, though. I think if you're at a business, then all your employees can be a marketing service.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:57.000]   If you've got all your employees with a good Twitter policy that are saying, hey, I'm working on this awesome new project, service we've got coming out,
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.000]   then you can get people really engaged with your business. It's a marketing channel.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   White House doesn't really, in my opinion, need all its staff to be marketers for White House.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000]   I'm against all censorship.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:15.000]   I agree with John, though. Do it as a policy. Don't block it. Do it as a policy.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:24.000]   Here's the funny thing. According to Mitch Kapoor, they're doing the same thing that people in China do.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:29.000]   The White House staffers are using their iPhones and they're getting around the block.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000]   They're using IMs?
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000]   Well, they use iPhones to any of the Twitter apps. They don't go to the website.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000]   Oh, right. You go to the Twitter app on the phone.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000]   Yeah, you use Tweety and it just goes right out.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:48.000]   It's the same problem they had in China. I was able to get onto a lot of these sites even though they were blocked just by using iPhone apps.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:54.000]   I found most of the propaganda about China. You drive around and everyone's got a dish network dish.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:00.000]   Oh, absolutely. But I was watching CNN and as soon as they started talking about the Uyghur rebellion, it goes black.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000]   Oh, you actually caught that.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.000]   Oh, yeah. For two minutes it's black and then it comes back when the next story's on.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.000]   Oh, they're pretty aggressive about blocking.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000]   What hotel were you at?
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.000]   Raffles. And then the Sofitel in Xi'an. Same thing happened.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:20.000]   But these are Western hotels for Westerners and they still do it.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.000]   But you're right. Everybody has a dish. I was in the countryside. These people raise kumquats.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000]   They make their own tofu to make a little extra money on the side in the local market.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:34.000]   And they've got a 50 inch HDTV with a satellite dish in their house.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:39.000]   That's pretty wild. Even people internationally. I have some friends that are Iranian in the U.S. here.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   And they have satellite dishes that pick up all the Iranian satellite channels here in the U.S.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   That's amazing.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   They watch all of the channels. Now, some of them come from Iran.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000]   Some of them are broadcast from L.A. and London and places like that.
[01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000]   But it's pretty wild. It's just a different world.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:03.000]   Well, actually, if you get a hold of the Dish Network folks, they actually have international plans that they don't advertise much.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:08.000]   Because I know some of them. It's all Dish Network. It's on their menu and the whole thing. All Russian TV.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000]   Oh, I loved it. It's good. I'm going to get that.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000]   I'll make some dubs for you.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000]   Will you please? I need to practice accent.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:20.000]   I think, you know, one key thing and you say it sends a shit is OK, sure, there's a risk of leaking.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000]   But what about kind of consuming information?
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.000]   I mean, you were saying, Leo, that you're using Twitter to read your news and consume content.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:36.000]   It's true. It's true. And it's an argument that at least on at least on the inbounds, you're going to get a lot more value out of something like Twitter than reading RSS.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000]   You're going to be a lot more clued in.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.000]   I think there's that argument on the inbound. Yeah, this certainly should be reading Twitter.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:46.000]   I think you got to grow. You got to grow up. You got to assume your staffers, adults.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:50.000]   And this is to block something is absurd. That's just absurd.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.000]   That's treating them like kids. It means you don't trust your people. Yeah, I'm sorry. That's ridiculous.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:00.000]   Yeah, you should spy on them instead. Yeah, we can see what you're doing.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000]   We don't have to. We don't have to block anything.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.000]   Let's take a little time out. If you want to go base your meat, John, you may you may do so.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000]   Is this a euphemism? I hear this in every show.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:16.000]   It all started with John. It's become a euphemism.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000]   It's a euphemism. No, I cook.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000]   He literally it's Sunday afternoon when we record the show.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:26.000]   John frequently is making pulled pork or some other fine roast.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:31.000]   So why can't we just have this at Dvorak's house and have dinner?
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000]   I agree. I think, John, we should be going over there.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000]   And what are you cooking tonight? Are you cooking?
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   I'm just doing some flank steak. But you know, doing a pulled pork would be a good.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:46.000]   The problem is it's the timing on pulled pork. It's like takes 12 to 14 hours, sometimes 16 to make this.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:51.000]   Now, flank steak is a fantastic cut, but it can be a little chewy. Do you tenderize?
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:55.000]   No, what you do flank steak is a simple thing to cook. I actually had a recipe that I posted when I used to.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000]   It's very lean. It's very healthy for you. Yeah, it's very tasty. Oh, I love it.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:04.000]   But it's essentially you have to cook it over extremely high heat, very short period of time.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.000]   And you marinate it for a very short period, about 20 minutes max with it.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:12.000]   And what the easiest one I've tried a lot of different things, but for people out there who want to catch this recipe,
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:17.000]   you take a flank steak and you soak it in of all things. This is the best. Believe me.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:22.000]   Kikkoman soy sauce, the one that's made in the United States, it's soy based, the tender.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:27.000]   It's actually a tenderizing product. And you soak the meat in that for about 20 minutes at the most.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.000]   And if you over soak it, it will cook the meat because it's so salty.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:38.000]   And then you get a really hot barbecue going about. You definitely have to have the thing blazing.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000]   So it's around 800, 900 degrees on the surface temperature.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:46.000]   And you throw the flank steak on there, cook it on each side rather quickly for about two or three minutes.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000]   You get the hang of it after you do about two or three of them.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.000]   And then you make the sideways cut. You do it. You cut it at an angle with the unit.
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000]   You have the grain going across and the grain goes this way.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:01.000]   Because it won't have flank steak curl. You don't have the curling problem.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:07.000]   It won't curl if you do it this way. And also that membrane is broken down by the soy sauce.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:11.000]   Throw it on through the three, three and a half minutes on each side, bang, bang, bang.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.000]   The thing is the most unbelievable cut of meat. And they're always available.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.000]   There's only two of them on a steer, but they're always available because nobody knows how to cook them.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.000]   If you don't know what you're doing, they will be horribly tough.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000]   Tough and dry and horrible. Yeah.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000]   So fast cooking, marinate and keep them on for 20 minutes.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, there's our recipe of the day.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000]   Thanks to John C. DeVora.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000]   I love this show.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000]   Munchcast.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000]   You can go listen to your buzz out loud.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.000]   You can go watch your news on TV, but nowhere are you going to get a flank steak recipe.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000]   No other tech programming will give you that.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000]   He's on those shows.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000]   No.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000]   Especially on those shows. They eat burgers, those people.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.000]   No other show will give you this quality content.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:57.000]   The good folks at Citrix are our sponsors and I want to mention their product.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000]   GoToMeeting right now.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000]   We use GoToMeeting on a couple of our other shows. Maxwell's House, for instance.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   He does it for screenshots.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:09.000]   GoToMeeting is designed to make online meetings.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:14.000]   Every bit is good. Every bit is effective. Every bit is compelling as the in-person meeting.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000]   You know, we were talking the other day.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:22.000]   I think it's probably good when you first have a new client or the first time you meet them in person.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:28.000]   But after that, who can afford to fly across country to meet with clients or even just drive across town?
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000]   Time, money, stress.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:40.000]   And why worry about the costs of business travel when you can save money, do more, travel less with GoToMeeting.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:44.000]   GoToMeeting. So easy to set up. Just go there right now.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.000]   GoToMeeting.com/twit for your 30-day free trial before I'm done talking.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000]   You're going to have it installed.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:57.000]   Now the next time you need to meet with a client or a colleague, you just say, "Hey, go to GoToMeeting.com.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000]   Here's the meeting ID."
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000]   Suddenly they're seeing your screen on their desktop.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000]   They can see your PowerPoint presentations or your keynote.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000]   It's Mac, too.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000]   Your websites, your notes.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.000]   You can work together on a spreadsheet, collaborate on documents.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000]   It's real time, too.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000]   I've actually used it to rehearse.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.000]   We had a speech I was doing with three other guys, and it was a very fast-paced speech.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.000]   We had to go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000]   They had it all in PowerPoint.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.000]   They had written it.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000]   I had never seen it before.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000]   We rehearsed using GoToMeeting in real time.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000]   It was incredible.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000]   This thing really works.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000]   Brought to you by the folks at Citrix.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000]   So you know it's secure.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000]   You know it's fast.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.000]   You know it's going to work.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:46.000]   And I'll tell you, the day you save $300 on a plane ticket is the day you realize how
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.000]   affordable GoToMeeting is at $49 a month for as many meetings as you want, as long as you
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000]   want.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000]   But try it free right now for 30 days.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:57.000]   Go to GoToMeeting.com/twit.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:02.000]   G-O-T-O-Meeting.com/twit.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:06.000]   From the great folks at Citrix, we thank them so much for their support of this week in
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.000]   tech.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:12.000]   So we've had now in the last month two, count them two, false positives in antiviruses.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000]   And the most recent is a nasty one.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000]   Computer Associates Antivirus.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000]   I hope nobody's using that.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:27.000]   Had a false positive that if you're running it, and this was the latest version updated,
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000]   it would warn of an infection, quarantine the files.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000]   The files turned out to be critical Windows system files.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:37.000]   As soon as it did that, boom, your system crashed.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.000]   That's it.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.000]   It's over.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.000]   I love these stories.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:41.000]   What a piece of crap.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000]   Thanks for your help.
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:43.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000]   What a piece of...
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.000]   I actually related that.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.000]   I covered a story on, I think it was Friday, AVG.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000]   Another false positive.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:26:00.000]   Had a huge issue because AVG is a big, big, very, very popular antivirus software.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000]   And it was identifying iTunes as a driver's license.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:08.000]   So it would pick out all these iTunes files and then you'd go, okay, let's quarantine
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.000]   those.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.840]   And then you try and use iTunes and obviously it won't work because you've just quarantined
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:14.760]   a bunch of the files that iTunes requires to work.
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:16.000]   I think they've issued a patch.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.000]   I think if you go and update AVG now, which is they updated their virus definitions, they
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000]   included iTunes files for no particular reason.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000]   People say, oh my goodness, have I got an iTunes trojan?
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000]   And obviously...
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000]   CA has a patch too.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.000]   That one's slightly less annoying than the one that you just mentioned, which essentially
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000]   sounds like it just end of world scenario.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.000]   End of the world, yeah.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000]   I swear.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000]   I'm a big fan of AVG.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:44.000]   No, I think probably, I would bet you most of our audience, more than half of our audience
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000]   uses it because it's free.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.000]   Yeah.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.000]   If you can find it free.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.000]   I mean, it's free.grisoft.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000]   That's right.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000]   Free.grisoft.com.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000]   I used to use it, yeah.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000]   You know what?
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000]   I don't mind spending 30 bucks for a good antivirus, to be honest with you.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.000]   I don't mind it either, but I don't like them getting on my machine and then reminding me
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.000]   for the rest of my life that knew it or they interrupt me.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000]   That's Norton.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.000]   I hate Norton.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000]   I use non-32.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.000]   One of the best ones was actually OneCare, Microsoft OneCare, and they got rid of it.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000]   Well, no, but now they're going to...
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000]   And this is the interesting thing.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000]   All these companies are going to be out of business because they're going to give it away.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000]   If you're going to get Microsoft in a couple of months, you're going to get free security
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.000]   suite from Microsoft.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000]   I'm glad you brought that up because some people are talking about this.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000]   This is an antitrust thing, although they're going to offer it as a free download.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000]   So it's like, I don't really hope we don't hear any of that crap because it's like, okay,
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.000]   so Microsoft is going to fix its own product, build something in they should have done a
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:46.000]   long time ago and make it more user-friendly security features.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.000]   And they're going to get sued for doing that, for putting people out of business.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.420]   If you're a virus, antivirus maker and you made a product, you've always known that someday
[01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:56.760]   Microsoft could include this in the system.
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:59.000]   You took that risk when you became an antivirus.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:04.540]   You've been lucky all this time that Microsoft was screwing up so bad and didn't bother to
[01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:05.540]   fix it.
[01:28:05.540 --> 01:28:11.000]   You know, Leo, this is a great transition to your story that you bookmarks about machines
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.000]   taking over the world.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000]   Okay.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:17.600]   And there was actually some good points in that article.
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:21.600]   So I can't remember where the article is, I haven't got it up, but basically it was,
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:25.880]   you know, that people are, there's been meetings about seriously considering this possibility.
[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:29.240]   Well, you know, this has been the stuff of, yeah, this has been the stuff of sci-fi, you
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:30.840]   know, the Terminator and all that.
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:33.880]   But it turns out actually scientists are actually worried about this.
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:38.080]   And one of the points in that article is that, you know, there are viruses out there that
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:39.440]   are essentially like cockroaches now.
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:43.940]   We can't send them out even if we wanted to, you know, and if we get to a point where these
[01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:52.440]   viruses can mutate much like biological viruses, they're in a situation where we could have
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:58.680]   no control over these viruses and then reach a point where we have no control over actual
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:02.640]   physical hardware that's, you know, able to self-replicate.
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:08.240]   One of the things they were actually particularly worried about is autonomous killing machines.
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:12.680]   You know, right now we, the US has become more and more adept at fighting a war with
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:19.400]   these predator drones that are piloted out of a, you know, a complex in Las Vegas.
[01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:24.400]   And I think that's where we're headed, where, you know, the video game jockeys growing up
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:27.460]   today are going to end up piloting these machines.
[01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:32.720]   But autonomous machines are a little bit scary because they're not piloted.
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:35.220]   And that was something that particularly scared these scientists.
[01:29:35.220 --> 01:29:39.920]   There was a meeting of artificial intelligence researchers and roboticists at a Silimar in
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:44.000]   Monterey just recently and there's a New York Times article on it.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000]   There's always a good movie about this.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.080]   What was that movie that these guys are out in the desert and there was these autonomous
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:53.280]   things that were under the sand and they grind you up and then one of them came along, it
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:54.680]   was a robot and it was just like-
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:55.680]   Called Transformers.
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:29:56.680]   It was a fantastic movie.
[01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:57.680]   No, it wasn't Transformers.
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:04.240]   And by the way, we should always give a shout out to the classic movie, The Last Starfighter,
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:09.160]   which was a movie where the kid was a great video game player and then was recruited.
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:14.160]   And every time I see those drone guys in Vegas, you know, I'm thinking, there you go, there
[01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:15.160]   you have it.
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:16.160]   Yep.
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:17.160]   Yep.
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:18.160]   What's the difference?
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:22.080]   I think the greater concern immediately with these drones is that they just go wrong.
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:26.720]   There was a story and I think it was on another podcast called Buzz Out Loud, which is equally
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:32.880]   awesome about, you know, the problem is these, you know, you arm up these robots, they have
[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:37.480]   the exact same issues of software that we have on our machines, except when they make
[01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:39.160]   a mistake, they kill a bunch of people.
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:42.200]   And you know, that's the immediate concern that-
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:43.200]   That's life.
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:48.720]   You know, software is imperfect and we're arming up for, you know, you get a bug, it's
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:50.400]   going to kill someone.
[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:53.760]   I wanted to transition, I have no transition.
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:59.200]   I have no transition here, but you've got a story about Bill Gates quitting Facebook.
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:03.840]   He's dropped his Facebook and you had a, I actually saw this on Mashable because I followed
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:04.840]   your link to PC World.
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:07.760]   You saw it on Mashable, but you linked it to the New York Times, what's with that?
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:08.760]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:10.360]   I'll put it in the New York Times link.
[01:31:10.360 --> 01:31:13.600]   But well, the New York Times link has his, has his more from his speech.
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:15.080]   He talked about a lot of things.
[01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:16.720]   I know, I just went for the cheap.
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:21.600]   He talked about a lot of things, but I did like the fact that he said, I, I don't, I stopped
[01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:25.400]   my Facebook page because 10,000 people wanted to be my friend and I didn't know which ones
[01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:28.420]   were actual friends and which ones weren't.
[01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:29.420]   So I just-
[01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:30.420]   What?
[01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:31.420]   Screw it.
[01:31:31.420 --> 01:31:33.600]   Hey Bill, wake up.
[01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:35.360]   I can't tell which of you I know.
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:36.360]   None of them are your friends.
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:37.360]   None of them.
[01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:38.360]   You say yes.
[01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:43.040]   But PC World did a very funny parody Bill Gates Facebook thing.
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:45.940]   When I was, when I was looking through on this, I found this PC World thing and we actually
[01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:52.080]   put out a post today called Top 5 Funniest Fake Facebook Pages where I started digging
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:55.320]   into this stuff and it's actually, that was actually the funniest bit of the story was
[01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:57.320]   that PC World, no one had really seen it.
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:58.840]   It didn't get dug or anything.
[01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:03.360]   They'd created back in April, like a parody Facebook page of, you know, Bill Gates and
[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:08.120]   has like, you know, Steve Jobs saying that in your iPod, well him saying Steve Jobs that,
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:09.120]   you know-
[01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:10.120]   Well, no, no, no, get it right, get it right.
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:14.840]   Because it starts, it starts, it says Steve Jobs says, "Oh Bill, hey, remember that great
[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:16.520]   operating system you wrote?"
[01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:18.840]   Oh yeah, neither do I.
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:22.640]   And then, and then Gates respond, this is on the wall and Gates responds back says,
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:25.400]   "Yeah Bill, that iPod Nano, it looks like a tampon."
[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:26.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:30.240]   And it's just really, I mean, it's like if they had a Facebook page, this would be what
[01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:31.240]   it was like.
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:32.240]   It was very funny.
[01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:33.240]   It's brilliant.
[01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:36.240]   It's one of the top five funniest fake Facebook pages.
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:37.680]   So are these on Facebook?
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:39.400]   Because you can't really put a fake page up.
[01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:40.400]   No, they're mock-ups.
[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:42.920]   There are, you know, people in art departments who-
[01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:43.920]   So who else?
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:44.920]   What other people have Facebook?
[01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:45.920]   Fake Facebook pages.
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:46.920]   Let me go pull out the post.
[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:54.200]   I mean, there was one from, there's one for the story of Genesis, God's Facebook page.
[01:32:54.200 --> 01:33:01.360]   There's one that's Satan's Facebook page and he's just signed the Jonas Brothers for 3000
[01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:02.360]   years.
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:04.720]   There's some really good ones actually.
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:05.720]   I'm not doing-
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:06.720]   Actually that explains a lot.
[01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:12.960]   There's Obama's first 100 days from Slate, all told in kind of Facebook updates.
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:16.680]   There's Hitler's Facebook, the Steve Jobs, they didn't want to see Jobs, which is very,
[01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:17.680]   very funny.
[01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:21.240]   By the way, that's an internet meme that can die now.
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:26.440]   They use that scene, the Hitler scene from the Bruno Gans doing Hitler.
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:27.720]   Honestly, yeah.
[01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:30.360]   And then they just tie some other, you know, it's a subtitle.
[01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:33.240]   It ties like Hitler learns that Michael Jackson is dead or-
[01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:34.240]   Yeah, I suppose.
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:35.400]   I'm so sick of this meme.
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:37.080]   You can stop that now kids.
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:38.080]   No more of those.
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:39.080]   Okay.
[01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:40.320]   Here's an interesting story.
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:46.880]   For seven years, the National Transportation Safety Board has known the Highway Safety
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:52.880]   Agency, actually I should get this right, the NHTSA, the National Highway Transportation
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:58.980]   and Safety Administration has been wanting to recommend that cell phone use of all kinds
[01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:05.520]   be banned in cars because they've known since 2002 it's just as dangerous even with a hands-free
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:06.520]   unit.
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:07.520]   Yeah.
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:09.320]   That's because people can't concentrate and drive at the same time.
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:13.120]   How many times have you been down the road with somebody yacking on the phone, they're
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:16.600]   swerving all over the place and they're-
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:20.580]   There's studies galore that show that this is just as dangerous.
[01:34:20.580 --> 01:34:23.520]   This is the equivalent of having three or four drinks in you.
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:28.640]   And in fact, this report, which was suppressed, the only reason we know it's out is because
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:32.680]   public citizen in the Center for Auto Safety filed a freedom of information.
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:35.160]   Yeah, obviously somebody was paying off somebody's phone companies.
[01:34:35.160 --> 01:34:36.160]   They suppressed this.
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:37.160]   The handset makers.
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:39.760]   Actually it would have to be the cell phone companies, not those handset makers.
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:41.360]   That's who it is, it's cell phone companies.
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:46.320]   Well, I have to admit, this spring I spent some time in San Francisco and they have the
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:48.240]   ban of course in California, you can't do hands-free.
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:53.080]   I do think not having your hand on the phone, having your hand on the phone is even a more
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:54.080]   impairment.
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:56.560]   Yeah, because you can't even steer because you're on the-
[01:34:56.560 --> 01:34:57.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:02.920]   When I came back to Louisville, which is where Tech Republic's headquarters are, and I was
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:07.160]   there and I noticed I was sitting at the light my first day back at work and every freaking
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:09.240]   person is on the cell phone and I'm like, I just-
[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:10.240]   That's scary.
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:12.520]   I just felt, yeah, kind of scared.
[01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:17.080]   It was like none of these people are paying any attention to anything and they're driving
[01:35:17.080 --> 01:35:18.080]   and-
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:19.080]   Why do they need to talk so much?
[01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:20.080]   I know.
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:23.360]   Well, there's two theories.
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:26.680]   There's a conspiracy theory that the cell phone companies suppressed this report.
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:31.120]   By the way, one of the things they said in this report was that they didn't recommend
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:37.120]   state legislation requiring hands-free units because that quote may erroneously imply that
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:41.480]   hands-free phones are safe to use while driving.
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:46.840]   So they didn't even think that there should be laws banning the use of a cell phone or
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:48.200]   requiring the use of a hands-free.
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:51.760]   They said this should be banned in cars completely.
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:53.120]   Now here's just two scenarios.
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:57.520]   One that the cell phone companies got to them and said, "Hey, there's no way you're putting
[01:35:57.520 --> 01:35:58.520]   that out."
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:05.040]   The other one I think is maybe even more likely, they realized that voters would go crazy if
[01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:07.640]   anybody attempted to ban cell phone use.
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:10.240]   I'm not convinced of that second scenario and I'll tell you why.
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:14.760]   I think most of the people that are on the phone all the time are too dumb to vote and
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:18.560]   they probably have no influence and the rest of us have been scared once or twice a week
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:21.600]   by some maniac that almost kills us because they're on the cell phone.
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:22.600]   Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:23.600]   Texting people.
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:24.600]   I think it's unpopular policy though.
[01:36:24.600 --> 01:36:27.600]   I don't want to get into that.
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:30.640]   Texting's really, I mean, I've done that.
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:33.120]   I've held the steering wheel and texted with my thumb.
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:38.720]   Ever since I saw that Will Smith movie, I quit messing with my, where he's texting on
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:42.600]   his Blackberry and then he hits the other family and oh yeah, after that I was like,
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:43.760]   okay, I got to quit.
[01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:46.760]   It's very dangerous.
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:53.600]   I mean, I think legislators probably realized that it would be hideously, it would be death,
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:56.160]   political death to sponsor a bill that prevented people from using cell phones.
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.680]   They should have some guts.
[01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:04.240]   I think it would be hugely unpopular but if you're saying it's as dangerous as-
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:05.240]   It is.
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:10.800]   Not quite drunk driving but having a few drinks and clearly it's very, very popular
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:12.640]   of talking on your cell phone.
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:14.400]   What are the laws in the UK?
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:16.680]   Can you, are they required hands free?
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:19.240]   I actually can't remember.
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:21.520]   That's a good point.
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:22.520]   I can't recall.
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:26.840]   I just never, I don't have a car phone so I don't speak on the phone.
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:27.840]   So you don't do it?
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:28.840]   No.
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:29.840]   Good for you.
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:30.840]   No.
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:34.360]   But I think, you know, it's not about, it's ultimately about the right of whatever the
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:38.320]   pedestrian that could be killed or the other driver that you could crash into.
[01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:42.800]   It's rights and responsibilities thing and if this is as dangerous as the studies suggest
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:47.720]   then obviously it's not going to be popular to ban it but you know it's what you're going
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:50.920]   to do if you're going to, if a significant number of deaths happening from this.
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:52.440]   I'm going to blog about this next week.
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:54.960]   I'm on vacation but I'm still going to blog about this.
[01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:55.960]   Good.
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:58.440]   Now there's one story that before we finish I want to mention.
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:03.360]   Did anybody take a look at this PowerPoint presentation of the Microsoft store that just
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:04.360]   leaked out?
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:05.360]   Oh yes.
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:06.360]   I haven't seen this.
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:07.360]   Tell us about it John.
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:09.760]   This sounds good.
[01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:14.040]   First of all, their plan is to build stores next door to the Apple stores.
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:15.040]   Yes.
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:18.520]   And by the way, and I've mentioned this before and I'll mention it again and it was actually
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:23.560]   in the Market Watch column but they kind of took out the name of the company and also
[01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:29.080]   this was took place in the 60s not the 70s like I recall which is the, there used to
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:34.520]   be a hamburger chain and Leo might remember them but they were called Henry's and you
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:38.280]   can look them up on the internet because there's a bunch of people that collect their old signs
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:39.280]   and stuff.
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:41.240]   They're one of these nostalgia places.
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:47.040]   Anyway, Henry's 15 cent hamburgers was their strategy was to find a McDonald's and figure
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:49.840]   that somebody knew what they were doing to put the McDonald's there and they'd put a
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:51.480]   Henry's right around the corner.
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:52.840]   Well it's true.
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:57.720]   McDonald's like Starbucks and any other really sophisticated retail operation does a lot
[01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:00.360]   of research before they choose where to build a store.
[01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:03.720]   Especially in the early days and so what this Henry's would just find say oh let's put one
[01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:04.880]   here and they have it.
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:09.080]   I went onto one of the Henry's sites and they showed, they failed to mention that there was
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:14.120]   a bunch of these places in California and I remember the Henry's hamburgers in San Jose.
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:17.440]   But anyway there was the thing was also McDonald's clone.
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:23.320]   They tried to look like a McDonald's only the theme was green and red and it just sucked.
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:26.480]   I mean the burgers were almost identical so that didn't make much difference but it was
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:28.000]   like a bad stupid idea.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.180]   There was no originality really and this is exactly what Microsoft's doing which is another
[01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:36.960]   point I try to make which is okay Apple's got the store, nobody's done well with the
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:37.960]   stores.
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:40.120]   They're pretty much almost gone out of business with stores.
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:41.120]   Gateway, remember Gateway?
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:44.120]   Gateway and before that Compuad.
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:45.120]   Compuad, yes.
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:47.760]   And before that IBM.
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:51.360]   So Microsoft stores are basically very similar.
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:56.240]   Apple stores really succeed whether they sell computers or not they succeed in kind of positioning
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:00.200]   the Apple experience and I could see why Microsoft would want to kind of get some of that magic.
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:03.360]   Well yeah but Apple's a lifestyle brand that's completely different.
[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:07.400]   I mean if you're selling a lifestyle brand you're selling hardware.
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:08.400]   Well yeah Microsoft doesn't even sell.
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:12.800]   Microsoft sells some hardware but they don't sell the computers that are running Windows
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:15.720]   so I don't see the sale here.
[01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:18.280]   Here's some of the copy from the PowerPoint.
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:21.120]   Here's some of the copy from the PowerPoint.
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:25.960]   Emily has come in for an appointment at the Windows bar.
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:26.960]   It said genius.
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:27.960]   Is that what they're going to call it?
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:30.060]   It said genius where they crossed that out.
[01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:32.600]   The Windows bar for personal training.
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:38.600]   The easy to find iconic glass back wall boldly showcases the service offering throughout
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:39.980]   the store.
[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:45.320]   The dynamic video or screen projection inside the wall broadcasts brand messages.
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:47.060]   Truth is beauty.
[01:40:47.060 --> 01:40:48.060]   War is peace.
[01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:49.060]   No no that's something else.
[01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:54.520]   As well as queue status and announcements welcoming new PC users after a sale.
[01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:56.360]   Congratulations Lauren.
[01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:58.580]   You're a new PC owner.
[01:40:58.580 --> 01:40:59.880]   This sounds fake to me.
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:03.480]   No no Microsoft has confirmed these are real.
[01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:05.200]   Oh god.
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:06.200]   That's how bad it is.
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:07.740]   It would sound fake.
[01:41:07.740 --> 01:41:09.080]   That's how bad it is.
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:10.080]   Before her appointment.
[01:41:10.080 --> 01:41:16.160]   I was just about to defend them on this actually.
[01:41:16.160 --> 01:41:17.600]   Always a mistake by the way.
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:19.280]   Yeah don't defend Microsoft.
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:22.640]   Before her appointment Emily receives an email notification.
[01:41:22.640 --> 01:41:24.520]   By the way this is everything Apple does.
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:26.000]   Reminding her of the appointment.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:29.540]   Real time email notifications keep her informed of her place in line.
[01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:34.840]   The friendly associates enhance the Windows bar experience with their distinctive style
[01:41:34.840 --> 01:41:37.920]   knowledge and recommendations.
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:39.960]   Wow.
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:43.920]   There is one scenario where they could actually this thing could actually work for them.
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:46.500]   I don't know if you guys have seen their booths at CES.
[01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:49.120]   If the people who put together their booths at CES.
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:50.420]   Those are quite beautiful yeah.
[01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:51.960]   Did their stores.
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:54.920]   It would be great because it would be it was kind of similar to Apple.
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:55.920]   It's a showcase right.
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:59.480]   It shows what they're working on now but even more it shows like here's stuff that we're
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:03.000]   working on that's kind of coming and some of its concept car ish.
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.400]   But I think technophiles like that stuff.
[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:09.720]   The technophiles that go to the Apple stores that are boys would like that.
[01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:10.720]   They would.
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:14.680]   There is no chance in a million years that the scenario you describe would ever take
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:15.680]   place.
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:18.520]   Microsoft does not have very good inter corporate communication to begin with.
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:23.760]   There's so much jealousy at all kinds of levels there that you wouldn't let this guy who does
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:26.680]   the trade shows who even talk to these people.
[01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:30.720]   I guarantee there's going to be none of that element at these stores.
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:33.480]   If they did they could they could win but I think you're right.
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:34.480]   I don't think they will.
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:37.120]   I just think it's so funny that they can't come up with anything original.
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:38.920]   They've got a genius bar.
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:39.920]   They've got appointments.
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:44.400]   I mean if you look through it this it's it's they might as well have just taken the plans
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:45.400]   for the Apple store.
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:48.880]   Even though they have the plans in slide five and it looks like the layout of an Apple or
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:50.360]   of an early Apple store.
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:52.020]   Yeah they have a theater.
[01:42:52.020 --> 01:42:54.920]   They have a stage where they do instructional stuff.
[01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:58.560]   Yeah you know these anyway these companies have failed.
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:00.680]   This is the hardest thing in the world to do.
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:02.880]   It is expensive too.
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:08.680]   You're setting yourself up with this massive overhead of all these these stores you know
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:12.840]   even even if you decide it fails it's not like shutting down Bing or something.
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:15.720]   They are we're going to move some people here or there.
[01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:19.760]   I mean shutting down stores is is as expensive as opening them.
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:20.760]   I'm sorry.
[01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:23.480]   They call it the guru bar.
[01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:27.800]   Even worse.
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:29.600]   We had something that starts with a G.
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:34.000]   They basically opened the thesaurus and said okay what's good for genius.
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000]   No one will notice.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.000]   Genius, good guru.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:40.800]   Hey guys I want to not being bingo.

[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.040]   At Mashable.
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:54.640]   There's no Pete Cashmore account?
[01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:57.560]   No I just use the at Mashable.
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:43:58.560]   That's all you need.
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:00.040]   Well it's great to have you.
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:01.040]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:04.320]   Jason Heiner is the editor in chief of the Tech Republic.
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:06.440]   Go there now and you can see my cabinet.
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:07.800]   That's right.
[01:44:07.800 --> 01:44:08.800]   What do we make John?
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:09.800]   Is he the secretary of?
[01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:10.800]   Secretary of Justice.
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:11.800]   Justice John.
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:12.800]   Justice.
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:17.300]   All right you're all you're a life sentence.
[01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:20.160]   And Adam Curry is secretary of conspiracies.
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:21.160]   Yeah.
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:22.160]   Oh that's normal.
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:27.800]   I'd never join a government that would have me.
[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:29.640]   Jason is the editor in chief of Tech Republic.
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:31.680]   Great Ziff Davis publication.
[01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:32.920]   One of the last remaining.
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:33.920]   ZDNet isn't it?
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:36.640]   I'm sorry it was Ziff Davis now ZDNet.
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:38.000]   No it never was Ziff Davis was it?
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.000]   It was never Ziff Davis.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000]   Yeah yeah it was.
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.000]   I know it's a con.
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:42.000]   I'm so confused.
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:45.000]   Get it straight but I'm not even there.
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.000]   ZDNet.
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.600]   ZDNet bought ZDNet and then Tech Republic.
[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:55.240]   Oh okay you were merged with ZDNet and then made into CNET which was made into CBS.
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:57.360]   Yeah pretty much.
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:59.360]   Which is soon to be a MySpace property.
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:01.360]   No that's not true.
[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:04.320]   You can also find me on Twitter at Jason Hyder just H-I-N-E-R.
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:05.320]   J-A-S-O-N-H-I-N-E-R.
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:10.320]   You can catch him on HBO every other Saturday night.
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:12.200]   Using his pseudonym Max Kellerman.
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:14.160]   Right that's right of course.
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:19.160]   And Mr. John C. Dvorak is at Channel Dvorak and of course he's the host of Cranky Geeks
[01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:24.320]   and Tech5 and No Agenda and many other great programs which all can be found.
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:26.800]   And a substitute host once every two years on this show.
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:30.520]   Now I'll have you back anytime you are great.
[01:45:30.520 --> 01:45:34.680]   The real Dvorak on Twitter is what I need because I've got to get my numbers up a little
[01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:36.880]   bit I'm falling I'm lagging here.
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:38.520]   How many followers do you have?
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:41.680]   I think I'm like 58, 400.
[01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:45.840]   You know in all the pales compared to the two million plus that Ashton Kutcher has.
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:48.680]   Yeah but that's what he's the master of true engagement.
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:51.800]   I actually don't think it would be good to have that many because I'd like to still crowd
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:55.160]   source and I'm already at 58 it's actually too many.
[01:45:55.160 --> 01:46:00.360]   It becomes very hard once you get over that many that to actually track all your replies.
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:02.360]   Well you don't follow you can't follow.
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:04.240]   No it's not that following me it's the crowd sourcing.
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:07.120]   I say you ask your crowd a question.
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:10.320]   But you know the truth is I don't I bet you have those two million how many are actually
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:11.320]   engaged very few.
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:16.880]   Yeah I've done some you know testing and I think you're lucky to have 10% of those people
[01:46:16.880 --> 01:46:18.840]   ever paying any attention.
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:23.120]   You know what I did recently which really worked out well Jay Rosen who's a professor
[01:46:23.120 --> 01:46:27.240]   of journalism at NYU and is a great guy to follow on Twitter said and he just posted
[01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:34.120]   a tweet I have my I follow 600 tightly tuned people in the journalistic community and I
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:37.920]   so I just stole all his all the people he followed I just started following them and
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:38.920]   it's worked out really good.
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:41.000]   There's this great discussion going on in journalism.
[01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:46.440]   In fact I'm thinking I recommend this to people maybe look for somebody who is interesting
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:51.760]   himself or herself and see who he or she follows because that's a very good way to find out
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:54.360]   who else is interesting particularly in an area.
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:56.520]   I think you should post your list Leo.
[01:46:56.520 --> 01:47:00.880]   I've got a post coming up a hundred technology experts on Twitter including all the present
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:01.880]   company.
[01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:05.840]   You know you know what they could do is like RSS where you know with RSS they need an OPML
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:07.240]   they need OPML for follower lists.
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:10.360]   It would be cool if I could go who does Leo because I want to get started in podcasting
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:11.360]   who does Leo follow.
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:13.240]   I would like to add that.
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:19.240]   All Leo follows are just B and A list celebrities and porn stars and porn stars.
[01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:24.600]   I keep hoping one of them will say something interesting constantly disappointed.
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:29.760]   Let me tell you that's the kind of the drawback to those the most boring people in the world
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:30.760]   are porn stars.
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:33.200]   Just I have a shoot at one.
[01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:34.200]   Not even that.
[01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:35.200]   I'm going to wear my red shoes.
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:43.080]   I would love to hear that not even that my cat is pink.
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:47.240]   I mean I don't know it's like misspell pink.
[01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:48.240]   That's the worst part.
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:51.600]   I don't know why I expected more but I did.
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:52.600]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:57.400]   We will don't forget of course you can get to Twitter at the iTunes store for free even
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:48:01.240]   though it's in the store you explain that to Apple would you please or on the Zune store
[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:04.880]   same thing free just search for Twitter and all of our podcasts are there.

[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:13.960]   That's the fun.
[01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:17.080]   That's where the fun happens where people let their hair down and say it all and that's
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:18.560]   the stuff we edit out.
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:20.600]   We'll see you next time.
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:33.480]   Another twit is in the can.
