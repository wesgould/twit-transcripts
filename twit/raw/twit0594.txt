[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500]   Well, happy holidays everybody. It's time for "Twit in a Special Holiday" episode.
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.000]   We had so much fun a couple of years ago during a New Year's Eve show,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   bringing some of our hosts from different shows together,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.500]   as they never do appear during the year, and we thought we'd do it again.
[00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.500]   So joining me, Denise Howell from This Week in Law, Steve Gibson from Security Now,
[00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.500]   Renee Ritchie from Mac Break Weekly,
[00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.500]   and what we're going to do is look back at the year 2016.
[00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.500]   The highs, the lows, the big tech stories.
[00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.500]   It's a very special Twit coming up next.
[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.000]   Net-Casts you love.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   From people you trust.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   This is Twit.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by CashFly at CACHEFLY.com.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   This is Twit, This Week in Tech.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   Episode 594, recorded Thursday, December 1, 2016 for Air on Christmas 2016.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   What a year.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.500]   This Week in Tech is brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quick and Loans.
[00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.000]   Rocket Mortgage brings a mortgage process into the 21st century with a fast, easy, and completely online process.

[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   It's time for Twit, a special holiday edition.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Hello everybody.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   This is the Twit for Christmas Day, December 25, 2016.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   We are not recording this.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   I did not make anybody work on the holiday.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   So we recorded this earlier in the month, but we're going to, we're festive.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   I've got Santa coming out of my head.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Where is that an elf?
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   I don't know what that is.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   To my right, Steve Gibson has joined us.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Go, Leo.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   So what we used to do is we used to have people come in and we'd all get drunk.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And then I thought we should do what we did.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Remember this?
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   How many years ago was this?
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   It was 2015.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   For New Year's Eve, you, Randall Schwartz, Renee, you were there.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Renee Richie was also my more.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Jeff Jarvis was there.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Right.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   And I was not.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   No, I think you, well, I was taking a break.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Much deserved break.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   It was exhausted.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Everything is being aired live.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And it was just a spontaneous discussion.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   So you know who was missing from that one?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Is this person right here?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Denise Howell from This Week in Law.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Nice to see you.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Great to be here.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   This is the beginning of a new tradition.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   We want to bring everybody up from, we'll rotate shows, obviously, but we'll bring hosts from other shows in because usually you don't get to talk to each other.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Right.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And it's kind of nice.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   You guys had breakfast together?
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   We did.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   We hung out all morning.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Totally secure.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Totally secure.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Do you lock you down?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   No.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   It was a squirrel coat to get your breakfast.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   But after that, some guy with a mask walked up and had been listening to our entire conversation for several hours.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Really?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And he had several critiques of some of the...
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   That's a little scary.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Are you kidding?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   No.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   That's a little weird.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   He was charming.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Yes, he was.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And he said he corrected you?
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   He didn't stay long.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I think he agreed with us.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   No, he said he'd been using Maxis before it was doomed.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And he was happy to hear us talking about technology.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   My goodness.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.640]   So, what we're going to do, Tanya and Carsten, our production team, has put together a list
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.080]   of some of the big stories from 2016.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.640]   And I hope you will all, you know, because each of you has your own beat.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.640]   You've got security.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.120]   Denise has law and Renee has the Mac.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.360]   Come up with stories that you thought were important also this year.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.160]   Why do we think was the big story?
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.960]   I think I know what the big story of 2016 was.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.480]   It was the election.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.360]   And while that's a political story, there was a...
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.320]   It was very much, I think, also a technology story with Facebook and Twitter particularly
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.120]   were really used to great effect by the candidates.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.120]   Right.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.120]   Actually, by one candidate.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.400]   Well, Steve and I talked about that this morning.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.400]   It was an amazing social engineering attack, like just from a pure technical point of view.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.600]   Well, and then the whole...
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.960]   Of course, Trump's use of Twitter was very effective.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.520]   I mean, he continues to use it.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.240]   But also the big story, you know, that we talked a lot about was fake news on Facebook.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.160]   I've been one of the people who's not too worried about that and doesn't think we should censor
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.080]   news because what is fake news after all, right?
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.080]   I mean, it's...
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.080]   Who decides?
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.800]   Who decides that?
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.360]   But more to the point, I think the dark advertising that we've been learning about that the Trump's
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:29.720]   team led by Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, was able to use a company called Cambridge
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:37.080]   Analytica out of the UK to profile 220 million Facebook users in the US.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.720]   And in particular, using Facebook quizzes do more than just...
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.360]   You know, gauge.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.360]   Engage sentiment.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.840]   So, and then could target ads, not just ads for people who would potentially be voting for
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.440]   President-elect Trump, but also for people who would be voting for Hillary Clinton or the
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.320]   others, they could...
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.480]   They were using it to suppress voting like, "Oh, it won't matter.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.480]   Don't vote."
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.480]   Text in your vote.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.480]   Text in your vote.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.480]   So, it's really interesting.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.320]   And I think back to...
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.040]   I'm old enough to remember, and you might be too, Steve, when Richard Nixon won the presidency
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.040]   in 1968.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.040]   Oh, I do.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.920]   And everybody said, "This is the first time ad men have been brought in to run a campaign."
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.920]   Yep.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.920]   And I think fast forward now to 2016, this is...
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.600]   Standard operating procedure.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.040]   This is more than ads now, though.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.560]   This is the very effective use of social media in a way that we will probably see from now
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.560]   on.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.560]   Right.
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.800]   So, I'm going to nominate that for my biggest story.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.920]   What do you think your biggest story was, Steve?
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:49.080]   Well, I agree that in general in our world, this crazy election dominated a lot of our
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.120]   time and thinking.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:58.960]   And of course, to a somewhat lesser degree, this whole question of private email server
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.440]   be secure is something that we talked about.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.440]   Absolutely.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.840]   And unfortunately, or for good or bad, it did factor heavily into forming a lot of people's
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.480]   opinions about security and trustworthiness and so forth.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.480]   And so, that was leveraged to great effect.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:25.560]   And I said on a number of times on our podcast that without knowing anything about the technology,
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.560]   that's because, you know, as they say, the devil is in the details.
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.840]   And so, to make any kind of an actual judgment about the security of a piece of technology,
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.600]   you have to know everything about it.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:47.000]   And none of the rest of the world outside of some inner circle had any details.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.200]   But what we did here was that at one point, at least, while the server was in use, it
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.240]   was physically insecure.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:03.600]   It was in a small ISP's office building where you could not guarantee physical security.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.800]   Somebody could walk in the door.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.800]   And that was my point.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.000]   You don't at least have physical security.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.120]   You can't have data security.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.000]   So also the third year of the Snowden era.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Yes.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.760]   Ellen, my good point, everything has changed.
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:27.320]   I mean, we're seeing the ongoing effects of the revelations that he woke us up to.
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.320]   Right.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:35.040]   And as I've said also on the podcast, independent of like how you feel about him.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.040]   Was he a traitor?
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.280]   Was he a patriot?
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:45.560]   The question I've posed is, can you imagine an alternate timeline where he didn't do this,
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:52.160]   where we didn't know today what we now know if we were as ignorant of what was really
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.160]   going on?
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:59.640]   And so, I think knowledge is better than ignorance independent of that.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:05.160]   And what we've seen is we've gone from a world where you would create a secure connection
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:12.200]   to a server only briefly to send your credit card information or your logging credentials
[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:21.160]   over, then it would drop you back to HTTP for your regular interaction with the server.
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:28.000]   The problem is, as the fire sheep hack showed, it was trivial to hijack somebody's log on
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.520]   session and just to watch their traffic.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.920]   That's what we knew that the NSA was doing because at the beginning of this, most of the
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:40.560]   traffic, only brief little pieces were encrypted and could not be easily seen.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:46.080]   Denise, what do you think the legal story of 2016 was?
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:52.000]   It was probably the dispute over whether the FBI could compel--
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Sam Bernadillo.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:04.120]   And I think that speaks to a larger story of 2016 being the year that people-- that not
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:12.160]   just we geeky people, but ordinary people started to realize that their data on all
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.640]   of these devices is not just unique to themselves.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:22.480]   That it's very readily available to whether it's the government and we can wrangle over
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:32.840]   what circumstances that happens in or advertisers or other corporate interests who are leveraging
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.200]   that data, not necessarily to everybody's benefit.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.200]   We spent weeks--
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.200]   I think the society's getting that next.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.040]   Weeks talking about Apple versus the FBI.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.520]   Could you imagine a future where your phone enjoys privilege the way your spouse does
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.520]   because it starts to contain more--
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.520]   It can't testify against you.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.000]   It knows more personal information about you than a spouse does.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.320]   Well, but isn't that what the court debate over fingerprint versus password is you can't
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.560]   be compelled to give your password because that would be self incriminating?
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.560]   Testimony.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.560]   Right.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.560]   Exactly.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.560]   Testimonial.
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:09.160]   But your fingerprint like your hair or your DNA or an actual fingerprint is not.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.160]   That's right.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.560]   It's not actually any sort of knowledge in your head.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.360]   Is that holding strong?
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.360]   It's split.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.840]   I thought there were some decisions recently that went the other way.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.840]   There have been.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.520]   I think the courts have wrestled with this over the years.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:31.360]   We've had courts in different parts of the country say that passwords could be compelled,
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.600]   that fingerprints could be compelled.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:41.760]   So I don't think-- by and large, I mean, to have a takeaway for our listeners and viewers,
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.760]   by and large, the password is going to be the way to go if you're trying to--
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.760]   Did they have one where they said that they couldn't make you tell them your password,
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.480]   that they could give you your phone and you had to enter it and then give them back the
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.480]   phone?
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.480]   I saw that.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.480]   Well, I learned a lot of weird decisions this morning.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:04.040]   In October, there was the big story where this actually Forbes found a May filing, the
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:09.920]   Department of Justice, sought a warrant that would compel everybody in a building to give
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.720]   hand over their fingerprint.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.720]   Right.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.000]   This was down in Southern California, actually.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:23.960]   And we don't know much about it at all because it was all under seal.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:32.040]   So kudos to Thomas Fox Brewster at Forbes, who, you know, he and his minions unearth the
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:33.880]   fact that this had even happened.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.800]   Kind of an amazing story.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.080]   But it's not passwords, it's still fingerprints.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.360]   But to get a warrant, and it's kind of a phishing expedition, right?
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.960]   To walk in and say, everybody in this building, and all these premises must give us the
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.560]   name of the IP, but not the individual using the device.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.560]   Right.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:51.560]   It was a mobile device from that IP.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.800]   It was a one of those John Doe warrants that we hate.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.800]   Right.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.080]   And it's going to vary from judge to judge.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:01.920]   You know, judges are still the people who decide whether search warrants should issue.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.960]   And unfortunately, you know, they, there's no uniformity between them.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:11.600]   Some of them are going to grant warrants that seem desperately over-broad, and some
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.320]   of them are going to be more circumspect about it.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.480]   So it comes down to, you know, who the judges are in our country.
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:24.800]   Well, and I guess in the case of compelling a password, if the individual refuses, and
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.960]   we've seen instances, for example, where hard drives have been encrypted, and the individual
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:36.440]   makes the decision that, you know, I'll be in worse shape if they see inside this hard
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.840]   drive than if I refuse.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.760]   And so they're in then in contempt of court, and they're put in jail until they produce
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.080]   the evidence, which the judges compelling them to produce.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:51.600]   It's no question in my mind that the hackers gained ground in 2016.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:57.760]   But I wonder if it's safe to say that the government also gained ground in 2016.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.560]   For instance, you know, we're recording this early in December.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:08.920]   Early in December, Congress neglected to stop a rule that would allow law enforcement to
[00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:16.240]   hack computers, any magistrate in any jurisdiction could give law enforcement a warrant to hack
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:21.920]   computers in any other jurisdiction in the pursuit of a crime.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.800]   And this was much battled, but it went through.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:31.480]   So well, I guess what happened is they weren't able to, you know, to say stop, because otherwise
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.480]   it was-
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.480]   Unfortunately, well, they're paralyzed.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.480]   Everyone else is still moving.
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:41.920]   So it happened this way as an administrative amendment to the rules of criminal procedure
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.360]   rather than any kind of law that had to be-
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:49.480]   I mean, I might argue the other- on the other side of it, which is that technology has outpaced
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:55.880]   this notion that you'd get a warrant in the district of the crime because of-
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.360]   And in particular with hacking, there is no jurisdiction.
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.360]   Right.
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.880]   We've broken those borders.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:02.880]   Right.
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.960]   I mean, I think you could make the argument that this rule 41 kind of had to be changed
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:07.960]   for the 21st century.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.960]   Right.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:13.120]   But the other component of it where Judge's Kennedy issue warrants now that allow basically
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.720]   the government to hack computers of unidentifies-
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.720]   Yes.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.720]   Yes.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:19.720]   People.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.640]   I don't know how you show probable cause if you're entering machines where you don't
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.400]   even know who they- or you're not disclosing who the individual is.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:32.480]   That may be one of the most shameful stories of 2016 that the FBI was running more than
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:38.640]   half of all the child porn sites at one point in the United States as honey pots for
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.160]   a pet arrest.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:51.000]   That baffles me that the FBI was doing that and was allowed to do that.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.320]   According to one researcher, the FBI was likely running about half of all the child porn
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.440]   sites at one point on the Internet as a sting.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.440]   I mean, I guess you catch a lot of criminals that way.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.080]   Well, they had a major bust like last week.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.280]   They took down a huge rant.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.320]   That was the playpen bust, I think.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.400]   So government is gained ground.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.800]   They gained ground in the UK this year.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.800]   The Snoopers Charter.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.280]   The only judge recently passed Theresa May who had proposed that before she was Prime
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.720]   Minister three years ago had been fighting to get that through.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.680]   Now that she was Prime Minister, she was able to get the votes.
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:30.320]   And that passed in the UK, giving the, according to Edward Snowden, the most broad powers to
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:35.600]   a non-autocratic government ever.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.040]   Extreme surveillance.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.640]   Corey Doctorow called it.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.640]   V for Vendetta.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:47.400]   And I imagine, remember, remember the 5th of November, I imagine the same thing will happen
[00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:52.080]   in other Western nations, including perhaps here.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:56.120]   We did talk a little bit though, and I'm not clear on this, and we'll have to get back
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.120]   to you on it.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.000]   How it affects encryption.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.600]   It seems that it might mandate backdoors in encryption, but I'm not sure.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.120]   I don't see that explicitly in the Snoopers Charter.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.480]   Yeah, it's not clear how this is going to get implemented.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:13.920]   I mean, there was one of the reasons that this recent presidential election was important,
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:20.480]   was we know that the next president was going to be appointing or nominating for appointment.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:27.840]   At least several Supreme Court justices over the course of the probable tenure, and that
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:32.440]   as we're seeing now, the Supreme Court has become more and more involved in figuring
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.640]   out where these lines are.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:36.600]   Yeah, and I understand.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.200]   I mean, times change.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.560]   Technology was not envisioned by the founding fathers.
[00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.560]   Nope.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:50.960]   And we're trying to interpret this constitutional document, which knows about grain, and doesn't
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.960]   speak of the problems that we have today directly.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.440]   In case you okay, they're making it laws, they're not doing it illegally.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.920]   And that's one of the justifications for this, isn't it?
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.240]   Well, it's now explicit.
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.320]   And at least a law you can challenge and can be overturned.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.240]   But when you're doing it illegally, then there's no reports.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.240]   Well, and secretly.
[00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.240]   That's a very good point.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:11.920]   That was why our Patriot Act was so controversial, is that one of the things we learned was that
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:18.800]   things were being done under those guidelines, under that legislation, that the people who
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.720]   established it didn't ever intend.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.480]   It was pushed quietly and secretly.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:32.200]   And then all of the letters which companies are receiving the national security letters.
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:36.960]   Again, under the cloak of, you know, we're asking for this and you can't tell anybody.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.080]   So now we have warrant canaries all over the place that are dying.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.280]   You used to have it all gone now.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.280]   That's right.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.960]   In fact, they have all disappeared.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.960]   We know now that they were asking.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.400]   It's sort of sad if yours are still episodic.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.400]   Nobody wanted your data.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:56.560]   So I agree with you, Denise, that one of the very biggest stories was Apple versus the FBI.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.920]   Now that the smoke is clear, the FBI dropped the case.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.400]   They said, oh, we found a way to get in, which was a little disturbing.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.720]   Now the smoke is clear.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.040]   What is the upshot of that case?
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:10.720]   Is the FBI just waiting for an, it appeared the FBI was waiting for the kind of perfect
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.920]   conditions to pursue this?
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.720]   Apple took a very, and unprecedentedly strong, and I think principles stand against
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.880]   it.
[00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.920]   But in the long run, if the courts rule against Apple, Apple is going to have to do if it
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.600]   wants to do business in the US with the courts say.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:32.760]   So what is the, what is now as we look back, was that just a tempest in a teapot or is this
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.760]   the beginning of a first skirmish in a long war?
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.320]   I think it's a skirmish.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:42.880]   And I think that, you know, Apple drew a line in the sand and that there has been a
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:49.680]   political shift in the country toward helping law enforcement get.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.680]   Yep.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.960]   It was controversial then, and I think you're right.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.600]   It's less controversial now.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.600]   Yeah.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:02.120]   So companies, it's going to be incumbent on customers and companies to make it really
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.720]   clear what sort of services they demand and expect.
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:12.200]   And if the government says, you know, sorry, encryption is just a deal breaker for us
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.720]   because we can't do law enforcement anymore.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.720]   Right.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.200]   Things are going to come to a head.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.840]   And we have this notion of things being normalized too.
[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:25.920]   We're hearing the word normalized a lot in our jargon and the idea that this was a big
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.880]   issue this year, it won't be such a big issue in the future.
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:36.880]   I mean, it's going to, it's just, you know, the social side will adapt to this and the
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.880]   new normal.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.880]   Exactly.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.080]   And it's going to be a consensus though among the American people that we, you know, we
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.640]   want to err on the side of security.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.640]   So I'm interested in what happens next.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.640]   So what happened?
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.820]   Let's say this goes through and there are forced to put back doors in and then inevitably
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:55.080]   hackers discover them and suddenly millions of people have their bank accounts.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.080]   Is it the American?
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.080]   That was Tim Cook's.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.080]   But let's say that happened here.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.320]   That's going to be the American people though, or is this being?
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.320]   I think it's the American people.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.520]   I think most people.
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:11.480]   The fact we've seen this worldwide is kind of moved towards authoritarianism.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:16.880]   That when you get really scared, you let the strong man in and say protect us.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.360]   And I think that that's kind of what this is.
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.280]   It's just about people who didn't mind military government anymore were mind boggling.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.080]   They thought it was not a bad idea.
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:28.560]   I just saw, and I'll see if I can find it, but I just saw some graphs, Nate worldwide
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:33.160]   by age demographic of people who thought democracy was important.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:37.360]   And it's us old folks, you and me, Steve, but still think democracy.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.360]   To our democracy.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.360]   To our democracy.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.000]   35% right with millennials.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.560]   Millennials democracy was not important.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.400]   And they were defined with a military state.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:49.640]   And we've also seen studies where you say to someone, here's an ice cream cone.
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.800]   I'll trade you for your password.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.960]   And they go, okay, you know what I mean?
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:57.120]   Very different sense of what your password is.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.120]   What your password.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.120]   The gun program is unclear.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.960]   You ask him for it.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:01.960]   Yeah.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:02.960]   Right.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.960]   Let's change this topic.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:04.960]   Let's change this topic.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.760]   You know what I think the big story of 2016 was Pokemon go.
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.760]   How you still like it?
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.560]   Was that going to be all right?
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:12.560]   Take it.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.560]   I didn't ask you what yours was.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.560]   I apologize.
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.560]   No, not at all.
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.480]   So I guess it's not exactly Apple news, but it was I think that was part of the appeal
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.520]   was that it was both Apple and Android and hit all at once.
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:27.040]   And it was I remember seeing their presentation where they showed this is what we expected
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.040]   in terms of traffic.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.640]   This is the maximum we expected.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.240]   This is what it happened.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:35.760]   So you had a perfect confluence of a platform that was beyond any specific hardware vendor.
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.320]   You had location services.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.440]   You had gamification.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.280]   And you had this massive appeal where you could play together and people were going
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.040]   out to parks and families.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.040]   It was amazing.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.000]   It was discovering their neighborhoods and you couldn't move with that people playing
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.480]   Pokemon go on the street.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:54.920]   I remember the first day it happened in the restaurant where I was eating one of the
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:59.520]   servers came outside because I sit out on the patio and she said, I hate this Pokemon
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.520]   thing.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.520]   It was like all over tables.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:02.520]   Nobody's paying attention.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.520]   And Steve was like quiet.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.520]   I'm catching his relax.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:07.680]   Later, we had to go get a zikiku or something.
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.840]   I mean, she didn't know what was going on.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:13.360]   That first weekend I went to the park and there was this elderly gentleman and he said,
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.440]   my daughter is out here catching Pokemon with me.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.280]   She doesn't want to spend a minute with me normally.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.240]   This is the best weekend of my life.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.200]   And yet, and I didn't think this was going to be a flash in the pan.
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.640]   It was a flash in the pan.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.640]   Yep, right.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.640]   It was sold.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:30.040]   It was the fastest selling game in history in five days outsold every other game.
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:35.200]   In fact, Google Play did at the end of the year name at the top game of 2016.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.000]   But it's also, I mean, I don't see anybody playing it anymore.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   There are still...
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   You're still...
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   No, yeah, I play it.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.280]   So I think they said it's about 10% of initially, but they had a huge problem because they couldn't
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.280]   scale.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.680]   Scaling turned out to be non-trailer for them and that put the brakes on new features.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.280]   They had to work so hard to roll it.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:54.040]   They're just, I think they just added China, which is a huge market for them.
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.520]   And they couldn't focus on new features.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:59.080]   So only last week did we see like the Ditto creature came out.
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.080]   And then Generation 2 is going to come out.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:04.160]   Is that why everybody in every social feed, I saw this purple blob.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.160]   Yes.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.160]   Yes.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:10.160]   So their problem is that they would have maybe got...
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.160]   They're at 10% now.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.640]   Maybe they would have subsisted at 20%.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.640]   But they couldn't do it.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.480]   So the question now is, can they grow again?
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:18.840]   Can they do Generation 2 and at least get some sort of an ongoing audience?
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:23.160]   Well, and I think there is probably an initial fad value also.
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:28.120]   So it's not clear to me, I mean, we know what the shape of that curve is, even if they
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:32.400]   have been able to scale, the curve would have probably still come down to about where
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.280]   it is now, because there were people who were going to screw around with it for a couple
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.360]   of weeks and then go, okay, back to my regularly scheduled life.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:43.760]   Just technology, I mean, it's augmented reality, it's geolocation, it gets people out.
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.160]   They've done everything they can to make sure you can't play from a car.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.720]   They're making an Apple Watch app and a Pokemon Go, so you have to go out.
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.480]   And it's going to be a workout Apple and Apple Watch.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.480]   It's not going to be a game.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.400]   It's like you started and it does a workout for you.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.440]   So it'll become part of the culture, but not at this crazy, you know.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.760]   And then you wonder like the technology, there were rumors they do a Harry Potter beasts
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.560]   version of us, you go out and catch magical beasts.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:04.560]   Yeah, I thought they were going to do that.
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.560]   Yeah, Pokemon wasn't their thing.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.560]   It didn't happen.
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:14.160]   Well, it's some said this is the first kind of little bit, Camels knows under the tent
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.360]   of augmented reality, getting as used to.
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.360]   Yes.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.560]   Wait a minute, we've got to pause for a moment because the hot butter rums are going to
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.560]   look good.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.560]   Oh my.
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.720]   We're enjoying our special Christmas edition of this weekend town.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.720]   You're a gentleman.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:32.160]   I'll tell you, all right, since you take Pokemon Go, I have another, okay, biggest story of
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.160]   2016.
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:37.080]   We'll talk about that as you get whipped cream on your nose.
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.320]   First though, a word from Rocket.
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.200]   Mortgage are sponsored for the show.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.240]   It's nice that Rocket Mortgage doesn't take time off for the holidays because they're always
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:46.240]   there.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:51.000]   If you're looking around and you say, I think I see a house in our future and you want to
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.400]   get a mortgage or maybe you're ready to re-fi.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.920]   When you're watching this show, you're probably pretty geeky.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:03.360]   I can imagine that you don't want to go back in time to 1956, bring a banker's box full
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:08.120]   of papers to the loan office while the loan guy goes, I remember this actually.
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.000]   It has a clipboard with the various.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.920]   Well, let me see what loan would be.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:12.920]   Well, I don't know.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.840]   And it's the finest print you ever saw.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:18.840]   The right here, it seems to be based on the lieboard.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:19.840]   Forget that.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.840]   Forget that.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.120]   Go to Rocket Mortgage.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:26.800]   When you just answer a few questions, you could send them your statements, your pay stubs,
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.800]   your all the information they need with a push of a button.
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.240]   Actually, the touch of a thumb because you could do this on your phone or your tech.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.560]   You could even do it at the open house.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.520]   Like this couple does, they're looking at a house.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.520]   They suddenly get the itch.
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:39.880]   We should buy this.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:44.440]   And before they leave the open house, they've got the Rocket Mortgage screen that says you're
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:49.640]   approved and approved in minutes for not just any loan, but a loan that's tailored for you.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.360]   Rocket Mortgage comes to you from Quick and Loans.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.600]   They're the premier mortgage lender in the country.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.480]   And of course, they've got a product for geeks and I'm so glad.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.080]   Rocket Mortgage, if you want to find out more, get ready.
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.080]   Put this on a post-it note.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.000]   You never know when you're going to be at that open house.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:13.080]   You want to buy quickandlones.com/twit and the number two, quickandlones.com, Twit2.
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:17.840]   Rocket Mortgage, equal housing, lender, licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer octus.org
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.840]   number 30, 30.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.120]   Rocket Mortgage from Quick and Loans.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.320]   We thank them so much for their support for our holiday special.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.800]   We've got hosts from various shows here.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:29.800]   This is a lot of fun.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.000]   We asked a bunch of hosts.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.520]   You guys were the first to respond.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.520]   Lucky you.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.520]   Smart us.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.520]   Smart you.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.520]   Yeah, it's fantastic.
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.800]   Well, it's perfect because the Twit holiday party is tonight.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:40.800]   So you're all here tonight.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:41.800]   Did they know there was going to be holidays?
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:42.800]   Yes.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.800]   How come I got the big mug?
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:44.800]   That's the big mug.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:45.800]   That's the big mug.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:46.800]   There's a Chief Twit.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:47.800]   This is interesting.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.480]   And by the way, that's the other big story of the year.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:54.080]   Anthony Nielsen, who is one of our great creative editors, also happens to be an amazing
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.080]   mixologist.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.080]   And convinced.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.080]   It's so good.
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:04.120]   It's one of the nights of the week, Wednesday night, we leave early and apparently a party
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.120]   breaks out.
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:09.520]   Don't let Leo knows a party going on in the air.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.520]   Get the baby.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:14.360]   Like all good pushers, Anthony doesn't drink his own concoctions, but he makes everybody
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:15.360]   else.
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.360]   That's good stuff.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.360]   That's all the good stuff.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.360]   That's awesome.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.760]   Good stuff.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.760]   What is this?
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:21.760]   Is this a hot buttered rum?
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:22.760]   I think so.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:23.760]   Wow.
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.760]   Wow.
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:25.760]   Thank you, Anthony.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.760]   Yes.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.720]   This will, the show will be getting more interesting progressively as it goes by.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.400]   So nice job.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.880]   Oh my.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.520]   Brian Burnett, you dressed up for the show.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.960]   Nice to see you as well.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:37.960]   That was another story for us.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.960]   This is a brand new studio.
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.600]   We moved out of the Brick House studio.
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:41.600]   It's a nice studio.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.600]   It's great.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.600]   I really, you're seeing it for the first time all three of you.
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.600]   Yep, the right size.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.760]   Richie from I'm Ord, Denise Howell from Twill, this weekend law.
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.160]   Steve gives him from security now.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.640]   I should introduce you once again.
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.960]   Nice to have you here.
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.280]   Yeah, our first, this is our first holiday in the, in the new studio.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.280]   It looks fantastic.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.280]   Parking's better.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.280]   Yes.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.600]   That's a for sure.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.320]   It was hard to park in my old place.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.320]   But it's cozy.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.680]   It's a little smaller, but you know what?
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.880]   Doesn't this look kind of the same really?
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:09.880]   What do you need?
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.280]   And if Luca and I are yelling outside, doesn't bother you in here?
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.760]   That's a big improvement.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:18.680]   And I think really the rest, the real reason we moved was because the rest of the staff
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.000]   hated that they couldn't say anything.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.840]   They had a whisper all the time while we were doing shows.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.800]   Now they're drinking.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.320]   They're poor librarian, lost her shushing job.
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.240]   Everyone else is happy.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.640]   Burr cooked up a police.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.120]   Oh, I got whipped cream on it.
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:43.000]   Burr cooked up a police light and a horn and he pushed the button and it was too noisy
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.680]   down the hall and the light got booked.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.680]   You got booked.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.440]   We said you got burped.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.440]   We've been burped.
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.440]   You've been bugged.
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.440]   You've been bugged everybody.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.440]   Okay.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:56.400]   I think the big one of the big stories and it's much like it's there's some relationship
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:00.320]   to the Pokemon ghost story is virtual reality.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.400]   Because it was kind of a flash in the pan this year.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.760]   This was the year that the Oculus Rift finally was sold to the public.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:10.560]   Then HTC followed shortly thereafter with the HTC Vive.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:14.640]   Tony towards the end of the year released its PlayStation VR.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:18.880]   For the first time people were able to in their homes play VR.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.200]   Everybody got excited about it.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.640]   I can be Batman Leo.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.640]   I can be Batman.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.960]   Can you jump off a building and swoop down?
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.600]   So I started off with the Vive was the first one I tried and then George just told.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.600]   No, she stole my Oculus.
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.600]   Okay.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.320]   But I started off with the Vive and it's great because it's got the different cameras and
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.880]   different areas and you can actually move through the room and it does feel like a holodeck.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.400]   You put it on and there's like you if you have to walk a plank my brain will not let
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.400]   me do it.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.400]   It feels too real.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.880]   You were talking about that plank game.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:47.480]   It's called Richie's Plank ironically and George put it out there and I was supposed
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:51.000]   to walk on it and my entire body system shut down.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.120]   There's no way I'm walking out on this.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:59.680]   You know as an old timer there's a pattern that I've seen often.
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:06.240]   There was a first round of home computers that were too soon and too early and they
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.240]   die.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.240]   Altere.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.640]   So something called a newton.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:13.000]   There was a newton once that was it was ambitious.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.680]   It was too soon and and even laptops I remember we know luggables as they were.
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.680]   Yes.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:20.680]   Nick Kompak.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:24.080]   It's just you know it's like well it kind of works but would you have an extension cord
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:30.760]   and so so now we just take them for granted and and I think you know because what generally
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:37.440]   happens is that visionaries are out in front and they're often right about what but they're
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:40.040]   normally wrong about when.
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:45.840]   They're they see it too soon and so oftentimes they get arrows in their backs that are fatal
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:49.560]   and so so I'm I'm interested in this.
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:55.640]   I think that you know Renee was talking about how if you put goggles on that shows you a
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.960]   narrow plank over a gorge.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.080]   You're scared you can't walk across it.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:06.600]   I mean and so the point is that you know we're creatures that that take the environment
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:14.400]   that our senses deliver to us literally and and so I think essentially it this means that
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:21.600]   this kind of technology that can can create an artificial environment will be incredibly
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.600]   powerful.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.480]   I just think I don't I'm not in a hurry you know we got a lot of time left with the
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:31.080]   play station which is like the most mainstream when you you start playing Batman Arkham VR
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.560]   and you put it on and you look down and you are that fun like you.
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:39.800]   It's fun jumping you stick you'll keep playing it though hours in like next month in the
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:43.000]   month that's like Georgia plays paintball or husband plays pool he hates pool but he
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.040]   plays VR pool it's it's it's the it's the weirdest experience you can be almost anything.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:53.200]   It's a holiday my take on is opposite of yours and I'm not sure and we have them all
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.000]   and I played with them all and and I played with them the point where I go.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   You have an idea.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   I have several.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.320]   No and I think you could make an excellent point it could just be too early early days
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.960]   but it could also be like 3D.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:08.960]   Yes.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:09.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:14.280]   So there is precedent for it and what we're here there's two there's two trends happening
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.280]   here.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:19.640]   There's the one trend which we're trying to make a computer reality more immersive more
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:25.600]   real and of course the end game is the you know from neuromancer the or or snow crash
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.840]   the implant or the metaverse where we we are it's almost indistinguishable from reality
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:32.320]   and certainly I would love to get there and if we get there.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:36.760]   The hall of the day just had something that that was appeared in your visual field we're
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:41.640]   a similar state without looking like a goon from some and I think we might get there.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.640]   Yeah.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.280]   I think we might get there but I think VR certainly is I mean 3D.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:49.160]   So that's what 3D was supposed to be right it's more immersive movie and it's just annoying
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.160]   at least to me.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.560]   So I'm for some like is that you require like for the vibe or the office you need like
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.880]   a powerful PC.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:59.080]   I think it's some place we will get to there that get to some sort of immersive technology.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:04.400]   I personally don't think it'll be screens three inches from your eyes right but I don't know
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.560]   what else is out there.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:08.560]   I mean I don't think we'll be jacking in any time in my lifetime.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:13.200]   When you say it's like 3D do you mean how in the 50s people went to 3D movies and they
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.200]   were kind of.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.200]   50s two years ago.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.200]   Well oh yeah true.
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.200]   Right.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.200]   Remember everybody got 3D TVs.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.360]   Nobody makes 3D TVs.
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:24.520]   None of the companies that force 3D TVs on you two years ago makes them anymore.
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:27.320]   But the movies are good.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:28.480]   I'd always prefer you know to.
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.480]   We're going to go see a 3D.
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.680]   We're going to go see Rogue One and 3D for sure.
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.600]   Yeah I prefer 2D movies.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.600]   It's funny because I do too.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.880]   I have two very good friends.
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.360]   They feel exactly opposite.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.360]   I don't care.
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.720]   Jenny actually will not see a movie not in 3D.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.360]   It's dimmer and another friend of mine.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.880]   No, the likes 3D doesn't care at all.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:44.880]   It's dimmer.
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.560]   We went to see a fantastic creatures and had a train of many races.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.560]   That's fucking my name.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.040]   It's the world's largest, longest title.
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:57.600]   Anyway and there was a choice of 3D or 2D and I wanted to go to 2D but Lisa preferred
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.600]   3D.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.320]   I was told he'd Dr. Strange and 3D because of the building of the day.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:03.720]   Dr. Strange and 3D was very cool.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:10.080]   So anyway I think the jury is still out on VR that it could be the 3D or it could be
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.240]   the metaverse.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:18.320]   But what the other trend that's right alongside it is this trend towards new user interfaces
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.560]   for computing.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.000]   And I do think there's something there.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.560]   I think AR for instance augmented reality.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.320]   Well look what I'm playing with here.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.320]   This is my newest computer.
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.480]   I got this earlier this month.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:33.520]   This is the Surface Studio from Microsoft.
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:38.400]   And if you'd asked me a couple of years ago you'd think you'll ever have a giant screen
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.400]   computer.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.520]   I mean this would have been science fiction and it really works quite well.
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.880]   It's kind of an amazing thing.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:49.640]   So I think new user interfaces are very possibly.
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.440]   And voices come a long way this year too.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.840]   And voices the other thing.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:58.960]   And so VR would be one of my votes for a story that may or may not be a flash in the pan.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.280]   AR related.
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:01.640]   But voice technology.
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:05.720]   Look at the Amazon Echo and now the Google Home which is in Siri and Cortana for that
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:06.720]   matter.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:07.720]   Huge.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:08.720]   Huge.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:09.720]   And Vib.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:10.720]   That Samsung just bought.
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.720]   Yeah they bought the guys who created Siri.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:13.720]   That close.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:17.840]   After they sold it to Apple spun it off a new company called Viv and Samsung just acquired
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.840]   them.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:19.840]   Samsung is becoming table stakes.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.000]   Yeah it's table stakes right.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.600]   If you're going to be a player in the mobile category.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:24.600]   Absolutely.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:29.640]   Maybe one way to frame what you're suggesting Leo is that we also need to recognize that
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:33.400]   just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.400]   Right.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.720]   Silicon Valley will do it if they can.
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.560]   Because they don't know anymore that we do what the next thing is.
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:40.960]   They're throwing spaghetti on the wall.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:44.360]   I guess that ties in the AI because that's behind a lot of these voice.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:48.120]   And that to me is if I had to pick and these are all huge stories.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.120]   We're talking about massive trends here.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:55.200]   But I think this is the year that we're going to look back and say machine learning.
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.200]   Yes.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.640]   Finally became an important goal for the.
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.640]   Because we have connectivity.
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.880]   We have cloud.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:01.880]   We have.
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:04.520]   We were using Google now and Siri and Cortana for the and they never talked about AI.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:06.200]   They never talked about machine learning.
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.480]   Never talked about computer vision.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:10.840]   But they start Google put it on stage and then after that everyone had to talk about
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:11.840]   it.
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:18.080]   That was October 4th when Google had its event and and Sundar Pachai the CEO of Google.
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:25.760]   And I think very cogently the various stages of computing the personal computing.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.880]   And then what were they there was personal computing.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.480]   Then there was mobile computing.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.400]   I must have left something cloud.
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.720]   Then there was cloud computing.
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.600]   But now there's artificial intelligence.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:38.760]   And I remember talking with.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:43.200]   Oh, now we did it on triangulation.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.320]   Kevin Kelly who wrote a new book about the future.
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:49.800]   And one of the things he said is what happens with these technologies.
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:54.320]   And you could talk about computing as being an example of big data being another example.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.280]   Is that you take something you already.
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.480]   Had and then you add a layer of this new technology.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:04.680]   He uses an example of what electrification became big at the turn of the last century.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:08.920]   A farmer would look at well what if I got oh I've got this pump to get water after pump
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:09.920]   it.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:13.520]   I wonder what an electric motor would do to change that and whole new industries were
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.520]   born.
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:19.480]   He said that happens every time when the industrial era the electrical era car.
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:21.000]   You're managing themselves now.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.760]   Now he says what you're going to see and the opportunity that lies and people will look
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:28.040]   back and say oh you were alive in 2016.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:32.600]   You were you were around when the information age turned into the machine learning age.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:33.600]   And the artificial technology.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:37.000]   The ability of that like if you're a I accept an invitation for you or makes a car decision
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.720]   for you and is a bad result.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.720]   Is it your fault?
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:40.720]   Is it the company who made the eye as well?
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.720]   Is it the AI as well?
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.040]   Well that was another big story.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:47.760]   This year is a self-driving cars and wasn't the decision.
[00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:52.120]   This was the year that the first Tesla driver was killing a crash remember.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.360]   Right he wasn't self-driving.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:56.160]   It wasn't a self-driving car technically it was.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.160]   As it turns out yes.
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:01.880]   As it turns out neither the marketing can ask neither he nor the Tesla saw the truck
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:02.880]   across the road.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:04.880]   Yep.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.920]   And he was speeding and he plowed into it and passed away sad to say.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:12.920]   Nevertheless it brought up this whole fear of self-driving cars.
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.280]   And they weren't driving themselves last year.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:18.480]   It's like I remember when this sort of happened it's like what?
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.480]   When did that happen?
[00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.640]   When did cars learn to drive?
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:25.560]   This was also the year that a Tesla said we're going to put all the hardware in our
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:30.080]   Tesla's starting right now to do self-driving.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.800]   But we still have to work on the software a little bit.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.800]   But it'll be upgradable.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:37.320]   Well the funny thing is like the AI was a big story with assistance but you saw like
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:41.760]   Tim Cook start talking about how Apple uses AI in their devices for battery life.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:45.280]   Because it can intelligently figure out maybe what you're going to do next and then start
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.120]   to precache things for you.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:51.000]   So these technologies they've been doing this for years but now they're sort of talking
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   about it.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.800]   And it's become not just a thing that helps you make an appointment but something that
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.200]   preserves your battery life.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.420]   Adjust your phone performance and does all these things before you totally behind the
[00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:00.420]   scenes.
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:01.420]   We don't even see them.
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.420]   Didn't.
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:08.980]   A court decided who's responsible if your self-driving car causes a crash.
[00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:13.900]   No I think the National Highway Safety folks.
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:14.900]   And the NHTHS.
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:24.100]   What about acronyms is decided that the driver of a self-driving car is still responsible.
[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:28.700]   No is the whatever system is driving the car.
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:30.700]   Oh the driver is the software.
[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:31.700]   Yes.
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:35.700]   So how does that all play out.
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:40.380]   Oh there's a grandmother in that car but there's two kids in this one so the cars are
[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.340]   going to talk and say sorry granny the two kids.
[00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:46.340]   Yeah well that's what they're trying to figure out is they build out the AIs.
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:47.340]   It's ethical dilemmas.
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:51.780]   Yeah the MIT has this really interesting project called the moral machine that we've
[00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:54.180]   talked about on Twil a couple of times.
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:58.420]   Where you go and you help them answer scenarios.
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:02.180]   They're trying to get human intelligence to help answer those hard questions.
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:06.060]   How would the average person resolve these conflicts.
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:10.580]   And it's a fascinating exercise to make yourself go through.
[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.220]   It's a strange exercise.
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:16.820]   Like they bring some moral judgments into it where some of the scenarios tell you that
[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:21.220]   the person the car is about to hit if you don't swerve and hit something else is a criminal.
[00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:26.340]   So you know they try and bring some moral values into your decision making sure.
[00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:27.340]   Start judging.
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:31.860]   Okay what should the self-driving car do.
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:33.940]   So here's the choice.
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:34.940]   Oh this is terrible.
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:41.220]   Yeah so you could either plow into four pedestrians and kill them or you could swerve
[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:47.780]   and plow into a barricade and kill the passengers.
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:48.780]   Here's another one.
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:49.780]   It depends upon your point of view.
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:51.220]   Oh and there's an IC.
[00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:54.420]   So if you swerve into it's a Kobayashi Maru.
[00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:55.980]   It is and they give you some context.
[00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:57.860]   I'm not seeing it on your screen right now but they.
[00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:00.780]   In this case self-driving car with sudden brake failure will continue ahead and drive
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:02.740]   through the pedestrian crossing ahead.
[00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.860]   One male athlete will die.
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:07.060]   One man one homeless person one girl one criminal.
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:08.860]   Now here's what I think about this.
[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:10.500]   The car doesn't freaking know that.
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:14.540]   The car is going to do what you would do and I would do which is do the best it can.
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:18.300]   It's not going to make a calculus that says well this guy should survive this guy.
[00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:25.060]   It will attempt to avoid the accident as best it can just as you would do without doing
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:28.220]   the calculus of well that guy's an athlete and that's a grandmother.
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:29.540]   Let's kill the grandmother.
[00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:30.900]   That's a stupid question.
[00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:31.900]   It's not the kind of question.
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.500]   The ambulance chasing attorneys are just salivating.
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:37.780]   The robot chasing attorneys are just salivating.
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:41.020]   I actually think we're in a situation where you know we all think it's weird because we're
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:46.020]   not used to self-driving cars but as this all gets worked out I think you're rightly
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:49.860]   oh that people are going to look back and say were you worried about that.
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:50.860]   Exactly.
[00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:54.900]   Those human drivers were far more dangerous.
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:57.140]   That's the real point isn't it.
[00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:00.100]   The most interesting wrinkle I've seen on this thus far was something that caught my
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.420]   eye just this week.
[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:09.020]   A study out of UC Santa Cruz that wonders how pedestrians are going to react to knowing
[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:12.420]   that self-driving cars are programmed to avoid them.
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.420]   The article you pull up said they're going to bully.
[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:15.420]   Yes!
[00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:19.060]   They're going to bully the self-driving cars and across the street as slowly as I want
[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:20.060]   to.
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.340]   They're going to go play some stick ball in the street.
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:26.460]   Well having just visited New York for the first time in a long time last summer I can
[00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:30.140]   totally see this playing out where you get some pretty gutsy pedestrians.
[00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:31.140]   It just saved my life.
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:32.140]   Talking about traffic jam.
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:34.980]   The cars would just never move.
[00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:36.860]   You know this actually already did happen.
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:37.860]   This was the year.
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:41.140]   Remember that the Google car got in an accident.
[00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:43.220]   It plowed into a bus.
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:48.340]   Remember the car was driving autonomous vehicle driving down Mountain View in city traffic
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:51.540]   which is notoriously difficult for these cars.
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:55.620]   It would normally be in the lane to turn right but it turned out there was construction
[00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:56.620]   going on.
[00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:58.380]   It got to the end of that lane.
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:42:59.380]   There were barriers.
[00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:02.940]   It couldn't and it needed to merge back into traffic to go around the barrier.
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:09.580]   It saw the bus and it plowed into the bus because it assumed the software assumed.
[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:13.340]   The software's programmed to assume the bus will see me and let me in.
[00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:15.180]   That was a very slow speed accident.
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:17.140]   Nobody was hurt I should point out.
[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:21.780]   What Google said is yay that's good because now we're going to tune our software because
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:27.260]   we realize that what a human would do is look at the bus driver and see if the bus driver
[00:43:27.260 --> 00:43:31.580]   sees that eye contact and understands I'm going to get in and maybe even get a little
[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:34.620]   tacit or explicit permission to merge in.
[00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:36.140]   The software didn't do that.
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:38.300]   The software just assumed.
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:41.460]   The software's going to improve because of that.
[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:47.540]   This study says pedestrians know that drivers don't want to run them over.
[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:50.380]   So why not just step out into the street and assert the right of way?
[00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:55.220]   Well because there's always a small probability that drivers are in an attentive drunk, associate
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:57.420]   path or can't stop in time.
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:02.100]   On the other hand, if it's an autonomous vehicle, well I know it's going to stop.
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:07.780]   So crosswalk chicken from now on, pedestrians go, I'm walking in the street.
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:10.820]   You give the car a random number generator and one out of a million times it doesn't
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:13.420]   stop and that just keeps pedestrians on it.
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:22.660]   And to Denise's point, we often hear the argument that air travel is so much safer than freeway
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:23.900]   travel.
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:31.820]   And so yes, if automated cars do a better job than people, that's a strong defense for
[00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:34.940]   statistically speaking, it's still the safest way to travel.
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:35.940]   Right.
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:42.220]   And this also is the year that, actually last year was the year that fatalities in the highway
[00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:46.460]   went up after many years of decline because of distracted driving.
[00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:49.020]   Ah, this is such a problem.
[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:58.760]   So the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and HTSA suggested that it would be a good
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:03.260]   idea if Apple and Google, that we're not going to make you, but it would be a good idea
[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:08.420]   if you had software in your operating system that would prevent the driver from using the
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:09.420]   phone.
[00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:10.420]   Yes, not the passengers.
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:14.220]   The equivalent of a car mode to today is an airplane mode.
[00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:16.260]   These are non-technologists' suggestions.
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:20.140]   So they actually said, block the driver, but not the passenger.
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:21.460]   Well that was a bunch of the debate.
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:24.740]   I was reading the article and it was like, well passenger, like you have navigation software
[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:27.340]   and you have passengers and you have kids.
[00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:28.340]   And ways does that.
[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:31.140]   Way says, you know you shouldn't be doing this, but if you're a passenger, say I'm in
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:32.140]   a...
[00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:33.140]   Yeah.
[00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:34.700]   And the same thing with poking on a bunch of other things.
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:36.260]   It says I'm a passenger and you have to...
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:37.260]   Right.
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:39.980]   Supposedly I guess if you get in an accident and you hit that I'm a passenger button and
[00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:40.980]   you weren't, then you lied.
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:43.060]   You know, it's definitely your fault.
[00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:44.060]   Yeah.
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:47.140]   But I used to commute to work and there were people reading newspapers on their steering
[00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:48.140]   wheels.
[00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:49.140]   Oh.
[00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:50.140]   Putting on makeup.
[00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:51.140]   Absolutely.
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:52.140]   Turning around and yelling at the kids and while they're driving.
[00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:53.140]   Oh, I mean, it's a huge...
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:57.460]   How many of you can't debate the statistic that the highway deaths were declining until
[00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:58.460]   this last year.
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:45:59.460]   Absolutely.
[00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:04.460]   Right.
[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:05.460]   So they were up 10% in 2015 and in the first half of 2016 they're up like 15%.
[00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:09.660]   Well, who hasn't seen a car stopped at a green light?
[00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:11.540]   You know, the light turns green.
[00:46:11.540 --> 00:46:12.540]   Nothing happened myself.
[00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:13.540]   Right.
[00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:16.140]   I'm trying to find an emoji, Steve.
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.140]   I need this sarcastic face.
[00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:21.460]   If the person in the driver's seat is going like this, they're playing Pokemon Go.
[00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:22.940]   Yes, I know that for sure.
[00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:25.300]   Actually Pokemon Go won't work at past 10 miles an hour.
[00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:26.380]   No, yeah, they put a firm...
[00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:28.460]   But that didn't solve anything because people just slowed down.
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:29.460]   Right.
[00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:33.900]   But also, I mean, it's a whole big debate because there are people in rural areas who they just
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:37.140]   can't play at that point because it's like five miles between every Pokemon.
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:38.140]   Yeah.
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:45.060]   Well, I didn't play Ingress because at the time Petaluma was not a hip village and so
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:48.540]   there was very little ingress going on.
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:49.540]   So you had to be in...
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:50.540]   If you were in San Francisco, you could play Ingress.
[00:46:50.540 --> 00:46:51.540]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:55.180]   And then of course, Niantic, which created Ingress, then created Pokemon Go and apparently
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:58.780]   it's something that made Petaluma interested because you couldn't move.
[00:46:58.780 --> 00:46:59.780]   Yeah.
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:00.780]   Right.
[00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:01.780]   I remember going down to...
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:06.860]   Lisa and I were in San Diego in Coronado and there's one median strip where there were
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:14.180]   three pokey stops and there was at a gym in one small area and we're driving down this
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:16.740]   street and it looks like it's wood stock.
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:21.140]   Well, they had the incidents in Montreal somewhere, I think it was Singapore, where like
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:25.660]   a very rare Pokemon spawn and just hundreds of people flooded the area and police were
[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:27.460]   there trying to get them to disperse.
[00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:29.460]   Like, "No, I have to catch my Snorlax."
[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:30.460]   Wow.
[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:31.460]   Dido...
[00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:32.460]   See, it's lucky the dido came out now.
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:33.460]   Yes.
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:34.460]   Had the dido come out earlier.
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:36.140]   Well, dido is hard because you see, you don't know who it is.
[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:39.460]   You have to catch a normal Pokemon and then it could transform into a dido.
[00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:43.300]   So you've got to catch everything in case is a dido.
[00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:44.300]   That's...
[00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:45.300]   That keeps me awake.
[00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:46.300]   Where's more?
[00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:47.980]   I mean, when you look at the psychology that they're figuring out in order to get people
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:52.300]   to play and play in very specific ways, they must be employing tons of scientists to do
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:53.300]   all this stuff.
[00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:55.900]   By the way, that's Renee Richie, iMour.com.
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:58.940]   Denise Howell from This Week in Law and I love your...
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:47:59.940]   It's kind of a Grinch Stole Christmas.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:01.940]   Yes, it's a Grinchy hat.
[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:02.940]   It's a Grinchy hat.
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:03.940]   It's really cute.
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:08.660]   I apparently have an elf that has somehow got submerged in my cerebral cortex.
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:09.660]   This is weird.
[00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:11.180]   I should probably take this off.
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:13.340]   And Steve Gibson is also here from security now.
[00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:15.060]   We have a halo here for you too.
[00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:16.060]   Should you be so welcome to the halo?
[00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:22.460]   We thought you might wear the halo, Denise, but since you've recused yourself, I shall...
[00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:23.460]   I'm Grinch.
[00:48:23.460 --> 00:48:24.460]   There you go.
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:28.820]   Aw, I should be a victorious secret fashion show.
[00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:32.460]   This was the 40th anniversary this year of Apple Computer.
[00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:33.460]   40 years old.
[00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:35.060]   And they're still relevant.
[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:36.700]   Yeah, talking about old timers.
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:37.700]   Old timers.
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:40.060]   We're not celebrating the 40th anniversary of Commodore.
[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:41.060]   No.
[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:42.060]   Atari.
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:43.060]   Yeah.
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:44.060]   Radio Shack.
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:45.060]   No.
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:48.180]   It was a completely different company than it was 40 years ago.
[00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:51.380]   And I guess after 40 years, Apple decided you don't need a head contract.
[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:52.780]   You don't need a...
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:53.780]   You don't need a...
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:54.780]   USB-A ports.
[00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:55.780]   Come on.
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:57.780]   So this was the year.
[00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:01.300]   In fact, at the beginning of the year, I think it was the first story we covered in
[00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:07.220]   2016 was a consumer petition because of the rumor that Apple would be dumping the headphone
[00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:08.220]   jack.
[00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:16.780]   200,000 people, this was from the first tweet of the year, 200,000 people petitioned Apple
[00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:20.340]   to not ditch the headphone jack.
[00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:21.340]   So here we are.
[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:22.340]   They did.
[00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:28.340]   They shipped the iPhone 7 headphone jack, this iPhone 7 in September.
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:29.340]   You've got one.
[00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:30.340]   I've got one.
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:31.340]   I don't have one.
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:32.340]   No, you must be good girls.
[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:34.340]   They promised AirPods.
[00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:35.340]   Yes.
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:37.740]   You have some, but they're not the official ones.
[00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:38.740]   I have a free release.
[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:39.740]   I have a round hole.
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:40.740]   Wow.
[00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:42.220]   Did you drill that in your iPhone?
[00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:47.620]   It doesn't work as well now.
[00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:51.060]   So here we are a year later.
[00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:52.980]   It didn't seem to affect the sales of the iPhone 7.
[00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:55.540]   Those 200,000 people, I guess, changed their mind.
[00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:56.540]   Yeah.
[00:49:56.540 --> 00:50:02.780]   Well, I mean, it turns out it's not an issue for people who never used headphones or who
[00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:05.620]   always used them because people will always use them, just put the adapter on and forgot
[00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:06.620]   about it.
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:07.620]   You're an occasional user.
[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:09.340]   Like you just used them in convenience.
[00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:10.340]   That's what the inconvenience comes from.
[00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:12.860]   Yeah, well, they, because you wouldn't remember that you didn't have it and you get on the
[00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:14.780]   plane and by then it's too late.
[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:15.780]   There's just no hope for you.
[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:17.860]   So it's the in-flight entertainment system or nothing.
[00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:20.460]   That's a nightmare.
[00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:22.940]   AirPods, somebody wrote to Tim Cook.
[00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:25.260]   I think we don't know if this is a real email or not.
[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:26.700]   I don't think it's ever been verified.
[00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:33.220]   No, they, they wrote to Tim Cook saying, Tim, I'm a lot of be able to charge my iPhone
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:35.020]   and listen to music.
[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:36.980]   I know you're coming out with the AirPods.
[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:40.420]   Just let, just, you know, tweak your ear and let me know because if it's not going to
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:43.900]   be for a while, I'll go out and get somebody else's Bluetooth headphones.
[00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:48.660]   And Tim, supposedly, again, this hasn't been able to, we haven't been able to verify it,
[00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:49.780]   said in the next few weeks.
[00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:53.980]   So sometime before Christmas, maybe by the time you're watching this, I want to give
[00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:55.620]   them, I want to give them the stalking stuff for so likely.
[00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:59.260]   You'll be like Renee holding an AirPod in your hot little land.
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:01.340]   I want to give them as, there are the ultimate stalking stuff.
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:04.300]   I'm sure Apple retailers beside themselves that haven't been selling them since.
[00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:05.300]   And they look so alien.
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:08.580]   Yeah, they look like something right outside of what you thought.
[00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:10.220]   It'll go well with the Santa hat.
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:12.060]   It looks like you have icicles coming out of your ears.
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:14.380]   And are you a runner?
[00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:19.020]   I do know, I do like hiking, but I did a bunch of things to try.
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:22.180]   Because the courts don't pull and what if doesn't look as weird pulling them out.
[00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:24.700]   I, I, it does not look as weird as I thought.
[00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:26.860]   It looks a little strange.
