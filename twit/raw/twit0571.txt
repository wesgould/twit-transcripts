[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.040]   We'll talk a little bit about Pokemon Go
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.640]   and what it means culturally about the big news week behind us
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.140]   and the big news that can hit us
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.000]   and how new media is going to change how we gather the news.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.640]   And we'll do a little bit about Tesla and more.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.780]   It's all ahead.
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.240]   This week in Tech is next.

[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.960]   the show where we cover the latest Tech News.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.440]   And I feel like this is going to be a cozy, kind of fun
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.280]   Twit, because it's my buddies, my friends.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.680]   Christina Warren is here from Mashable Film Girl.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.920]   Always great to see you, Steve.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.360]   Love having a show.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.080]   Great to be here.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.000]   And yes, you are playing Pokemon Go.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.720]   Yeah, I am absolutely playing Pokemon Go.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.200]   OK, are you catching a Firo right now?
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.920]   No, I'm not.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.200]   OK.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.400]   I'm not.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.120]   There are two of you guys.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.680]   No, I'm absolutely playing Pokemon Go.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.520]   On two different phones with two different accounts.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.920]   Because--
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.200]   What?
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.560]   OK, this is problematic.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.320]   I wanted to start out with a Pikachu,
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.760]   and I realized I couldn't do starting over a whole new game.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.080]   And then I started catching Pokemon on that account
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.120]   that I didn't have on my other account.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.040]   So I'm kind of going back and forth with his.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.600]   Got to get him all.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.200]   Got to get him all.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.560]   Got to get him all.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.120]   Also here, Tim Stevens, who is now playing the game.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.760]   He wasn't when you dialed in 10 minutes ago.
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.480]   I've succumbed to peer pressure under about five minutes ago.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.000]   So I'm now part of the club.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.440]   Oh, man.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.960]   Oh, man.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.760]   Welcome from the roadshow.com, where he covers driving.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.800]   And Upper New York State.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.080]   Great to have you.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.920]   Thanks, Cleo.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.040]   And my old buddy, Tom Merritt, is here from--
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.520]   Hey, Leo.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.320]   --Daily Tech News Show.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.760]   Great to have you, DailyTechHeadlines.com.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.240]   And--
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.280]   Wait a minute, you have two.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.400]   What is this through?
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.320]   Well, yeah.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.320]   Daily Tech Headlines is just the headlines.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.160]   If you're looking for the news in less than 10 minutes a day,
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.080]   rather than a full--
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.680]   So you're doing two shows now.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.160]   Nice.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.760]   Excellent.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.960]   Do you do it different times?
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.960]   Or you do one after the other?
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.760]   How does that work?
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.480]   Yeah, I knock DailyTech Headlines out in the morning.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.800]   It's audio only.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.680]   It's for people who just want the boiled down headlines.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.920]   And then DailyTech News Show is still the same show
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.440]   it always was.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.800]   I think there's a real market for just the quick hit.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.320]   You know what we're trying to do?
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.920]   And you probably should, too, is try--
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.040]   And I think we can, is get it on the Amazon Echo
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.520]   as an option for the daily briefing, you know?
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.280]   The briefing would be perfect for that.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.560]   It's a good idea.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.560]   Oh, shoot.
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.920]   Damn it.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.440]   I use BBC for my briefing.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.040]   They don't have enough choices.
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.440]   But I think they're going to add some more.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.400]   And I think that would be a good idea.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.920]   But the most important question is,
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.680]   are you Team Mystic Team Valor or Team Mystic?
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.400]   I am Valor.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.920]   Red.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.960]   What are you?
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.640]   I'm Mystic.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.880]   I'm Blue.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.320]   And you're Valor, Christina?
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.440]   I'm Valor, absolutely.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.880]   All right.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.240]   To Tim, you've got five levels before you have to decide.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.760]   But let me just point out.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.480]   Actually, red seems to be dominant, isn't it?
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.200]   There's more Valor.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.920]   I'm Blue in my neighborhood.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.400]   But I think yellow is easily the smallest contingent.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.440]   Yeah, I feel like that's true.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.520]   So maybe that's the one to choose, or maybe not.
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.880]   Maybe you want to be on the biggest or the smallest?
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.400]   I'd rather be in the smallest, I think.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.120]   But I've got five levels anyway, so people can pitch me anyway
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.920]   and try to get me a giant car.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.320]   This is-- OK.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.680]   So if you just tuned in and you had high hopes
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.480]   that we would not talk about Pokemon Go--
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.360]   Let them be quashed now.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.440]   Look, it could be worse.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.200]   The Republican Convention starts tomorrow.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.800]   We could be talking about that.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.400]   So by the way, I understand that the Cleveland Convention
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.680]   Hall is a pokey gym.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.360]   Oh, I'm sure.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.360]   So--
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.360]   And then Blue and Red become whole different things.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.000]   That means a different thing.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.880]   And yellow could be libertarian.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.520]   So we'll just--
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.000]   Yes.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.000]   There's no green, unfortunately.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   They need green.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.800]   Wonderful to see you all here, and always fun.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.320]   And I guess, in a way, we--
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.680]   Pokemon Go, so I'm getting email now from people.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.440]   Nice guy, 50-year-old guy says.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.640]   I'm 50-year-old guy.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.280]   I love you.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.320]   I love the network.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.600]   Got two young daughters.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.600]   Please.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.920]   Do yourself a favor.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.720]   Stop talking about Pokemon Go.
[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.880]   That's nice of him, too.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.480]   I'm gonna interrupt you.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.240]   Do yourself a favor.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.600]   Usually, people say, I will never listen to you again
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.480]   if you don't stop.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.200]   This one is saying, just take some advice from me.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.920]   Take it down.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.400]   Take it down a notch.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.760]   But it's a story you cannot deny.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.240]   OK.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.280]   Oh, it's a huge story.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.480]   Question one.
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.560]   Have you guys ever seen anything on this scale of virality?
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.480]   I mean--
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.920]   Oh, but with that real style aspect of it, right?
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:40.120]   Like everywhere I go when we're out and about playing it,
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.520]   there are definitely other people playing it.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.800]   It's not like, oh, we're the only ones here.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.160]   Everywhere you go.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.560]   Everywhere.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.960]   I mean, we've certainly seen big viral hits before, right?
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.200]   With games and with apps.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.600]   But other than, I mean, just like almost a utility app
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.480]   and an Instagram or a Facebook or a Snapchat,
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.960]   this is the first time I've seen a game do this.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.120]   And certainly, this quickly, I think,
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.240]   this is caught on even faster than any of the social networks
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.000]   I talked about before.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.880]   I mean, like Tom, when I go out and I'm playing in the streets
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.480]   in New York, I'm not alone.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.840]   And even the first day, like it launched on a Wednesday night
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.760]   and that Thursday morning, I was walking to my subway stop.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.720]   And I was not the only one who had my phone out playing Pokemon
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.240]   Go.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.000]   And this is like six hours, seven hours after it launched.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.920]   So it's something I haven't--
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.160]   I can't recall seeing anything this big, this fast before.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.720]   And it's great to see something with so many positive aspects,
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.200]   too.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.120]   People actually getting out, walking around,
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.000]   getting some exercise, meeting each other,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.520]   teaming up to the cash of these things.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.000]   I think it's a great story.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.400]   Obviously, some people are having a negative reaction
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.440]   because it is all over every airline possible at this point.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.640]   But I think it's a great story that it's something
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.960]   that's actually getting people out and doing things
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.680]   and being sociable rather than just sharing the phone.
[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.960]   And we've had people cheering, like, hey, Pokemon, woo.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.360]   It's a positive thing for the different people that are playing it,
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:00.680]   too.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.560]   When I walk downtown and there--
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.040]   if there's a lure set-- and that's
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.800]   a thing that attracts players because you can get more
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.080]   Pokemon faster there--
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.040]   if there's a lure set and you can see it, especially
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.880]   if there's an area where there's several stops within an area
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.680]   that you can go, there's a park over here.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.720]   Nobody goes to.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.360]   Remember, Penry Park, Tom, up on the hill there with a cannon?
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.800]   Nobody goes there because it's up on a--
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.400]   you have to climb stairs to get to this postage stamp park.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.480]   And it's not that interesting.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.040]   But it has three pokey stops in the park,
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.640]   all within reach of one another.
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.280]   And people set lures in all three.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.720]   And there's dozens of people up on this hill that never has anybody,
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.600]   but maybe a homeless guy.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.600]   He's wondering, what the hell is going on?
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.720]   Or he's like, would you please let me just
[00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.560]   have some time to myself?
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:49.440]   This is my house.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.560]   What are you doing here?
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.480]   But there's friendly.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.920]   You go team red, team yellow.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.600]   There's friendly.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.680]   I think it looks as you see people walk down the street
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:58.680]   a little bit anti-social.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.200]   But there is a social component to it.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.280]   Well, this is what's so interesting to me.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.400]   So the original Pokemon game, if you think about it,
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.640]   was pretty social in a virtual sense.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.560]   You would take a link cable and connect your gameboy
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.920]   or gameboy color or whatever.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.600]   And you could trade Pokemon and battle that way, right?
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.080]   So there was definitely a social aspect,
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.120]   even though you were obsessed with your screen.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.840]   With Pokemon Go, it's almost the inverse.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.720]   Whereas you can't do anything.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.520]   Like, you know, where you can say what team we're on,
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.160]   but I can't give you a Pokemon.
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.040]   You know, I can't battle you.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.440]   Soon, I understand.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.440]   That's coming.
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.360]   I don't understand that's coming, but you know,
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.440]   but I can't do that right now.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.000]   But instead, what I can do is if I run into Tim,
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.960]   you know, and we're in the neighborhood together,
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.360]   we can talk and we move like,
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.280]   oh, there's one over here.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.160]   I found one over there.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.440]   So it's a weird thing where you don't have the social aspect
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.240]   inside the game itself, but instead,
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.400]   the entire outside world has strangely become
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.400]   a lot more social because we've all been kind of forced
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.480]   to converse with one another.
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.640]   I kind of love going to Friday evening.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.720]   We went to the big city, Santa Rosa.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.480]   It's the county seat, you know.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.840]   And I kind of, it used to be in the old days
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.000]   on a warm summer night, people would be out promenading,
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.720]   walking around.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.320]   And then in the last 10 years, it's just gotten pretty,
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.480]   not so much kind of deserted.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.400]   People don't go out anymore.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.600]   This was like the old days.
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.160]   There were all these people out of different generations,
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.880]   families, admittedly they were all starting their phone.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.960]   But they're, but not, you know.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.120]   So the question really is, is what is this phenomenon?
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.120]   Here's a graph from SurveyMonkey Intelligence,
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.120]   peak daily active users.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.520]   It is already in less than two weeks,
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.760]   the biggest US mobile game ever.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.120]   Best in Candy Crush saga, draw something,
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.200]   remember draw something?
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.280]   That was over in a week.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.520]   As in go bottom and then,
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.440]   they bought it and then it died and they were like, what?
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.400]   Clash Royale, which came out in Slythera IO,
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.880]   which came out this year,
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.920]   easily besting all of those.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.360]   The real question, and I think a lot of the naysayers say,
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.160]   oh yeah, in two weeks, it'll be Pokemon Who?
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.440]   I don't know if that's the case.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.120]   I think this has legs.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.160]   Yeah, I mean, I think if they can continue to add more Pokemon
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.000]   to it, if they can continue to add features,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.160]   there's been reports that if you go into the code,
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.640]   they're going to have sponsored gems,
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.720]   like they might have a partnership with McDonald's.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.360]   So every McDonald's location is a gem.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.320]   If they do add in the social features,
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.400]   like being able to battle one another
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.080]   and trade Pokemon with one another,
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.720]   I think that could keep people engaged.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.560]   Is it going to be this huge,
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.040]   like, viral phenomenon forever where everybody is doing it?
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.920]   No, of course not.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.360]   But I think that this more than maybe some other types
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.680]   of viral hits we've seen has staying power provided
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.440]   they can continue to update the game,
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.080]   get rid of the bugs,
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.640]   continue to onboard new players
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.320]   because there's something simple about it.
[00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.040]   It's not a very, it's not a huge game.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.520]   It's not that complex at all.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.640]   It's really easy to do.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.360]   There's not a lot of overhead.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.680]   The gaming mechanics are really basic,
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.360]   but there's something really fun about it
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.160]   that not to mention the nostalgia factor for a lot of us
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.240]   that I think will keep this enduring longer
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.840]   than maybe the draw something's out there.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.360]   At least that's the hope.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.360]   I mean, or at least, hopefully for Nintendo's sake,
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.520]   that they can draw this out
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.680]   until the real Pokemon game comes out in the fall
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.640]   and gets that customer base really excited.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.480]   Nintendo stock.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.920]   Yeah, I wonder what the bottom of it is.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.840]   It will definitely not stay at this new,
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.680]   like everyone's interested in it level,
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.560]   but will they be able to sustain a certain number
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.680]   of people that will always be out in the parks
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.400]   and you'll always see the Pokemon Go people
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.400]   or will it go more towards what Ingress became
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.880]   where it's like, yeah, there's people playing it,
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.440]   but you don't really notice them.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.200]   Nintendo stock, of course, huge jumps.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.080]   Does Nintendo benefit from this
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.320]   or didn't they sell the Pokemon property
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.640]   off to the Pokemon company?
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.320]   They own 33% I think of the Pokemon company.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.400]   Is that right, Christina?
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.720]   Yeah, that is, that's correct.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.040]   And they license, I mean, they own the Pokemon characters
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:02.960]   and then the Pokemon company handles licensing
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.200]   and Pokemon company, of course,
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.280]   then work with Niantech.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.400]   So they get some money from this game.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.040]   I think what this really helps with them more
[00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.480]   than anything though, is the fact that people
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.000]   are actually talking about Nintendo in a positive way.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.040]   We're not being like, okay, 83, we saw Zelda and that was it.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.440]   And there's a console coming out
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.760]   that no one is really that excited about.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.360]   Instead, we're all really stoked about the fact that,
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.080]   you know, a Nintendo property is actually doing
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.600]   gangbusters on a handheld and people like me
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.640]   are thinking, God, you know, how much better would this game be
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.760]   if not to take anything away from Niantech,
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.720]   but how much better would this be if this was like
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:39.080]   a fully robust Pokemon experience from Nintendo
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.800]   and not licensed?
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.320]   And so it makes you kind of hope and cross your fingers
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.680]   and go pleased Nintendo, you know, like seriously
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.120]   consider making, you know, mobile first games
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.040]   that are not dedicated solely to your console or handhelds.
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.160]   - Mario go.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.640]   (laughs)
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.400]   - Well, that's the question is who benefits from this?
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:01.160]   I mean, Niantech is really taking a property ingress
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:06.160]   that it created, and it's just skinned basically, ingress
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.520]   and made it much more appealing, much more friendly.
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.120]   And they benefit because ingress, the players of ingress
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.320]   were the ones who established all of these pokey stops
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.760]   at pokey gyms way back when it's interesting in Petaluma,
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:24.480]   the places of interest the pokey gyms are mostly murals,
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.920]   not so much buildings.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:28.000]   - They're at Santa's high neighborhood.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:28.840]   - Is it the same there?
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.840]   - Same here.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.160]   - And it's because of ingress, right?
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.360]   People, I don't understand how it happened.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:39.320]   The company started in 2010, it was called Keyhole,
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.840]   John Hanky, Mr. Hanky, I like to call him, formed it.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:46.680]   And Google bought Keyhole, Keyhole was satellite imagery,
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.520]   and Google added the Keyhole satellite imagery
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.160]   to Google Maps and Google Earth.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.680]   And I guess what happened is once they were internal
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.160]   at Google, the engineers, Hanky and a couple of engineers
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.360]   created Niantech Labs, that was a Google company,
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.520]   did field trip, right, remember that?
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.720]   Which was walking around and getting like messages
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.560]   about points of interest, ingress.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.400]   - And ingress was kind of one of those cult hits,
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.320]   it never broke out, but was, can you still play it?
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.160]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.480]   - Still around.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.200]   - But I didn't think they learned a lot from ingress,
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:23.920]   licensed the pokey mon characters and created Pokemon Go.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.720]   Does Google, I don't know, Google spun it out,
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.560]   I wonder if Google--
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.640]   - Yeah, Google spun it out.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.960]   - Do they probably though have significant--
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.800]   - They have a stake in it.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:30.640]   - Yeah.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:31.640]   - Yeah.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.360]   - So Nintendo has a stake in one side,
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.600]   Google has a stake in the other,
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.560]   and Apple's getting 30% of all the in-game transaction.
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.080]   - Yeah, on iPhones.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:41.120]   - Everybody's making money.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.320]   - But it's all run by the CIA
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.520]   if you listen to the conspiracy.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.520]   - All right, so what are the privacy implications?
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:50.080]   There was a misstep early on where you could use
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.240]   your Google account, and most people did because
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.720]   the Pokemon trainer accounts were blocked like crazy,
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.000]   'cause so many people were using it.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.520]   So they signed up with Google, and the way it was set up
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.600]   was incorrect, and it gave them full Google permissions,
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.520]   which is typically only given to browsers
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.200]   and operating systems.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.040]   - Right.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.040]   - So that was a mistake.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.840]   They patched it, it's been patched all around.
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.680]   It now does the normal kind of permissions
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.140]   that any game might do using the OAuth features of Google.
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:20.360]   But there are still persist these concerns.
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.400]   For instance, people saying,
[00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.640]   yeah, all you're just handing your continuous GPS coordinates
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.720]   over to some strange company that might be handing it
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.960]   over to the CIA.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.080]   Is there a privacy concern?
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.520]   - I don't think so personally.
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.880]   I think people aren't really aware of how much
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.320]   of that data is already being tracked,
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.280]   but certainly if they're using any kind of navigation
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.360]   software in their phones.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.440]   - Google already knows everywhere you are.
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.160]   - I was gonna say Google already knows where you are.
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.600]   - Oh, you have to just look at your Google dashboard.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.360]   You can see everywhere you've been,
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.720]   your location history, unless you've disabled that.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.840]   - Right, and any time the Google predicts navigation
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.680]   before, you just says,
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.520]   hey, are you trying to go here?
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.360]   I'll give you directions.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:58.640]   And obviously Google's already figured out
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.480]   that where you're going before you even get there.
[00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.840]   So the sort of thing certainly doesn't bother me.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.840]   As long as users are getting something out of it,
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.440]   and obviously, you know, people are having good time with it.
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.680]   So that's fine.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.800]   It's not a problem for me.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.520]   I think that it's just something that people
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.440]   are still slowly getting around the idea
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.360]   that their phones know a lot more about them
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.640]   than they think they do.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:20.200]   - I feel like the key is always transparency.
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.760]   As long as I know that it's collecting data about me,
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.920]   and in this case, I know the Pokemon goes collecting
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.080]   location data 'cause it can't work otherwise,
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.200]   and I know what they're gonna do with it,
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.960]   then I have the right to either play the game or not.
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.080]   What was disturbing is that when you did log in
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.160]   with a Google account, it didn't say,
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.080]   would you like to get full permission,
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.960]   it just signed you up and gave full permission.
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.840]   I'm still waiting for Google to explain
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:48.000]   how any authentication could ever give full permission,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.600]   even by accident, without alerting the user
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.920]   that it was about to do so.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.760]   - That's a good point.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:53.600]   - No, totally.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.480]   And I mean, honestly, that was a really big,
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.200]   to me, that was, I think, the reason
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.440]   that they had to patch it so quickly
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.000]   and came back with their response so quickly,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.400]   because that wasn't just a violation.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.480]   I think that's technically a violation of Google's APIs.
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.040]   There's supposed to be a pop-up that says,
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.600]   this is what you give and this is what it can do.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.160]   And in fact, that's now what the Google account log in says.
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.360]   It'll say, we cannot access your account,
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.080]   but we can, we know your email address,
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:18.960]   and it's just like Leo was saying, a simple OAuth,
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.840]   but it didn't give you any of that before.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.520]   And I think that's a violation of Google's policies
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.920]   around using their log in.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.080]   It's certainly a violation of App Store rules,
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.440]   because the App Store is very clear
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.440]   about, at least on iOS, saying,
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.520]   this is where the problem was, was on the iOS side,
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.720]   that if you're taking permission for some sort of other
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.440]   third-party log in, you've got to display
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.760]   what's happening to the user.
[00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.840]   And the fact that it wasn't is problematic,
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.560]   and then it kind of makes you think, at least to me,
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.880]   anyway, I'm going, how many other apps are out there
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.680]   that are using Google tokens that don't show up
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.320]   the proper modal window?
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.400]   You know, but--
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.240]   - Right.
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.560]   - Well, you could find out, it's easy enough
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.520]   you go to your account access, and you could see,
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.600]   in fact, the good side of this is that they get brought
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.760]   a lot of people to that part of Google, their page,
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.000]   to see what apps had, that permissions,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.200]   what the permissions were, had to turn off any apps
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:09.080]   that they didn't want to continue with those permissions.
[00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:11.320]   I, of course, neatly turned off Niantic,
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.320]   and-- - I definitely found a couple myself.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.840]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.800]   - But you'll notice they had this--
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:18.920]   - That app has not been around in years,
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.480]   why is that still a permission to do it out?
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.480]   - Twitter and Facebook too, because anybody,
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.360]   you know, the single sign on systems,
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.560]   that's, you know, you want to make sure
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.120]   you print those periodically.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.240]   So there's a benefit, I guess, to this point.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.600]   You know, the thing, one thing that struck me
[00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:33.840]   is it's a shame Google didn't come up with this
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.600]   before Google Glass fizzled out,
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.400]   'cause Glass would have been a perfect,
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.040]   perfect for Pokemon Go.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.040]   (laughs)
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:41.880]   - Totally.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.120]   Well, already we've seen, you know,
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.760]   somebody's got kind of like a demo setup
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.200]   of how it could work with HoloLens,
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.440]   and obviously HoloLens isn't perfect for Pokemon Go,
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.640]   'cause you're kind of tethered to your device,
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.760]   but to me, this just kind of proves that eventually,
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.200]   you know, if not this particular game, other types of games,
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.120]   we'll be able to kind of take advantage of this stuff,
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:02.720]   this sort of augmented reality kind of world.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.800]   These, you know-- - It's faux augmented reality.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.280]   Let's-- - Yes, it's completely,
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.400]   absolutely, absolutely.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.480]   - Fogue-mented reality.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:10.280]   - Fogue- (laughs)
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.520]   - Because, and in fact, most people probably by now
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.160]   have turned it off to save battery life
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.160]   and to make it easier to catch Pokemon.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.800]   But it was cool, and you know what,
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.120]   the smart thing was it spawned a million Instagram shots.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.200]   - Exactly. - Of Pokemon
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.320]   in your world.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.920]   But, and I also think there's a, there is,
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.360]   it is a nice breaker.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.160]   It's gonna make people a little bit more comfortable
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.000]   with the idea of technology in the real world,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.440]   and kind of an interface between technology
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.600]   and your real environment.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.240]   - Yeah, it's, this is what people will look back and say,
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.360]   augmented reality broke through
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.480]   into public consciousness with Pokemon Go,
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.280]   because now you can say, if someone says,
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.400]   what's augmented reality, you can say Pokemon Go,
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.480]   and a large percentage of people will understand,
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.680]   oh, okay, I get it now.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.800]   And it makes us more comfortable with walking around,
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:56.400]   I guess we already were somewhat with maps,
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.120]   but maybe more so walking around,
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.720]   interacting with our real world using our device.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.680]   - Sure. - Yeah, I mean,
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.120]   I think that the difference is between,
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.960]   you know, a mapping situation, it's a utility,
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.640]   and so you're trying to find a place to go,
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.400]   and so you can kind of, you're not,
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.960]   you know, there's, you're not that self-conscious about it.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.800]   This, as people are becoming less and less self-conscious
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.000]   about the fact that like, they're,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.560]   they've got their phone out and are looking for Pokemon,
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:22.560]   in the middle of the world,
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:26.000]   I think we'll kind of lessen the stigma
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.440]   for future types of games like this.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.560]   - We were pulled over the side of the road at a Poke Stop,
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.720]   and just having fun watching people walking down the sidewalk,
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.400]   looking at their phones and trying to say,
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.240]   okay, just on their phone or Pokemon.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.080]   - Right. - And you could tell,
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.360]   because they would stop and start, you know,
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.040]   spinning and catching Pokemon instead.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.160]   - You could absolutely tell. - Yeah.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.480]   But it's, it's made me aware of how many people
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.720]   just walk around looking at their phones
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.560]   who weren't playing Pokemon.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.140]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:22:01.280]   It feels like this is some, somehow qualitatively,
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.000]   as well as quantitatively different
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.560]   from anything we've ever seen before.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.200]   And I just, it's hard to say what exactly it means.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.760]   For instance, you know, we know now that self-driving cars
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.480]   and Uber and many of these vehicles that are mapping
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.960]   the world have all sorts of utility
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.320]   for the company that owns them.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.920]   What can Google do or an Iantic do?
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.920]   It is, because Google gets the data, right?
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.720]   This is, the stack goes through Google.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.560]   So the, the, the, the, they're using Google code,
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.520]   they're using the maps.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.440]   So the, the, all the data is going through Google.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.760]   What can they do with that?
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:41.720]   - I mean, I guess they could look at certain types
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.720]   of gathering patterns. - Patterns.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.720]   - You know? - Yeah.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.720]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.720]   - See what, what type of, what sorts of people
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.720]   are nearby, what times they'll congregate, you know,
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.800]   what types of, you know, maybe even, you know,
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.680]   how people will move through things.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.680]   Yeah, I mean, I would just think pattern data
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.400]   would be one of the things they could get.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.560]   And, and presumably, I mean, but yeah.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:04.960]   - Now I was just going to say it's,
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.960]   it's a little bit clouded by, it's only data
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:08.720]   of people playing the game.
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.800]   - Right. - Versus something like ways,
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.880]   which is everybody who's driving.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.600]   So you can't really tell if, if that is normal
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.880]   for that area or if that's just because it happens to have a gym.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:17.720]   - Right.
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.800]   - But yeah, there's, there's something there for sure
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.760]   in being able to tell population clusters
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:26.760]   and which stops and gyms get the most traffic, et cetera.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.280]   - And there, of course, the revenue opportunities as well
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.880]   when it comes to licensing these things
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.000]   and creating deals and, you know,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.240]   getting some money off of a drink,
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.720]   if you're playing Pokemon, go with that kind of thing,
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.560]   which ultimately I think is where this is,
[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.600]   this is of course heaven.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.880]   - Huge money in this.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.280]   This is, they've just, they haven't begun to tap
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.240]   the gold mine that is this game.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.280]   - Yeah, no, I mean, the only, only build challenge
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.080]   I think they're gonna have is obviously kind of striking
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.040]   while the iron is still really hot because I'm not like,
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.000]   some of the skeptics who think this is going to disappear
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.400]   overnight, I think that this is going to last longer,
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.760]   but they've got to start turning on that monetization spicket,
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.400]   you know, ASAP, beyond just the in-app purchase stuff
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.480]   because, you know, while you've got people engaged,
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.480]   start making the money.
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.400]   Don't, don't fall into the trap of Zinga, you know,
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.000]   and draw something, you know, as you were kind of mentioning
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.600]   before and not, you know, taking advantage of it
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.200]   while while people are out there.
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:16.480]   - Well, - In terms of one of the parallels
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.640]   is blizzard in that you have to keep adding things
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.360]   to the game like they did with World of Warcraft to say,
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.640]   okay, it's not just enough to have an MMO,
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.320]   how do you keep people playing it?
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.520]   Pokemon Go is gonna have to figure that out as well.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.360]   - And I think we are smarter about this kind of thing.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.840]   I think a lot of, these guys are thinking hard about this
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.480]   and I'm, it's not a complete accident that this game is
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.680]   such a success, they learned from Ingress.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:43.280]   This is, this is not accidental.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.960]   Timing might be accidental and by the way,
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.240]   timing greatly benefited it because I think we were all
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.000]   a little depressed over the last couple of weeks
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.720]   and having something fun that brings us out of our houses,
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:57.040]   we had a real salubrious effect psychologically,
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.880]   at least in the US, but I would guess around the world.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.720]   - I mean, getting out of school as well
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.680]   in pretty good timing there.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.520]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:04.840]   - Oh, that's right, summer time.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.480]   - Perfect timing on that yet.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.600]   Now everybody's out for the summer.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:11.080]   - Can't keep the servers up, that's the biggest frustration.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.520]   That could hurt them, right?
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.600]   People get frustrated and say,
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.840]   "I'm not playing this dumb game,"
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.240]   although I don't see that happening.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.120]   - That's the magical thing about it, right?
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.720]   Like, by all respects, everyone should have abandoned this game
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.720]   because it's unreliability, but people just keep playing it anyway.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.560]   - It's like Twitter.
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.840]   - Exactly, well, it's just like, wow,
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.480]   like it's just like early World of Warcraft days
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.280]   where like literally like you get in and like,
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.880]   you're like, "I'm never logging out again
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.720]   "because I'm on right now, I'm on the server,
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.840]   "I'm never getting off again."
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.640]   Or you continue to just kind of like hammer in
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.640]   and open the app over and over again until you get in.
[00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.160]   But yeah, you're right, Tom, by all accounts,
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.560]   we should all have been like, "Screw this,"
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.320]   but instead we're like, "No, please, please, please, please, please,
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.760]   "give us a shot, so to say."
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.480]   - All right, I'll kill it again for the fifth time
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.600]   in the past 10 minutes, but I'm not stopping playing the game.
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.880]   - But given the amount of money they're already making
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.600]   and the early estimates were $2 million a day,
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.880]   I would say it's an order of magnitude greater than that today.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.160]   And so they're clearly making plenty of money.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.000]   Why can't they keep the servers up?
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.960]   - They just, it's like anything else.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:14.760]   They never, you can never properly estimate a hit.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.720]   And so whenever you've got something that's successful,
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.840]   it will always go past whatever the system administrator
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.760]   is expected because you can't test a hit
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.040]   until you have a hit.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.440]   And I assume that's what's going on.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.720]   - They initially slowed the rollout.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.680]   They went to America, Australia, New Zealand,
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.520]   but they have seemed to turn the steam back on.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.760]   Probably Christina, as you point out,
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.040]   they want to capitalize on this before it all goes away.
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:39.880]   - Totally.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.000]   - So they went to Germany, Spain, the UK, and Italy,
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.280]   and then now 26 more countries,
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.920]   Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus,
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:51.600]   Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece,
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.520]   Greenland, Hungary, Iceland, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia,
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.400]   Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.320]   It's not in Russia, notice.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.680]   - So all of Europe, basically.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.840]   I wonder when it's coming to Asia,
[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:07.440]   that's gonna be, I think, a really interesting test.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.440]   - Hopefully by the end of August.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.560]   - Because I'm going to Japan.
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:13.920]   - Yeah, I wonder how many people in Japan,
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.200]   'cause you know, they've, or soaps as the Pokemon anyway.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.760]   - Oh my God, it would kill the surface,
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.600]   'cause 100% would play.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:20.440]   - Yeah.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.640]   - You'd have 100% penetration.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.080]   - Oh my God, when are you going to Japan?
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.000]   - End of August, first week of September.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.560]   - Okay, you must report back.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:29.400]   - Yes. - Yeah.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.240]   - Absolutely.
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.280]   - 'Cause you'll be on the front lawn.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.320]   - You'll be on the front lawn, we'll have it on.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:37.320]   You'll be on the front lawns of the Pokemon Mania in Tokyo.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.440]   - It'll be insane.
[00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.520]   - Hope that I catch all the gyms,
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.120]   'cause I've already been playing for a long time.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.520]   (laughing)
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.280]   - Lots of concern, well, of course, a couple of,
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.440]   you know, there's a lot of hate going on,
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.800]   a lot of people aren't playing hate it.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.120]   And, you know, it's gotten almost to the point
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.600]   sometimes where you're walking around playing it,
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.760]   and people are just being rude.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:58.200]   I had an older fellow go, "Hey."
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.160]   I was like 20 feet away, I said, "What?"
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:01.520]   He said, "I don't want you to run into me.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.000]   Okay, I won't run into you."
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.440]   (laughing)
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.600]   I actually said, I had the president of mine say,
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.840]   "Sir, if I run into you, you will know it."
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.040]   (laughing)
[00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:14.920]   Which was rude, 'cause I understand how they feel.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:19.920]   Like, it must be really frustrating and annoying
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:25.440]   if you don't get it, and all these people are doing it.
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.680]   It's like, what's wrong with you people?
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:30.160]   It's like the invasion of the body snatchers.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.840]   - It's bad enough when everyone's walking around
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.760]   looking at their phones, which is already happening.
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.640]   Now you have people who unexpectedly stop
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.200]   and are so absorbed that they don't realize
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.520]   the traffic is flowing around them.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.360]   So yeah, it takes a little bit of self responsibility to say,
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:44.840]   "You know what? If you're playing this,
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.640]   pull over to the side of the sidewalk,
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.680]   get out of the way of traffic.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.760]   Don't keep walking while you're battling, et cetera."
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.800]   - You saw the amazing, I know you've all seen
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.080]   the amazing video from Central Park.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.400]   - Yeah.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:00.520]   - Where I guess a rare Pokemon shows up,
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:04.520]   and the crowd stampedes.
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.840]   And what's amazing in this video is,
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.800]   right at the beginning of it,
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.360]   you see a guy, he's in the street,
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.200]   jump out of his car and abandon it.
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.640]   Leave it.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.120]   Just run away, I guess.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.520]   What was the Pokemon they saw?
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:23.080]   I didn't, it was, I don't know, it was rare.
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.080]   - Vaparian.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.120]   - A vaparian.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:25.960]   See, watch.
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:29.400]   Oh, wait a minute, let me roll it back a little bit.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.720]   This guy gets out of the car and leaves it.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.600]   He was running into the park.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:38.720]   And look at everybody's taping it and...
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:42.600]   - To be fair, that traffic is not moving, so.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.440]   - Right.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.000]   - Yeah, I, who's like, I've got time.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.360]   - It was a vaparian.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.640]   Is that even that rare?
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:51.760]   - Yeah, it's really rare.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:52.600]   - Yeah.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.440]   - I'm low and calm.
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.360]   - That's my expert.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:56.520]   - I mean, I don't know.
[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:57.760]   - That's an evolved Eevee.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.600]   So if you have an Eevee,
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.680]   you're gonna get a vaparian eventually,
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.480]   but man, it'll save you some time.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:06.240]   Eevee's evolving a whole bunch of stuff, so.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.320]   - But what's, what's,
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.160]   - I have a vault here.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.000]   - Not.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.120]   (laughs)
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.280]   - I'm sorry, go ahead, Christine.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.680]   - I have one too, Leo, it's okay.
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.760]   (laughs)
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:19.560]   - There's, to say what's amazing is,
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.640]   is that like literally I think they,
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.360]   there were people who probably were playing
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:24.840]   and wanted to do it, and then there was probably
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:26.640]   because at Central Park and you just see a ton of people
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.120]   in any way, they're just like,
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:29.120]   oh my God, what's happening?
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:29.960]   I have to be part of this.
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:30.800]   Like what's happening?
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.000]   I think there's people who were wanting to play the game
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:33.840]   and people who were just like,
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.480]   oh, crowd is moving, must follow, must record.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.120]   - It was a flash mob.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:41.720]   - It's completely a spontaneous flash mob.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:47.200]   So far, the good news is not too many people have been hurt.
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.000]   A couple of guys walked off a cliff.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.480]   Probably there were other circumstances involved.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.600]   - You'd have to be pretty oblivious to walk off a cliff.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.400]   - It is not normal expected behavior in this game.
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.920]   - No, it doesn't urge you to walk off cliffs.
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.920]   - No, not even close.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:10.920]   So very early on, a young woman found a body in a river.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.240]   - Yeah.
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.560]   - That's not the game fault of anything
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:14.960]   that just was probably like,
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:15.960]   it was a good thing.
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:16.800]   It was a good thing.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.440]   I mean, also shows us how much screw-ups stuff happens
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.880]   where that happened in Montana.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.000]   It's like, wow.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.320]   - The good news is, by the way,
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.000]   those guys suffered injuries,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:25.920]   but they didn't die.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:26.760]   The moderate injuries.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:27.600]   - Well, that is very good.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.440]   - So they're okay.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:32.320]   And probably great injuries to their,
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:35.720]   quitely embarrassed, great injuries to their ego,
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.680]   their pride.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.880]   That's just dumb.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.760]   - I mean, cliffs,
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:46.280]   it implies like, you know, road runner type,
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:47.600]   wildy coyotes.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.520]   This is a beach where it was a little bit of a sand break
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.360]   they felt that.
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.760]   - Right, I felt it was a sand drop.
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.080]   - Yeah, actually, I think that's one of the things
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.120]   that's gonna be a side effect.
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:59.880]   This is a lot of media hysteria about
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:00.720]   - Oh yeah.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.880]   - How people do stupid things, planes.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.960]   - Oh yeah, no, we're all watching for it.
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.200]   And then of course, last week,
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.040]   there was the robberies,
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:11.480]   which was, you know, I think that my tagline,
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:12.320]   when I had to write about that,
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.680]   I was like, I was literally like,
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:16.080]   I was like, this is why we can't have nice things.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.400]   Because, you know, people go into pokey stops
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.760]   to ambush people and rob them.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.280]   Although at this point, it might get harder to do that
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.320]   because it stops you become more popular,
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.480]   more and more people are gonna show up
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.240]   and you might be, you know, like,
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.160]   if you're trying to jump someone
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.080]   and there are like 20 Pokemon go players around,
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:33.960]   it might not be the best option.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.680]   - I think it's good for our, yeah,
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.560]   it's good for our downtowns.
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.160]   Here is a public service I give you,
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.360]   MMOserverstatus.com.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.800]   This is a site that--
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:43.880]   - Oh, it's back up.
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.440]   I couldn't get to MMOserverstatus.com.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.440]   (laughing)
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.000]   - But the server status down.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.560]   So it shows you ping times in not all the regions,
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:57.160]   but in the most of the region.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.400]   So it's down in the, right now in the UK, Spain,
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.400]   Germany and Italy and Portugal,
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.080]   but it's going all right in the US, Australia
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.760]   and Netherlands, New Zealand and other regions.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.180]   It's just bizarre.
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:10.260]   It's just bizarre.
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:16.520]   You know, I feel like they ought to know,
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:19.520]   they ought to know how to scale up.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.800]   I think the problem is you can't buy enough servers.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.960]   - Well, and there's also reports of a DDoS attack
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.960]   against them this week too.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:25.800]   - Okay, is that credible?
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:30.000]   That was from a hacker team called,
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:30.840]   what do they call themselves?
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.840]   Some silly name, PoodleCorp.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:36.720]   PoodleCorp took credit.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.720]   - I mean, DDoS is easy.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.640]   - If I'm PoodleCorp, I'm gonna take credit.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.560]   - DDoSes are easy to perform
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.200]   and they're also easy to take credit for,
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.040]   so who knows?
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:45.880]   - Yeah, who knows.
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.160]   - I wouldn't doubt that someone has tried it,
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.280]   whether it's the reason for this or not, who knows?
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:54.320]   - From the Hill, the Capitol Hill blog, thehill.com,
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:59.240]   Pokemon Go, craze, swarms, Capitol Hill,
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.040]   not just tourists, but I would best staffers.
[00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:04.840]   - Oh yeah, you know that the staffers in the intern,
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.040]   this is what they're doing right now.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.760]   - Fortunately, our members of Congress
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.960]   are probably not playing Pokemon Go,
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.360]   but only because they have blackberries.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.200]   - All right.
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:16.480]   - No, they don't, most of them have iPhones.
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:20.560]   - Here's Lynn Jenkins, she's a member of Congress.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:25.160]   Things I've caught in my office, Mice and this, a spirit.
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.200]   - Yeah, in the-- - Depends on the demo
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.040]   you're after.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.160]   You might wanna play Pokemon.
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:30.640]   - Yeah, be good for your career.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:32.960]   Here's the US Marines, found a Pikachu.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.920]   Gotta catch 'em all.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.200]   - Protecting our Pikachu's.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.200]   - Yep, thank you boys.
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.240]   - Remember when a photo of John McCain playing,
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:43.320]   like, Solitaire or something on his phone
[00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.400]   or some sort of, he was playing some sort of game on it,
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.040]   his phone during the Senate.
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:49.400]   Someone caught him on his iPhone.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:53.280]   I would, if I were people on C-SPAN right now,
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:54.160]   that's what I would be doing.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:57.720]   I would be like looking for shots of the galleys
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.960]   to see who's playing Pokemon Go
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.920]   while sitting in Congress.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.680]   - Whose fingers are going up regularly on their phones?
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.000]   - And of course, John Ledger immediately jumping on this
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.120]   and zero rating Pokemon Go.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:12.280]   If you're a T-Mobile customer,
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:14.720]   you get free Pokemon Go data for a year.
[00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:16.200]   It doesn't use that much data.
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.040]   - No, it does not.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.480]   - And you have to do their crazy Tuesday app to get it too.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.240]   It's not even that much data.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:23.680]   Just make it for all the subscribers.
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:24.760]   Come on, really?
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:25.600]   Come on.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:26.480]   - It really wants people to download the app.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.320]   Come on.
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.040]   - So what do I have to download an app?
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.800]   What's it called?
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.400]   - Yeah.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.160]   - T-Mobile Tuesdays.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.440]   - You get like a deal's app.
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.000]   You gotta download that and then on Tuesday.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.520]   - Yeah, the T-Mobile Tuesdays.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:42.000]   - Yeah, so then you can claim the free data thing.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.760]   You got until August 9th, I think,
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.480]   to claim the free data for Pokemon Go for a year.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:50.920]   And like Tom saying, it uses 10 or 20 megabytes
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.080]   an hour or something.
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:52.920]   - I checked.
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.480]   - Yeah, it wasn't too bad.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.320]   - Yeah.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.440]   - So for most users, I think are probably fine.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:02.000]   But give it to John Ledger and T-Mobile
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.960]   for fighting a hot trend and capitalizing on it.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:08.080]   - By the way, who do they have introducing T-Mobile Tuesday?
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.520]   DJ Khaled.
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:10.360]   - Oh yeah.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.160]   - So they, he knows, he really knows.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.960]   John knows how to jump on every gosh darn trend.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.400]   There is free data alert.
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.040]   - Hey, it's DJ Khaled.
[00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:22.160]   And I just wanted to tell you, don't play yourself Leo.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.400]   (laughing)
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:28.040]   Oh Lord, oh my gosh.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:32.040]   He's a Snapchat star, mainly, right?
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.160]   Yeah.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.800]   I don't, I still don't get it.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:37.680]   - I think it's a day for free stuff and epic prizes.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:41.360]   This Tuesday and another one just for being you.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.200]   - I love that.
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.960]   - Tuesday's the new Saturday.
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.000]   It's Saturday's due itself.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   - Let's not.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.840]   - Get the T-Mobile Tuesday's app.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.680]   - Let's all.
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.040]   - I really, sometimes I feel like,
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.680]   I feel kind of disoriented.
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:57.680]   And I guess, I understand how non-Pokemon go players feel.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.720]   I feel like the world has left me behind.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.280]   And I look at DJ Khaled and I go, Khaled or whatever.
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.120]   And I go. - Khaled.
[00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:05.480]   - Khaled. - Khaled.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:09.120]   And I go, I think, my time here is almost over.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.560]   - Do you follow him on Snapchat?
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:11.600]   - I do.
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.800]   - Way to go. - That's even more baffling.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.120]   (laughing)
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.240]   It's like, what the what?
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.640]   What am I seeing here?
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.680]   - Secure your bag, blast up.
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.480]   - Good.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.760]   - I just think, you know, my time is almost over
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.320]   and I don't understand the world anymore.
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.640]   This, I guess that's what happens.
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:31.000]   When you get to a certain age, I now understand it.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:31.920]   When you get to a certain age,
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.640]   you just look at the world and you go, yeah,
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.240]   I guess it's over for me.
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:39.360]   I no longer understand anything.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.960]   - Do you just need to get DJ Khaled
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.680]   to swing by the Twit Studios?
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:43.960]   - Explain it all. - And just to talk.
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.320]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.160]   Explain it all to me.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.440]   - I've got just some major keys with you.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.960]   - Yeah. - Absolutely.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:49.800]   I like that.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:54.160]   - So you guys are all in the DJ Khaled group here.
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:55.680]   You understand it, right?
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.000]   'Cause you're young people.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.960]   - I think I'm borderline in that case.
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.320]   So I don't know.
[00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.160]   I'm mildly confused.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:06.480]   - I met him at a Beyonce concert
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.880]   and did take a selfie with him.
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:11.080]   Now, it was one of the things usually when I am in the vicinity
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.080]   of famous people.
[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.640]   I'm not a fan girl and I'm not like, take a selfie with me.
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:18.640]   But I figured like, if I was in a suite with DJ Khaled,
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.560]   I was like, yeah, I'm gonna walk up to you and get a selfie.
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.840]   He looked up on his phone for about two seconds.
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.760]   We got the selfie, went straight back to the phone.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:26.600]   - Is he jaded?
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:27.440]   - I am love.
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:30.600]   - Bless us, bless all, whatever.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.360]   - Bless up. - Bless up.
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.200]   - Yeah. - I don't know.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.800]   The lingo. - We the best, you know?
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:37.640]   - Last time you were on, you did Taylor Swift lyrics.
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.480]   How do you stay so young, Tom Merritt?
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.320]   - Eileen.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.520]   (laughing)
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.320]   - My wife would have just been to awe at that.
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.160]   (laughing)
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.000]   - Well, she has to.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.600]   She's at the YouTube facility down there in LA.
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.520]   She's got the pipeline, exactly.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:51.400]   - They're all in there.
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:54.160]   They're all, yeah, she's seeing them all.
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.560]   She's learning it.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:56.400]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.360]   Tom Merritt's here from the Daily Tech News Show.
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.880]   Great to have you, Tom.
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:03.560]   Once again, glad to see the fireplace is still there.
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:04.640]   - Yeah, it's still up.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:08.160]   - Still intact. How's the dog?
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.320]   - Dogs are great. - Good.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.840]   Dogs. - Doing well.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.920]   - Good, and Eileen, of course, miss her.
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.360]   - She's doing great, too. - Great to see you.
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:18.480]   From Mashable, the wonderful Christina Warren,
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:20.800]   she's film girl on the Twitter, film_girl.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.920]   And the Twitter still happening,
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:27.040]   or is Pokemon Go going to super-seat Twitter?
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:27.880]   It's all over now, right?
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:31.200]   - I mean, we are just in a Pokemon Go universe.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.960]   And so my great displeasure,
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.200]   my Pokemon Go name is not film_girl
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.200]   because they don't allow any scores.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.800]   So I'm Christina Mon, so it's a whole new brand for me.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.680]   So I'm starting over.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:44.520]   - I'm sorry, what'd you say?
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.320]   I just have to get this ratata.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:50.480]   Yeah, I'm Chief Twit.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:51.320]   I'm Chief Twit.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.680]   What's your handle, Tom?
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:55.400]   - It's Ace Detect as usual.
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.440]   - Good, you got it.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.840]   And Tim, have you come up with a clever handle
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.840]   for your Pokemon Go?
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:06.320]   - I'm Zapp Rousdauer because I'm a mystery science
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.360]   theater 3000 nerd.
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.600]   - I like that.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:09.440]   - I love that.
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.440]   - Good job.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.200]   - I don't even know how to spell it, but I like it.
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.400]   Wow.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.520]   It doesn't matter at this point,
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:16.360]   'cause you can't communicate,
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.560]   although there's all sorts of rumors
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.280]   are gonna put messaging in, all sorts of different stuff.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.920]   - Soon we'll be promoting our articles on Pokemon Go.
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.280]   - Yeah, Pokemon Go instant articles.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.440]   Ah!
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.840]   - God, it's gonna be a thing.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.520]   - Actually, when we come back, I wanna take a break.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:32.480]   When we come back, let's talk a little bit about,
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:36.640]   you know, the news now no longer belongs to
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:40.240]   traditional media, belongs to Twitter and Facebook.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:42.360]   And we got a Republican convention coming up
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.960]   starting tomorrow, and I have a feeling
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.800]   Facebook's gonna be a pretty big player
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.040]   and this Twitter wants to be too.
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.720]   We'll talk about it when we come back, Leola Porte,
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:52.840]   and this week in Tech,
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.160]   or showed today, brought to you by our friends at Citrix
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:59.560]   who do go to meeting, oh man, I love go to meeting.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:03.920]   It's the best way to step up your meeting game,
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.320]   take your meetings to the next level.
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.480]   You know, if you're in business,
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.240]   you're gonna be doing the conference calls,
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.600]   you're gonna be doing the meetings.
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.360]   The best way to start a conference call, go to meeting.
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.640]   You can do the conference call,
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:16.480]   but then should it happen that you wanna share a screen,
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.080]   show a PowerPoint, collaborate on a document,
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:21.160]   it's right there, you turn on your camera,
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.400]   suddenly you're seeing the people you're meeting with,
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.640]   you could be a meeting MVP,
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.720]   it's like, I mean, it's like you're right there.
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.360]   No matter where your clients or colleagues are,
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.440]   anywhere in the world, it's easy.
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.040]   You could start a meeting with one click
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.840]   with the go to meeting software.
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:36.280]   If you're using Outlook, for instance,
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:37.920]   you go click, you send out the invites,
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:40.320]   you have the meetings ready, it's so easy.
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.360]   You can even do it though,
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.440]   from not just from a desktop, from your mobile device,
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:47.640]   you can even hold a meeting on your iPad, for instance.
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.760]   Use your webcam to see your colleagues in HD,
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.480]   share your screen to get on the same page,
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.240]   pass off presenter duties with ease,
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.760]   you can even send private chats and video links,
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.040]   hey, I just kinda pitchy.
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.880]   Go to meeting, be kinda fun actually to do a Pokemon Go Go.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:03.960]   It looks like they're doing it, right there,
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.280]   Pokemon Go Go to meeting, yeah.
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.100]   That's a Pokeball.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.000]   Now's the time to put on your best performance,
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.320]   be the next meeting MVP and start it free

[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.640]   G-O-T-O meeting, gotomeeting.com.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:23.200]   We thank you so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:29.200]   I was watching, seems like every day,
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.640]   a new fresh, bad news story.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.600]   This morning, get up, watch the CNN,
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:37.440]   please shooting a bat on Rouge.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:39.920]   First thing you see, vertical video from Facebook Live
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.800]   was a trending topic on Facebook Live,
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.720]   practically before it was on TV.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:49.080]   And Facebook Live was a big part of last week's news,
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:53.360]   watching the Turkish coup or whatever happened in Turkey,
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:55.600]   'cause it seems unclear at this point.
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:43:00.600]   Prime Minister, President Erdogan uses FaceTime.
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:03.480]   FaceTime, and then of course the coup plotters, as always,
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.840]   first thing you do, you shut down the TV and radio
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.120]   and now Facebook and Twitter,
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.000]   although they didn't do it completely.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.520]   And as a result, lots of video coming to the rest
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:16.460]   of the world of what was going on in Turkey.
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:20.920]   Whether it was a real coup or a fake coup.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:24.440]   I don't know what the question here is.
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:28.840]   I guess, is this a kind of a partnership between old media
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:32.120]   and new media or is new media gonna eventually just supersede?
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:34.360]   Is CNN out of luck here?
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:37.640]   Is NBC, CBS, the conventions are coming up this week,
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.440]   are people gonna be watching on Twitter?
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.400]   - I mean, Twitter hopes so.
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:45.560]   - Yeah, and BitTorrent hopes they'll be watching on BTN
[00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:48.000]   and Twitch, hopes they'll be watching on Twitch.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.680]   - Twitch is doing the public convention?
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:52.240]   - They're gonna carry streams of the Republican
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.840]   and Democratic conventions.
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:55.440]   - Wow, but now in the case of Twitter,
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.280]   the stream's coming from mainstream media.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.120]   - Coming from CBS.
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:59.800]   - Yeah, CBS.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.240]   How about Twitch, where is it coming from?
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.560]   - You know, I don't know.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.600]   - Yeah, maybe they're sources of the--
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:09.920]   - They're owned by Amazon, maybe Amazon's got a network.
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:11.400]   - And Washington Post TV, no.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.440]   - Washington Post TV, right.
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:17.760]   - No, but yeah, no, I think that it's partnerships for now
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:21.760]   because obviously, there are infrastructures that exist
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.280]   on both sides that don't exist on the other.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.520]   So you have the technology infrastructure,
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:26.840]   if you're a Facebook or a Twitter,
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:30.680]   and you have the media reach and the cameras and the talent,
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.280]   if you're some of these other, the switchers,
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.480]   if you're some of the other places.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.960]   So I think it benefits everybody
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:36.080]   if they're kind of working together,
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.280]   but I mean to Tom's point,
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:40.920]   I mean, all kinds of companies are trying to get the eyeballs.
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:43.040]   And that's certainly not a good thing
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:46.040]   if you're the more traditional CNN of the world,
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:49.160]   although I think CNN is probably shifting the way
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:51.400]   that it counts its ratings and its impressions for things
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.880]   and says, okay, if we can get people watching
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:55.000]   on our Facebook live stream,
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.360]   or if we can get people watching through an app
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.640]   or through another source,
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:00.760]   then we'll count that towards our total impressions
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:04.200]   that we sell versus just however many people are tuning in
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.280]   to the traditional broadcast feed.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:09.440]   - Well, you're our canary in the coal mine, Christina.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.480]   How are you gonna be watching with Twitter
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.960]   by your side on a television?
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:15.960]   - Twitter probably Facebook.
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:17.760]   And that's been the case the last, you know,
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:20.040]   while, a little while has been, you know,
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.840]   the last election we saw that's a lot too,
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:24.720]   where you finally saw the older media partnering
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.320]   with the debates with YouTube and Twitter and Facebook.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:30.400]   And now we're seeing more and more of that.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.440]   And obviously now we have the live video component
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.160]   that we didn't really have with those infrastructures
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:37.400]   before where you can really, both with broadcast
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:39.960]   and consume the stuff that way.
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.280]   So, but yeah, I mean, I anticipate
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:43.560]   I'll be watching a lot of the speeches through Twitter
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:45.560]   or through Facebook.
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.280]   You know, we have TVs in our opposite match
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.800]   while that are tuned in to the different news networks.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.520]   But I think most of us, it's just easier to consume it
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.280]   on the screens that we're already tuned into.
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:56.400]   And so, and I think I'm not alone in that.
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.320]   I think a lot of people when they get home
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:59.960]   or if they're at the office or something else,
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:02.280]   it's just easier, you know, if they have it pulled up
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:05.760]   in Facebook that they're already browsing anyway,
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.000]   why not just have the video stream going there?
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.240]   - One thing that this does is it kind of disconnects
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:13.400]   the content from its source.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.680]   So for instance, this morning,
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:20.320]   I wanted to see Trump's speech about his vice presidential
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:23.360]   choice and there was video.
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:26.480]   I can't, you know, I was probably reading a news feed
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.040]   or, you know, maybe Tech meme or something.
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:30.920]   There was maybe Nuzzle and there was video and I clicked it.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.240]   And then I'm watching the video.
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.080]   I don't know where it came from.
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.160]   I'm watching the video of the speech
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:35.880]   and I thought, oh, I would like to Chromecast this
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.160]   'cause I want to see it on the big screen.
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.120]   And there was no button.
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.280]   I realized, oh, this isn't YouTube.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.480]   This is Facebook.
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:42.800]   I'm watching Facebook video now.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:43.680]   But it disconnects.
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:44.960]   You don't know where you saw it
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:47.000]   or so what's the benefit to Facebook?
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.040]   If I'm not viewing it on Facebook, if it's embedded,
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.840]   what's the benefit?
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:54.600]   They're not putting it. - Right now it's just uptake.
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.800]   They just want people to use the platform,
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.640]   but eventually they'll figure out how to monetize that.
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:02.960]   And then they already are doing it in small ways to begin with.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:06.160]   - Do they need to be more subtle than traditional media?
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.560]   I mean, traditional media will say,
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:10.440]   oh, we'll be back after this word from our sponsor.
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.040]   YouTube kind of has this middle ground
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.800]   where they just slide up a banner.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:17.920]   Those are kind of annoying.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.680]   And then unless you have YouTube red,
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:23.160]   or are they gonna get more subtle?
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:26.000]   I mean, how do you monetize?
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.600]   If you're Facebook, how do you monetize this?
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:30.720]   'Cause especially if it's not on the page,
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:32.080]   I understand-- - Yes, Facebook would like you
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.440]   to answer that question as well.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:36.040]   - Yeah, I understand if it's on Facebook.com,
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:39.080]   you're gonna monetize it 'cause you get the ads on the side.
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:41.040]   But I noticed this is embedded video.
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.920]   Was I was reading somebody else's site?
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:45.680]   - Well, and that's part of the calculation, I think,
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:49.320]   is even if you're not always watching it on Facebook,
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:50.640]   if enough people are using it,
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:53.240]   that's bringing people to Facebook, I guess.
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:54.440]   - Yeah, and they can probably,
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:56.920]   they're probably grabbing some demographic information
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.680]   from the embed anyway.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:47:59.960]   There's probably some ad code shared
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.240]   where they can get some information about
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:02.800]   at least the location and maybe something
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:04.760]   from your browser cookie that can add
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:06.000]   to their geographic information
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.120]   for those sidebar as they'll see.
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:09.640]   But I mean, I think that the short answer
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:11.640]   and Tom would know better than I would,
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.280]   but I think obviously there's, you know,
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:16.280]   pre-roll would be an easy thing for them to do.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:19.400]   Once it comes to embeds that are already happening
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.400]   on the stream, I don't know if they wanna do the YouTube route
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.080]   of doing, you know, the pop under, you know,
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:24.880]   and kind of overlay or what.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.480]   I think right now, though,
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.040]   they're just trying to get as many people watching
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:30.840]   as possible and they'll worry about making money
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:32.120]   off of the video component later
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:33.560]   'cause that's gonna be there.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:36.120]   That opportunity will be there for them.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.800]   I think the big thing that they just want
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:39.360]   as many people as possible,
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:40.960]   using their platform to broadcast
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.800]   because that really helps showing, hey,
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:45.200]   we've got people who are using their phones
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:47.400]   and are capturing these major events,
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:48.600]   whether they're positive or negative
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.400]   using Facebook Live, that's a really big thing.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.720]   And then the secondary thing is just
[00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:52.960]   whether they're watching it embedded
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:54.560]   in an in a stream, on a webpage
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:56.720]   or at theirontasbook.com.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:00.400]   - We used to say that the advantage Google had is,
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.160]   as long as you use the internet more,
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:03.240]   they would make money.
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:06.120]   It was an easy thing for them.
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:08.840]   You can't really say that about Facebook.
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:10.360]   You can't just say as long as you use the internet
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.400]   more Facebook will make money, or can you?
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:13.240]   Maybe because--
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:15.400]   - You could say as long as you use Facebook more--
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:16.800]   - Facebook more. - Facebook will make money.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:19.080]   - And because it's trying to make itself different.
[00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.360]   - Right, yeah, it is the internet.
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:21.280]   - They are.
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:23.880]   - Yeah, for a lot of people, that's probably true.
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:26.680]   - I looked it up, Twitch doesn't actually say
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.280]   exactly where the streams are coming from,
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:31.160]   but they say they're partnering with the parties.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:34.160]   So I assume it's just like a pool feed
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:35.760]   that the parties provide from the conventions
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:38.120]   and they're saying they're doing it as a public service.
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.480]   So it ties into what we're saying here,
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.400]   which is Twitch is just doing it to bring eyeballs
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:44.680]   and say, hey, maybe just use our platform.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:46.760]   And the other interesting thing is they're letting you
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:50.880]   as a Twitch user re-broadcast that with your own commentary
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.960]   and streams on your Twitch channel.
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:54.640]   - Okay, now that's actually interesting
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:57.080]   because then that's the pool feed concept,
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:49:58.480]   which has obviously been around for a long time,
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:00.040]   and that truly does democratize it
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:02.720]   because before you added that part, Tom,
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:05.680]   I didn't really understand why Twitch would care
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:07.680]   because I would think the typical Twitch audience
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:11.440]   isn't going to be as engaged with the party conventions
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:12.960]   as maybe some other things.
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.720]   But if you can add in that commentary factor,
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:20.640]   that's very interesting and that's really smart on their part.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:21.920]   I wonder how many people will use it,
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.520]   but that's really smart.
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:24.760]   - We're wondering too, I mean,
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.480]   it's one thing to be able to re-stream these things.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:28.680]   I think that's great, but do people really want
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.880]   political commentary from professional gamers
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:32.680]   and their celebrities that they follow?
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:34.120]   - But it doesn't have to be, we're on Twitch.
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.440]   It doesn't have to be professional gamers, Twitch is now.
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:37.920]   At first when they started, they said,
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:39.280]   oh, you're going to have to be gaming content,
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:40.240]   they've stopped that now.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:41.800]   They can be, I mean, I got it.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:44.160]   - They're opening it up to a lot of different creative types.
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:47.360]   - I'd be really curious, you know, who's on the beach?
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:50.520]   What journalist is on the beach?
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:53.000]   If you were, you know, when Brian Williams, for instance,
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.560]   was in purgatory, wouldn't it be interesting
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:57.920]   if he went to Twitch and said,
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:01.040]   "I'm going to do the Brian Williams commentary."
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.360]   Maybe nobody would watch it, I don't know,
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:05.880]   but it would be, it's a way to kind of end around
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:07.200]   the networks.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.680]   - And I think that's one of the big things
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:11.160]   that would be missing from live streams on Twitter
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:12.360]   or from Facebook or elsewhere.
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:13.680]   You know, it's one thing to sit there and watch
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:15.440]   to see Span, but ultimately it's not going to be
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:17.560]   a very informative thing if you've never watched
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:19.360]   these conventions before.
[00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:20.960]   And certainly not everyone's going to be able to sit there
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:21.960]   all day and watch the whole thing.
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:23.520]   Anyway, that's what CNN and everybody else
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:24.760]   brings to the table.
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:26.520]   They have the analysis, they have roundups,
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:29.040]   they bring out the important parts and talk them up,
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.880]   you know, unless you're able to watch all day long
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:32.200]   and you've watched them before,
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:34.240]   you want to be able to pick those things out.
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:36.520]   So I think that's the big advantage for the news networks
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.440]   at this point.
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:40.120]   But yeah, as we see people being able to rebroadcast
[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:41.520]   these things and cut them up and put together
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:43.680]   their own highlights, that really does bring
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:46.400]   the democratization to another level for an event like this.
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.240]   And it will be interesting that people comes out of it.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.880]   - Tim, what are you going to do if you wanted to watch
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:51.880]   the Republican convention?
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:55.040]   How would, I mean, you have a lot of choices now.
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:58.200]   - Right, I've actually been, not to be too patriotic
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.440]   to my own corporation here, but I've been enjoying
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.880]   CBSN or local streaming news networks.
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:04.360]   - I actually love that. - All the time.
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:06.760]   And I actually have, you know, actual news commentary
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:09.800]   and actual people who I trust and respect on there.
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:11.440]   But if I just want to tune in and see what's going on,
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:13.680]   yeah, I'll probably check out Twitter or somewhere else
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:14.760]   just to get the live stream.
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:17.360]   But yeah, just to see what's going on in the news
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:19.120]   and to watch live events that are happening,
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:21.760]   I've been using CBSN, excuse me, quite a bit.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:25.280]   - I just, I have a feeling, I hope I'm wrong,
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:28.400]   but I have a feeling there will be a lot going on this week.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:32.840]   And maybe even some crazy stuff going on.
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:33.680]   - Yeah.
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:37.200]   - I mean, I'm very worried because you've got open
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.480]   Kerry in Cleveland.
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:44.320]   You can't bring a squirt gun to a protest,
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:46.800]   but it turns out a long gun, no problem.
[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:49.680]   And I'm some really worried about what's going to happen.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:52.240]   Who knows what's going to happen in the convention hall?
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:54.000]   I think there's going to be a lot of news coming out of there.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.560]   And so it'll be very interesting to see
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:58.440]   how, what choices people make.
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:01.520]   And we, I feel like we're reaching a tipping point.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:05.040]   This last three weeks, we've really seen
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:08.920]   a very rapid migration to alternative sources
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:09.800]   for your content.
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:15.360]   - Yeah, the Saturday morning, I never turned on a video stream.
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:18.120]   I essentially consumed the news
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:20.480]   about the vice presidential announcement on Twitter.
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.760]   And I didn't need to have the stream on.
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:27.280]   I watched the video later, but I was getting all different sides,
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:30.840]   supporters and, and tagtists giving their opinions
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:31.680]   as it happened.
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:34.240]   And I felt like I had a richer experience just that way.
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:37.600]   Other times I go to Sling TV, I turn on BBC World News
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:40.480]   because that gives a non-US centric opinion,
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.240]   the CNNs on there as well.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:45.640]   Facebook Live was great when the problems were happening
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:48.200]   in Istanbul and Ankara over the weekend,
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:51.160]   because you had all these Facebook Live videos
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:54.440]   coming out of Turkey, because they've shut down Facebook
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:55.680]   so many times in the country.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:59.320]   People know how to get around it with VPNs, et cetera.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:03.160]   So yeah, it's fascinating the wealth of choices you have
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:07.960]   to keep up on an event that we've never had before in history.
[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:09.680]   - And of course, if you follow it on social media,
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:11.120]   then you get all the great animating jists
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:13.480]   to go along with it and that's really what you're throwing down.
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:14.800]   - In some ways that might not be bad.
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:19.800]   I mean, I almost feel like you're at a control center
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:23.080]   where you, you know, I'm thinking when I was,
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:27.200]   I was a six when President Kennedy was shot.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.480]   And there was this kind of unity,
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:33.080]   the whole nation was watching the same thing.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:38.080]   And it was, the storekeepers had put speakers
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:40.840]   in their windows.
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:42.840]   So I was, I remember walking down the main street,
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:44.800]   I was in Providence, Rhode Island at the time.
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:48.040]   And you never were outside the audio,
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:52.120]   the radio audio of after those few days.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:55.440]   And events happened very rapidly.
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:56.840]   But you would never kind of,
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:59.440]   it was the first time you were in the bubble all the time,
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:02.120]   but we all experienced all the same thing.
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:06.800]   Now you can remix the news at will and you kind of do,
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:11.560]   don't you, you're doing mashups as you go.
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:14.800]   - And it takes, it took back then a Kennedy
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.400]   assassin level event.
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.200]   - Absolutely.
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:19.880]   - To make everyone pay attention at the same time
[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:20.840]   and talk about it.
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:23.640]   But what happens now is it almost to the negative,
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:26.760]   every event can get that level of coverage.
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:30.080]   But I think the positive side of it is that everyone
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:31.520]   can talk to each other about it.
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:34.280]   Not just whoever you happen to be around at the time.
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:38.160]   - Well, I do feel like events are accelerating
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:43.160]   and this is right now, something's happening.
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:46.080]   And it's not just Pokemon Go.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.400]   Right now something is happening
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:50.680]   and it's happening in the way we see the world around us.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:55.960]   And maybe, I don't know, is it just we geeks
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:58.240]   who are spending a lot of time sitting in front of screens?
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:59.560]   I think it's everybody.
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:01.480]   - No, I think it's everyone because we've seen it
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:03.800]   from all types of people who are broadcasting this stuff
[00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.280]   and who are reporting on the news
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.280]   and all parts of the world.
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:09.320]   I think this is just the reality.
[00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:10.800]   - Yeah, I think Christine is right.
[00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.040]   We all have phones now.
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:12.960]   - Yeah, that's right.
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:14.320]   That's the difference, isn't it?
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:15.640]   We are all on screens.
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:16.800]   Everybody, not just geeks.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.720]   Everybody is on screens at all times.
[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:24.840]   - Well, just, I was looking at a New York Times headline
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:29.360]   from Wednesday and it said,
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:31.880]   "Another night, another shooting on Facebook Live."
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:33.760]   And that was Wednesday.
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:35.000]   And when they wrote that headline,
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:35.840]   they probably didn't think,
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:37.280]   "Oh, and then there would be Thursday and Friday
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:39.000]   and Saturday too."
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.900]   And Sunday, as it turns out.
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:44.200]   I just feel like events are snowballing
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:48.240]   and these forms of coverage are snowballing.
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:49.680]   And it's very interesting, by the way,
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:52.800]   that although they tried to shut down social media in Turkey,
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:54.560]   they could not do it effectively.
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:57.720]   And so as a result,
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:59.520]   everybody kind of knew what was going on.
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:02.640]   And Erdogan was able to say to the people,
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.880]   go out on the streets and show your support.
[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:09.120]   - Well, because Erdogan has shut down social networking
[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:10.880]   so often people have learned how to get around.
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:12.680]   - They figured it out.
[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:16.040]   - Well, that gives me hope for all of the world.
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:20.040]   You know, Putin last week announced
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:21.480]   even more draconian measures,
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:24.140]   effectively banning encryption in Russia.
[00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:27.040]   But I have hope for the whole thing,
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:29.600]   that people have figured this out
[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:31.080]   and they will get around it.
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:33.440]   And this technology will end up longer and win.
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:37.640]   - I do think we're going to have to somehow recalibrate
[00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:41.680]   ourselves because we're not used to seeing these events
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:43.320]   as up close and personal.
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:45.760]   There's always been some barriers, some buffer.
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:48.080]   Someone saying shocking footage ahead,
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:49.680]   you may want to tune out that kind of thing.
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:52.800]   That barrier is gone now.
[00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:54.680]   And so these sorts of things are,
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:57.240]   they're in your Twitter feed, they're in your Facebook feed,
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:57:59.040]   they're in your face all the time.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:01.800]   And we're not really used to seeing these things,
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:04.360]   we're not used to not being able to avoid seeing these things,
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:05.200]   I guess.
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:06.600]   And I think that's something that we as a society
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:10.160]   are going to have to do with and have to adapt to somehow.
[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:11.240]   And I'm not sure what the solution is,
[00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:12.400]   or even if there is a solution,
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:15.120]   it will just become a bit more jaded about these things,
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:16.400]   which would be unfortunate.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:19.600]   But ultimately, we've never had this kind of exposure
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:22.720]   and this kind of insight into these terrible events
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:25.680]   as we've had over the, even just the past few weeks.
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:28.720]   And that I think is definitely changing our perspectives
[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:29.960]   on the world at large.
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:32.840]   - We talked about this last week on a Twitter
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:35.560]   'cause we had Siva Saad Yidafan and Jeff Jarvis,
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:39.560]   both media critics, media journalism professors.
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:43.280]   During Vietnam, the networks very consciously
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.320]   edited out bloodshed.
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:49.240]   And as a result, we got a kind of a sanitized picture
[00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:50.880]   of the war.
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:53.600]   Same thing really happened in the first Iraq war.
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:55.320]   It was very sanitized.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:58.040]   We saw the shock in awe from a distance,
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:00.040]   but we didn't see the bloodshed.
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:01.800]   I think that that's changed now.
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:03.280]   And you're gonna see, you're seeing the bloodshed
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:04.160]   and it's shocking.
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:07.080]   And you might be right, we're not,
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:08.640]   me may not be ready for this.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:10.520]   There's nobody intermediating now.
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:11.920]   - Well, I mean, it kind of, you know,
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:16.280]   if you've ever seen the classic film network, you know,
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:18.640]   like at a certain point where, you know,
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:20.200]   one of the subjects of that film,
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:22.000]   which was when it was done in the '70s,
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.640]   a satire on the media industry.
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:25.560]   Now of course it just looks like a predictor of a--
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:28.520]   - Pedjievsky, who was a great media critic of the time.
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:29.920]   - Yes, precisely.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:32.680]   You know, was the whole thing of like having a coo station
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:34.360]   and murder happening on live television.
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:36.440]   And now that's actually things that are happening.
[00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:37.760]   - It's actually happening, yeah.
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:38.680]   - It's actually happening.
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:40.080]   Network has become, I mean,
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:44.040]   10, 10 years ago, you know, that was something you could say
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:45.200]   and point to things happening.
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:47.520]   But now it literally is happening.
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:49.160]   - And you don't have to throw up in the window
[00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:51.320]   and say, "I'm not gonna take it anymore."
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:52.080]   You just go to Twitter,
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:53.280]   'cause that's where everybody's doing today.
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:54.800]   Everybody on Twitter is mad as hell.
[00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.280]   - Or you have a Facebook live, you know.
[00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:57.120]   - Right.
[00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:58.840]   - These things are being broadcast in real time
[00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:02.480]   and without anybody wanting to censor it.
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:05.240]   And so it's becoming, whether or not we're ready
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:06.360]   to see it or not, I think,
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:09.240]   is a very interesting question, but it's happening.
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:12.200]   - It, I may be wrong, but it just feels like
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:14.040]   there is a significant difference
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.920]   to what's gonna, been having the last couple of weeks
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:16.880]   and what's gonna happen next week
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.920]   and what's gonna happen through November in this country
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:20.720]   than anything we've seen before.
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.280]   And I don't know what the impact,
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:24.400]   societal impact of it is,
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.000]   the personal impact of it is,
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.480]   clearly it has a personal impact.
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:30.400]   I mean, I think we are more gutted
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.120]   by the things that have happened in the last two weeks
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:35.040]   than we would have been if we hadn't seen them
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:38.720]   on an intermediate, seen them directly,
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:41.760]   that really hit home, didn't it?
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.640]   - Yeah, I 100% agree.
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:48.640]   I think for good or ill, you can't ignore things
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:51.960]   by just reading about them in the newspaper.
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:56.560]   People are shot and killed every day by policemen
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.200]   and policemen are killed not every day,
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.920]   but regularly by citizens,
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.600]   but they show up as numbers in a column.
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:07.560]   And so now you actually see what happens
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.800]   and it forces people to pay attention to that.
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:13.440]   And if you think back, you're talking about in the 60s,
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.160]   the civil rights protests and the water guns
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:18.480]   being shown on television was brand new,
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:20.080]   instead of just hearing about something
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:22.320]   and reading it in the newspaper, you could see it.
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.760]   And this is the evolution of that.
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:25.600]   - Yeah.
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:28.800]   You too, so another thing that happened is
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.080]   the networks stopped doing gamble to gamble coverage
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:31.920]   of the conventions.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.960]   When I was a kid, you could literally
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.400]   sit in front of the TV from the first gavel
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.960]   to the last gavel and watch everything.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:43.640]   I even remember in contested conventions,
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:46.320]   writing down the votes and keeping track of it
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:49.200]   and all this stuff, 'cause I was some sort of weird nerd.
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:53.200]   But then the networks stopped doing that, right?
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:56.320]   And then they did a wrap up with a half hour newscast.
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:58.000]   Well, we're back to gavel to gavel.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.680]   In fact, we're back to immersive gavel to gavel.
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:05.080]   If you wanna wear a gear VR all night, you can.
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.000]   YouTube's gonna stream the conventions
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.120]   in 360 degree video.
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.280]   - It's interesting because I do wonder
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.840]   how many people will actually tune in for that.
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:15.880]   I have a feeling that's a very small number.
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:17.640]   - Well, you don't wanna do it for long.
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:20.320]   I watched one of the debates that way.
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:21.320]   - Yeah, it was a good experience.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.840]   - Yeah, it's kind of nauseating, actually.
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.280]   And I don't know if it was the debate or the--
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:28.480]   - The battery didn't last very long.
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:30.120]   The battery didn't even last the entire debate
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:31.200]   as I recall.
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:33.600]   I had to stop like three quarters the way through
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.760]   because you had like--
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.600]   - I saw stuff that I wouldn't have seen
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.960]   'cause one of the cameras was like,
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.840]   as people were coming on stage and you would see,
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.560]   you would see it, it was very telling.
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:48.720]   The candidates gear up for their introduction on stage.
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.440]   It's kind of a personal moment.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.800]   They probably weren't aware of these 360 degree cameras.
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.760]   They're small and didn't realize
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.280]   that people were watching them.
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:01.440]   - I think that there's a potential here to kind of pierce
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:04.040]   the image making and see what's really going on.
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:06.640]   - It's the learning step, right?
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:09.280]   You put those cameras in to see what happens
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:12.560]   and what doesn't work so that you can figure out
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.280]   what are the things that these are good for.
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.560]   And that's one of the things they're good for, yeah.
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:18.200]   - There are also, YouTube's also gonna have people
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.680]   like the Young Turks, Complex News,
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:22.680]   Seeker Daily, Ingrid Nielsen, Mark Watson,
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.960]   Julie Borowski, those are names you may not know,
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.640]   but they are, and I don't know many of them,
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.000]   but they're YouTube stars who will be participating
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.240]   in YouTube's coverage.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:36.240]   So this is a chance for a new generation of media stars
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:41.680]   to participate in what was traditionally,
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:44.320]   the realm of Huntley, Brinkley and Walter Cronkite.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.120]   - And I'm curious to see what their reactions are,
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:47.960]   these things.
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.800]   I mean, as you mentioned, those are great journalists
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.240]   that you just named and they've obviously
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.480]   got a lot of extensive training and being not biased
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:56.360]   and ultimately shooting straight effectively.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.560]   This new generation of YouTube stars,
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:03:59.920]   they obviously have a great following
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.280]   and hopefully they can bring a positive message to it all,
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.640]   but I'm definitely very curious to see what that message is
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.840]   that they bring to coverage.
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:09.360]   - By makeup, how straight they can shoot, I guess.
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.440]   - Well, but it doesn't matter anymore, right?
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:14.360]   First of all, that was an illusion that there was objectivity.
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.200]   - Sure.
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:18.320]   - I mean, there was an attempted objectivity.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.860]   Now it's like, no, there's no attempt at all.
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:24.560]   It's advocacy all the way down.
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:28.200]   - It would be interesting to see if somebody could do
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:30.480]   an attempt at responsible coverage, right?
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:33.560]   Objectivity is something none of us can achieve 100%.
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:36.280]   But that was what the broadcasters did try to do
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:40.080]   is attempt objectivity and at least have responsible coverage.
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:42.400]   - Boy, what an opportunity for somebody, right?
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:45.080]   Somebody really smart, you know,
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:47.880]   boy, that would be interesting.
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:52.880]   Somebody like, who's the 538 guy, Nathan Silver?
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:54.800]   - Yeah.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.320]   - To do something really smart and different.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:00.240]   Who could do that?
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:02.600]   - It's Silver and Christopher Buckley together.
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:03.440]   (laughs)
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:04.880]   - I'd love that when you watch Nate Silver
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:06.600]   and Christopher Buckley doing
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.000]   Gavaldagabble Convention Coverage, I'd love that.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.680]   So here's an opportunity instead of doing the same old thing
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.920]   to do something really new and different
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:17.280]   and find an audience, and that's the other thing
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:20.040]   that's changed is you don't need 18 million people.
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:23.440]   I mean, we've shown that with Twitter.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.720]   You can have a niche audience and do fine.
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:29.920]   And so they're led at 100 niches bloom.
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:32.280]   - Yeah, man, I have way fewer people than Twitch.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.480]   - And you're doing fine, right?
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:34.680]   - And doing okay, yeah.
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:39.000]   - You're making a living thanks to Patreon and the tools
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.160]   and you've got tools to disseminate and YouTube
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:47.160]   and you can do this in your living room and do great.
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:49.080]   - Absolutely.
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.240]   - I think that's, to me, that's very encouraging.
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:56.400]   That's kind of the promise of all of this.
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.640]   But we'll see.
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.800]   I mean, often the promise doesn't deliver it
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:04.800]   when it comes to things like national news stories.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:07.720]   - Taking a break, come back with more, Tom Merritt,
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:08.560]   Daily Tech News Show.
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:11.120]   You should do your Gavaldagabble coverage next week.
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:12.200]   - I've got a Gavald back.
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.120]   (laughs)
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.240]   - You do, I see it.
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:19.080]   dtns.com, DailyTechHeadlines.com
[01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:22.440]   for the short version, short audio version every morning,
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:27.440]   from Mashable, it's tech, film girl, Mashable's Christina Warren.
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:31.440]   You need to, like a Christina's Corner thing.
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:32.720]   - I do, I do.
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:33.560]   - Where do you do that?
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:35.560]   Do you do that, anything like that?
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:38.000]   - I mean, the closest thing I come to that is I do a podcast
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.200]   called Rocket where we talk about tech,
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:41.200]   but I don't have my own thing.
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:42.040]   I should probably start.
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.600]   - But you see, I mean, you look at what Tom's done.
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.120]   It's really great because you build a brand,
[01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:50.480]   you build a name, it should be your name, it should be you.
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:52.200]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:54.920]   - Just saying, I'm just saying, Tim Stevens,
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:57.440]   he's got the roadshow, I mean the roadshow.com,
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:00.240]   that's really, I mean, I know it's become a big enterprise now.
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:02.240]   You get all these people all over the world, Detroit,
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.520]   and San Francisco, you go into Paris
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:07.520]   for the big auto show next week or two weeks, right?
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:09.160]   - Just about a month actually, yes.
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:10.720]   I'll be in Paris for that,
[01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:13.000]   and then we've got LA coming up not too long after that.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:13.840]   - Oh yeah.
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:14.680]   - And I'm going to Tokyo too,
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.000]   in the end of right after Paris actually.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.280]   So, I'm getting all over the place.
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:19.760]   - We were thinking we should do some coverage
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:20.920]   of the LA auto show.
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:23.560]   Is there one show that's more technical than others,
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:26.840]   like more, I guess they're all technology nowadays?
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:27.960]   - Yeah, they definitely are.
[01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:30.760]   Both LA and Detroit are making a big push this year
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:34.360]   to be the kind of go-to automotive tech show.
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:36.880]   LA previously had the connected car conference
[01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.200]   that led into the LA show,
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.800]   now they've kind of consumed that into the show itself.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.160]   Detroit's making a big push this year,
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.560]   they're dedicating a lot of floor space
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:45.400]   to start up some of the Detroit area,
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:46.760]   and autonomous cars not gonna think too.
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:49.200]   So, it's gonna be kind of a fight between the two,
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:52.800]   but Detroit shows definitely the bigger of the two by far.
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:53.960]   - Actually, when we come back,
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:56.280]   we should talk about autonomous vehicles.
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.120]   - Yeah.
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:58.480]   - Consumer reports told Tesla,
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:01.240]   you should stop saying that's a self-driving car.
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:04.400]   That's not the right message to send, clearly not.
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:07.480]   We'll talk about that when we come back.
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:09.100]   Little more in just a bit.
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:14.280]   Tom Merritt, Christina Warren, Tim Stevens,
[01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:15.240]   this week in tech.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:18.040]   Our show today brought to you by Gazelle.
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.920]   Gazelle, August 2nd, we're gonna see,
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:23.560]   we think the new Galaxy Note,
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.160]   probably called the Note 7.
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:28.120]   There's new phones still coming.
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:31.120]   I just got a new Huawei phone, or ZTE,
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.600]   I can't remember, some Chinese phone, the Axon.
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.200]   Who is that, Huawei, GTE?
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:38.200]   Anyway, $400 phone, I've ordered that.
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.200]   The OnePlus 3, you got iPhone.
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:43.200]   I mean, this is, if you're sitting there
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.480]   with the same old phone,
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:46.720]   it might be time to see how much you can get for it
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:50.920]   from Gazelle so you can buy up to something new and cool.
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:54.080]   Gazelle lets you trade in your old device for cash,
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.000]   or buy a certified pre-owned one,
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.080]   or do both, to buy or sell.
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.360]   It's Gazelle, Gazelle's great
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:04.640]   because they will give you a 30-day quote for your device.
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.040]   In fact, why make it just one device?
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:08.880]   As long as you're there, get quotes for everything.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:11.160]   You know, you got stuff piled up in a drawer, right?
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:12.800]   You wouldn't throw $100 bills in a drawer
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.920]   and just let 'em catch, dust.
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:17.040]   That's what you're doing if you're just throwing
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.200]   your stuff in the drawer.
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:20.320]   Here's your chance to get cash,
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:22.680]   or you can get a check, or a PayPal credit,
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:25.040]   or an Amazon gift card.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.920]   Man, that would have been good for last week for a prime day.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.960]   We'll talk about that too in a little bit.
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:32.480]   Gazelle.com, top dollar for your old device.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:35.000]   And then, the best stuff,
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.680]   they run through their rigorous 30-point inspection
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:40.920]   and they sell it if you wanna get a great deal
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:44.760]   on a gently used iPhone 6S or 6S plus,
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:46.720]   an iPad and a Galaxy phone.
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:48.960]   Gazelle's the place to go, each device.
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:51.000]   Oh, it looks like they're selling them MacBooks now too.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.200]   That's nice.
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.680]   Gazelle's the place to go.
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:56.800]   And they do that rigorous 30-point check.
[01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.680]   You also have a 30-day return policy.
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:09:59.880]   There's no when you sell a phone,
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:01.120]   there's no carrier contract,
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.840]   but they do work on all the major carriers
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:05.920]   in the US, AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile and Sprint.
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:08.440]   And when you're at Gazelle,
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:10.160]   you can now get financing too.
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:11.000]   In fact, you could do it.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.240]   It's so easy, you could do it at checkout.
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:14.520]   Just as you're checking out, check, say,
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:15.800]   "I want to financing by a firm,
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.880]   "you'll give them some simple information."
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.600]   They can instantly approve you.
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:22.680]   They also offer 12-month warranties now
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:25.720]   and cell phones and iPads powered by assurance solutions.
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:27.280]   They cover not just defects,
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:30.560]   hardware defects, but water damage, cracked screens.
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.560]   Gazelle, it's great.
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:35.840]   Go to Gazelle.com, back to school time's coming.
[01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:38.440]   I can't, is it already back to school time?
[01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:39.520]   Holy cow.
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:41.960]   Boy, that comes fast.
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.640]   Summer's shorter than ever.
[01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:47.240]   Now's the time maybe to get some back to school devices,
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:52.240]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, to buy, to sell.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:54.440]   Give new life to use electronics trading
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:58.640]   for cash or buy certified pre-owned at gazelle.com.
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:00.800]   Today,
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:08.080]   Consumer Reports says, "Hey, Tesla, knock it off."
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:11.400]   What are they complaining about, Tim Stevens?
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:13.080]   - They're complaining about a lot of things, actually.
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.840]   This letter that they wrote. - Isn't it Consumer Reports
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.320]   that said the Tesla was the best,
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.480]   the Model S was best car they'd ever tested,
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.560]   ever in their history?
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.400]   Yeah, and that's one of the many reasons
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.440]   that I have a lot of issues with this Consumer Reports,
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:26.840]   Open Letter Consumer Reports,
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:29.560]   first said that the Model S was the best car.
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:31.640]   It was so good that it broke their scoring system.
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.240]   And they actually gave it two slots
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:36.920]   in their top five best cars of, I think it was 2015.
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:39.760]   That's how much they were in love with the Model S.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.560]   And less than three months later, they said,
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:44.240]   "Actually, we don't recommend the car after all
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:45.600]   because of the reliability concerns
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:46.440]   of a lot of people that are willing--
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:49.760]   - Not even knock it down a point, but don't recommend it.
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.800]   - Right, it went from the top two cars, again,
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:54.640]   the Model S had two slots in their top five
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:55.800]   to being not recommended.
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:57.720]   Even though in that first recommendation,
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:58.920]   they said, "You know, we've heard some concerns
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.600]   about reliability, but we don't care such a great car."
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.440]   Then they turned around,
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:03.760]   so you know what the reliability is for us
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.520]   and we thought, so we're not gonna recommend it after all.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:06.920]   - Is it really bad, by the way,
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:09.040]   'cause I'm about to get a Model X?
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:12.200]   - It is definitely, I would get the extended warranty.
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.800]   Yeah, there are a lot of people getting battery packs swapped.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:17.320]   We've heard the suspension issues as well.
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:20.080]   There are definitely concerns about reliability for sure.
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:23.960]   I don't think it's honestly horribly bad,
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.400]   but there are definitely concerns,
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:27.200]   and a lot of people are going through multiple battery packs
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:28.600]   in their cars, which thankfully are covered
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:29.880]   by a very generous warranty.
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:32.480]   - Well, it's also, I'm told a very expensive car
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:34.360]   to repair, right?
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:36.200]   - It is, yeah, I mean, there are a few components,
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:38.240]   which is good, so maintenance is a lot easier.
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:40.120]   You don't have to worry about oil changes
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:41.600]   or breaks last a lot longer.
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.920]   So in terms of the cost of running overall,
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.360]   it's probably not that much different from a normal car,
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:48.480]   but the componentry that's in the car
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:49.800]   is of course very specialized,
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.080]   so it's not like you can go down to a local nappa
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:55.320]   and get some new inductor coils
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:56.440]   or that kind of thing for your car.
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:57.720]   It's a very specialized thing,
[01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:59.280]   and indeed Tesla makes it very difficult
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:00.240]   to work on it yourself,
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.840]   so everything pretty much has to go back
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:03.680]   to the Tesla mechanics,
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.480]   which definitely adds some cost to the game.
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:10.240]   - So there have been two or three autopilot crashes,
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:12.840]   probably just two, 'cause now Tesla's saying
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:16.120]   what was initially billed as an autopilot crash wasn't,
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:18.560]   because Tesla has the telemetry, they said,
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.480]   no, the autopilot was not turned on,
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:24.600]   but the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.700]   is investigating.
[01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:30.800]   Security Exchange Commission investigating
[01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:32.760]   some sale of stock issues,
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:35.200]   and Consumer Reports now writes the letter,
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:36.760]   quote, "This is Laura McLeary,
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:40.680]   Vice President of Consumer Policy and Mobilization."
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:41.720]   For Consumer Reports, quote,
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:44.920]   "By marketing their feature is autopilot,
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:48.200]   "Tesla gives customers a false sense of security
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:51.040]   "in the long run, advanced safety technologies
[01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:52.760]   "and vehicles could make our roads safer,
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:55.480]   "but today we're deeply concerned that consumers
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:58.360]   "are being sold a pile of promises
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.760]   "about unproven technology.
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:03.640]   "Autopilot can't actually drive the car."
[01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:04.480]   - Right.
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:06.560]   - But it does allow consumers to have their hands
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:08.880]   off the steering wheel for minutes at a time.
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:12.680]   - I think the most important thing here is that
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:16.160]   autopilot in a plane does not fully control the plane.
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.840]   In fact, autopilot in a plane is in a lot of ways
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:22.080]   very similar to the autopilot system that Tesla offers.
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.040]   Autopilot system will not take the plane,
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.160]   it will not tax it on the runway,
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:28.040]   it will not take the plane off the runway for you.
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:30.400]   It will control the plane and maintain a heading,
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:31.880]   and it will maintain a course for you,
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:34.840]   and indeed autopilot systems will land the plane
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.680]   for you in many cases as well.
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:38.400]   But it's not the kind of thing where a pilot would turn
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.960]   on autopilot and go take a nap or go play go
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:42.640]   or watch a movie or that kind of thing.
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:43.480]   - Both ways.
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:45.040]   - But in fact, there are specific regulations
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.240]   that the FAA has in place about when you can use it,
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:48.200]   when you should not use it,
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:51.840]   and a lot of recommendations about using autopilot
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:54.440]   to effectively reduce the workload of the pilot
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:55.960]   so they can be paying more attention to things
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.720]   like traffic in the air,
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:59.760]   inclement weather conditions and that kind of thing.
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:02.880]   But ultimately, the system that autopilot has in planes
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:05.520]   is not as comprehensive as what most people think,
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:07.000]   and I think that's where this disconnect is.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.760]   Tesla is saying, it's like autopilot in planes,
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:12.040]   and people think, oh, well autopilot flies a plane for you,
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.560]   you don't have to do anything.
[01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:15.440]   That I think is where the big disconnect here is.
[01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:17.400]   - Well, but I'm not sure consumer report is wrong,
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:19.080]   because of course, if you're a pilot,
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:21.000]   a commercial pilot, you're highly trained,
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.480]   and know exactly what autopilot will and will not do,
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:25.840]   and what your responsibilities are,
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:28.280]   but Tesla drivers, you know,
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:29.600]   they just have a driver's license,
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:31.040]   and they could probably never driven a car
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:34.840]   with these features by using the word autopilot.
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:37.560]   You know, as a pilot, and pilots know
[01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:38.920]   that's not what we think it is,
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:41.040]   but can you expect the guy off the street
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:42.760]   to know what that means?
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:45.120]   - Right, and I think that's the big disconnect,
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:47.720]   but certainly when you enable that system in the car,
[01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:49.760]   it tells you exactly what it does and does not do.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:51.120]   - Right, it's pretty clear, right?
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:52.040]   - And it's tension.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:54.440]   - You have to turn it on, it isn't on by default.
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:58.040]   - There's a little bit of eulophatic there though.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:15:58.880]   - Yeah.
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.640]   - So people get excited about autopilot,
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:04.240]   and they think that means it will drive the car for you,
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:06.880]   even though that's not what Tesla said.
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:07.720]   - Right.
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:10.200]   - And so they treat it as if it will,
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:12.520]   and I think that's what consumer reports is reacting to.
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:14.640]   In my opinion, they're overreacting to it.
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.640]   I think consumer reports has the right to change their mind
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:18.120]   and say, now that we've seen
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:20.240]   that the reliability concerns are true,
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.160]   we're gonna adjust it.
[01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:25.240]   It seems like they're going from one extreme to another though.
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:30.240]   They say that Tesla should disable automatic steering
[01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:32.760]   in the cars until it updates the program.
[01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:36.040]   Actually, what they're really saying is,
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.720]   add the feature that says,
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:41.920]   the driver's hands must be on the wheel for this to work.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:43.080]   Right now, what is it, Tim?
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:44.680]   You can take it off for a minute or two,
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:47.600]   but eventually it's vibrates and buzzes,
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.240]   and then it slows down.
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:51.080]   - Right, it's somewhere between two and four minutes,
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.160]   usually, I don't think there's a set of time
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:54.960]   that Tesla has stated,
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:56.720]   but certainly it's definitely more generous
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:16:59.080]   than we've seen in other manufacturers.
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:01.320]   But one of the points that I wrote a big editorial about this,
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.080]   'cause it kind of made me upset,
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:05.520]   but one of the points is we've had cruise control forever.
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:07.560]   In fact, the first generation of cruise control
[01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:09.320]   was called autopilot, ironically, now.
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:10.160]   - Really?
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.840]   - We've had people who were doing things,
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:14.560]   we've seen controversies in the past
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:16.760]   where people have done stupid things with cruise control on,
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:18.640]   but there's no regulation about having to have your feet
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:22.200]   on the gas and the brake pedal ready to take over.
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:23.400]   You can be paying attention,
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:24.640]   and you can be alert in the car
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.560]   without having your hands resting on this steering wheel
[01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:27.800]   at all times.
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:30.160]   I don't think that that is necessarily the crux of the problem.
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:32.360]   I think the problem is that ultimately,
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:34.920]   a lot of local news stations in particular
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:37.720]   have been misrepresenting what this system is.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:39.720]   I did a two second Google search
[01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:41.680]   and came up with 10 different local news reports
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:44.680]   talking about the Tesla Model S being a self-driving car,
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:46.800]   even one that called it a driverless car,
[01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:48.600]   which is completely outrageous.
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.600]   - Yeah, but, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:52.120]   but Musk kind of encouraged that perception
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:53.400]   by saying things like,
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:54.960]   soon you'll be able to get the car
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:57.000]   to come to you from across the country.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.240]   - I don't know that he said that he did say
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.840]   you can drive from Seattle to San Francisco
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:05.160]   with your hands off the wheel, which I thought was definitely
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.920]   - It's inappropriate.
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:09.080]   - I mean, he's, look, he's definitely played up
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:10.360]   from a branding perspective
[01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:12.320]   that people can trust this thing a lot.
[01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:15.360]   And I think that, although I agree that the consumer reports
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.440]   is overreacting, I do understand where they're coming from
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.960]   in the sense that I think so many people buy this car,
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:22.840]   they buy it, they're hardcore Tesla fans.
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:24.680]   You've got to be on a waiting list to get the car.
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:26.680]   You get the car, you like the technology.
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:27.560]   It works really well.
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.280]   It works better than anything we've seen before.
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:30.360]   And you trust it.
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:34.520]   So you are willing to give it more responsibility
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:35.760]   than maybe you should.
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:37.760]   And I think that there is going to be said about
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:40.280]   the fact that the branding that Tesla's done
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:43.160]   might be too good and is leading some users
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:46.960]   to think that they can not be as alert as they are
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:51.240]   when they're in these partially autonomous systems.
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:56.160]   - Tim, is there any car out there right now that does steering?
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:59.320]   - There are two other cars on the market
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:00.800]   that have very similar systems.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:03.720]   The Mercedes Benz E-Class and the Volvo S90,
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:05.280]   both of which are very new on the market.
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:07.880]   In fact, I don't think the S90 has come to the US just yet.
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:09.480]   They both have the same basic functionality.
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:11.880]   They'll steer around corners and speed up and slow down,
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:14.080]   of course, and change lanes for you too.
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:16.920]   Both of them though have much shorter restrictions
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:19.120]   in terms of how long you can take your hands off the wheel.
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:20.440]   I don't know exactly what the time is,
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:22.320]   but it's less than a minute, I believe, for both of them.
[01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:25.080]   - Interesting, but you can take your hands off the wheel.
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:27.800]   - Yeah, and then Volvo's got their drive-me pilot system
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:29.480]   coming to Sweden next year.
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:31.520]   That's going to be a very limited number of cars.
[01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:33.200]   I think about it 100 cars,
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.280]   but that'll be a fully autonomous car on the highway
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:37.240]   that you will be able to, you will at that point
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:39.520]   be able to take out a book and take a nap if you want to.
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:41.400]   That will be a fully autonomous car.
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:42.400]   But again, not until next year,
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:44.880]   and it's only going to be about 100 so far.
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:47.040]   - I mean, I think one of the biggest problems here
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:50.880]   is what some people are calling ambiguous role allocation.
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.960]   When the car doesn't entirely drive itself,
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:55.520]   but you're not also entirely driving the car.
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:57.480]   - Who's in charge? - Which does slow
[01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:58.480]   your reaction time.
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:01.440]   There was a University of Strasbourg study in 2013
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:03.080]   that found with cruise control,
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:06.280]   episodes of drowsiness increased 25%
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:09.200]   and reaction time to emergencies was lengthened by one second.
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.120]   Now, I agree with Tim,
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:12.960]   I don't think that means we need to ban cruise control,
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:15.720]   but I do think that we have to keep in mind
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:18.480]   that when we are using these assisted technologies,
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:21.560]   there is an extra responsibility on us to stay alert
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:23.000]   that things could happen,
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.400]   and we might be less likely to notice them right away
[01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:27.520]   if we're not constantly paying attention,
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:30.200]   like we would if we're driving the car entirely ourselves.
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:34.720]   - I'm just not sure who should be doing the messaging here,
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:36.640]   because all Tesla's messaging has been saying
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:38.960]   exactly what the system can do.
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:41.200]   I don't think that they have gone out of their way
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:44.520]   to swat down every single mistaken report
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.760]   that says what this kind of misled people
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:48.920]   into believing that these are self-driving cars.
[01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:49.920]   And I don't know that that's something
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:51.640]   that Tesla should have to do,
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:53.560]   because what would we be thinking about them
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:55.640]   if they were correcting every single news report
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:56.480]   that went out there?
[01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:58.600]   I mean, they'd have to have a staff of hundreds
[01:20:58.600 --> 01:20:59.880]   just to keep up with that.
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:01.360]   But I'm not sure what the solution is
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:03.120]   to get people more educated,
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:04.480]   because the manual says what it can do,
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:07.280]   all of Tesla's messaging says what it can do,
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:10.400]   but yet people are using the system incorrectly.
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:12.320]   And so I'm not sure what the solution is,
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:15.360]   but ultimately just disabling it and renaming it.
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.120]   I don't think that's gonna fix the problem here.
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:19.960]   - And by the way, keeping your hands on the wheel
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:22.080]   doesn't mean you're paying attention.
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:23.080]   - Right.
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:25.360]   - So the same problem that you referred to Tom
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:29.040]   is it could occur even if you have your hands on the wheel.
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:30.480]   Google-- - Yeah, it's about attention.
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:33.600]   - Google talks about this with their self-driving cars.
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.280]   They don't want people,
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:37.960]   they take the steering wheel and the pedals out,
[01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:42.960]   because it takes you too long to figure out what's going,
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:46.600]   you might say, oh gosh, but I need to take control,
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:50.560]   but you still have to kind of readjust yourself
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:52.320]   to be in the situation.
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.520]   And by that time, you're in trouble.
[01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:59.480]   - So I think the way is to disambiguate it.
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:01.120]   Either the car is driving or you're driving,
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:02.800]   but there's no middle ground.
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.640]   You can't both drive.
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:06.000]   - Yeah, and unfortunately we're gonna be stuck
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.840]   in that middle ground for a good couple years anyway,
[01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:10.800]   as this technology evolves.
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:13.240]   I think the other big problem is that
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:14.920]   there's no way of knowing how many lives
[01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:17.240]   our pilot has saved, and I'm sure it saved
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:19.200]   a couple of lives at this point.
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:21.520]   But there's no way to prove that, there's no way to know.
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:24.080]   But obviously when a lab is lost,
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:26.080]   because the system failed,
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:27.440]   that's obviously very easy to tell,
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:29.240]   and it's obviously a very tragic situation.
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:31.880]   But for sure, these systems have saved lives.
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:33.920]   Even the emergency braking system
[01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:36.520]   is there was an instant study, I think two years ago
[01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:39.320]   that showed if your car has emergency braking alone,
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.920]   you are 42% less likely to get involved
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:44.480]   in a rear end collision that involves injuries.
[01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:46.560]   42% just from this one system,
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:48.680]   and Tesla's got that system and a bunch of others.
[01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:51.080]   So I'm sure that there are fewer accidents happening,
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:54.320]   and fewer serious accidents happening because of this system,
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:55.760]   but there's no way to prove that ultimately.
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:57.560]   And that I think is an unfortunate thing
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:59.720]   that there's just no inserform.
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:01.760]   - That's a really good difference from cruise control.
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:05.320]   Cruise control is not designed to avoid an accident.
[01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:07.840]   And so that ambiguous role allocation
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:10.040]   can be more dangerous than something,
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:12.480]   which is a driver assistance that does
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:15.000]   lane detection and collision avoidance,
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.880]   which is actively trying to help you avoid
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:17.880]   getting into an accident.
[01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:19.720]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:21.960]   I mean, a number of cars, including my current car,
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:25.400]   have adaptive cruise control,
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:27.760]   which is great in stopping go traffic,
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:30.360]   because you kind of just let the car
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:33.480]   maintain a safe stopping distance at any speed,
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:35.320]   and it will even come to a full stop
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:37.320]   if the car ahead of me stops.
[01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:40.720]   It's not as smooth a driver as I would be.
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:43.360]   It tends to jam the brakes on a little bit,
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:46.360]   which is a little scary, but it does the job,
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.840]   and I still would never, ever take my hand off
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:50.120]   the wheel or stop paying attention.
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:51.560]   Of course, it's not steering for me,
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:54.600]   but you clearly need to pay attention.
[01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:56.600]   I don't know.
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:57.440]   We'll see.
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:00.320]   I got the autopilot and the Tesla.
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:02.400]   - Yeah, I'm scared to turn it on.
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:04.360]   - It is a genuinely great service.
[01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:05.840]   If you're paying attention,
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:09.200]   it's just one less thing really that you need to worry about.
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:13.160]   Having that on the highway, you can really relax a bit more.
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:15.560]   Honestly, I think it makes me a safer driver,
[01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:18.400]   because I can be looking around for incidents
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:20.240]   much more so rather than just worrying about staying
[01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:22.640]   between the lines, worrying about how fast I'm going,
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:25.320]   worrying about maintaining a safe gap between the car ahead
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:27.160]   of me if they're speeding up and slowing down.
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:29.200]   The car kind of takes care of all the menial stuff
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:32.200]   and frees me up to be looking for someone who's driving
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:35.240]   in a safe way or straight lights ahead, that kind of thing.
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:37.360]   - It should make you a better driver, not a worse driver.
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:39.480]   - Right, and it does if you use it,
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:40.440]   obviously you're supposed to,
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:42.960]   but if you are using that as an opportunity
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:45.280]   to do something you shouldn't be doing,
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:47.400]   then obviously it can cause a lot of problems.
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:48.480]   - Leo, don't worry, turn it on,
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:49.880]   just call it something different.
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:50.720]   (laughing)
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:51.640]   - It's not autopilot.
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:52.920]   It's a driver assist.
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:56.080]   You know, if you say driver assist, that's really,
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:58.080]   so I'm a little bit on the side of Consumer Reports here.
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:00.440]   - I think there's also a consumer advocacy group,
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.000]   and I think it's a good idea to say,
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.920]   "Hey, it's not all, don't call it on a pilot."
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:06.400]   That confuses people, call it driver assist.
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:08.680]   That's a perfectly legitimate description.
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:11.480]   - I mean, it doesn't have the same branding kind of, you know.
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:13.720]   - Oh, you can't have it both ways, yes, I agree.
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:15.200]   - You're not wrong, you're not wrong.
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:17.640]   I'm just saying I don't see Tesla changing their marketing
[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:18.920]   that they've done so successfully.
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:20.440]   - Well, that's what their response is.
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:22.160]   - Because Consumer Reports wants them to.
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:23.880]   I mean, that's just, that's not gonna happen.
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:24.720]   - Yeah.
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:26.320]   - I think Consumer Reports wishes that they were
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.160]   that influential.
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:28.640]   They're sadly, they're not.
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:31.720]   Even though I think on the whole, they're making good points.
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:33.960]   You know, I don't know about, you know,
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:35.800]   pulling the entire recommendation for the car,
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:37.400]   that seems going a little bit far.
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.160]   I should note here, I'm not a driver,
[01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:40.280]   I don't have a driver's license,
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:41.440]   so I don't have a lot to add to those things.
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:42.280]   - You're lucky.
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:44.480]   - You're so lucky.
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:45.960]   - But you have a vested interest
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:47.280]   in these cars becoming an entire company.
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:48.760]   - Not hitting you, yeah, right.
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:49.600]   - Yeah.
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:50.440]   - Without a doubt, I do.
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:52.640]   But I kind of wonder from you guys, like,
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:55.360]   do you think that we can live in kind of this middle ground
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:57.080]   world where we do have these systems
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:59.240]   that are partly autonomous and partly not?
[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:01.800]   Because to me, that becomes the big question.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:04.720]   Like, I don't really have a problem with, weirdly,
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:06.840]   with a fully autonomous car on the road,
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:08.520]   because even though there will be crashes,
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:11.760]   I think that, you know, those, the software will get better
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:14.280]   and things will probably be safer
[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:17.480]   with more autonomous, fully autonomous cars on the road.
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:20.080]   But in this middle ground, I do have to be concerned
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:22.560]   with whether people really understand
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:24.760]   they still have to be paying as much attention,
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:29.480]   if not more, you know, versus just doing what I think
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:30.440]   a lot of people are gonna do.
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:32.600]   I mean, I know a lot of my friends who drive
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:35.160]   who are already distracted when they're driving
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:38.400]   without any sort of autonomy and give them an excuse
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:40.320]   to not have their hands on the wheel.
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:43.640]   You know, you just, you're concerned.
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:46.200]   So I wonder, like, can we live in this middle ground world?
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:48.240]   Or are we going to have to kind of wait
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:51.000]   for the fully autonomous cars to come?
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.760]   I hope that we can.
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:53.600]   Sorry, go ahead, Lou.
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:55.240]   I talked to a Tesla owner today.
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:56.480]   He was in our studio visiting.
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:57.920]   He's such a Tesla fan.
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:59.360]   He's actually had some cards printed up
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:01.880]   that say Tesla Evangelist.
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:03.960]   Unofficial Tesla Evangelist.
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:07.640]   But he said, because he often gets drowsy,
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:09.320]   this was something that really scared me
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:10.880]   when I had a commute.
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:13.040]   I would get drowsy on the way home after the show
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:14.560]   and I'd be tired and I'd get drowsy.
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:17.040]   And I was so glad when I stopped driving
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:19.000]   'cause I was really afraid I was gonna die at some point
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.120]   by drifting off.
[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:23.440]   He said, there is something to be said for the kind of,
[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:26.160]   you shouldn't be taking naps to wheel.
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:27.320]   But should you get drowsy,
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:29.520]   if you've got these services turned on,
[01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:31.680]   you're safer, right?
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:35.040]   You're less likely to have an accident due to inattention.
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:36.040]   You should pay attention.
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:36.880]   Of course we know that.
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:38.880]   No one should drift off asleep.
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:41.080]   But these things might protect you if you,
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:46.080]   for a moment, you know, momentarily lose focus.
[01:27:46.080 --> 01:27:47.600]   - And many of these cars can actually tell
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.840]   if you do fall asleep because they have infrared cameras
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:50.680]   that are watching you.
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:52.400]   So they will tell if you're getting drowsy
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:53.400]   for not paying attention.
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:57.120]   And some of them even have retinal position detectors
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:59.600]   basically so they can tell exactly where you're looking.
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:02.000]   So they, and that's part of this handoff
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.200]   that that's gonna be put in place,
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:04.880]   which is uncomfortable as you're going
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:06.600]   from the car driving to driving the car
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:07.960]   and needs to obviously make sure
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:09.880]   that you are paying attention before.
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:12.280]   It'll give you control back if you do have a situation
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:14.760]   where the car can really drive itself.
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:16.720]   But these cars can really tell,
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:18.320]   in a lot of ways your health situation,
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:20.000]   in fact, we're working on seats
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.320]   that will tell if you're having a heart attack, for example.
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:25.000]   Things like that which are coming and which are encouraging.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:26.960]   And I think we'll make driving safer.
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:28.640]   But ultimately, you know, there are ways
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:30.480]   to exploit these autonomous systems.
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:31.840]   And as we've seen people are,
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:33.760]   we've all seen terrible YouTube videos
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:35.640]   of people on their Teslas playing board games
[01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:38.120]   or even snacks or picking maps.
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:39.800]   I hope that people will be responsible
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:41.160]   so they don't have to worry about some kind
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:43.760]   of draconian legislation that sets the whole world
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:46.200]   of autonomy back by five or 10 years.
[01:28:46.200 --> 01:28:48.720]   But ultimately, I think it's too early to tell.
[01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:51.400]   But I think this ties back to our conversation before
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:54.160]   about things getting more sensationalized
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:56.720]   and getting more coverage, I think, than they did before.
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:00.440]   If the news media sees these things and runs with them
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:01.680]   without getting all the facts right,
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:03.360]   as we've certainly seen in the case
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:05.080]   of the unfortunate death of a judge.
[01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:06.480]   I think Joshua Brown was his name
[01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:08.040]   who died in the mall less.
[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:10.240]   There have been a lot of misreporting about that incident
[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:13.240]   just because everyone wanted to cover the story
[01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:15.880]   of the first person who died in a quote unquote,
[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:17.320]   self-driving car.
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:19.720]   And so if we have a lot of misrepresentation,
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:22.440]   if that gets momentum, that could definitely
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:24.680]   set things back and that's really what I'm most concerned
[01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:26.480]   about here.
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:28.520]   - We almost have zero data points, right, Leo?
[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:29.360]   - Right.
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:32.600]   - We're talking about something that has happened once.
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.480]   It doesn't really tell you one way or another,
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:36.680]   whether it's dangerous or not.
[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:39.560]   - One thing we've known from watching this over and over again
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:42.480]   is technology disrupts the state.
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:44.440]   And during the period of disruption,
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:47.320]   whether it's cord cutting or self-driving,
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:51.560]   it's weird things, bad things sometimes happen
[01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:52.400]   and weird things happen.
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:53.840]   It doesn't work very well.
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:56.160]   And this is, we're kind of in that,
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:58.120]   I think for the next decade probably,
[01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:01.200]   in that inner-regnum between driving yourself
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:03.600]   and having the car drive you,
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:06.880]   where it's gonna be just weird and that disconnect of,
[01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:08.920]   well, who's in charge here?
[01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:10.720]   We're gonna be putting up with that for a while.
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:12.640]   So people pay attention.
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:15.520]   Don't trust the car.
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:18.200]   And this has been good for me.
[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:19.400]   You know, we're in a lucky position.
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:20.760]   I think all of us are in a lucky position
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:22.480]   that we are not,
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:25.640]   we don't have the pressure to file every five minutes
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:27.280]   and generate a lot of traffic.
[01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:30.800]   We have the luxury of not having to sensationalize the news
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:32.040]   or being able to sit back and say,
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:34.320]   well, let's find out what really happened.
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:39.360]   And I feel fortunate that I don't have to be first
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.480]   on any of these stories,
[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:42.680]   'cause they change.
[01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:47.240]   And you know, maybe this new media landscape
[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:49.160]   will help with that a little bit.
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:50.840]   We're gonna take a break.
[01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:53.040]   I wanna talk about Prime Day.
[01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:56.560]   Did you guys buy stuff at Prime Day to 12th?
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:58.000]   Free TV. - I got a TV.
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.280]   - It's, whoa, let's hear about it,
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:02.960]   when just a second, wow, whoa, nice.
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:06.280]   Our show today brought to you by My Mattress.
[01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:09.160]   A good night's sleep, God, it's so important.
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:11.080]   That is, you're not gonna have a good day
[01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:12.960]   if you did not get a good night's sleep.
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:14.200]   You just not, it's just hard.
[01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:15.680]   You have to slog through the day
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:18.960]   and talk about being dangerous at the wheel.
[01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:20.920]   If you're sleepy, driving, that's really bad.
[01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:22.520]   So get a good mattress.
[01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:24.560]   It will help you get a good night's sleep
[01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:28.160]   and Casper is the mattress to get.
[01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:31.320]   For a lot of reasons, of course, it is a great mattress.
[01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:34.160]   It combines two technologies, latex foam,
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:35.520]   and then supportive memory foam.
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:38.640]   So you get an award-winning sleep service
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:40.880]   with just the right surface, with just the right sink
[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:42.080]   and just the right bounce.
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:43.200]   It's kind of hard to describe.
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:44.920]   You gotta try it.
[01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:48.680]   2016 Business Intelligence Group Innovation Award winner.
[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:50.240]   It's summertime, it's hot.
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:54.480]   You will be very glad another Casper mattress sleeps cool.
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:56.720]   Breathes.
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.760]   And that's a big, that's important.
[01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:01.480]   That's a very big part of having a good night's sleep.
[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:05.080]   Comfort, coolness, but here's the best part.
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:06.160]   You can try it.
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:08.800]   You don't have to listen to me.
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:09.640]   You can try it.
[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:10.760]   Now, that's not in the store.
[01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:12.000]   That's not how you try a mattress.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.680]   Yeah, I know that's how we used to do it.
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:15.920]   You go to a store, you line it for five minutes.
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:18.520]   Get the stink eye from the salesperson
[01:32:18.520 --> 01:32:20.200]   as you get your shoes on.
[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:23.200]   You can't really see if this is a comfortable mattress.
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:24.960]   Can't tell you how many mattresses I bought
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:27.960]   and spent years on suffering with
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:29.520]   because I bought it in the store.
[01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:32.200]   No, the way you get the Casper is you order it right now.
[01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:33.440]   By the way, because you're buying direct
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:34.600]   from the factory, very affordable.
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:36.600]   It starts at $500 for a twin.
[01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:39.840]   It comes in that compact box, very easy,
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:41.560]   to get in the door.
[01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:43.000]   And then you open up the box and,
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.600]   whoosh, you got a mattress.
[01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:45.800]   Oh, you got a nice mattress.
[01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:46.960]   But try it.
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:50.120]   You have not one, not two, not three days.
[01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:52.160]   You have 100 nights.
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:53.120]   100 nights.
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:54.640]   If at any time in those first 100 nights,
[01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:57.600]   you say, yeah, I like my old mattress better.
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:58.520]   You just call Casper.
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:32:59.440]   They'll send a courier.
[01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:00.320]   They will take it away.
[01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:01.160]   They will refund you.
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:03.520]   Every penny will have cost you nothing.
[01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:06.880]   It is engineered the Casper mattress
[01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:10.080]   to meet the Goldilocks standard of not too hard,
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:13.520]   not too soft, but just right.
[01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:17.440]   Casper mattress is also made in the US,
[01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:19.880]   free shipping returns to the US and Canada.
[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:21.680]   You know, I was a little worried
[01:33:21.680 --> 01:33:22.680]   that I went and opened the mattress.
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:24.400]   I'd have to air it out 'cause it would smell,
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:26.360]   you know, like the, like latex.
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:29.440]   No, no, it's great.
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:33.600]   Casper.com/Twit.
[01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:36.760]   You could save an additional $50 towards a mattress purchase
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:38.920]   when you use the promo code TWIT at Casper,

[01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:48.120]   Casper.com/Twit, say, 50 bucks off the best mattress
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:50.460]   you've ever had or send it back.
[01:33:50.460 --> 01:33:54.520]   Really, really happy for my son.
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:56.120]   I, you know, he's in the dorm.
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:58.680]   They have terrible disgusting mattresses.
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:01.640]   So I sent him a Casper and he's third floors,
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:03.080]   but he was able to easily, you know,
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:05.920]   maybe he had to, with a buddy, get the mattress up.
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:06.840]   I don't know how he's gonna get it out.
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:08.400]   He probably just leave it there.
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:09.400]   I'm sure he left it there.
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:10.220]   You know, why not?
[01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:11.120]   He just left it there.
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:14.320]   Let's see here.
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:20.440]   Prime Day was July 12th.
[01:34:20.440 --> 01:34:21.280]   I looked at it.
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:23.200]   You know, the problem with those sales like that,
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:25.280]   this is Amazon Prime customers only,
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:27.280]   is you tend to buy stuff you don't want.
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:29.640]   So I just, I looked at it, I thought,
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:32.320]   now I'm not gonna, did I miss out?
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:33.800]   What did you buy, Christina? TV?
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:34.920]   I got a TV, yeah.
[01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:37.600]   Whoa, like a big one?
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:38.520]   Yeah, 43 inch.
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:40.160]   It's not the one behind me.
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:41.880]   It will eventually replace the one behind me.
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:44.720]   I haven't put it up yet, but I got a 43 inch 4K TV
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:45.560]   for $300.
[01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:47.120]   Whoa, nice.
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:47.960]   It's a high sense.
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:50.120]   It's probably not the best TV, but frankly,
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:51.840]   it'll be good enough and has a four year warranty,
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:52.960]   four HDMI ports.
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:54.920]   The reviews were solid.
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:56.000]   It was like a hundred bucks off.
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:57.920]   And I was like, I kind of need a new TV.
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:02.240]   It's been time. We've got a newer TV in our second bedroom.
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:04.320]   And so I just figured, okay, I'll go for it.
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.560]   And what actually happened, it was very funny.
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:10.160]   I hit the buy button and I went through the process
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:12.560]   and I had the wrong shipping address chosen.
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:14.520]   I had my work address chosen.
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:17.360]   And I was like, no, I do not want the TV sent to the office
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:18.720]   because they don't have to get an Uber to get a new--
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:22.080]   It's hard to bring a TV home on the subway, yeah.
[01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:24.120]   Well, right, especially 43 inch TV.
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:26.040]   It was like 30 pounds, like I'm not dealing with this.
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:27.520]   So I canceled the order.
[01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:29.760]   But then I can't repurchase it because I've already claimed
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:31.640]   all her points.
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:34.480]   So my colleague Raymond Wong was nice enough.
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:37.160]   Ray Ray was nice enough to buy it on his account
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:39.240]   and get it sent to my address.
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:41.800]   So using the magic of Venmo, I paid him back.
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:44.240]   But it was-- but it arrived.
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:46.760]   And I'm putting it up probably after the show.
[01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:50.080]   So yeah, I got a TV and I got a USB thumb drive
[01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:55.320]   because it's 2016 and it was like $15 for like a 64 gigabyte.
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:57.480]   And I was like, why not?
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:00.360]   You guys, you buy anything?
[01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:01.360]   Now--
[01:36:01.360 --> 01:36:04.000]   I tried, but I was in a plane over the Atlantic
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.680]   and the connection was slow and I missed my opportunity.
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:09.760]   And Gogo and Limbed Time Deals don't really
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:10.680]   work well together.
[01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:13.360]   I'm kind of impressed that you tried.
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:15.560]   There were a few tools and things for the garage.
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:18.880]   I was looking to get nothing too exciting, no TVs.
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:23.560]   Actually, I'm really interested in how you like
[01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:25.520]   Christina the high sense because, you know, these guys,
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:28.320]   these are the Chinese TV companies, TCL and high sense,
[01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:29.000]   are coming on strong.
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.080]   High sense took over Microsoft's massive booth at CES
[01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:33.840]   two years ago.
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:34.440]   No, I know.
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:37.000]   I've seen their TVs before and I've been impressed.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.600]   And so I'm looking forward to it too.
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:40.400]   I mean, I know it's not going to be-- look, I'm not
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:42.320]   making any mistake and thinking it's going to be as good as
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:43.560]   a high-end Samsung or something.
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:47.800]   But for $300, frankly, that's like if it sucks for breaks
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:51.000]   in a year, like, OK.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.920]   It actually has a four-year warranty, which is crazy.
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:56.640]   I'm like, I'm still using this TV in four years.
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:57.880]   I'll be very happy.
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:36:59.880]   Isn't that funny how that's changed?
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:01.000]   It really is.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.480]   Used to be to keep a TV for 10 years easy.
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:06.560]   Now, four years, that thing's ancient.
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:08.200]   We're at an ATV--
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:09.680]   My TV's nine years old.
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:10.880]   Yeah, you're that type.
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:13.520]   You're an intellectual, Tom.
[01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:15.160]   You don't know where the glass is now.
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:18.840]   You probably have like a rug over the TV.
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:20.040]   No, no, I don't know.
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:22.000]   I have an old Panasonic Plasma 1080p.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.240]   No, that's a good TV.
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:24.000]   You would don't like--
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:24.840]   I have to--
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:24.840]   I have to--
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:25.680]   I have to--
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:26.680]   I have to--
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:27.680]   I have to--
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:28.520]   You don't ever get rid of that.
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:29.040]   Yeah.
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:30.040]   Exactly.
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:31.520]   Yeah, they don't make plasma anymore.
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:32.040]   No, I'm not.
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:33.000]   Was it a choreo?
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.000]   Is it a choreo, Tom?
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:34.880]   Coron, yeah.
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:35.840]   No, no.
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:37.640]   It's a Vixia.
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:38.480]   I have a--
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:39.440]   That's so funny.
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:41.400]   That's our big TV in the living room.
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:41.800]   Oh, yeah?
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:43.000]   That's our Game of Thrones TV.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:43.680]   That's what I call it.
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:47.600]   At the time, which was like 2007, 2008, it was the TV.
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:48.600]   It was the TV.
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:49.100]   Yeah.
[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:49.600]   Yeah.
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:50.100]   Yeah.
[01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:50.600]   Yep.
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:51.600]   I think we have the same model.
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:52.600]   That's so funny.
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:53.600]   Yeah.
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:54.600]   Probably.
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:56.480]   I know I should get a new TV because--
[01:37:56.480 --> 01:37:57.480]   Because you're an intellectual.
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:58.720]   I'm an intellectual.
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:37:59.800]   But I don't--
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:00.800]   I resist--
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:02.840]   I don't want to get a new TV.
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:03.960]   But I'm missing out.
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:05.120]   Like the new OLEDs.
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:06.560]   Everybody's oh, they're really good.
[01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:07.560]   I'm really good.
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:11.000]   When 4K is worth getting and there's tons of programming
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.720]   and I feel like I'm really missing out,
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:13.680]   I'll get a new TV.
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:14.200]   Yeah.
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:14.680]   Yeah, same for me.
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:15.680]   We're not 4K.
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:18.560]   But OLEDs are attainable.
[01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:19.560]   I'll be there.
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:20.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:24.800]   You know, the one that everybody likes, the LG OLED,
[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:27.920]   that's the one that bought--
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:30.840]   what's the New York City TV--
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:33.920]   the value shootout, they call it, the value TV shootout,
[01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:36.440]   where they get the best TVs and then they
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:41.840]   have all these TV reviewers vote and then the LG OLED one.
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:46.600]   And they make a G line, G6 line, which is the expensive one.
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:50.360]   But then they make a B6, which is they take out
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:51.800]   like 3D.
[01:38:51.800 --> 01:38:53.240]   Oh, gee.
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:55.160]   Wow, I don't know how I'll live without it.
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:57.840]   They take out 3D and it's $1,000 less.
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:02.640]   Now you're talking for a 55-inch, something like 4,500
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:03.280]   for an OLED.
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:05.720]   So they're getting-- I mean, yes, that's still a lot more.
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:06.880]   But they're getting--
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:09.560]   You got a sweet WebOS interface too, which is--
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:10.240]   Yeah.
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:11.360]   It's got WebOS.
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:13.080]   I love WebOS.
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:14.080]   Award-winning interface.
[01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:14.920]   All right, you got WebOS.
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:17.880]   Do I have to swipe up?
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:18.840]   No.
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:21.320]   But there are some cute animations of your paints fly up
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:24.720]   and lots of pinks and magentas and things too.
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:27.880]   Most smart TVs are dumb.
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:29.600]   I wish they would just sell me a monitor
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:33.160]   and let me apply the smartness at another place.
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:35.200]   Well, the ones-- in fact, I was going to ask you, Christina,
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:38.080]   does yours have Roku built-in or anything like that?
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:41.280]   It has a YouTube and Netflix built-in.
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:42.360]   Oh, it has its own.
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:43.720]   But not a Roku.
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:44.960]   It's not a Roku thing.
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:47.120]   But it has YouTube and Netflix.
[01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:49.520]   So for the 4K content, that's how it'll come in.
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:52.640]   I mean, I don't need a 4K TV, especially the size I got.
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:54.880]   It was just for-- it was cheap.
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:59.280]   And I was like, well, I can watch 4K Netflix.
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:00.400]   That'll be cool.
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:03.080]   If I could watch Game of Thrones-- not Game of Thrones,
[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:05.080]   but Orange is the new black.
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:08.160]   Well, Game of Thrones is also 4K, but you've already seen it.
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:08.960]   Yeah, I've already seen it.
[01:40:08.960 --> 01:40:13.160]   And also, I mean, HP, I don't believe my cable provider offers 4K.
[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:15.120]   It's probably safe to say now.
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:17.000]   It wouldn't be a spoiler that Donald Trump becomes
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.720]   the president in that show.
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:21.040]   I don't think that's a spoiler.
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:22.520]   It's been long enough.
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:23.240]   It's been long enough.
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:23.740]   Yeah.
[01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:28.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:29.360]   Couldn't resist it.
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:30.200]   Couldn't resist it.
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:34.240]   What was that?
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:36.760]   There was something else I wanted to bring up.
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:38.960]   It was a world emoji day.
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:40.760]   I was supposed to wear my world.
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:44.760]   I got to-- the emoji people sent me a t-shirt.
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:45.240]   Yeah.
[01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:46.920]   I got to meet a t-shirt too and some stickers.
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:49.520]   But yeah, I loved it at the office, unfortunately.
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:50.320]   So I couldn't wear it.
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:52.440]   I forgot to wear it.
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:53.800]   I hate that it was on a Sunday this year.
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:54.920]   But yeah, World Emoji Day.
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:55.920]   Actually--
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:57.680]   Will actually--
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:00.640]   John, I think I left my-- I should put it on right now.
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:03.120]   It won't be too late.
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:04.320]   Yeah.
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:05.080]   Who sent this?
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:07.200]   The emoji consortium?
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:09.000]   It was emoji-pedia.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:09.960]   Oh, emoji-pedia.
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:11.640]   That's a good site.
[01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:12.440]   That's a great site.
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:14.600]   That's the site where if you don't know
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:16.880]   what the thing with the things coming out of it
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:20.480]   and the thingy is you can go there and find out.
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:23.200]   Well, it'll show it to you in every rendering style.
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:26.080]   So it shows it how it's rendered on Apple, on Android,
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:29.400]   on Windows, on an emoji one, on Twitter,
[01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:30.680]   like it shows you all the style.
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:31.200]   Yeah.
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:31.560]   It's great.
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:32.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:33.160]   There it is, emoji-pedia.
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:35.640]   It would be crazy if Unicode was sending people t-shirts.
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:36.120]   Yeah.
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:36.720]   I want it.
[01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:37.920]   I want a user to fade in the back.
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:40.840]   I want to say, if Unicode would ever answer my request
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:42.760]   for comment, like every time I write about emoji,
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:43.600]   I always reach out to them.
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:45.080]   And they're like, oh, go throw a mailing list.
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:47.560]   I'm like, are you serious?
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:48.760]   It's an instantous body.
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:49.560]   It's different than me.
[01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:50.080]   I know it is.
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:50.080]   I know it is.
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:50.560]   I know it is.
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:51.080]   It's ridiculous.
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:52.000]   There it is.
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:52.440]   There it is.
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.200]   World emoji day.
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:55.640]   Woo-hoo!
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:57.080]   Congratulations.
[01:41:57.080 --> 01:41:57.560]   Yay.
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:58.800]   I'm glad it was that emoji.
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:00.800]   I was worried.
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:02.800]   The pile of poo emoji.
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:04.960]   No, it's-- I don't think this is an emoji, is it?
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:06.280]   With a hat?
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:09.960]   No, it's their own, I guess, little creation, but it's cute.
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:10.480]   How do you--
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:12.400]   That's why Unicode doesn't support that shirt.
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:14.960]   This is your model, Unicode, Coplyans shirt.
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:18.600]   So there are-- and if you go to google.com, at least in the US,
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:21.240]   but I bet worldwide, they have a little Google doodle.
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:22.240]   It's World Emoji Day.
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:24.240]   And it says, teen girls--
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:25.160]   So cool.
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:27.040]   Code an emoji that's unique like you.
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.280]   And this is because Google was able to tell
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:33.200]   the world emoji consortium to actually add some female
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:38.480]   emojis with jobs instead of just-- what
[01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:42.280]   were the women-- the girl emojis before?
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:44.440]   It just depended that if you had--
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:46.400]   they're mostly just men for certain jobs.
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:48.200]   It was like if you're a farmer or a doctor or whatever.
[01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:49.840]   Campio Lady Farmer.
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:51.680]   Campio Lady Doctor.
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:53.840]   I mean, it's like, come on, Barbie,
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:55.240]   was all of these things.
[01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:56.000]   Come on, emoji.
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:56.920]   Getting stuff with Barbie.
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:42:57.480]   And now they are?
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:59.160]   And we're getting to the developer.
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:00.520]   Yeah, that's the new Barbie, though.
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:01.640]   That's not my Barbie.
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:05.240]   That's not Barbie from my era.
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:08.040]   That was only recent Barbie became anything more than just
[01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:10.600]   a busty--
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:11.440]   The world is changing.
[01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:15.320]   -- companion to Ken who had all the jobs.
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:15.840]   Actually--
[01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:18.640]   ATV's female doctors, just saying it again.
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:19.680]   So let me see these.
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:20.040]   Let me see.
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:21.640]   It's time for emoji equality.
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:22.840]   Until now, emoji represents--
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:26.120]   this is Google's madewithcode.com.
[01:43:26.120 --> 01:43:28.800]   Until now, emoji representing women hadn't been well
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:29.400]   representative.
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:30.080]   Let's change that.
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:32.760]   Google is working to make sure emoji include a wide range
[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:35.360]   of female professions.
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:37.200]   And now we're inviting you to join the movement
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:39.200]   by coding your own.
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:40.120]   Oh, this is kind of cool.
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:40.960]   Really cool.
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:42.000]   It's actually really cool.
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.360]   I'm playing with it right now.
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:46.520]   And it actually uses their blocky programming language.
[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:47.760]   It's actually really awesome.
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:49.560]   So there's a code block.
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:50.440]   Let's add a care.
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:53.600]   This is kind of like Android App Inventor.
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:56.120]   Use the drop down menu and choose a character.
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:02.080]   Olivia, Alia, Emma, Rebecca, Lily, Taylor, Mia, Valentina,
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:03.200]   Natalie, Martina.
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:05.360]   Well, there's no Christine.
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:07.000]   I'll be Emma.
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:08.880]   And then you can snap eyes in.
[01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:10.400]   Oh my gosh.
[01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:12.160]   Let's snap in some eyes.
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:13.600]   This is kind of cool because it really
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:16.040]   is just building a character.
[01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:19.720]   But you can say where the position of the eyes are.
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:20.280]   Yeah.
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:23.400]   And what code is it underneath?
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:24.440]   Well, like JavaScript.
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:24.960]   I don't know.
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:26.960]   JavaScript, yeah, that would make sense.
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:29.840]   So now I've made the eyes off to the left a little bit.
[01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:31.280]   That's not good.
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:35.160]   Oh, that's kind of creepy, actually.
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:35.760]   Whatever.
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:37.000]   It's your emoji.
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:37.840]   It's my emoji.
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:38.560]   Eyes there.
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:42.160]   Yeah, it's googly eyes.
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:44.720]   Let's move the eyes in a little bit.
[01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:46.000]   There you go.
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.280]   Yeah, eyes on the chin.
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:48.440]   Eyes on the chin.
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:49.000]   That's good.
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.160]   So you can make aliens, too.
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:54.400]   And I think aliens are somewhat underrepresented
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:55.800]   in the emoji space.
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:57.400]   There's only one.
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:44:58.400]   But there's only one.
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:00.000]   And we know there's more aliens than that.
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:01.800]   Let's give her a mouth.
[01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:03.000]   This is fun.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:04.240]   Tongue.
[01:45:04.240 --> 01:45:08.160]   I could choose a tongue and position the tongue.
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:09.400]   50.
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:09.920]   50.
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:11.040]   Yeah, this is kind of--
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:12.200]   There you go.
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:13.320]   That's my emoji.
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:14.120]   That's awesome.
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:15.600]   I think that's the family guy who's risen up.
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:16.120]   She should have a hat.
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:17.240]   Quite psychedelic.
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:17.880]   It is good.
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:18.840]   I like it.
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:23.600]   What kind of hat would you wear if you looked like that?
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:24.360]   Dark--
[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:25.400]   A flower crown?
[01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:25.760]   Oh, no.
[01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:26.360]   Flower crown.
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:27.080]   You're absolutely right.
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:28.960]   Flower chin, though.
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:29.600]   A flower chin.
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:30.720]   No, wait.
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:31.640]   Let's raise that.
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:32.200]   Lower it.
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:33.840]   OK, there you go.
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:34.840]   There you go.
[01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:36.120]   The flower choker now.
[01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:37.440]   Flower choker.
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:38.480]   I'm done.
[01:45:38.480 --> 01:45:40.400]   And what happens when you're done?
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:41.040]   What do you learn?
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:42.880]   You learn to have a change, a position of an object,
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:44.280]   a x, y values.
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:45.880]   And I can now download it.
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:46.800]   Very nice.
[01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:48.120]   I think I'm on.
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:52.600]   And I have my-- this is going to be my new Twitter
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:53.400]   profile picture.
[01:45:53.400 --> 01:46:00.680]   I did one earlier this week, and I used Prisma on it,
[01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:02.000]   to take a selfie.
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.160]   And then-- but Prisma brings out lines and stuff
[01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:05.120]   and shadows.
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:07.080]   And I didn't really notice it, but then I used it.
[01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:12.760]   And somebody said, dude, your emoji looks like Hitler.
[01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:14.880]   And I looked at it and I realized it does.
[01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:16.640]   So I backed down.
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:19.000]   But this doesn't look like Hitler.
[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:19.720]   I don't know.
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:20.200]   No.
[01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:20.560]   No.
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:22.000]   This is a safe emoji.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:22.520]   Awesome.
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:23.560]   Yeah.
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:25.760]   It's the extra-system-o-g.
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:27.920]   For those listening to the audio podcast,
[01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:29.560]   we're not going to try to describe it.
[01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:31.360]   You'll just have to go to Twitter.
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:32.600]   Just go to Twitter.
[01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:34.760]   My new-- this is actually-- this is great.
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:38.840]   You could use this for all your profile pictures everywhere.
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:40.040]   Let's see.
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:41.200]   Oh, I know what I want to do.
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:44.360]   We had a fun week, an interesting week.
[01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:47.720]   We talked about Pokemon Go pretty much incessantly all week.
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:48.720]   I'm curious.
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:53.320]   Let's see if the promo this week features any Pokemon at all.
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:55.240]   Previously on Twitter.
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:58.040]   I thought for sure this would be the first show I've done all week
[01:46:58.040 --> 01:46:59.960]   that doesn't mention Pokemon Go.
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:01.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:02.960]   Can you turn that down?
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:04.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:05.440]   That's awesome.
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:06.280]   It's like a heaven.
[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:07.720]   The new screen sabers.
[01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:09.840]   This is $49.
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:11.160]   It's the pocket chip.
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:15.720]   And what it really is is a full Linux computer plus keyboard.
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:17.920]   You could prototype inside of it and take it apart.
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:19.400]   So it has no glue and no screws.
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:21.720]   And of course, the entire thing, the hardware, the software,
[01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:25.160]   all designs are completely open source this week in law.
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:29.200]   Now, we have two fascinating guests, both working
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:34.080]   at the forefront of AI when it comes to the law.
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:36.600]   Do not pay a chat bot to help people
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:38.200]   with their low level legal problems,
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:40.720]   for example, parking tickets or delayed flights.
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:42.920]   From my experience, you have these guys
[01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:45.880]   copying and pasting templates into Microsoft Word
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:48.400]   and then charging $100 to do so.
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:49.920]   And I think that's just the perfect thing
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:52.760]   to be kind of disrupted by technology.
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:53.920]   Security now.
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:56.200]   We've got to talk about Russia's president Putin.
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:01.760]   Whether his shirt is on or off, he ordered the Federal Security
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:06.520]   Service Bureau to produce encryption keys capable
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:09.800]   of decrypting all data on the internet.
[01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:13.120]   But no one's really sure exactly what that means to it.
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:15.720]   Broadcasting from the capital of the free world,
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:16.880]   Petaluma, California.
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:17.720]   Absolutely.
[01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:19.800]   Strange week.
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:20.920]   Yep.
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:22.520]   Leo's off getting Pokemon's again.
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:22.960]   He is.
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:25.000]   He's like looking for me.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.200]   They caught me.
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:30.120]   Ah, Meghan Moroni has a look at the week.
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:32.560]   I should have you do this, Tom.
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:34.280]   He's getting chills down his back.
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:39.120]   He doesn't know Meghan Moroni has a look at the week ahead.
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:39.880]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:42.760]   Coming up this week on Tech News Today, July 18th
[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:44.880]   is the final deadline for bids on Yahoo.
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:45.560]   Anyone want it?
[01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:46.080]   You?
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:46.720]   You?
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:48.960]   This week will also see earnings from some of the biggest names
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:50.840]   in tech, including the aforementioned Yahoo,
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:55.240]   as well as IBM, Netflix, Qualcomm, Intel, and Microsoft.
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:48:58.000]   BitTorrent's live streaming TV news network also
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.240]   launches this week, bringing the Republican National
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:03.880]   Convention Street to you and your devices live.
[01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:05.840]   And for those security minded among us,
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:08.200]   RSA Asia takes place this week in Singapore
[01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:11.080]   with keynote speeches from Bruce Schneier and others.
[01:49:11.080 --> 01:49:12.880]   We'll cover these stories and more on Tech News Today
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:15.360]   at 4 p.m. Pacific Monday through Friday.
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:18.640]   Thank you so much, Meghan Moroni, the host of TNT.
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:20.360]   I-- IOS today.
[01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:21.680]   In fact, we're going to do that show.
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:22.720]   She's back from vacation.
[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:24.760]   We'll do that show tomorrow.
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:27.920]   Who's on triangulation tomorrow, Carsten?
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:29.880]   Are we going to do-- is Alan Cooper on time?
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:31.080]   Virginia Heffernan.
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:31.640]   Oh!
[01:49:31.640 --> 01:49:32.920]   With magic and loss.
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:34.040]   Virginia Heffernan.
[01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:34.560]   I can't wait.
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:39.040]   She's a New York Times writer and was the first--
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:41.000]   and I'm going to call her on this--
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:44.080]   to write about Twit in the New York Times.
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:48.640]   She said we were obsessively tech focused.
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:50.280]   And I made that our motto for some time.
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:50.840]   Remember that time?
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:52.160]   Maybe it was before you were telling me.
[01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:52.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:55.080]   I just always thought that was funny because it's like, yeah,
[01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:55.760]   that's the whole--
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:57.000]   Yeah, you got it.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:00.040]   She was doing-- I think she thought she was insulting us.
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:00.760]   But no, no.
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:02.000]   She thought she was insulting.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:06.600]   But yeah, it did seem like it was a little on the nose, maybe.
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:07.080]   Yeah.
[01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:08.400]   I wanted to ask Megan a question.
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:09.200]   Is she gone already?
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:09.720]   Yeah.
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:12.080]   Stop it.
[01:50:12.080 --> 01:50:12.960]   Yeah, sorry.
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:13.880]   Oh, she left.
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:15.720]   She was out Pokemon hunting.
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:16.200]   Oh.
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:17.200]   With her family.
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:19.120]   Virginia's new book is actually kind of
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:19.640]   be interesting.
[01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:22.360]   It's called "Magic and Loss--
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:25.840]   The Internet as Art--
[01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:29.280]   The Logic and Aesthetics Behind the Internet."
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:30.720]   Is that fascinating or what?
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:32.040]   I don't even know.
[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:33.120]   I don't know where to begin.
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:35.040]   I know.
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:38.760]   Just as Susan Sontag and Marshall McLuhan--
[01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:40.720]   She's getting compared to in the description.
[01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:42.280]   Yeah, that's an interesting blurb.
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:45.120]   I don't know if I would let my publisher compare me
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:46.960]   to Susan Sontag and Marshall McLuhan.
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:49.440]   But there you have it.
[01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:50.800]   There you have it.
[01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:53.240]   Life online in the highly visual, social, portable,
[01:50:53.240 --> 01:50:55.600]   and global incarnation.
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:57.680]   We'll talk about that tomorrow.
[01:50:57.680 --> 01:50:59.680]   And then Alan Cooper, the inventor of visual basic,
[01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:02.280]   and in a week.
[01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:03.640]   Maybe something.
[01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:06.000]   Possibly.
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.880]   We're working on him.
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:09.720]   Let's see here.
[01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:12.800]   FBI says, hey, when we write malware, it's not malware.
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:14.040]   You know why?
[01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:15.280]   Because we're the good guys.
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:20.520]   OK.
[01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:23.320]   Well, I'll take their word for it.
[01:51:23.320 --> 01:51:23.840]   The FBI--
[01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:25.680]   I don't think it was really anything to say about that.
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:27.040]   It's an obviously true statement.
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:28.040]   Yes.
[01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:28.560]   Right.
[01:51:28.560 --> 01:51:31.400]   It's obviously nothing wrong with that at all.
[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:35.240]   I mean, this is when the FBI was running
[01:51:35.240 --> 01:51:37.920]   at its own child pornography site.
[01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:39.240]   Right on tour, right?
[01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:39.680]   Yeah.
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:44.360]   So is that-- the good news is that in several cases,
[01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:47.840]   the judges have thrown that out.
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:52.080]   But the FBI, filing a legal brief,
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:55.240]   said a reasonable person or society
[01:51:55.240 --> 01:51:58.080]   would not interpret the actions taken by a law enforcement
[01:51:58.080 --> 01:52:03.120]   officer pursuant to a court order to be malicious.
[01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:04.680]   How could that be?
[01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:07.360]   Well, pursuant to a court order is the key there, right?
[01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:11.280]   If the court responsibly has said you get to tap a telephone
[01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:13.480]   line, then it's not against the law.
[01:52:13.480 --> 01:52:17.240]   And the problem is we don't have good, clear law
[01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:19.480]   about what you're allowed to do on the internet.
[01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:22.720]   Because I am a little bit sympathetic to the FBI
[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:27.160]   saying, well, if you're trying to tap an internet connection,
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:30.160]   like a particular specific person that we have probable cause
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:33.160]   about, we may not know where they are.
[01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:35.880]   But that doesn't give them the excuse to then say,
[01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:37.600]   so we never have to know where anyone is
[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:39.120]   and we get to tap anyone we want.
[01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:40.800]   Like, there needs to be a balance there.
[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:43.680]   Well, and this is precisely why judges have thrown out
[01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:45.080]   some of these decisions.
[01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:47.560]   Because they said, the FBI did not
[01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:50.160]   have a warrant to run a child pornography site
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:51.960]   or to use malware to crack a tour.
[01:52:51.960 --> 01:52:54.000]   They just did it.
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.680]   Right, creating a honeypot, you know,
[01:52:55.680 --> 01:52:57.280]   to try to catch-- look, creeps.
[01:52:57.280 --> 01:52:59.000]   So I don't think anybody's defending the people
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.440]   that they're going after.
[01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:02.200]   You know, when you don't have a court order,
[01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:04.240]   when you're just going off the hip and they, you know,
[01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:05.320]   we'll just get permission later.
[01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:06.160]   Like, that doesn't work.
[01:53:06.160 --> 01:53:06.880]   That's not OK.
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:08.720]   No.
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:10.880]   Galaxy Note 7, probably right.
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:13.360]   Being launched August 2nd, you're
[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:14.960]   going to go-- you're probably in New York.
[01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:18.200]   You're going to go to the Samsung Unhinged Event.
[01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:20.040]   And that's not what they call it.
[01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:20.880]   They're unlocked.
[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:22.800]   I like that.
[01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:23.800]   Unboxed.
[01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:25.640]   Yeah, no, I'll be there.
[01:53:25.640 --> 01:53:26.960]   And yeah, no, it seems like what they're
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:28.320]   going to be doing, the rumor is,
[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:30.320]   that they'll be changing the naming convention.
[01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:32.240]   They've been a year behind.
[01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:34.560]   They're skipping the Note 6 and just going
[01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:36.040]   to go into a Note 7, which makes sense.
[01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:38.240]   Because you've got the S7, the S7 Edge.
[01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:40.800]   And it's always weird to then have the Note 6.
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:44.200]   So it makes sense to have them have the same number.
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:45.040]   Looks pretty.
[01:53:45.040 --> 01:53:46.800]   And I'm just always ripping off Microsoft
[01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:49.720]   with their naming convention.
[01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:50.880]   Skipping numbers.
[01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:51.920]   Skipping numbers.
[01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:53.520]   Just skipping ahead.
[01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:54.080]   Just skipping ahead.
[01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:56.080]   Just like, we don't want this.
[01:53:56.080 --> 01:53:58.000]   Maybe they're just concerned.
[01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.920]   Maybe 6 is unlucky for them for some reason.
[01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:00.560]   Who knows?
[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:01.160]   But yeah.
[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:02.680]   By the way, a little public service announcement.
[01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:05.920]   In case you didn't know, you can get a free upgrade.
[01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:07.640]   Windows 10, did you know that?
[01:54:07.640 --> 01:54:09.720]   If you're-- no, surprise.
[01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:11.320]   Someone would have told us.
[01:54:11.320 --> 01:54:12.840]   Wish they'd let us know.
[01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:14.720]   Let me close this pop up in my desktop.
[01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:15.640]   I'm just going to say--
[01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:16.080]   There we go.
[01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:17.040]   Oh, I didn't know anything.
[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:18.760]   I was going to say, I think I just got one.
[01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:19.280]   It installed.
[01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:21.680]   I accidentally clicked an X and it installed it anyway.
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:22.240]   Yeah.
[01:54:22.240 --> 01:54:22.760]   Right.
[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:24.240]   Of course.
[01:54:24.240 --> 01:54:26.040]   Paul Therat, of course, our Windows Weekly.
[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:28.240]   I was just talking about how his wife, who--
[01:54:28.240 --> 01:54:29.920]   she's married to one of the premier Windows
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:30.920]   journalists in the world.
[01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:31.920]   She saw that box.
[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:33.440]   She just dragged it off the screen,
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:35.280]   like to this corner of the screen,
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:36.520]   which is what normal people do.
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:37.320]   I don't know what this is.
[01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:37.880]   I don't want it.
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:40.160]   But I'm just going to put it over here.
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:42.560]   And of course, she got Windows 10 as a result.
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:46.680]   Anyway, that is going to run out in 12 days.
[01:54:46.680 --> 01:54:49.000]   We're almost done.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:52.800]   Mike, as Sacha Nadella this week said, that's the future.
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:55.280]   There's no new Windows ever again.
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:56.000]   This is it.
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.280]   Windows is now software as a service.
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:01.920]   Yeah.
[01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:05.400]   And that's why they're being so pushy about trying
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:06.440]   to get people to upgrade to it.
[01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:06.840]   Exactly.
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:07.840]   Exactly.
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:11.360]   Because they promised us what a billion devices by 2018
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:11.880]   or something.
[01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:13.600]   And that's a really tall order.
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:15.720]   I think they're only $300 or $400 million.
[01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:18.160]   And I'm not sure they're going to meet that.
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:19.080]   They even say it now.
[01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:19.600]   They're not.
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:20.800]   They say they don't want it.
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:21.800]   Yeah.
[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:25.200]   They said, we were counting on a lot more Windows phones
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:26.400]   when we made that prediction.
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:27.400]   Whoops.
[01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:29.240]   I can't remember the exact words now,
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:30.520]   but they're like, that's pretty funny.
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:33.040]   That involved more focus on the phone market.
[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:33.560]   Yeah.
[01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:35.880]   And they're like, oh, you mean that $9 billion you spent?
[01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:37.360]   And then basically wrote off.
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:40.320]   And yeah, OK, good, good, good work there.
[01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:41.560]   Good job.
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:42.560]   Go team.
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:43.560]   That was the ball.
[01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:44.560]   It's a ball.
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:45.560]   It was.
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:46.560]   Yeah.
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:47.560]   That's all right.
[01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:48.560]   I can't blame Steve.
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:51.240]   He was a he was a vefacious.
[01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:52.880]   He was in a better place now.
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:53.880]   He is.
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:55.880]   Honestly, he's living his best life.
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:55:56.880]   And we could be.
[01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:57.880]   We're having a friend.
[01:55:57.880 --> 01:55:59.480]   I'm genuinely so happy for him.
[01:55:59.480 --> 01:56:02.040]   Like you know, this is just literally what he was meant to do.
[01:56:02.040 --> 01:56:04.040]   He is living his best life.
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:08.000]   You know, as a sports team owner, getting to yell and cheer
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:11.480]   and you know, screaming, you know, players, players, players,
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:12.480]   and it's great.
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:13.480]   And they're successful.
[01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:15.480]   A team that was never successful.
[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:16.480]   That's amazing.
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:18.480]   He's like the ultimate.
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:20.480]   I mean, again, he's living his best life.
[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:25.480]   And we can only all wish that our retirement could be that fruitful and amazing.
[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:26.480]   Yeah.
[01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:30.480]   Well, if you have a couple of billion dollars lying around, you could buy it.
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:33.480]   And be a team and it'll make any of his retirement a little bit.
[01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:34.480]   Yes, sir.
[01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:35.480]   Yeah.
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:36.480]   We'll take a break.
[01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:38.480]   Then we'll talk about the Yahoo deal and kind of wrap it up.
[01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:42.760]   We're running low on fumes here, almost out of gas.
[01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:46.880]   This show brought to you by Squarespace, the place to make your next website.
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:51.200]   I love the starts with the templates, a gorgeous Squarespace templates.
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:54.440]   I got a really nasty tweet because I said, you don't need a web designer.
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:55.440]   The guys are web designers.
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:57.200]   He said, you're putting me out of work.
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:56:58.200]   Well, sorry.
[01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:03.040]   But frankly, unless you're a big corporation, you could afford to spend a lot of money,
[01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:07.720]   you're better off going to Squarespace because they have the best designers, the best engineers,
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:09.920]   designing these new templates.
[01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:13.000]   You start with the template and you get state of the art design.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:17.360]   And by the way, it's very fashion driven.
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:19.520]   So you're going to get the latest, greatest looks.
[01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:23.280]   But when a new one comes along, you push a button and it's easy.
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:26.640]   You just apply a new template, your content's all there.
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:30.720]   And they're all the best engineering, all the state of the art stuff, like mobile responsive
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:34.040]   design, which means your site, you don't have a separate mobile site.
[01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:36.480]   Your site looks good on every size screen.
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:38.520]   They have some new templates.
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:41.800]   Actually, this is kind of a new thing they can do.
[01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:46.680]   You can put multiple templates on one website and work on multiple designs at once.
[01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:51.480]   So suddenly, the whole thing, the template space has really opened up because there's
[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:52.480]   the sky's limit.
[01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:53.960]   You could do anything.
[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:57.680]   They have these great magazine templates, grid style landing pages, infinite scroll,
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:02.120]   related posts, author profiles, search in the header, all of that.
[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:06.720]   You can now get e-commerce in every single site.
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:07.720]   And it's good to us.
[01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:08.960]   The e-commerce that you would want.
[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:10.800]   It doesn't look like it's a afterthought.
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:13.080]   It looks like it's the design of your site.
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:14.640]   So people feel good about it.
[01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:18.840]   They're like, in the same spot as boys, that's all so affordable.
[01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:24.200]   Plus, you get a free custom domain name with an annual purchase, access to 24/7 customer
[01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:25.560]   support.
[01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:27.560]   They do don't mains now, which is really nice.
[01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:29.360]   Support for over 200 top level domains.
[01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:32.280]   All the big ones and some wild ones too.
[01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:36.400]   And if you have an idea but you're not, yeah, Pokemon Go, there you go.
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:38.320]   That's we need to do a site.
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:40.120]   Let's see what we can get.
[01:58:40.120 --> 01:58:44.360]   They'll give you a great, there's .com, there's .net.org.info.
[01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:47.760]   And if you're not ready to do the site yet, they'll give you a landing page.
[01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:48.760]   It doesn't have ads on it.
[01:58:48.760 --> 01:58:49.760]   It's just gorgeous.
[01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:51.960]   Look at all of these.
[01:58:51.960 --> 01:58:52.960]   I love it.
[01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:57.360]   They just introduced analytics for commerce, allowing you to view the traffic of your visitors
[01:58:57.360 --> 01:59:03.600]   in real time and things like abandoned checkouts, device filtering and more.
[01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:07.440]   This is the point is that you sign up, you're part of the Squarespace family and you get
[01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:12.040]   all of this automatically because the best hosting and the best software, security updates,
[01:59:12.040 --> 01:59:16.000]   upgrades, new features all come with the territory.
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:19.600]   And members who have built or contributed to three or more active Squarespace websites
[01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:23.720]   now can join the Squarespace Circle.
[01:59:23.720 --> 01:59:27.040]   Circle membership includes advanced guides, optimized support, six month trial periods
[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:28.440]   for new projects and more.
[01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:32.520]   And the nice thing about a Squarespace site is you design it, it's going and it goes and
[01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:33.440]   it goes and it goes and it goes.
[01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:35.360]   It just never goes down.
[01:59:35.360 --> 01:59:42.640]   Squarespace.com, you could try it for free, but if you go there and you decide to buy,
[01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:47.120]   may I suggest you use the offer code to it because not only will they then say, "Oh,
[01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:53.280]   you heard about it on Twitter," but they will also give you 10% off as a little thank you.
[01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:58.080]   Squarespace.com is the offer code.
[01:59:58.080 --> 02:00:00.040]   Twit.
[02:00:00.040 --> 02:00:02.200]   So it's finally happening tomorrow.
[02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:07.720]   Ladies and gentlemen, Yahoo will be sold.
[02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:08.720]   The gavel.
[02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:10.680]   Is that a golf club?
[02:00:10.680 --> 02:00:11.680]   It was.
[02:00:11.680 --> 02:00:12.680]   The gavel.
[02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:15.320]   Our long national night.
[02:00:15.320 --> 02:00:17.040]   Over.
[02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:20.800]   Final bids for the services that is searched, that's email, that's advertising, that's media
[02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:23.000]   operations due tomorrow.
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.800]   The board will make a decision quickly after.
[02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:31.000]   I think the board probably already knows who they are going to award it to, I would guess.
[02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.160]   Verizon seems to me the inside track.
[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:37.360]   They would probably merge it with AOL.
[02:00:37.360 --> 02:00:39.200]   AOL.
[02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:42.560]   And I don't know, they could go, I don't know, they could, what could you do?
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:44.840]   You could do Yahoo.
[02:00:44.840 --> 02:00:45.840]   Yahoo.
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:46.840]   Yahoo.
[02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:47.840]   Yahoo.
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:49.840]   I don't know.
[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:50.840]   Somehow merge.
[02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:53.160]   AOL is kind of a similar property, right?
[02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:55.040]   It's not.
[02:00:55.040 --> 02:00:56.800]   It's still got a lot of traffic.
[02:00:56.800 --> 02:00:58.040]   There's still a lot of content.
[02:00:58.040 --> 02:00:59.040]   There's a lot of.
[02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:01.960]   I mean, the Yahoo homepage, I think, is more than the AOL homepage.
[02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:07.800]   But yeah, I mean, they've got programmatic advertising and media content and video and
[02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:08.800]   other stuff.
[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:09.800]   So yeah.
[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:10.800]   AT&T.
[02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:11.800]   Yeah.
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:12.800]   Yeah.
[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:13.800]   Yeah.
[02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:14.800]   Yeah.
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:15.800]   Yeah.
[02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:16.800]   Yeah.
[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:17.800]   Yeah.
[02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:24.040]   AT&T also in the mix, apparently, including a quick and loans co-founder Dan Gilbert with
[02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:26.680]   support from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.
[02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:30.040]   Actually, a number of equity firms interested.
[02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:34.280]   Probably they would chop it up and sell it off for pieces for parts, right?
[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:35.280]   Yeah.
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:36.280]   I'm sure.
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:38.360]   You'd see a Ziff Davis-like effect on it probably.
[02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:39.360]   Yeah.
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:45.120]   Boy, it's amazing when you see what happened to Ziff Davis after we worked for ZD, of course,
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:46.120]   Tom and I.
[02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:47.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:51.160]   Did you, you didn't, you, it was owned by SoftBank when you joined us, right?
[02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:52.160]   Correct.
[02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:53.160]   Yes.
[02:01:53.160 --> 02:01:54.160]   I was under Masioshi Son.
[02:01:54.160 --> 02:02:01.320]   I worked for Ziff Davis for 10 years and had four different owners.
[02:02:01.320 --> 02:02:11.400]   And now it's owned by weirdly enough, Ziff Davis is owned by, I can't remember.
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:14.400]   Well pieces, I mean, CNET owns ZD net still.
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:15.400]   Right.
[02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:17.600]   It's the domain name for ZDTV.com or did.
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:19.960]   But like PC Magazine and Extreme Tech.
[02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:20.960]   Yeah.
[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:21.960]   What's left is Ziff Davis media.
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:25.920]   Well, Ziff Davis media got split up into two different pieces too.
[02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:29.840]   There's different equity firms behind it.
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:31.640]   That's what it'll happen.
[02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:33.120]   And so that may be what happens to Yahoo.
[02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:34.480]   I'm with Christina.
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:37.400]   I think Verizon is probably the best bet to get Yahoo.
[02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:39.040]   It just makes the most sense to me.
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:40.040]   It makes the sense.
[02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:44.440]   So do we think that Tim Marns Armstrong will be given control over both?
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:45.440]   Yes.
[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:46.440]   I would say so.
[02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:47.440]   Yeah.
[02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:48.440]   It's that much.
[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:49.440]   Yeah.
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:50.440]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:51.440]   5G.
[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:53.080]   Very interesting.
[02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:56.520]   Federal government president Obama says we're in the National Science Foundation.
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:03:04.320]   We're going to put $400 million into 5G over the next few years.
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:05.680]   That's not a lot of money though.
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:06.680]   $400 million.
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:08.000]   I think it's a safe thing, Christina.
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:09.800]   It's honestly it's not for the infrastructure.
[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:10.800]   Are you kidding me?
[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:11.800]   That's like a drop in the bucket.
[02:03:11.800 --> 02:03:13.200]   But we got to first do research, right?
[02:03:13.200 --> 02:03:15.080]   I mean, we got to-- or no.
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:16.080]   Do they already have the technologies?
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:17.240]   They already have the research.
[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:18.960]   So it's just putting it in.
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:19.960]   It's rollout.
[02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:20.960]   It's spectrum allocation.
[02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:24.480]   The FCC has voted to make spectrum available for it.
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:27.000]   It's standardization still has to come.
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:28.760]   It hasn't actually been voted on a standard.
[02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:30.240]   But the same thing happened with 4G.
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:32.760]   People were rolling out implementations before the standard.
[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:34.760]   And they have private industry involved as well.
[02:03:34.760 --> 02:03:35.760]   Maybe there'll be more money.
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:38.080]   I'm a Samsung and the carriers are putting--
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:40.320]   Yeah, the carriers for sure.
[02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:43.920]   Because the last thing that anybody wants is for us to have what we had here, which was
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:48.480]   remember what was what was Sprint's terrible thing called their phone version of--
[02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:49.480]   Oh, YMAX.
[02:03:49.480 --> 02:03:50.480]   YMAX.
[02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:51.480]   YMAX.
[02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:52.480]   YMAX was this LTE debate.
[02:03:52.480 --> 02:03:53.480]   And we all knew.
[02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:55.280]   We all knew that YMAX was dead.
[02:03:55.280 --> 02:03:56.960]   We were like, Sprint, what are you doing?
[02:03:56.960 --> 02:03:58.680]   And Sprint was like, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:00.120]   We swear it'll be good.
[02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:01.120]   It wasn't.
[02:04:01.120 --> 02:04:02.120]   So I mean, we can't have--
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:03.120]   Still big in Japan.
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:04.120]   They have YMAX too even.
[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:05.120]   Really?
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:06.120]   Yeah.
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:07.120]   I was early, optimist about YMAX.
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:08.120]   But we all were.
[02:04:08.120 --> 02:04:09.920]   And it was only Sprint.
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:11.600]   I knew the writing was on the wall.
[02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:12.600]   We all were.
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:13.600]   Same.
[02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:16.240]   When it was very clear that it was only Sprint, it was going to be involved.
[02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:18.040]   It was like, oh, well, that's over.
[02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:19.040]   Yeah.
[02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:20.040]   Good luck there.
[02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:28.760]   HTC also participating Intel Oracle, Nokia, not Apple, Google, or Microsoft.
[02:04:28.760 --> 02:04:29.760]   They're not getting involved.
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:34.400]   No, I mean, I think Apple and Google are smart enough to recognize the ones that there's
[02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:35.960]   a standard they'll sign on board.
[02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:38.720]   They don't need to be involved in it earlier than that.
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:42.600]   If you're a chipset provider, if you're a Qualcomm or someone, maybe you care more if
[02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:44.800]   you're a radio provider like Erickson.
[02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:47.280]   But if you're not doing those things, why bother?
[02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:48.280]   Yeah.
[02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:51.600]   I mean, Google, if they got involved, that would be very telling for their plans for
[02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:52.600]   Project 5.
[02:04:52.600 --> 02:04:53.600]   Yeah.
[02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:56.040]   That's very true.
[02:04:56.040 --> 02:04:58.760]   Which, that was some other news this week.
[02:04:58.760 --> 02:05:03.920]   You can now get international 4G with Project 5 for the same price.
[02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:04.920]   LTE.
[02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:05.920]   Yeah.
[02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:06.920]   Which is amazing.
[02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:09.120]   I mean, like, that's seriously unreal.
[02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:12.320]   I signed up for Project 5 right away because I'm going to be traveling internationally.
[02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:14.080]   It's an awesome T-Mobile.
[02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:18.440]   T-Mobile only gives me a slower level of service, which is nice.
[02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:19.440]   Yeah.
[02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:20.440]   Which is great.
[02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:23.000]   But if you're going to be in Japan, you don't want your 2G on T-Mobile.
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:28.040]   So might as well take an XS, you know, 6P or whatever or whatever.
[02:05:28.040 --> 02:05:29.040]   Exactly.
[02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:31.920]   And get $10 a gigabyte or whatever it is, which is awesome.
[02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:37.160]   So you pay the same rate in 15 countries that you pay in the US for high speed and you
[02:05:37.160 --> 02:05:38.560]   get full high speed.
[02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:40.800]   You get the fastest speed available is what they say.
[02:05:40.800 --> 02:05:44.960]   Now, I don't know if that means available in our partners or available.
[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:47.640]   I imagine it means available in our partners for sure.
[02:05:47.640 --> 02:05:48.640]   Yeah.
[02:05:48.640 --> 02:05:50.280]   And three is their partner now in the UK.
[02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:52.520]   Three is a very good carrier in the UK.
[02:05:52.520 --> 02:05:54.120]   I don't know what they're doing in Japan.
[02:05:54.120 --> 02:05:55.120]   But yeah, that would-
[02:05:55.120 --> 02:05:59.960]   I think they used three's roaming partners to kind of get into the-
[02:05:59.960 --> 02:06:00.960]   The one out?
[02:06:00.960 --> 02:06:01.960]   That's the most remarkable mark.
[02:06:01.960 --> 02:06:03.120]   That seems to be what they did.
[02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:04.120]   Well, right.
[02:06:04.120 --> 02:06:08.800]   If you're leaving in September, that's probably when there'll be a new Nexus phone or phones.
[02:06:08.800 --> 02:06:12.920]   That might be the time to pick one up, get a 5 chip and go for it.
[02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:21.080]   The 5G story data rates in the tens of megabits a second.
[02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:26.640]   But even higher, a gigabit per second in some cases.
[02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:29.480]   Lots of efficiency, better coverage.
[02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:32.160]   Latency significantly reduced compared to LTE.
[02:06:32.160 --> 02:06:36.120]   I'm looking at the Wikipedia article about 5G.
[02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:40.440]   Now, don't get all excited because according to this, the next generation of mobile networks
[02:06:40.440 --> 02:06:46.120]   alliance is calling for 5G to be rolled out by 2020.
[02:06:46.120 --> 02:06:47.280]   So we're a few years off.
[02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:51.440]   We're a couple years away, but I mean at least we have already seen, I think, just how
[02:06:51.440 --> 02:06:54.680]   much faster LTE rolled out than a lot of us were expecting.
[02:06:54.680 --> 02:06:57.840]   Once it finally got over, like there was a good Y-max for LTE.
[02:06:57.840 --> 02:07:03.560]   And once the bigger manufacturer jumped on board, that rollout, which at first the carriers
[02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:07.240]   were kind of reticent to do, came fast.
[02:07:07.240 --> 02:07:08.920]   I think we can thank the iPhone for a lot of that.
[02:07:08.920 --> 02:07:13.000]   But I think just for kind of forcing the carriers to say, "Well, now we really got to
[02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:14.000]   blink at the place with it."
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:19.480]   But now I mean, even in places that there are a few world pockets where you won't find
[02:07:19.480 --> 02:07:23.520]   LTE in the United States, but it's come faster and faster.
[02:07:23.520 --> 02:07:28.120]   And I think that that'll only be good things once the 5G roll, what happens.
[02:07:28.120 --> 02:07:33.920]   And yeah, that's four or five years away, but that's still in the grand scheme of things,
[02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:39.800]   not terrible for wireless gigabit, which is a great thing to think about.
[02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:43.200]   I sort of think the marketing companies just call it 5G this time.
[02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:47.680]   They don't have to do the 5G LTE thing, which of course was necessitated by the Y-max thing.
[02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:49.480]   Maybe just 5G, I think.
[02:07:49.480 --> 02:07:55.760]   Well, and what happened was T-Mobile started calling their HSPA+ 4G when it wasn't 4G.
[02:07:55.760 --> 02:07:59.320]   So don't anybody call something 5G if it's not actually 5G.
[02:07:59.320 --> 02:08:00.960]   But you know they will.
[02:08:00.960 --> 02:08:06.360]   Yeah, it'll be like 4.5G and they'll be calling it, which is what has happened to HSPA+.
[02:08:06.360 --> 02:08:08.120]   Yeah, they'll be like, "Oh, but it's 5G.
[02:08:08.120 --> 02:08:09.120]   It's a marketing term."
[02:08:09.120 --> 02:08:11.560]   And we're like, "No, actually it's not, but thank you."
[02:08:11.560 --> 02:08:12.560]   Yeah.
[02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:15.320]   So some LTE advanced implementation is going to get called 5G.
[02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:17.600]   Oh my God, you're so right it is.
[02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:22.520]   The next LTE advanced is going to, oh my God, yeah, that's totally happening.
[02:08:22.520 --> 02:08:26.240]   So the DARPA Grand Challenge brought us autonomous vehicles.
[02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:27.240]   It was amazing.
[02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:32.680]   And just a few years, cars went from running off the road after 30 feet to driving long
[02:08:32.680 --> 02:08:33.680]   distances.
[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:36.600]   The new DARPA Grand Challenge is a cyber challenge.
[02:08:36.600 --> 02:08:45.760]   August 4th, in between Black Hat and Def Con in Las Vegas, computers are going to hack each
[02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:46.760]   other.
[02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:52.040]   And totally autonomous computers will face off in a historic battle to each to try to
[02:08:52.040 --> 02:08:56.960]   defend themselves and point out flaws without any human intervention.
[02:08:56.960 --> 02:08:57.960]   That's awesome.
[02:08:57.960 --> 02:09:03.800]   That is, I'm telling you, it's seven teams of finalists with names like Deep Red and
[02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:07.520]   Code Jitsu were given a DARPA constructed computer.
[02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:13.440]   Their task, program it to be able to recognize and understand previously undisclosed software,
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:16.320]   find its flaws and fix it.
[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:20.320]   And once the challenge starts, no human involvement, that's it.
[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:21.320]   That's so cool.
[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:22.320]   The machines have to come.
[02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:23.960]   I'm quite as exciting as cars driving.
[02:09:23.960 --> 02:09:25.960]   It won't be much fun to watch.
[02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:26.960]   It is interesting.
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:29.360]   But what will be fun?
[02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:35.320]   The team that wins gets $2 million.
[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:37.520]   Second and third, a million and 750,000.
[02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:40.920]   So there's some incentive here.
[02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:46.120]   Yeah, $2 million plus immediate interest in signing them on to provide security.
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:47.120]   They're hired.
[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:48.120]   Yeah, seriously.
[02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:49.120]   Seriously.
[02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:51.800]   I presume people are working on this right now.
[02:09:51.800 --> 02:09:53.760]   I think this is very cool.
[02:09:53.760 --> 02:09:56.840]   What does this do to putting malicious hackers out of work though?
[02:09:56.840 --> 02:10:00.360]   Well, we can only hope.
[02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:04.640]   We can but hope the world's first all-machine hacking tournament.
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:10.160]   I hope there's lots of lights because otherwise it will be very morning just to watch.
[02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:11.960]   And now he seems to be.
[02:10:11.960 --> 02:10:13.640]   There should be lights and there should be like bells.
[02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:15.960]   You know, whenever you're ever having to be attacked or repaired, you get another
[02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:16.960]   being.
[02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:17.960]   It's computing.
[02:10:17.960 --> 02:10:19.840]   Yes, it's still computing.
[02:10:19.840 --> 02:10:22.240]   Wow, talk about watching Grass Grow.
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:24.240]   I don't know.
[02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:27.480]   It could be exciting if you had casters who knew what they were talking about.
[02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:31.600]   Like you can see he's trying to get around the firewall here, but watch.
[02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:36.400]   I'm always trying another buffer overflow, but no, it's thwarted.
[02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:38.280]   Quick divide by zero and yes.
[02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:41.480]   He slams those ports close before I get to him.
[02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:42.480]   A clutch move.
[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:45.280]   He's sports commentators involved.
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:46.520]   Can we combine those two worlds?
[02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:47.520]   It would be funny.
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:52.800]   It would be like an old school hockey commentator to talk about clothing ports down.
[02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:54.760]   I think Father Robert's going down.
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:56.600]   It's hard to get people to go there.
[02:10:56.600 --> 02:11:02.920]   A lot of the people we work with say, "No, not going anywhere near Defcon."
[02:11:02.920 --> 02:11:10.320]   But I think Father Robert goes down and he usually sanitizes his inputs before.
[02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:12.720]   You go down there with a dummy laptop and phone.
[02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:15.160]   You're like, "Just in case."
[02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:17.120]   Bring a Nokia candy bar phone.
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:18.120]   Yeah.
[02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:19.120]   And a Chromebook.
[02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:21.560]   It's the profile that doesn't belong.
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:22.560]   Like a dummy profiling.
[02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:27.120]   Hey, speaking of Chromebooks boy, I had a happy occurrence on Thursday.
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:29.240]   I rebooted my Chromebook Pixel.
[02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:33.780]   I'd put it in developer mode some time ago and lo and behold, the Android store, the
[02:11:33.780 --> 02:11:35.600]   Play Store popped up.
[02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:37.760]   You're playing Pokemon Go on it?
[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:38.760]   You can.
[02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:40.880]   It's a little weird.
[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:43.040]   You have to have GPS and it doesn't know where you are.
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:45.200]   But other than that, they just spoof the GPS.
[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:46.200]   Then you don't have to even leave.
[02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:48.000]   You just spoof the GPS and you can be anywhere, Leo.
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:49.760]   You can literally go anywhere.
[02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:50.760]   Ooh.
[02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:54.920]   Now we're talking, but never move more than five miles an hour.
[02:11:54.920 --> 02:11:55.920]   And you're going--
[02:11:55.920 --> 02:11:56.920]   You know about there.
[02:11:56.920 --> 02:12:00.960]   It was a YouTuber and I wish I could remember his name who used Bluestacks and spoof GPS.
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:01.960]   Oh, smart.
[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:02.960]   I'll do that.
[02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:03.960]   All right, I'll have to look into that.
[02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:06.920]   I did install a number of apps to see.
[02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:10.440]   Many of them are kind of like you have a phone on your screen.
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:12.560]   But some are smart enough to go full screen.
[02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:16.120]   Snap Seed, for instance, was a great Google photo editing program.
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:17.880]   It works like a desktop program.
[02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:20.600]   It's pretty cool.
[02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:24.960]   And if you have a Pixel and I think that they are kind of encouraging touch for the--
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:30.400]   There's only-- right now it's three Chromebooks.
[02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:35.040]   More to come in the fall and you have to be in the developer track to do it.
[02:12:35.040 --> 02:12:36.040]   It did.
[02:12:36.040 --> 02:12:37.040]   You know, it's buggy.
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:39.920]   It got some real slowdowns like weird things going on.
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:43.640]   But nevertheless, the fact that you could run Android apps on your Chromebook really
[02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:46.440]   adds a whole other layer of capability.
[02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:49.080]   What are they just going to use the two projects?
[02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:51.120]   Well, I think that's where they're going, right?
[02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:54.320]   I mean, yeah, I've been predicting that for years and I've been told by like the Android
[02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:56.120]   and Google Watchers, no, no, no, you're wrong, you're wrong.
[02:12:56.120 --> 02:12:57.120]   And I'm like, no, but--
[02:12:57.120 --> 02:12:58.120]   But really?
[02:12:58.120 --> 02:12:59.120]   Like, seriously.
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:00.120]   Come on.
[02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:02.160]   Do you need to have two separate stacks?
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:06.360]   Because two separate-- I mean, you've got two versions of Linux happening right now.
[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:09.400]   Just merge them into one thing.
[02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:10.400]   Right.
[02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:13.400]   It just adds like two million apps now that you can run.
[02:13:13.400 --> 02:13:18.920]   And by the way, I did not notice any attempt to restrict the apps you could get like, oh,
[02:13:18.920 --> 02:13:21.840]   with Android TV, you could only get a small subset of the total store.
[02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:26.600]   It looked like the whole store was there, even if the app made no sense on a Chromebook.
[02:13:26.600 --> 02:13:30.880]   I'm curious what the end of that road is, because Microsoft's trying to do the same thing
[02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:35.640]   to say we have one operating system on multiple platforms and Google's taking a different
[02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:36.640]   approach.
[02:13:36.640 --> 02:13:40.440]   I think they don't know whether they will actually merge Chrome OS and Android.
[02:13:40.440 --> 02:13:42.800]   They're just trying things to see how they work.
[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:44.640]   And this is the next step.
[02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:45.640]   Well?
[02:13:45.640 --> 02:13:47.760]   Yeah, I think that's a good point.
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:49.600]   Because it's a different implement.
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:51.320]   I mean, it is a slightly different user interface.
[02:13:51.320 --> 02:13:55.440]   I guess for me, what I could see them doing at some point would be if Android becomes
[02:13:55.440 --> 02:14:01.800]   developed enough, have the same Chrome that's running on desktop on Chrome OS and Android
[02:14:01.800 --> 02:14:03.880]   literally being the same branch.
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:06.240]   And that would at least get you close to the version.
[02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:12.400]   I have a Pixel C and I would love to have some of the Chrome ability, Chrome OS ability.
[02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:14.480]   I had such high hopes for that.
[02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:19.280]   And I ended up not a great experience.
[02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:20.480]   Too bad.
[02:14:20.480 --> 02:14:21.480]   We're at a time.
[02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:22.480]   What a fun show.
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:24.320]   Great to have you all, Tim Stevens.
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:27.160]   He's now the host of The Roadshow.
[02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:30.920]   If you're into automobiles, that thing is becoming a juggernaut.
[02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:34.840]   I mean, you really, this is, you've gone, this is like you've got a whole team now.
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:37.560]   You've got the people all over the world.
[02:14:37.560 --> 02:14:38.560]   Really good.
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:39.560]   We do.
[02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:40.560]   We've got a great team.
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:41.560]   We've got folks in London and Detroit and San Francisco.
[02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:45.120]   I'm in New York and yeah, a lot of great stuff and a lot of great news and reviews.
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:46.120]   So check it out.
[02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:48.560]   What are you most excited about in the automotive world?
[02:14:48.560 --> 02:14:54.280]   Well, in just a couple of weeks, I'm going to Reno, Nevada to see a certain battery
[02:14:54.280 --> 02:14:55.280]   factory that's opening.
[02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:58.680]   Oh, that's been in a couple weeks.
[02:14:58.680 --> 02:15:01.080]   Oh, that is exciting.
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:06.960]   Actually, we just got an invitation to go down and visit one of their, a number of hyperloop
[02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:08.200]   projects going on.
[02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:12.960]   They've all, they're all funded by angel investors who are excited about the prospects
[02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:14.200]   of Hyperloop.
[02:15:14.200 --> 02:15:16.920]   And we're going down, I think to Santa Jose to look at one of the companies that's starting
[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:19.240]   to do some Hyperloop development.
[02:15:19.240 --> 02:15:24.920]   I believe in Russia, apparently, is all in on Hyperloop.
[02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:25.920]   Who knew?
[02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:26.920]   They want you to think that.
[02:15:26.920 --> 02:15:27.920]   Yeah.
[02:15:27.920 --> 02:15:28.920]   Oh, we do it.
[02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:33.400]   It's going to be great right after we get to moon.
[02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:38.880]   The story on that, Jason Callikenis told us some months ago is not necessarily the San
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:43.920]   Francisco to LA super train that they've talked about, that Elon's talked about, but
[02:15:43.920 --> 02:15:47.960]   really for cargo and undersea cargo.
[02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:53.480]   And imagine if you had a hyperloop from, let's say, Asia to the West Coast, and you could,
[02:15:53.480 --> 02:15:57.840]   instead of on container ships, but you could very rapidly move goods back and forth.
[02:15:57.840 --> 02:15:58.840]   That would be great.
[02:15:58.840 --> 02:15:59.840]   That's a long Hyperloop.
[02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:02.960]   Well, the nice thing about that is it's, there's no humans.
[02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:05.760]   So if there's an issue, no lives are lost.
[02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:09.440]   And you could have a submerged tube that would kind of float like a transatlantic cable
[02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:10.440]   kind of thing.
[02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:11.440]   Exactly.
[02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:12.440]   Yeah.
[02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:13.440]   Yeah.
[02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:14.440]   All right.

[02:16:42.280 --> 02:16:43.280]   Thank you so much.
[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:44.280]   Always great to see you.
[02:16:44.280 --> 02:16:45.280]   Yeah, I can see you too.
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:46.280]   Yeah.
[02:16:46.280 --> 02:16:47.280]   You come back more often.
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:48.600]   I know Sundays, it's hard to get people on Sunday.
[02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:49.600]   Yeah.
[02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:50.600]   There you go out.
[02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:51.600]   They do things.
[02:16:51.600 --> 02:16:52.600]   They're having a lot of fun.
[02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:56.240]   You know, I'm talking about trying to focus on people who don't have lives here or hunt
[02:16:56.240 --> 02:16:58.600]   and it's a lot easier to get them.
[02:16:58.600 --> 02:17:01.040]   Christina Warren film girl, she knows has a life.
[02:17:01.040 --> 02:17:02.040]   She has a new TV.
[02:17:02.040 --> 02:17:03.040]   You'll find her.
[02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:04.040]   TV.
[02:17:04.040 --> 02:17:05.040]   Yeah, baby.
[02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:06.040]   Mashable.com.
[02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:08.040]   It's great to see you as always.
[02:17:08.040 --> 02:17:09.840]   Always great to be here.
[02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:10.840]   Thanks for having me.
[02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:12.720]   It's also a regular on tech news today.
[02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:14.240]   See a lot of her there.
[02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:15.240]   Thank you for being here.
[02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:21.440]   We love having you come by on Saturday afternoon about 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern Sunday afternoon.
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:22.440]   What day is today?
[02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:28.160]   Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern, 2,200 UTC.
[02:17:28.160 --> 02:17:31.840]   If you can join us in the chatroom at IRC.tv, we encourage you to do so.
[02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:33.800]   What did I forget?
[02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:36.600]   I said hi to Tim.
[02:17:36.600 --> 02:17:37.600]   I said hi to Tim.
[02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:39.920]   Tim, did I ignore you?
[02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:40.920]   I'm saying hello.
[02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:43.920]   Why are you saying Tim?
[02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:46.240]   Did I call him Tom?
[02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:48.840]   Okay, I know there's Tom and Tim.
[02:17:48.840 --> 02:17:50.640]   There's also Tim, Tim.
[02:17:50.640 --> 02:17:51.640]   I think you're good.
[02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:54.000]   I think I'm a fine candy cookie from Australia.
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:55.560]   They're not related to Tim Bitts.
[02:17:55.560 --> 02:17:57.880]   If you're a Tim Bitts, a lovely doughnut hole.
[02:17:57.880 --> 02:17:58.880]   Tim Horton, yep.
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:02.800]   Yup, late, great Tim Horton, hockey star.
[02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:06.760]   We do the show as I said every Sunday afternoon.
[02:18:06.760 --> 02:18:09.840]   But if you can't watch live, do get the on-demand audio or video.
[02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:11.240]   You'll find that at twit.tv.
[02:18:11.240 --> 02:18:14.840]   All our shows are on the website or wherever you get your podcasts.
[02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:16.640]   If you want to join us in the studio, we love it.
[02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:17.920]   We have a great studio audience today.
[02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:19.080]   Nice to have you all.
[02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:21.160]   I love your shirt, sir.
[02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:22.160]   I love that shirt.
[02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:24.840]   I'm going to steal it from you.
[02:18:24.840 --> 02:18:30.000]   We also have a studio member who's wearing a Nintendo controller and the shirt says "classically
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:31.000]   trained."
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:32.000]   I think that's a…
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:33.000]   Yeah.
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:34.000]   Yeah.
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:35.000]   Are you ready?
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000]   I'm going to get a Nintendo NES that's coming out.
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:38.640]   Oh boy, that'll be fun.
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:39.640]   So good.
[02:18:39.640 --> 02:18:40.880]   Doesn't it take cartridges even?
[02:18:40.880 --> 02:18:42.640]   No, it's all 30 gals.
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:43.640]   It's all built in.
[02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:47.160]   It's just like the old Atari flashback, but it's so cool.
[02:18:47.160 --> 02:18:49.120]   Still, if you grew up with the Nintendo…
[02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:50.120]   I'm buying one.
[02:18:50.120 --> 02:18:51.120]   Absolutely.
[02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:53.080]   It's Pokemon's on there, I'm sure.
[02:18:53.080 --> 02:18:54.080]   I would hope.
[02:18:54.080 --> 02:18:55.680]   No, there was never a Pokemon NES.
[02:18:55.680 --> 02:18:57.320]   No, no, no, no, no.
[02:18:57.320 --> 02:18:58.320]   That was a test.
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:18:59.320]   You passed it.
[02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:00.320]   Very good.
[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:01.320]   I didn't know.
[02:19:01.320 --> 02:19:02.320]   I'm impressed.
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:07.120]   No, as a matter of fact, the Pokemon was never on the Subrennius.
[02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:08.720]   I think you're mistaken.
[02:19:08.720 --> 02:19:09.720]   Never.
[02:19:09.720 --> 02:19:10.720]   Never.
[02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:12.200]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:19:12.200 --> 02:19:13.880]   We'll see you next time.
[02:19:13.880 --> 02:19:15.520]   Another Twit is in the can.
[02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:16.520]   Bye-bye.
[02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:17.520]   Yeah.
[02:19:17.520 --> 02:19:18.520]   This is the game.
[02:19:18.520 --> 02:19:19.520]   Yeah.
[02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:20.520]   I'm on the Twit.
[02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:21.520]   Do on the Twit.
[02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:22.520]   All right.
[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:23.520]   Do on the Twit, baby.
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:24.520]   Do on the Twit.
[02:19:24.520 --> 02:19:25.520]   All right.
[02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:26.520]   Do on the Twit.
[02:19:26.520 --> 02:19:27.520]   All right.
[02:19:27.520 --> 02:19:28.520]   Do on the Twit.
[02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:29.520]   All right.
[02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:30.520]   Do on the Twit.
