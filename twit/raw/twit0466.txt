[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.120]   Thank you to Father Robert Ballisair for filling in for me on Twit.

[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.320]   Mike Elgin, Scott Wilkinson, filled in on my various shows.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.560]   As you know, I was in Hawaii.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.880]   So apparently it was John C. Devorak.
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.880]   You got quite a tangent.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.880]   I'll just get it.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.040]   Fred McVend Johnson is here.
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.440]   He is the host of this weekend Photography, a long time friend of the network.
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.720]   It's been ages since you've been on.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.480]   So I was really glad you were in town.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.840]   It's because you live so far away.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.320]   You, I notice, have a fit bit flex on.
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.320]   I do.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.320]   I'm looking for you.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.320]   Is this a pebble?
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.320]   What is the?
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.320]   No, this is a regular watch.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.320]   What?
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.320]   It's a dumb watch.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.320]   A wrist watch?
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.320]   You know, it does.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.320]   What?
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.320]   It does one thing and it does it well.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.320]   It tells the time.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.320]   Sometimes.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.320]   This weekend in photography.com.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.720]   This is a good photo doc.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.720]   This weekend photo doc.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.720]   Nice to have you.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.120]   Also here to your right, Jason Heiner from the tech republic and CBS Interactive.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.120]   Good to have you.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.120]   Great to be here.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.480]   As always, like a bad penny back again.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.840]   Is your email address CBSI.com?
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.840]   That is one of them.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.840]   Okay.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.280]   Cause I saw for somebody from CNET seemed all excited that he had a CBSI address.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.280]   We have multiple.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.520]   We have CBS, CBSI and CBS Interactive.com.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.600]   All of those go to the same place.
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.080]   Oh, well, it's cool to have multiple choices.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.080]   There you go.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.080]   Also with a Stan Patterson.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.080]   Hey there.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.520]   Freelance radio guru.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.280]   Last time we talked you were you were helping teach people in unnamed locations how to use
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.280]   encryption.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.800]   Yeah, I just got back from from Cairo and now I'm working on the data behind gun trafficking
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.680]   and Native American reservations.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.680]   Wow.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.680]   Data.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.880]   Gun tracking in Native.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.280]   Gun trafficking in Native American.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.280]   No, no.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.280]   Those are separate.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.280]   Okay.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.680]   So your enemy two different stories that I'm doing in the SEGA reports on.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.680]   We're the enemy.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.680]   Well, it's your enemy.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.960]   It's good to have your.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.120]   So that's interesting that you were in Cairo this recently.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.160]   Wasn't that a little risky to be there?
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.880]   I mean, we can downplay quite a bit, but there are a lot of AK-47s little Muslim Brotherhood.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:05.880]   Pop pop pop.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.880]   You know how it goes.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.880]   It's a little scary.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.880]   Dan's bad.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.880]   Dan's a bad man though.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.880]   He doesn't care.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.880]   Bad ass.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.880]   Is that not bad?
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.880]   I like hugs.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.880]   But you say that.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.120]   I mean that in a good way.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.120]   Bad.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.120]   He's so good.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.120]   He's so good.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.120]   He's Michael Jackson.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.120]   Michael Jackson.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.120]   He's in the Michael Jackson.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.120]   Who's bad?
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.120]   I do not.
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.120]   No, not.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.480]   No, see, yes, see, it's kind of all all the hell.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.480]   So I started talking about watches.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.480]   Dan is amazing.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.480]   Dan is amazing.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.480]   No, we love Dan.
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.480]   He's the man.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.240]   Dan is reinventing journalism.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.440]   We all talk about it all day.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.080]   We all pretend we care, but Dan's actually living it.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.840]   He's got his feet on the ground and his head in the clouds and his head into his head.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.680]   His little sharpie to the notebook and he's writing it all down.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.680]   The journalist.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.680]   Exactly.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.960]   The journalist, Dan Patterson is here.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.520]   Good to have us.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.680]   It you as in.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.680]   Stop this.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.760]   Can I talk about my watch?
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.440]   Do you like first of all the fact that I chose a white band?
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.920]   What is that fashion forward?
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.160]   That's Android where I look at like sprockets.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.160]   I should be.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.000]   This is now is it time when we dance.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.720]   This is Android where this is the LG.
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.800]   There's two different ones available now in the play store.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.080]   There's the LG and there's the Samsung, but they're identical almost except for slight
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.800]   design differences.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.320]   This is the watch that Google announced at Google I/O and finally arrived this week.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.200]   I didn't have a chance to take it.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.360]   So you're not going to be able to see it because it's so tiny, but there's a CBS breaking
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.640]   news bulletin.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:40.160]   Germany scores an extra time to defeat Argentina and World the World Cup in Britain.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.160]   Or something.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.280]   And then I can swipe it over and I can now open it on the phone or not.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.600]   I could go down and look the New York Times has the same story.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.640]   So I get notifications from every major news source on my watch.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.640]   Same damn story.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.360]   It's only five minutes to home.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.160]   You better believe I'm thinking about that.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.920]   Light traffic on Petaluma Boulevard North.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.920]   That's kind of cool.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.640]   There's a there's a direct message from Twitter and that concludes the.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.320]   Is there any sensors in it?
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.600]   Like is it going to replace it?
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.080]   It has a it has a pedometer.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.520]   The Samsung has a heart rate monitor.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.080]   I didn't get that one because I found those not to be so useful when you're exercising.
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.080]   And I don't really care about my heart rate.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.080]   See that.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.080]   It's not as big as I thought it would be.
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.080]   It's not bad is it?
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.080]   It's not too.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.200]   And my first my first reaction was oh this is just another one.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   I've had them all.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.200]   I've had the Fitbit Flex.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.840]   I've done Nike Fuel Band the basis watch.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.840]   It's not bad.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.640]   I've had the gear the gear fit the gear to.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.920]   This is the best of the bunch.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.400]   And I still feel like it's a category just begging for somebody to come up and and and.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.160]   The round watch is the most interesting.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.160]   The Moto 3 6 2.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.160]   Moto.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.160]   Yeah.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.160]   I'll probably replace this with that.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.720]   But I just like that Frederick caught his his old watch the dumb watch.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.720]   It's a dumb watch.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.720]   Like it's a feature.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.720]   It's a challenge feature.
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.720]   It's a feature watch.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.720]   It's a feature watch.
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.720]   It's a feature watch.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.720]   It's a feature watch.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.760]   It only does one thing but it does it well.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.760]   You know.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.960]   It's a little highfalutin like Mr. Leo with his crazy.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.520]   This is kind of it's kind of cool.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.320]   You can I can hear.
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.560]   You can see either say OK Google to it or tap the watch.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.120]   Send a text to Lisa Kenzel.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.680]   Hey babe.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.080]   Doing the show.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.520]   Talking to you from my watch.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.880]   Did he get it?
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.880]   He got it.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.880]   One thing it does is it sends that without asking you or.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.880]   Yo.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:31.880]   So it just sends it.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.560]   Oh so it is accidentally sent a text.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.480]   So it'd be pretty easy to accidentally send it.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.440]   Accidentally send a text and have it send your entire conversation transcribed.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.440]   The microphone is on the watch.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:46.680]   It does of course have to be tied to an Android phone 4.3 or later.
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.680]   229 for this one.
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.640]   The Samsung's 200 bucks battery life all day.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.960]   They have a always on watch face which gives you all day.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.440]   I haven't tried the turn off when you're not looking at it version but I presume that
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.280]   would give you more of a one full day of charge.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.280]   Yeah I don't mind sure.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.280]   I have to charge my phone anyway.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.280]   The watch dock and as a little box.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.280]   This is another thing.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.000]   I'm like I don't mind I got a table full of things.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.200]   Well yeah who are you?
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.120]   I got a binder full of things.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.120]   I don't know.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.120]   That's okay.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.120]   That's okay.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.120]   Too much stuff.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.160]   It's in charge by like kinetic electricity.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.520]   When you walk it you just charge itself.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.520]   Well see that's the question.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.440]   So this is not the most perfect thing in the world.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.880]   We're getting somewhere but I don't know if the first of all as Ben Thompson on Stratecary
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.080]   pointed out this is a luxury purchase.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.680]   You don't like a phone a smartphone everybody has to do.
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.680]   Oh yeah.
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.680]   Right.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.200]   We're still in this anticipatory period right everybody is just waiting for what Apple
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.400]   is going to do and after that we'll redefine the form factor and the features and the market
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.920]   will open up.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:50.520]   And until then everything is going to be like flirtation but not ceiling the deal.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.520]   Yep.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.520]   But does Apple still have that mojo?
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.600]   I mean they did it with the iPhone they did it with the iPod they did it with the iPad
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.440]   they took even existing markets and reinvented them.
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.640]   Even if they don't have the mojo everybody is still waiting to see what Apple does in
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.400]   this market even if it's a total flop.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.500]   Everybody is waiting to see if this validates the marketplace or not and that's really the
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.800]   validation is the thing that we're waiting for.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.800]   The fall is there is to drop right now.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.360]   If Apple announces it this fall which seems likely although some say maybe not till next
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.520]   year.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.640]   First okay I already see the news stories first news story if they don't announce it
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.640]   this year.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:31.040]   Apple doesn't announce watch the Steve Jobs eras over Apple's dead.
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.520]   They'd be something completely different like I said you know what we know you expected
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:39.280]   us to release a watch so we're doing headband instead.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.560]   I think the Apple watch I think they are going to release one I mean we've been hearing
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.680]   about it for a long time I think they've I think they've had versions of this ready over
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:54.400]   the past couple years and it just wasn't there and they were the only ones that were I would
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.760]   say you know maybe disciplined enough to not release something just crap because everything
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.440]   that's out there is just nobody would want to use it we use them because we have to because
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.200]   you know it's our job to tell people about it but none of us I don't think would would
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:13.040]   necessarily want one you know in our regular everyday life or have integrated into our
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:18.280]   everyday life yet but I think Apple's going to go simpler and I think it's going to be
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:24.440]   focused on more focused on health than anything else and it's going to have less features than
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:29.400]   everybody else's it's going to be focused actually two on three things design health
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:34.720]   and simplicity and probably it's going to you know have a it's going to have less power
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:39.280]   in it so that it can you know the battery can last longer it's going to focus on health
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.120]   clearly and it's going to focus on design something you would actually want to wear
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.760]   want to be seen wearing and not sort of the kind of hideous looking things that we've
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.760]   seen so far.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.560]   I think Apple Apple saying to themselves we could have done that but we're not going
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.560]   to.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.560]   Absolutely.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.560]   They could have done that last year.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.400]   I mean they had prototypes you know floating around.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.400]   And nano is that.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.400]   Really it all started with an ano with an ano in the watch you stick it on there and
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.720]   like hey this could actually be a watch you know that's where an even still kind of
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.560]   look like it looks like a nano.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.800]   The true advantage that Apple will bring here is that these are just translating that
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.440]   metaphor of the phone on to something that is smaller and that you put on your wrist
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:21.960]   and what Apple is going to do is bring this fresh approach and say this is not the same
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.600]   thing as your phone this is something that is complimentary to your phone.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.160]   Yeah.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.920]   If Apple releases some okay here's a couple of thoughts Apple may not be able to do something
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.420]   better than this.
[00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:34.840]   So maybe they won't release a watch.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.840]   Why would they not?
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:36.840]   Why would you?
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.840]   Why not?
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.480]   If they can't if they can't release something that's better I think they won't release
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.480]   it if it's not ready I think they've shown that already.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:48.600]   Like I said there is photo photo the photo types prototypes floating around for a couple
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.800]   of years if you will I you know I mean from the rumors I've heard people said they look
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.880]   pretty slick but they had problems with battery life they had you know they weren't sure exactly
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:03.400]   what to do with the thing you know what functions to focus on or whatever and they didn't release
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.040]   it because they felt like it just wasn't it wasn't there yet.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.680]   Is it wrong of me to think of this is almost a litmus test to the post Steve Jobs era that
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:15.720]   if if jobs were here Apple would release something that would set us all back and go
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.320]   wow I didn't know I needed that yeah yeah but I want it.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.560]   Can they do that again without Mr. Jobs?
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.040]   I think it's fair I think it's fair to call it a litmus test you know to see what they
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:31.760]   come out with if they release it and how good it is and how much it you know makes people
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:36.840]   whether it's a hit or not right the jobs era was based on hit products and they had hit
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:41.480]   after hit after hit and that's why they are where they are today.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.080]   They have released flops we have to acknowledge.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:49.080]   They're having ugly the the iBook that looked like a toy that Dvor called a toilet seat
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:54.520]   that was ugly the cube which I thought was great and bought a flop they have not Apple
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:13:00.480]   has not always been a hundred percent yeah certainly on software but they can't they
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.360]   can't afford mistakes now that's the difference right that the prior yet jobs could make mistakes
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:10.840]   because he was Steve and and now boy a flop now would be pretty bad.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.840]   Good point it would.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.760]   I agree it would be tough whatever they do with the iWatch I think it's fair to call
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:18.640]   it a litmus test to see you know do they still have the discipline do they have still have
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.200]   the design mojo do they still have the ability to create hit products because while they
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.840]   had misses they had they had more hits than anybody and you know that's what sort of put
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:33.280]   them over the top and made them the most valuable company in tech but and they could look they
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:39.520]   are going to be able to survive for a decade on the the things that they did last decade
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:46.440]   but will they do it and and and be creative and innovative that's the big question I mean
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.640]   or will they turn into just a company that you know has nice looking hardware and you
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:56.480]   know keeps putting out iterative iterative approaches to that what's already out there
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.480]   I don't know.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:02.440]   Fans of Marcus Brownlee heard those two notes and immediately knew I was playing MKBHD and
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.520]   there's a good reason to be playing this video.
[00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:10.600]   Marcus got a massive scoop he got what he says and he may be right because it'd be pretty
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:15.000]   hard to fake is the sapphire crystal from the next generation iPhone.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.480]   It sure looks like it and I don't know how you would I don't know how you would make
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.560]   a fake of this.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:26.480]   It's not you're not the only one who has it there's some Hong Kong videos showed at first
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:32.220]   a guy named what was his name Chet Scottie I can't remember his last name gave it to
[00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:36.440]   Marcus but the Scottie had it before Marcus did I have to say if you're going to make
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:40.840]   something that's a fake that's going to be pretty hard to do a lot of work and Sonny
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:46.340]   Dixon Sonny Dixon that's the name so this is Sonny Dixon sample you know I don't credit
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:49.480]   a lot of rumors that come from within Apple because Apple's so good at keeping a lid on
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:53.520]   those but when it comes to this when it comes to the supply chain it's hard it's hard to
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:57.160]   those Chinese companies they're small they could you know whoever made this it may not
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.500]   even be Foxconn it might be a supplier to Foxconn I'm not surprising they might leak out but
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:06.560]   here's the interesting thing he really ripped on this thing first of all we are not sure
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.200]   still if it's Sapphire it's claimed to be Sapphire we know Apple bought a big Sapphire
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.920]   manufacturer and is trying to make a larger sapphire has been around for a long time in
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:21.840]   fact the iPhone 5 S uses a Sapphire crystal on the camera lens and on the thumb fingerprint
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:29.560]   reader watches have it watches a lot of dumb watches have it dumb watch no feature watches
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:35.520]   please feature like limited use to watch this come on but yeah if you have a high end wrist
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:39.980]   watch Sapphire crystal is premium product right but watch he's going to try to scratch
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:46.260]   this thing with a knife with his keys he tries to bend and break it and this thing is if
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:50.860]   this really is what it purports to be that alone might be a good selling point for the
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:57.820]   new previous one thing that if this is the iPhone crystal this is a 4.7 inch screen so
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:02.600]   it would confirm that rumor that Apple will do a larger yeah it's kind of like your HTC
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.920]   right they've got to I don't think there's any doubt about that they've got to and as
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:12.260]   Marcus pointed out the thinking by some was that the larger 5.5 inch iPhone would have
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:17.320]   the Sapphire crystal and the less expensive 4.7 would not but clearly this is the case
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:24.800]   he he he he tries to break it by bending it can't in fact it took it finally somebody
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:32.780]   did break it a Hong Kong video from Hong Kong guy drove a 1.6 ton truck over it and finally
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:37.100]   smashed it I would take it back I should point out that there's still going to be a phone
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:43.340]   behind this piece of so far and some delicate electronics still has some fragility yeah but
[00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:47.420]   it's the number one failure in iPhones is those broken screens and so if they can fix
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:51.680]   that oh my gosh it would be huge it would be huge for Apple ecosystem I mean it's the
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.460]   number one thing that people do is when they have a drop you know people drop their phones
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:59.620]   all the time those iPhones and the way the iPhone screen is if you don't have a case
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:04.180]   on it they just break I mean I I can think of three I've seen just in the last couple
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.340]   weeks of people that I know that have dropped and broken their iPhones haven't gotten them
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:11.300]   fixed yet you know and there's not a day you get on the subway I mean that's a nice
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:15.940]   sample right you can see literally thousands of people in a very short period of time and
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:19.980]   and I see tons of of Android sure but there is not a day that goes by that I don't see
[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:25.360]   is crack screen or three every day no my kids every every single one of them here's the
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:33.520]   video from China apparently the same part they're doing the same things to it but eventually
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:41.960]   they drive there it is with no rims it is gone it is gone wow you can stab it you can
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:46.960]   cut it it's inferior it's inferior I don't want to clear explosion I don't want I can't
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:53.020]   drive like that's a great video let's see oh no it's just one point six tons broken
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:59.120]   oh my gosh yeah this is a back gonna be glass to like the five S or is it just the front
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.920]   you know a couple of questions here in metal right we've been hearing metal the back's
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:07.320]   gonna have to go back to metal probably metal of course antenna issues that's why the 4s
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:12.360]   was a ten again right you'll go back to pass those little gaps right yeah right that
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:20.900]   the exactly well again it's all rumors congratulations to Marcus Brownlee yeah we'll never again
[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:25.720]   be invited to an Apple event Marcus just wanted to warn you but he got 4.6 million
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:33.360]   views in five days so he doesn't need to be invited it's worth it it's worth it for
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:42.960]   absolutely that's nice and credit to a Marcus and Sonny what was it Sonny Dixon correct
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:52.480]   who I guess is a fairly reliable leaker that's not my title chief leaker here given
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:56.480]   a few more years we are speaking of which I think I'll take a bathroom breaker I'm the
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:03.360]   freelance leaker yeah leak on demand in related news China has taken the advantage
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:10.000]   of the NSA revelations to say we don't trust the iPhone we know that Apple has tracking
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.900]   software in it we believe the iPhone tracks you this was not an official government release
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:21.460]   although I think you probably preserve yeah that anything that comes out of Chinese state
[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:27.980]   TV is a government release iPhone like number five like the lowest adopted phone in China
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:32.180]   but it's only recently for sale in China officially okay so it's still I think it's
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:37.020]   been very headed off of the past there's yeah they don't count the gray market or black
[00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:42.260]   market sale so I think there's quite a few iPhones and Chinese state TV said the iPhone
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:48.460]   is a national security concern just as I should point out the US Congress said the phones
[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:54.140]   from ZTE and Huawei Chinese owned companies were nationally security concerns last year
[00:19:54.140 --> 00:20:01.540]   in the US Apple says hey privacy this is gonna go a long way with the Chinese government
[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:07.140]   privacy is built into our products and services from the earliest stages of design we were
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:11.940]   I should do it in Johnny I voice you have we were tirelessly to deliver the most secure
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:17.460]   hardware and software in the world and they don't you should do it in as the voice from
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:21.940]   on Bill Murray and Scrooge you know where he says we at the IBC are shocked in a poll
[00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:29.700]   shocked I tell you and we don't work with government agencies to spy on customers you
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:34.700]   don't have to really work with the government agency right used by a government is right
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:40.500]   exactly I have a source who who is just a friendly source and I think he would prefer
[00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:45.460]   deep background or off the record but he he is a really reliable guy and he will swear
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:50.900]   up one side and down the other that he works at Apple has for 15 years that that look when
[00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:56.940]   it's out of our data centers is gone we don't care about your data we are we are we are not
[00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:02.660]   Google and you know we can take that you know it's a worth a pinch of soul but it it's
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:08.220]   he really is a true believer that look that yes we could be undermined by the NSA and
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:13.020]   foreign countries and other people but but we do not want to sell your data or give it
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:18.100]   to anybody and he really truly believes that it's encrypted and then gone well their business
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:23.980]   model is different than Facebook and Google they don't they make money on hardware and
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.180]   I guess a few iTunes sales and Google and Facebook make money selling ads so of course
[00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:32.540]   their business is different but also remember that you know Apple does boast about they
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:38.620]   have more you know accounts yeah credit accounts than anybody in the world except for Amazon
[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:43.620]   so you know to an extent I believe what Dan saying at least in terms of and you know
[00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:49.740]   or what the Dan source is saying but you know they're also they are in the information
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:55.020]   business and they are they do want to eventually use that information to make a lot of money
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.740]   and I think that you know to think that they won't make some kind of e-commerce play which
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:03.740]   will make them yeah you know down the road make them a player in this I think is you know
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:07.260]   we should we should we should expect that yeah I don't think they're doing I mean you
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:11.660]   can I agree with the fact that you know or the statement that Apple's not doing anything
[00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:16.620]   nefarious with data of course right it'd be stupid but I think a lot of people are concerned
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:22.420]   with the fact that not that they are doing something but they could right yeah it comes
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:27.300]   down and what do you define as a various I mean people's I think Google could probably
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:34.060]   say well we don't do anything nefarious with data yeah we we we use keywords in your emails
[00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:38.940]   and search results to target to make sure the ads are something you're more interested
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:43.460]   in is that nefarious right I don't think any of these companies are saying oh and you
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:49.380]   see this there's a nude picture Leo look at that yeah now the NSA on the other hand well
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:53.380]   we're going to talk about that just to say yeah let's take a break we are we got a great
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:58.940]   panel here Dan Patterson freelance journalist a guy reinventing the word journalism as we
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:04.620]   speak Dan Patterson calm at Dan Patterson on Twitter Jason Heiner from CBS interactive
[00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:12.500]   and the tech Republic zeding that they're all one now all one big ball it's all the same
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.460]   used to be used to be a fact I think it was in my zd TV contracts you can never go to
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:23.220]   work for Cnet they're the competition that the end of it yeah in force it yeah the evil

[00:26:52.260 --> 00:27:00.580]   dot com so I guess this happened since our last show but I think it's a huge story again
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:08.900]   more revelations from the NSA and now this one's a little bit more controversial the
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:17.100]   Washington Post published a story one week ago saying that in and what happened is that
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:24.620]   Snowden among all the stuff that Snowden gave the press he gave a big database of intercepted
[00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:33.300]   data from the NSA 160,000 records in there and what the Washington Post had hired a data
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:37.780]   expert because it was it was not structured in any way it was just a dump hired a data
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:46.820]   expert to parse it and they found that most of these conversations were not foreign nationals
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:59.860]   but US citizens and in there were email addresses pictures personal stuff so 10,000 account owners
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:07.020]   holders they they cataloged and let's say many other files described as useless by the
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:12.220]   analysts but nonetheless retained have starvingly this is the Washington Post intimate and
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:17.820]   even voyeuristic quality they tell stories of love and heartbreak illicit sexual liaisons
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:23.500]   mental health crises this is all in the data political and religious conversions financial
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:27.820]   anxieties disappointed host the daily lives of more than 10,000 account holders who were
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:33.780]   not targeted not targeted by the NSA but never nevertheless recorded and more than that
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:41.340]   cataloged by the NSA 160,000 intercepted email instant message conversations some of them
[00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:46.860]   hundreds of pages long 79 hundred documents 11,000 online accounts all from president
[00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:56.580]   Obama's first term 2009 to 2012 this clearly proves the NSA is collecting and in some cases
[00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:03.140]   analyzing personal information from US citizens no question about it right no question that
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:08.420]   will fall under nefarious that is nefarious now there was a little bit of heat on this
[00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:13.460]   and maybe Dan Patterson you can explain because some people said no it wasn't it wasn't the
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:18.300]   NSA that violated these people's privacy was the Washington Post and Edward Snowden
[00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:27.100]   that's interesting this is a well follow-up post the debrief published by the Washington
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:32.340]   Post and the reporter Barton Gellman who broke the story he said some readers and commentators
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:37.100]   have described the story as an overheated statement of the obvious that surveillance
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:42.940]   of one person includes the content of people who talk to him others have said the Washington
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:47.940]   Post not the government invaded the privacy of innocence because we published their conversations
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:53.300]   the NSA did not in the view of some critics we displayed ignorance of NSA systems or
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:58.940]   knowingly chose to distort the way they work now he acknowledges it's a very complicated
[00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:04.780]   story he said we drafted the story carefully we stand by all of it he explains in the article
[00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:11.580]   how they parsed the data he said most of the accounts we found in the pile and he was just
[00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:19.060]   a dump of a pile of data we're not NSA targets some commentators think that's unremarkable
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:23.660]   I'll come back to that nine out of ten account holders found in a large cache of intercepted
[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:27.900]   conversations were not the intended surveillance targets but were caught in the net the agency
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:32.820]   had cast for someone else he says actually I underplayed that amount that number was
[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:38.660]   the only one we could measure with any precision but we think it was actually a lot more
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:43.220]   I'm determined that individuals weren't targeted like I were well he says we didn't have an
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:47.340]   official NSA list of targets we had to find them in the pile ourselves so they hired an
[00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:53.220]   independent researcher who you tried to figure out kind of structure all this it was the
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:31:00.300]   target and who was the collateral damage and he said sometimes probably go ahead on sorry
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:04.220]   go ahead he says some of our questions could not be answered with the data we had for that
[00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:09.660]   reason our story did not say what some commentators have imputed to it we did not say there are
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.980]   more Americans and foreign targets in the pile we suspect that's true but we couldn't
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:18.900]   establish it reliably but they did say nearly half of the files contain names email addresses
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:27.340]   and other details that the NSA marked as belonging to US citizens or residents so what do you
[00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:33.300]   guys I think I mean I think the general takeaway that I saw in all the press was the NSA is
[00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:38.260]   spying on US citizens that may be collateral damage but they are collecting that information
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:43.620]   analysts are looking at that information and this is going far beyond what they are legally
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:49.780]   entitled to do others say as I as I said well that's just what happens when you collect
[00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:56.500]   data yeah and I would say yeah this is this just verifies the data that we already have
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:02.300]   right we already know that Americans are being spied upon and it's a I think it comes down
[00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:06.300]   to if you are if you're that person that's fighting against privacy invasion and you let
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:10.900]   you know what I think that this should not be happening and you can't use technology right
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:16.340]   now because by using any kind of technology I think you're opening yourself up to this
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:22.060]   kind of stuff right that that is true although it's I mean it's an untenable suggestion for
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:27.860]   most people in this era and and particularly look I was at the UN for five years and I'm
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:32.780]   looking at my bucket of press releases I've over 150,000 press releases that come from
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:39.460]   all countries including Iran Syria Libya the most terrifying places in the world they I'm
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:44.780]   on their email list it is it makes a big difference when you think of this as an abstract and then
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:51.900]   when you think of this as you and and you can set a set of criteria and say look and also
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:55.860]   we should put alleged in front of all of this but you can say these are this is the criterion
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:33:02.700]   by which the NSA made a list of the people to gather information from and then you can
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:07.700]   put spokes out from those the people who fit that criterion and you can say whether it's
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:11.500]   okay to gather data or not gather data or whether this is what happens when you gather
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:17.940]   data or don't gather data you can easily connect those dots and see who and what types of people
[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:23.180]   have been spied on and the degree to which they've been spied on yeah you know but on
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:27.740]   the one hand the top of the show we were talking about Leo's watch and more and more
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:31.260]   technology that we're embracing and getting excited about and all these things and then
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:36.900]   on the other hand we're concerned about the privacy but yet we want more and more technology
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:40.580]   to make our lives easier you know so where do you draw the line do you just say hey I'm
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:46.060]   just you know I'm cutting the cord I'm not going to do anything from there on I what
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:50.740]   I know are people and particularly journalists and colleagues of mine are doing a few things
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:54.740]   and there's nothing that you can do that really prevents all of this but there are some small
[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:59.380]   measures you can take first isn't crypt everything the second is although it's not really going
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:04.900]   to make you safer you can move to my co-lab or to proton mail or something that is stored
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:10.020]   at least outside of the auspices of the United of the US now I don't really believe
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:14.580]   that this is going to keep you safer but it is a protest move and it's one that says look
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:18.660]   I'm willing to take my own privacy seriously the other thing that you can do is which is
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:24.580]   what I'm doing right now is taking everything of importance out of Google and using the
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:29.220]   Google account to access things because you have to but not allowing an indexing of your
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:34.020]   personal data I mean no you can't escape everything but you can take measures they may be half
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:39.820]   measures but you can send a pretty loud signal yeah Bruce snire we've had on the show Love
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:47.500]   Bruce he's the security guru go to guy on this he says and he said this in a talk earlier
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:53.660]   this week at the New America Foundation a panel discussion called national insecurity
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:58.300]   agency how the NSA surveillance programs undermine internet security snire said the
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:04.060]   issue is not that the NSA is spying on whoever the bad guy is that they want to spy on the
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:08.660]   issue is they're deliberately weakening the security of everyone else in the world in
[00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:14.420]   order to make that spying easier right yeah putting back door access in undermining encryption
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:21.540]   protocols hacking into Yahoo and Google's private interconnects they're undermining security
[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:27.580]   in general and I think when China says don't trust the iPhone what their real message is
[00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:33.740]   the USA is spying on us and any USA any company that that is in the USA whether intentionally
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:41.300]   or not is acting as an arm of that agency yeah and in our most mission second day don't
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:46.580]   know sorry go ahead yeah oh no I'm sorry the lag I keep cutting you guys off but but it
[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:51.740]   gives this this tacit permission well if the NSA can do it we can do it and that actually
[00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:56.100]   figures into security and threat models far more than just the NSA I'm far more concerned
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:36:02.380]   about China and and Egypt than I am about the the NSA but because the NSA is capable
[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:06.740]   of this and because they've been doing it it gives these other countries permission to
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:12.180]   do it and say well you know it's a chance yeah that's right exactly exactly and Dan
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:17.820]   I would I would I wonder if you you mentioned the the alternative email clients etc that
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:23.460]   you can use to you know sort of be more secure online and I wonder I go back to the you know
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:29.300]   that pile of data that they were using and and what key were they're using to flag people
[00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:32.980]   that they're gonna look deeper I do they look deeper at people that are obviously trying
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:37.300]   to hide stuff or can you hide in plain sight by just they have said the NSA said if you
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:42.860]   use encryption if you use tour tour your screen you we are going to have yourself we can't
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:48.980]   tell this is their excuse we can't tell if you're a foreign national or a terrorist so
[00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:52.380]   we're just going to collect everything mm-hmm so that's the other side of this equation
[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:58.820]   I use a PGP encryption on all my email it's a flag right it's saying hey I might be up
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:02.300]   to something so they collect everything you do you've got something to hide so we need
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.980]   to look target which means you're out of people you see a crowd of people and everyone
[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:10.980]   looks kind of the same you see one person doing this that's gonna look at everybody
[00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:16.700]   that's more more of us to do this the other the other point the Washington Post makes is
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:21.740]   this is already data that's been minimized according to the rules the rules are that if
[00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:26.420]   it doesn't have anything to do with an investigation you should minimize it you should you should
[00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:32.580]   redact it you should remove personal information they say the data we got was already minimized
[00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:39.100]   so trust me it's worse than that they're saying nine out of ten people in this database where
[00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:45.460]   u.s. citizens not connected with foreign nationals in its and that's the minimized version
[00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:50.460]   mm-hmm take my word for it right I'm sure that we're all familiar with the panopticon
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:55.340]   and that's exactly what we are experiencing here well why bother why bother encrypting
[00:37:55.340 --> 00:38:00.100]   why bother using tour why bother using proton mail because that's just a flag so maybe
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:05.420]   I just shouldn't say anything I should just shut up I frankly I frankly think that one
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:10.060]   of the conspiracy theories that is somewhat credible is that this whole thing is intentionally
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:15.360]   planted by the NSA to make everybody feel like that the whole point of the panopt after
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:20.700]   con which was a prison that was designed to make prisoners feel like there was no way
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:26.540]   they could do anything without being surveilled the design of the panopticon was that the prisoners
[00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:30.740]   couldn't see the watchers but the watchers could see the prisoners so the prisoners never
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:35.780]   knew if they were being watched the presumption would be then I'm always being watched so I'm
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:41.140]   gonna behave I think that's in you could make the case this is exactly what the NSA would
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:46.380]   like yeah this it this impression that we are all being watched and so watch yourself
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:52.020]   it's like fake traffic yeah that psychological bit is far more powerful than any you know
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:56.740]   kind of it's working they could do right it's working I mean I've talked about I feel
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:00.620]   like I've talked about this so many times you know this story specifically nothing about
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:04.300]   it surprised me you know at this point we've heard it all haven't we yeah I think it was
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:09.860]   important nothing about it surprised me but I still believe and you know that I think
[00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:15.260]   we do need sort of a new kind of Bill of Rights digital era sort of Bill of Rights to at least
[00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:20.020]   come to some discussions some really hard discussions about what are the rights that
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:24.380]   we should expect you know people should expect on the internet in terms of especially privacy
[00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:29.660]   and data and those type of things we're gonna it's gonna take it's gonna be just like any
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:34.020]   time you've created something like this is gonna be a lot of arguing there's gonna be
[00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:38.820]   a lot of you know give and take but I feel like we haven't had those discussions and so
[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:45.780]   we're slowly just sliding down the sort of accepted practices and and I think just think
[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:50.900]   it's it's a bad road to go down and you know at some point there needs to be sort of a
[00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:57.380]   grassroots movement to sort of take back the sort of rights or at least set expectations
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:02.460]   and it needs to be I think it's gonna have to be bottom up and it's gonna have to force
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:06.660]   you know people in power to think about it I don't like internet legislation I don't
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:15.540]   I'm not necessarily suggesting a body to to to you know oversee this or you know be in
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:21.860]   charge of the internet but I do think we can come to some reasonable expectations about
[00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:26.020]   you know what what kind of privacy we should expect and what kind of sort of rights people
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:31.020]   have and those kinds of things seems like a big obelisk like a big in a say seems like
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:35.820]   a big box that it's impenetrable right there's all this data in there you don't know what
[00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:40.700]   they're collecting what they're doing and you know by the way the key to the panopticon
[00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:44.060]   but you don't know what the watch you have no idea really but may not be collecting
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:48.340]   anything but you look at this and I say I think like okay yeah be great to have some
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:53.580]   sort of legislation and oversight over what they're doing but how I mean how do you how
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:57.660]   do you even affect that if you have no idea what they're what they're capturing and what
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:01.260]   they're doing with that data and they will never tell you exactly what they're doing
[00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:06.620]   how do you even hope to do other hand I would say that the NSA and the people who are doing
[00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:11.580]   this are patriots that they're doing it because they want to protect us from another terrorist
[00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:17.660]   attack like 9/11 yep that they are doing everything that they know how to do to protect
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:24.300]   us but I think there's another question is this effective I think terrorists you know
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:27.740]   reminds me of copy protection you know the only people who are impeded by copy protection
[00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:33.020]   or honest people that guys know exactly how to get around right yep I would imagine that
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:39.260]   the means exist and that terrorists know how to use them Osama bin Laden was not using the
[00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:46.460]   internet he was hidden away he had a courier bringing USB keys it was really excellent working
[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:50.460]   great luck that we were able to figure out where he was I would imagine that at this point if
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:56.060]   you're a terrorist you're not using the internet you're not sending him hey Abdullah let's attack
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:42:02.540]   the Pentagon you're not going to send that over Gmail right so who is who is this protecting us from
[00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:10.140]   aren't we really the victims without without any real benefit is my question I mean you know
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:10.140]   that no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:18.460]   that in fact I think you can make the case the terrorists won that this is exactly what 9/11
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:23.660]   was all about because we have terror we're terrified we're terrified yeah we're terrorized
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:29.580]   all right let's take a break there was a World Cup game today Germany won congratulations
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:36.380]   but we all lost because if you're Twitter on Twitter well I'll talk about what happened
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:42.060]   but first of all we're from our friends at Citrix who do that great go to meeting Citrix go to

[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:30.300]   okay so it's over the world cups over but if you couldn't watch the world cup during most
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:35.820]   the games you could follow a twitter account which was a really cool account called replay last goal
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:39.820]   i don't know how many people knew about this but what would happen is as soon as there was a goal
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:45.580]   in any of the world cup games it would automatically generate and display a a gif and a video clip of
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:52.300]   the goal so if you missed it you could go and watch it fifa the international organization that runs
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:56.700]   the world cup and assigns tv rights to the game didn't like that it's going to take down notice
[00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:03.420]   to twitter at the end of last month took a little while but twitter pulled down replay last goal
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:10.940]   uh i don't know if it's fair use probably fifa had a right to say that's copyrighted material
[00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:17.260]   but boy that just shows you kind of the ignorance of and why are we surprised about fifa's ignorance
[00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:22.460]   what a great promotional vehicle i would kill to have somebody create a twitter account you know
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:26.700]   replay last gaff they couldn't get an ad in there that's why
[00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:33.820]   i think twitter probably didn't want to pull it down but didn't have a choice yeah i think fifa
[00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:40.460]   should have been a little bit cooler about this tv rights are worth more than four billion dollars
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:45.740]   but i don't think this damages the tv rights well if they've slipped fifa a couple bucks then maybe
[00:45:45.740 --> 00:45:50.860]   two could have their twitter again oh yes it always could be an envelope was a check in and
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:59.740]   did uh that's kind of allegedly allegedly allegedly have you been uh there's another uh a really great
[00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:05.820]   twitter account i don't think this will get pulled down at congress edits i started following them
[00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:14.700]   this is an automatic uh tweet a bot that whenever a member whenever somebody from the
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:20.060]   u.s congress ip addresses anonymously modifies a wikipedia entry it tweets it
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:26.140]   and in fact now there's so many of them because it's on github that they've got it for all sorts
[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:32.220]   of governmental agencies if you go to at congress edits i love that you can see that there's one for
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:40.540]   big pharma there's one for the german parliament the bun de stagh the right stagh i guess it's
[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:48.460]   called edits the uh scientific institutions in berlin so this is a big problem you know is that
[00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:53.820]   these members of congress go in there and fix up their wikipedia entry before the election
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:57.580]   take out the bad stuff put in the good stuff not anymore
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:02.380]   they should have a similar bot looking at big tech companies terms of service
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:08.620]   there you go whenever whenever facebook changes something yeah to weed out let us all know now
[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:11.580]   some of the so here's somebody from the u.s has representatives
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:17.100]   edited a the wikipedia article for maricious i don't think we really care about no
[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:22.460]   what do they think they did some staffers said you know it's actually 16 billion dollars with
[00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:28.220]   the coconuts a year let's get that right or the lower yank c mandarin wikipedia article
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:33.740]   but then when on the other hand when a member of congress edits you can see the differences in
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:40.940]   the revisions you can see this is the anonymous from the thing from the love it
[00:47:40.940 --> 00:47:47.420]   so uh that's uh kristin uh cenima she's a representative from arizona's ninth congressional district
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:53.660]   i guess you wanted to fix up that little little bit in here on the uh you know and now she's on
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:48:01.100]   twit yeah so be careful go for that that's a good use of twitter and i hope that doesn't get
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:05.340]   shut down by fifa that's a violation in some way of fifa's copyright i'm sure
[00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:08.940]   twitter has analytics have you been looking at your twitter analytics do you have
[00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:13.100]   anybody have a verified twitter account i have not been looking at my analytics
[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:19.980]   i haven't either honestly you have to have an a verified twitter account think i'm unverified
[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:23.740]   yeah now you have to be who you are if you're not who you are it's not going to work
[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:30.140]   and but it tells you some interesting stuff now our friend um uh jina trapani of course has
[00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:35.580]   think up i'm signed in actually this is a bad account to use but i'm signed in uh to a
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:38.860]   links for twit account that i use for links but it shows you how many impressions
[00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:45.900]   uh i got in the last month the increase over previous impressions graphs i have to log out
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:49.900]   and log into my because this is just a dummy not a dummy account but an account i use for
[00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:57.740]   news links i didn't realize this one was also uh verified it's cool so good way to see if your
[00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:01.740]   tweets are actually reaching your twitter followers well that's one of the things it's kind of cool
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:07.980]   you can really see um a couple of things serge engine land uh talked a little bit about it and
[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:13.020]   which they said you know just people often complain on facebook that you you put something on facebook
[00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:17.580]   and only a small number of your total window yeah and they pointed out you know it's the same on
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:21.420]   twitter mostly because twitter is like live tv if you're not there at the moment you're not going
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:26.300]   to go back in time so i don't think of it like a toilet paper rule it's just kind of
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:32.220]   screw it is a toilet paper roll i think you're right this is scrolling uh you can export it as a
[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:37.420]   csv file and find out more that's the show title yeah twitter the toilet paper it is you don't
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:44.380]   ever go backwards on that it could be it could get ugly if you did that uh quartz notes that mark
[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:47.820]   and dreason who suddenly started using his twitter account at the beginning of the year
[00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:54.220]   really started using it he created an account early on in 2007 but only tweeted twice then all of a
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:50:00.060]   sudden january first he must have made must have made a new year's resolution i'm going to tweet
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:06.060]   more any kept away nuts with it too yeah absolutely nuts 10 i tell you my tai i tell you great
[00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:09.420]   grandmother what i called that what he did you would have caught she would have called that diarrhea
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:15.580]   the mouth exactly in the first six months of this year mark and recent the guy who created net scape
[00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:23.260]   he's now a venture capitalist p marka on twitter tweeted in six months 21 783 times
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:29.900]   an average of five tweets an hour every hour i i had to quit following him i followed him for a
[00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:34.940]   long time and then really him like crazy yeah no it's him it's good stuff actually to be honest
[00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:39.500]   there's actually a lot of good stuff in there but it'll just it'll crush your feed so i just rely on
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:44.460]   people my my people i follow are so good that when he tweets really interesting stuff they retweet
[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:48.300]   it so i stop following him and just waited for my people that i followed or retweet the interesting
[00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:52.380]   one that's a good way to handle it i mean we need that wicked we could he bought to pull out the good
[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:58.780]   one right he's most productive hours between two and four in the afternoon and nine and eleven at
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:06.060]   night before after lunch and after dinner he gets a little buzz on and he starts tweeting but he does
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:10.940]   he he he will really in fact he's gotten a number of very big battles and epic battles over stuff
[00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:17.980]   like journalism dan um and he's he's very outspoken and for some reason he's just using twitter instead
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:22.780]   of a blog or some other platform it's twitter is how mark and recent speaks to the world
[00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:30.540]   but uh yeah this is marketing land dot com uh the the stats show you this according to danny
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:37.980]   Sullivan are we love danny twitter's new impression stats suggest few followers see what's tweeted
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:44.620]   even though everything you know unlike facebook where they filter the news feed twitter doesn't
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:50.380]   do that but i love some visibility into that on twitter facebook and google plus this no yeah
[00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:57.740]   you know who's seeing what he says he he's seeing engagement rates as low as you know 0.1 percent
[00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:05.100]   very low yaoza yaoza and danny's probably a pretty he's a pretty high quality twitter with lots of
[00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:12.220]   good things to say yeah definitely you guys uh have any thoughts we've talked about it but uh
[00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:17.740]   not recently and it's about twitter no yeah you have any thoughts
[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:23.420]   in general about this facebook study you know where they try to influence the happiness or sadness
[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:30.780]   oh yeah and now a member of congress is saying we got to investigate this you know i i i have a
[00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:36.940]   thought on that and i think it's that's just dumb you know because advertising in general i think
[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:41.660]   jina trapani said this on on when the shows i heard her on and i agreed with it 100 percent that
[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:49.100]   advertisers and marketers have been in in you know hollywood everyone in entertainment have been
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:54.780]   influencing our emotions through media some way or another yeah when you write a story you're
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:58.940]   trying to make somebody laugh or cry in editing you can if you put a cut here versus there you can
[00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:03.420]   make someone laugh or cry you know you can they're puppestringing our emotions because facebook
[00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:09.500]   did it and facebook is generally evil per se you know then it becomes weird you know but
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:14.300]   but it is a little weird that what they did is for one week they took 300 what is a 700,000
[00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:19.580]   users for one week they took half of them and they pumped sad feed stories they would look for
[00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:25.740]   specific keywords and they increased the number of sad posts for those people and then for the
[00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:29.740]   other half they increased number of happy posts and then they watched what they posted on facebook
[00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:34.540]   the following week to see if as a result they posted more sad stuff for happy stuff first of
[00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:41.020]   all who the hell cares right that's stupid and useless yes if i'm sad i post sad stories thank you
[00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:47.340]   what the hell you got to do a study there's so much money to this story as well i mean we don't know
[00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:52.620]   we don't know a lot about the origins of the story we don't know a lot about like is this one study it
[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:57.020]   it should be one study amongst thousands of facebook does there are public companies they're not
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:54:01.580]   testing this stuff it's irresponsible right we don't know the any of the content this is such a great
[00:54:01.580 --> 00:54:07.420]   clickbait story that i feel i almost feel bad look i want to believe facebook is evil as much as the
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:14.620]   next tech person they're evil okay great that said this is such a great linkbait story that that
[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:19.900]   we forget all the context and the questions we should be asking which is you know what
[00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:23.580]   how many of these studies do they do what types of studies do they do what's a criterion what's a
[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:29.660]   sample rate i mean there's i would like to know if they do this more so yeah well my first thought
[00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:36.380]   when i heard the story was like this is cold you know but uh but the thing that i sort of came to
[00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:42.540]   because a lot of the discussions about this came down to will people sign those sla or not the sla
[00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:46.780]   oh yeah if you look at the terms of service terms of service all right it's very clear that facebook
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:51.820]   they could do this oh yeah absolutely but it sort of reminded me of again this is kind of what i was
[00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:56.940]   getting to a destroyed nsa earlier right it's like the digital world is sort of fundamentally
[00:54:56.940 --> 00:55:04.700]   changing a lot of the ways people interact and their expectations and in the you know uh existing
[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:11.980]   world there are um regulations and guidelines in place to sort of protect people from entities that
[00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:17.100]   could do these kinds of things to them in in manipulate it and manipulative and sort of not
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:24.140]   very cool ways unethical ways for for example it made me think of like informed consent when um
[00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:29.500]   you know a uh when someone is asking you to do something in a medical community and they're getting
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:35.900]   your consent for a surgery or to use some of your cells for something and that kind of thing um like
[00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:42.780]   we learned with that the sort of the great book on the heila cells um uh the uh about the iraq
[00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:49.260]   i love that by the way that's exactly um you know what happened was it was a failure of informed
[00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:54.620]   consent because informed consent hadn't really fully formed yet um and so they had to you know
[00:55:54.620 --> 00:56:01.180]   they had to within a reasonable you know um within a reasonable doubt they had to give you uh
[00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:06.060]   communicate it to you what was happening in a way that an average normal person could understand
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:10.300]   um you know that's the thing here with some of these that that's what that sort of make me think
[00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:15.500]   of there are things that people are doing and agreeing to and you know they're being covered in
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:19.900]   these terms of services that you know we're just now seeing some of the use cases where companies
[00:56:19.900 --> 00:56:25.100]   getting a little bit um you know stretching the bounds of those things to see what really they can
[00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:29.020]   do and that's what happened in this case you know facebook was stretching the bounds of of what it
[00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:32.940]   can do with its users in ways that i think not all of us are real comfortable with
[00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:39.180]   you know in terms of them trying to manipulate um people uh in ways that is essentially an
[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:44.220]   science experience for them but in ways that could potentially you know have negative effects on
[00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:48.380]   on average people of their service and senator senator mark warner sent an open letter to open
[00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:53.820]   letter the f t c saying you need to see if this is a vi that they fully explore the potential
[00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:59.340]   ramifications of facebook's experiment and whether they violated their terms of service which they
[00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:04.940]   did not in terms of a specific they did mention this kind of stuff not at all not at all but let
[00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:09.980]   me ask this question Frederick uh you said it's like a novel or jina said that but you repeated it
[00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:14.220]   it's like a novel we certainly when we read a novel we expect that that's what we read a novel
[00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:19.980]   for it's about expectation i expect to be lifted up or depressed or you know and and that's not a
[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:24.700]   shock but when i read a facebook feed don't i just isn't my expectation merely that i will see what
[00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:29.180]   my friends are up to less and less so i mean i think less and less because well that's why i'm
[00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:33.420]   mad yeah because we don't know what's in our feed they're they're curating our feed for us highly
[00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:40.460]   for one and now we know that they're you know on purpose guiding the feed right so you know you can't
[00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:44.460]   anything you see on facebook and less is from your close friends and family which you know you're
[00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:49.180]   gonna get their posts you can't really trust it anyway i don't even know if i get that i feel like i
[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:54.380]   i get whatever mark zuckerberg wants me to see i feel like and that really bugs me right right
[00:57:54.380 --> 00:58:00.380]   i don't think facebook violated its own terms of service now in this respect uh i think it's kind
[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:05.980]   of creepy and i think they should have known better yeah there's a documentary on netflix
[00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:10.380]   it's called terms and conditions may apply no you should watch that said about all the things
[00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:15.100]   about facebook google everyone and about the things that you sign and what you sign away because you're
[00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:21.020]   in a hurry to get into the service and what rights you give up by just uh clicking okay
[00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:26.540]   you should you should watch that what's it called terms and conditions may apply i will watch it
[00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:31.660]   tonight after nice ray Donovan and master's of sex and then i have some catching up to do on
[00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:36.060]   true blood and uh i'm gonna watch the last penny draw i'm gonna think i'm maybe next week i'll
[00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:41.100]   watch it here you go in your queue we're gonna take a break if you were busy watching tv and not
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:45.740]   watching twit this week you missed some wonderful stuff in fact i wasn't either so let's watch
[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:53.420]   together the best of the week gone by previously on twit is that right there please help us we're
[00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:58.780]   being repressed this week in law a story from a German site revealing some information sites
[00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:04.540]   including loing loing and the Linux journal might be targeted for long-term surveillance and
[00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:09.100]   by the NSA if they're flying while using their own people visiting the littles you're probably
[00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:14.380]   flagging themselves because i know the NSA is using tons of Linux installations and journey
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:19.340]   tech news tonight the guardian reports that papers leaked by NSA whistleblower edwards
[00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:23.900]   Snowden indicate us and british intelligence agencies have been researching the covert use
[00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:30.620]   of social media for purposes of propaganda and deception triangulation overstock.com is the first
[00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:37.260]   online retailer to actually not only accept bit playing the financial system has far more cracks

[01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:15.100]   i'm sorry i missed that floss i was going to be here but as i mentioned we were in a while we
[01:00:15.100 --> 01:00:21.580]   actually extended our trip i was supposed to be back for that back on monday and we liked why so
[01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:28.700]   much we stayed i would have to it was very nice uh let's check in with our news director mr mike

[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:52.140]   you leo monday through friday 10 a.m. pacific 1 p.m. eastern time 1700 to use t c your daily dose of
[01:00:52.140 --> 01:01:04.700]   tech news tech news tonight so ario uh when when was last we talked before i went to huai lost in
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:10.860]   the supreme court the supreme court said no you are that is a public performance you are not a cable
[01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:14.940]   or you are a cable you're like a cable company they the judges were very good for you you're
[01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:23.420]   excited kind of like a cable company and so uh what you're doing is illegal so ario said okay
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:28.860]   we uh we're a cable company and we want retransmission rights and we'll pay those fees
[01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:38.860]   the the broadcasters who would sue them said no he can't be a cable company you weren't so
[01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:43.020]   the broadcasters basically said you're a cable company until ario said yes we're a cable company
[01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:48.380]   now they're saying no you're not a cable company whatever ario may say about its rationale for
[01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:54.780]   raising it now it is astonishing says the cable industry astonishing for ario to contend the
[01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:58.140]   supreme court's decision automatically transformed ario into a cable system
[01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:09.740]   so it seems to me that this is exactly what this was all about like the supreme court sent
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:15.340]   them back to the lower court and said figure this out ario said okay i thought this would happen
[01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:22.220]   actually we want retransmission agreements we'll pay the retransmission fees and now the the networks
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:28.620]   say no they basically it's pretty clear now the networks just want aria to go all right it's not
[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:33.740]   about the money they don't it's about ario existing you've got some good lawyers over there yeah
[01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:40.780]   isn't that's that's kind of sad uh london firm has created mind control commands for google glass

[01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:19.020]   you otherwise are impaired that makes you know i could see a use case for that before well the
[01:03:19.020 --> 01:03:25.340]   question is does it work i don't know i mean am i am i beaming commands out from my forehead
[01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:28.940]   these are going to be at parties like next week and there's going to be

[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:40.940]   after turning on the mind reader app users will see a camera interface on the screen of their google
[01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:45.980]   glass they can then pick a subject aim their head in its direction okay so far so good and then
[01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:52.140]   concentrate on it while the glass displays a meter showing the level of their brain waves
[01:03:53.180 --> 01:04:00.060]   as you intently focus on your subject the meter the meter climbs
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:07.580]   and when it reaches the top the glass camera goes and takes a picture this should be on twitter
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:12.780]   and this should be on there by repeating the process you can then direct mind reader to upload
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:20.860]   the photo twitter when you can just do this click click how about that just take a hi you know i had
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:27.180]   a japanese thing that uh you made you little bunny ears and then you put it on your head same
[01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:31.820]   same place and you can make and the bunny ears then would simulate or cat ears would simulate your
[01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:36.940]   your state of mind it's like a facebook experiment if you're happy that cat ears would stick up
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:39.260]   we uh we know
[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:44.860]   um and the nsa will hack into those to get into your brain waves

[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:53.260]   judges don't like uh distribute memos about what they they don't get they don't collude here's
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:11:03.820]   that why i say this a federal judge sued uh by uber vita uber vita which is a um
[01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:11.340]   did nutritional supplement company mmm makes up and and they were bad reviews on amazon and uber
[01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:16.700]   vita says no this is not this is a campaign of dirty tricks against uber vita in an effort to
[01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:21.660]   put us at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace and they and they went to court
[01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:32.940]   mm-hmm the judge has said no if uh you amazon have got to reveal to uber vita who posted those
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:39.740]   negative reviews and craigslist same thing the maker they make testosterone boosters multi
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:44.700]   vitamins and weight loss supplements what could be wrong with that unknown cometers had placed
[01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:50.540]   fraudulent orders to disrupt their inventory posted a craigslist ad to offer cash for favorable
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:56.060]   reviews of uber vita products that wasn't us and posted as dissatisfied users
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:06.220]   um u_s district judge marsha peckman said that uber vita can serve subpoenas on amazon and craigslist
[01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:11.260]   what they call john doe subpoenas saying we need the identities of these people and amazon must
[01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:18.940]   comply so that's the first i'm not crazy about that but it feels like but it's so it's probably good
[01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:24.060]   to know that when you post a negative review on a site you could be liable for libel right you could
[01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:33.180]   get sued for slander um but then there's this other decision it doesn't doesn't amazon have
[01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:38.300]   the concept of verified purchaser they do so in some of the cases you are not anonymous you can
[01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:43.020]   be anonymous but you don't have to be so if you're a verified purchaser i presume you're not anonymous
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:53.500]   so nano virus sides is a uh i presume biotech company they make something um they were uh
[01:12:53.500 --> 01:13:02.860]   upset by a guy named pump terminator who posted allegedly defamatory articles about uh nano
[01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:11.180]   virus sides on a website called seeking alpha um not nano virus side says the guy's a short seller
[01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:15.020]   he's trying to dump the stock this happens all the time trying to get the stock to dump so he can
[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:22.300]   sell so he can make some money yeah um seeking alpha which is a free online platform and source
[01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:28.380]   for financial information went to court the judge ruled you don't have to reveal the guy's
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:32.220]   information at all this is from the supreme court of the state of new york
[01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:41.500]   the honor roll scinthe s kern decided now so so if i may summarize if you are a short seller trying
[01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:47.980]   to dump a stock on a form that's okay you can do that anonymously but if you're writing a negative
[01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:53.820]   review about a product on amazon you better watch out right they need to exchange memos i'm just
[01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:58.460]   saying figure it out one way or the other that happens all the time the whole commenting
[01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:02.940]   architecture needs some some help what do you think of internet and an anemimini
[01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:08.940]   can you say it like a rooster rooster rooster rooster rooster rooster rooster rooster rooster
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:16.140]   there is that there is a reason for aminemanese and then we would life on the earth as we know
[01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:20.060]   it would not exist to that aminemanese that's right no there's a reason for anonymity but there's
[01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:25.420]   also a reason for instance g plus and facebook too supposedly you have to use your real names and
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:29.580]   that that changed youtube completely right the comments on youtube are very different aren't they
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:33.980]   shed after the new policy that you have to have a google plus account and have verified it into the
[01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:38.940]   to post a comment that's completely changed the tenor of commenting yeah youtube yeah i mean
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:44.220]   well there's still there's still um uh you know there's same type of people will still comment but
[01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:51.020]   it's a lot better because of the cream rises yeah and because you know the person's name yeah and
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:55.740]   there's a lot it's a lot more difficult to create an all-time is pump terminating and i think chat
[01:14:55.740 --> 01:15:01.740]   has just a terrible person and that stuff's gone you know that's worse than the most part yeah
[01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:06.620]   so there's a reason for uh for forcing real identities but there's also i got to say a reason
[01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:11.900]   for anonymity i think i think like on youtube if someone's commenting on a random youtube video
[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:17.660]   of a cat dancing or something who cares it can be anonymous or anananominous amana más
[01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:25.420]   but if it's related to a product and profit it is involved as a purchaser or consumer
[01:15:25.420 --> 01:15:30.940]   i would want to know that the person that's commenting is a real person and does not have
[01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:35.100]   some sort of a hidden agenda well it's true on Yelp and other places that you know the
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:39.740]   businesses will give bad reviews of competitors good reviews of themselves yep it's hard to know
[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:45.580]   it's a different type of trust dynamic right so so it flips both ways i'm chat i'm sure you know
[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:52.780]   this but within gaming a ton of the the the gamers uh uh the youtube gamers their commenters had this
[01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:57.180]   trust relationship precisely because they could be anonymous or at least pseudo anonymous but
[01:15:57.180 --> 01:16:02.060]   then when we flip to a consumer type of relationship uh just like you're saying Frederick that
[01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:07.660]   it's a different type of trust relationship and i i need to be uh less opaque about my my
[01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:12.540]   identity but i i think that uh there are certain types of behavior and and the gamers are really
[01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:19.740]   the easiest ones to point to where trust comes from anonymity how interesting and i want to read the
[01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:24.380]   bad reviews that's what i generally read online and i'm gonna buy a book there should there's a
[01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:28.380]   chilling effect if you think somebody might sue you for a bad review if you generally
[01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:31.500]   genuinely don't like something you should be able to say i think this thing sucks right
[01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:36.380]   right and i and i shouldn't have to be sued for libel i guess you're not liable for libel
[01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:43.660]   or slander if if it's true if it's true and there is not an intent to cause harm right right so you
[01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:52.140]   can't say i can't say you know uh Frederick van johnson is an extortionist we agreed not to talk about that
[01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:59.820]   but i want my pictures back no but but i could say he's a jerk because that's an opinion
[01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:05.180]   yeah so there's provable matters of fact and then there's there's opinion and you could say i don't
[01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:09.260]   like this pro this red bull tastes crappy i don't like it you're not gonna get sued over that right
[01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:14.220]   if you say red bull is made from baby's blood you could be sued for that because it's obviously not
[01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:19.420]   right we don't think right and online on amazon because so many people make purchasing decisions
[01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:26.620]   based on those negative reviews i mean i do think i do too they the weight is is there if i see three
[01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:31.020]   people that say hey i ordered this thing and it showed up broken i'm not buying that thing you know
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:35.660]   regardless of how many positive reviews were there it's it but you learned don't you to weigh it and
[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:40.620]   to say if there's only one negative review okay i'm gonna i'm gonna ignore that but if i say three
[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:46.940]   all saying kind of the same thing right oh i very much pay attention to amazon reviews that's one of
[01:17:46.940 --> 01:17:52.300]   the best things best innovations an Amazon reviews are by most store everything reviews yeah
[01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:57.820]   yeah although although chilling is Leo you said that a moment ago and that's the exact right word
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:01.660]   especially i i keep coming back to gaming but that's where you'll see some of the most
[01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:07.660]   offensive childish ridiculous language and it's precisely because people can be anonymous or
[01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:13.100]   they'll use a gaming name or or a pseudonym or a handle and okay that's childish ridiculous
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:18.700]   language but that's very important they use that because they feel i can be free i just want to say
[01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:26.380]   stupid stuff at night and uh whatever nobody cares and it doesn't reflect on my my work persona or
[01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:31.900]   or my public persona it's not chill behavior and i think that that's really important too
[01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:39.340]   by the way that's a skill we should be teaching in in uh schools today how to read amazon reviews
[01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:45.180]   like how to that that's a real skill you could take the amazon reviews part off of that sentence
[01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:50.140]   just how to read would be a complete okay start with that this is aim low all right yeah you're
[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:54.860]   right start at the bottom it's not this is a life skill right and i think it's we've we've all
[01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:58.700]   learned how to do it yeah nobody taught us but we just kind of figured out what we know what to
[01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:03.660]   look at what not to look at that's useful though that's boy that's off sleep yeah critical thinking
[01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:09.900]   it's not high on the list of of uh most schools no it ought to be in the u.s because what you know
[01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:14.540]   they say i want to we're going to teach you how to use microsoft word like who knows what we're
[01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:17.740]   when that kid graduates from college if they're going to still be using microsoft word not but a
[01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:23.180]   critical thinking will always be in style yep very good thank you will keep you from using microsoft
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:29.980]   word that too put on there you go well said well said youtube ways funding efforts to boost
[01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:33.500]   premium content sources this isn't the first time they did it remember they put aside a hundred
[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:39.820]   million dollars to fund something like a hundred new channels from big names like Oprah and Shaq
[01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:46.380]   um some question about whether that hundred million dollars really was effective youtube
[01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:50.460]   says that of the hundred fifteen channels launched as part of that initiative
[01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:51.580]   um
[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:57.740]   wait a minute over a hundred fifteen of the channels launched
[01:19:57.740 --> 01:20:02.940]   i don't understand that because they only launched a hundred channels this is makes no sense at all
[01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:07.660]   yeah they launched a hundred channels Madonna ESPN as i mentioned Shaq
[01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:13.900]   um over one hundred fifteen of the channels launched as part of that initiative are now in the top
[01:20:13.900 --> 01:20:19.420]   two percent most subscribed channels i don't understand if that's how that's right since they
[01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:23.900]   only launched a hundred but anyway they're going to do it again but this time they're going to be
[01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:30.380]   cageier um they are actually gonna do it a little bit more quietly they apparently
[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:34.220]   according to Reuters have embarked on a new round of discussions with hollywood and independent
[01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:41.740]   producers to fund premium content in other words pump a little cash into the better youtube
[01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:48.140]   channel so it's not all groinshot videos and talking oranges o amet talking oranges is the
[01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:55.660]   premiere content sorry uh apparently youtube is it's very similar to the previous initiative
[01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:59.020]   they're going to offer between one and three million dollars to produce a series of programs
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:04.860]   might contribute marketing funds as well they want shorter than the traditional 30-minute tv
[01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:09.260]   shows but they want web network quality web shows
[01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:19.740]   nothing to say about cool yeah yeah sign me up where's the form they've been they've been on this
[01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:25.420]   road for a while i think that absolutely but without any success because the real hits on youtube
[01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:30.460]   are not network quality television shows i think that's why they keep trying
[01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:40.620]   yeah uh let's see microsoft i want this is a big change for microsoft and i don't know did
[01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:45.500]   robert talk about this at all last week satin adela has started to write letters to employees he
[01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:51.180]   says we want you to be bold and ambitious that's all right but he's also started a downplay his
[01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:57.660]   predecessors steve balmers focus on devices and services particularly the devices part it is the
[01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:03.740]   strong impression of a lot of observers that microsoft is moving away from hardware and is
[01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:10.300]   moving towards a enterprise and a cloud company this is after all what nadela's background is it
[01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:18.780]   and basics bloomberg's Betty lu who reported the memo said that according to people familiar
[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:26.860]   with the plans this means job cuts so get ready there may be some belt tightening at microsoft
[01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:35.100]   as mike mentioned the microsoft quarterly results come out july 22nd this is the final nail in
[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:41.580]   the coffin for windows phone is it over this is the white flag it's done well maybe not windows
[01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:46.940]   phone but windows eight they they have spent i didn't know this six point two billion dollars
[01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:55.980]   to market windows eight six point two billion dollars with a b with a b and uh it didn't it was
[01:22:55.980 --> 01:23:02.140]   it's a obviously a flop it's a turn it's a complete turn it's a complete turn that's being nice um
[01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:09.740]   they they're the pc market is dying partly because of windows eight partly because of windows eight
[01:23:09.740 --> 01:23:14.700]   partly because of tablets and smartphones microsoft's own smartphone initiative is late to the table
[01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:19.100]   although i think acquiring noki is not a man noki makes great hardware right you use the pure
[01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:25.500]   view cameras uh no no i've seen them but i'm i'm still not on that bandwagon of i want one unified
[01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:30.860]   device for everything camera should be a camera a camera from you know me and uh
[01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:36.860]   granted i'm a sample size one but i want i want my phone to be a phone and an excellent smartphone
[01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:42.620]   and i want my camera i went in that mode to uh to you know do my photos it does happen that well
[01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:49.260]   i'll give you an example when we're here in hawaii we hiked up to the seven sacred pools and it was
[01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:56.620]   it's tropical it's raining and um i didn't want to bring my 5d up there so i only had my camera
[01:23:56.620 --> 01:24:01.180]   phone but i was able to do things this is the htc one i was able to do things with a camera
[01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:06.380]   phone like these google photospheres oh that's nice that i i couldn't have done and i didn't mind
[01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:12.060]   if the phone got a little damp um but it it was an amazing and you can see how muddy and wet it is
[01:24:12.060 --> 01:24:17.020]   i did not want the 5d i feel situation for that right i mean you don't want to you're mentioned
[01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:21.900]   yeah to take photos i wish i'd had the 5d because this is i mean i should i would have loved it got
[01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:27.180]   beautiful pictures of this but i got i got some okay stuff i'm pretty happy with what i got
[01:24:27.180 --> 01:24:32.460]   um this is all from a camera phone and i think that's one of the things about a camera phone is
[01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:38.780]   um you know it's the camera you have right and and they're getting better and better well that's
[01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:44.940]   the thing if you if you have the pure view um this bamboo forest by the way have you ever been in a
[01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:53.500]   bamboo forest not like that no wow they were probably 20 feet tall and it was mystical it was
[01:24:53.500 --> 01:25:00.700]   just magical all bamboo is Lisa walking through it wow that's cool and you know what the 5d might
[01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:06.060]   have captured it better yeah but it but um but at least you got something and google does those fun
[01:25:06.060 --> 01:25:12.780]   auto awesome uh this was by the way there's a big sign that says do not fatalities have occurred
[01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:20.300]   do not go here and so what does Lisa do right there yep fatalities have occurred
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:27.100]   wow anyway that's the argument for an ocea pure view camera is that you still a phone but you
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:30.700]   maybe have a little bit better care i know i agree it's not going to replace the 5d or anything else
[01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:35.660]   but can we talk more about the bamboo forest yeah have you ever seen a bamboo forest no
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:44.140]   that looked amazing that looked amazing it is so how cool you know we went what you go to is you
[01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:51.820]   go to see the falls um which are which are here's the here's the sign this is a big sign i do not
[01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:58.540]   i do do not pass this point fatalities have occurred violating this order is a hundred
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:04.540]   dollar fine and then wait wait let's look beyond the this is a little Jurassic park isn't it oh that
[01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:11.260]   is oh there's Lisa down there what what she doing what she do not cross during flooding there she
[01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:15.500]   goes i'm just standing back here going please don't die i don't know how we're going to get
[01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:20.780]   helicopter you out but these falls what's wrong with your video oh well it's a camera phone why is
[01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:29.900]   it so vertical you know what okay okay okay i was going to bring that up wait a minute this is the
[01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:36.300]   test case for vertical video that is a hundred foot waterfall yeah yeah of course you're going
[01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:41.740]   to shoot that vertically you'd had a pan up you'd had a pan up if you wanted to do it shoot it
[01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:49.340]   swide it's up that's and this again another case where see sometimes it should be sometimes
[01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:56.780]   it's a mr photographer it's okay Leo you're okay i was hoping nobody would notice that all my videos
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:27:04.220]   like every one of them we're shot well it's a waterfall and even in this i had to pan up panning
[01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:09.420]   up on a vertical that's that's creative it's a serious waterfall though it's an awesome waterfall
[01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:14.700]   seven sacred pools two miles almost here it straight up in the mud you can't hear it if you
[01:27:14.700 --> 01:27:18.220]   listen to the sound i guess you don't have the sound turned on no i and then and i love these
[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:22.700]   oh you want to hear it now well i mean now i now i just have yeah let's turn up the sound listen
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:32.620]   yeah oh yeah it is truly magnificent wow and you but so we went to see the falls right seven
[01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:39.100]   sacred pools this is a national park by the way in hana hawaii on maui but uh that's on maui it's
[01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:43.580]   on maui but the bamboo forests were what actually knocked me out i thought these things were truly
[01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:51.020]   incredible the other thing i love is the google is the android okay they're a little weird but the
[01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:57.340]   uh the this gives you it's almost a sense that you're there yeah right yeah you can pan around
[01:27:57.340 --> 01:28:02.460]   and i did this one all the way around so you see a little audio snippet for some like ambience
[01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:06.300]   you can do that actually in some of these camera some of these camera phones so it couldn't do that
[01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:12.780]   very easily with a 5d if i had a special head and tripod in four hours yeah in a pack mule yeah
[01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:18.700]   exactly it's pretty amazing there's some errors but uh it does a pretty good job considering i shot
[01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:23.420]   that in like 30 seconds with a phone is that amazing look at that it's awesome you're still

[01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:45.580]   and it's much easier than craigslist or ebay so i bought i got you here i got to talk to you about
[01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:52.220]   this rhetoric johnson this week van johnson this week in photo yes um i bought lightroom years ago
[01:31:52.220 --> 01:31:55.980]   two hundred bucks or whatever it was and i have the what they call it the perpetual
[01:31:55.980 --> 01:32:00.540]   version or something like that but now they have a ten dollar a month you get photoshop
[01:32:00.540 --> 01:32:04.220]   and lightroom and since you have to subscribe to photoshop i figure well i'm gonna buy that
[01:32:04.220 --> 01:32:09.900]   there was some concern that if you've got this creative cloud subscription and then you don't
[01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:15.180]   continue to pay adobe's ten bucks each and every month that you will no longer have access like
[01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:20.380]   is my lightroom gonna go away why would your lightroom library go away if you lost access to
[01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:25.660]   lightroom you mean yeah because i didn't pay for the subscription anymore yeah um
[01:32:25.660 --> 01:32:31.180]   that's a good question well i could tell you the answer because tom hogarty explained i know
[01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:35.900]   tom very well i'm sure you do i do too so the issue and a lot of people were worried about this in a
[01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:40.620]   little area of the subscription um although i think ten bucks for both photoshop and lightrooms a
[01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:45.500]   good deal if you haven't bought lightroom if you bought lightroom ever like the full version you
[01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:49.020]   don't have to ever worry that's always going to continue to work you'll have to pay for upgrades
[01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:53.180]   of course but that's forever gonna work with full functionality if you only got it through
[01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:57.820]   subscription some stuff will stop working the develop and map module if you stop paying the
[01:32:57.820 --> 01:33:03.260]   subscription you will no longer be able to use the develop module in the map module so you have
[01:33:03.260 --> 01:33:06.780]   your photos they're not gone you have you can see what you've done with your photos you could still
[01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:12.860]   uh print them uh you can do some minor modification but develop is where most of the stuff the
[01:33:12.860 --> 01:33:18.860]   modification stuff lifts right and and the other thing to be to understand is lightroom isn't
[01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:24.540]   ingesting your photos or your raw files into some sort of weird database right they're just you know
[01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:28.860]   they're sitting there in the original photo yeah so the things that you're losing access to are
[01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:34.300]   your changes if you've made any development changes and not exported a new tiff or something right
[01:33:34.300 --> 01:33:38.780]   then those are going to be locked in because you can access the develop module but everything
[01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:43.580]   else is there you could run some other app and point it at that directory and boom all your photos
[01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:48.780]   right you won't be running aperture probably doubtful yes what do you think of that apples
[01:33:48.780 --> 01:33:53.180]   uh announced we're not going to continue aperture we did a whole show on that and that yeah we've
[01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:58.140]   i called that like a year and a half two years ago it's pretty obvious they hadn't updated in years
[01:33:58.140 --> 01:34:03.740]   it's a car sitting in a garage and you know adobe is sitting on blocks rolling down they've taken all
[01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:08.140]   the oil out of the pump yeah they're not gonna run that car yeah and people are like yeah it's
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:12.380]   coming they're gonna make an update then they haven't updated it and then finally in fact you know
[01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:17.820]   on the show i think we said the announcement was kind of a admission it wasn't an announcement it
[01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:21.660]   was like okay yeah you're right we're done with that you know we're on the other things a new
[01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:26.060]   thing is photos you know but i feel like they're abandoning the professional user they're saying
[01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:31.900]   we don't really care about you on the photography side for sure i think and it makes it yes well that's
[01:34:31.900 --> 01:34:36.940]   what i got i wonder if you're a video editor and you could use it final cut you might you know what
[01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:42.060]   we're moving to premiere premiere pro yeah that's what we're doing here tWET you can't blame you can't
[01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:48.140]   blame out yeah we are too just you move on like you're moving to premiere yeah yeah we're buying
[01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:53.580]   a few seas really premiere runs fine on a Mac yeah and we'll continue to run it on the old Mac
[01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:58.540]   pros but instead of buying the new Mac pros because we're our Mac pros are three or four years old
[01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:03.820]   ours everybody's are uh we're gonna buy they're more for we're going to del we're buying i can't
[01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:10.060]   remember eight pcs loaded with all the video cars and stuff and i didn't use adobe premiere well with
[01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:17.260]   window seven uh that's a good question i should go look at Russell specs yeah i don't think it
[01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:22.860]   matters because you live in uh you live in premiere is it one of seven or eight um i'm not sure but but
[01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:26.620]   yeah i mean you'll you'll switch over to the desktop and then never leave i think it's eight i think
[01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:33.500]   we're getting eight just get of no that's a good question actually yeah anything we run we run
[01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:37.420]   window seven on it we don't want to say it all you know who would well no business in their right
[01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:42.540]   mind because you'd have to retrain and yeah i'll just see if Russell shared that document with me i
[01:35:42.540 --> 01:35:48.860]   could tell you it's you know when you add up the price it's not uh it's not cheap but i think we're
[01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:53.820]   gonna completely replace all hardware for like i don't know do you remember what it was fifty
[01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:59.180]   thousand something like that it's just money you know needs it right you know you so you decided
[01:35:59.180 --> 01:36:03.420]   you can't take it with you the mac pro just because it's cheaper on the pc side that was yeah yeah
[01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:09.020]   you know i bet people would be interested i won't waste your time now uh i bet people would be
[01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:13.660]   interested in what uh what we're gonna do with that so i'll find that information and publish it i
[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:17.820]   want to know and we have some really old computers right now that we're working on so we're at there
[01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:22.860]   old but they're old mac pros i mean even if you had the the last mac pro it's three years old yeah
[01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:30.300]   yeah yeah i guess yeah it's really gonna speed stuff up so excited yeah we're excited you're
[01:36:30.300 --> 01:36:34.540]   gonna do a big garage sale for the old computers what are we doing with the old computers uh we're
[01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:43.820]   making the skype o rex oh yeah no i don't know that would be cool last story uh donate them to a
[01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:49.820]   high school frustrating for a lot of people and a word of warning if you are coming from europe into
[01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:58.940]   the united states the tsa will require that you power on your gadgets and if you can't if your
[01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:11.340]   batteries dead they'll take it uh they wow whoa they've decided uh that uh terrorist threats al-qaeda
[01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:21.500]   operatives could very easily hide bombs in what looked like a laptop or some other device and uh
[01:37:21.500 --> 01:37:24.620]   and so they don't want to pass it they want to have you turn it on i remember the
[01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:30.460]   i do remember having to turn on laptops before laptops i remember that yeah but they hadn't done
[01:37:30.460 --> 01:37:37.740]   that recently and if you travel i mean when i was uh just in kyro uh i often and and my colleagues as
[01:37:37.740 --> 01:37:42.780]   well will travel with a ton of external batteries and they just look like a backpack loaded with
[01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:49.660]   these dense small little things that don't turn on and when you're overseas it can look pretty scary
[01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:55.980]   to the guys who are doing your customs no kidding when does this go into effect is this
[01:37:55.980 --> 01:38:02.620]   eh um oh and also if your gadgets broken like you dropped your phone you can't take on can't take
[01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:08.620]   it with you uh kori doctor are writing about this on boing boing apparently linked to syrian and
[01:38:08.620 --> 01:38:12.540]   yamini bomb makers thinking they can blow up airplanes with fake electronics we don't know
[01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:19.980]   uh and it's also not clear if making a an led blink on a battery is enough or i mean how
[01:38:19.980 --> 01:38:24.060]   that's meaningless because if it is a bomb they could easily make a little led picture it's on
[01:38:24.060 --> 01:38:31.260]   yeah um related story best by kiosk sales and airports of batteries is booming
[01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:36.460]   um and if stuff's broken uh same thing it does does not say
[01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:44.140]   if this is you know the tsa is basically asking places like he throw to do this unclear
[01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:49.100]   if and when they will but there's certainly something to be aware of and if you are
[01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:52.300]   as many of our viewers are Sebastian you came here from brelind if you're traveling
[01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:58.780]   uh into the united states i make sure if you power up your stuff before you go
[01:38:58.780 --> 01:39:06.460]   charge it up transport officials said an estate passengers could be asked to switch
[01:39:06.460 --> 01:39:10.860]   on devices and equipment that does not power up would not be allowed on board this is a
[01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:17.900]   official from sunday july six twenty fourteen tsa press release it seems weird what if you're
[01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:21.740]   in a connecting flight and you used up all your juice watching movies and you got to go through
[01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:29.100]   security again for some reason i think a lot of this is in reaction to uh i mean tsa is amped up
[01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:34.460]   but in the last month with isos uh tsa is just amped up all kinds of restrictions so this could
[01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:40.140]   also just be a pretty general thing where some bureaucrat was like uh what else and uh all
[01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:44.940]   electronics just yeah that's it power them on yeah this sounds like a bureaucratic decision as
[01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:49.260]   opposed to one that was specifically targeting tech or it could be an excuse you know it you know
[01:39:49.260 --> 01:39:54.700]   to target people here's here's the official press release as the traveling public knows you know this
[01:39:54.700 --> 01:40:00.060]   as the traveling public knows all electronic devices are screened by security officers
[01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:05.900]   during the security examination officers may also ask that owners power up some devices including
[01:40:05.900 --> 01:40:13.260]   cell phones you can't put much of a bomb cell phone i don't know powerless devices will not be
[01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:19.660]   permitted on board the aircraft the traveler may also undergo additional screening that sounds
[01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:23.580]   like body cavities buckets they're gonna have a bucket of google glass over there because you're
[01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:29.580]   always dead can you turn on your glasses this is not going anywhere up here you go sorry
[01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:34.540]   it sort of sounds like maybe they were tipped off to something maybe there was something that's
[01:40:34.540 --> 01:40:39.020]   the only thing that's what they're saying it's something about yamene bomb makers yeah yeah
[01:40:39.020 --> 01:40:43.500]   yeah that that they really do they've seen some of this yeah at least there'd be it i don't know
[01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:46.540]   at least they're trying to be transparent about it used to be i think they would do something like
[01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:51.020]   this and say oh yeah by the way we just got it to put your phones on now right and you'd be like what
[01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:55.500]   and at least i kind of like that they're saying look we found something we see that there are people
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:41:00.060]   trying to you know pass off devices i'm sure it's based on actual intelligence of course yeah and
[01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:06.220]   look your phone can i mean like your phone is the right size to put a lot of things in
[01:41:06.220 --> 01:41:12.620]   at least powering it on shows that this is a phone i mean i i don't support like blanket actions
[01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:16.620]   like this but at the same time like well i may not be blanket it sounds like they're saying
[01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:21.980]   this could happen yeah i would just be prepared safe then but uh but absolutely if you're traveling
[01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:26.700]   the u.s and i know a lot of you do a lot of you come here to see us make sure everything's charged
[01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:31.340]   up yeah but you know one of your commenter said something about the mophie juice pack that goes
[01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:37.500]   on your phone yeah you that could hold something in there too you see it in there you know my phone
[01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:42.940]   turns on hey look and now i'm on the plane with you know and i don't i mean i don't you know it's
[01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:47.260]   all security theater you can think of lots of ways around this somebody in the chat room said put the
[01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:52.540]   bomb in the suitcase they're not gonna make you turn it on i mean the whole thing is like it's the

[01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:04.060]   not pure tech and and i know that your audience really loves pure tech and and i apply pure tech
[01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:08.940]   to the jobs that i do and i always have but i understand it's uh it's it's a tough sell often
[01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:13.260]   when somebody doesn't do you know pure tech reporter you're a smart journalist and that's
[01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:18.860]   what i really care most about and i think uh you don't have to be a tech reporter to be
[01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:24.700]   uh of value on this show or any of the shows we do know i know and you have to have a journalistic
[01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:29.420]   point of view here and that's what i get out of out of consuming your shows is that it's smart
[01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:34.700]   discussion it's not just a pithy throwaway stuff right and that's very important in the stay and age
[01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:40.380]   of clickbait thank you dan appreciate all the work you do as well well you too
[01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:45.900]   forwarding the the world of journalism dot this starting with occupy wall street
[01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:51.020]   it all started down earlier than that really really occupy that was the first
[01:43:51.020 --> 01:43:56.860]   day you're sure if i had to tell that story and and uh was it abc didn't really want you to do it on
[01:43:56.860 --> 01:44:02.300]   the air so you just you use social yeah yeah i was i was uh we don't need to talk about me unless
[01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:08.620]   we're actually talking about me right um but right i i was using social media to cover occupy because

[01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:25.100]   old and uh this weekend photography is at uh this weekend photo dot com that's correct
[01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:31.420]   and uh a real uh pat in the back to matthew inman as you know he's the cartoonist who does the oatmeal
[01:45:31.420 --> 01:45:38.700]   and uh he has been raising money for a museum to honor nickele a tesla a man who really was
[01:45:38.700 --> 01:45:43.180]   eclipsed by uh thomas edison yeah but did so much it was kind of he was a crazy guy
[01:45:43.180 --> 01:45:50.060]   he was a little nutty tesla was but at least he didn't kill an elephant and uh and he
[01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:54.780]   would did a lot to promote the use of electricity in his country and really isn't really acknowledged
[01:45:54.780 --> 01:46:00.540]   but one one form of acknowledgement he got of course was that elan musk named his electric
[01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:06.620]   automobile and his company the tesla that's right uh so it's kind of a nice uh conjunction
[01:46:06.620 --> 01:46:13.820]   matthew inman suggested in fact that elan musk help him with the tesla museum uh and elan musk has done
[01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:19.420]   so he says he's going to build a tesla supercharger in station in the parking lot which is very
[01:46:19.420 --> 01:46:26.540]   appropriate and he's donating one million dollars and uh and uh matthew wrote about this on the
[01:46:26.540 --> 01:46:33.980]   158th birthday of a nickele tesla which is just a few days ago so that's good news uh anything else
[01:46:33.980 --> 01:46:39.900]   chad that i should mention if we plugged everything oh yesterday by the way was kepler appreciation
[01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:47.260]   day in petaluma california very odd uh they had a little ceremony not yohannas kepler the
[01:46:47.260 --> 01:46:56.220]   astronomer the satellite named after him the telescope that's designed to discover exoplanets
[01:46:56.220 --> 01:47:01.900]   earth-like planets they've discovered more than 400 so far and uh because yesterday was a super
[01:47:01.900 --> 01:47:08.620]   moon and i don't know why but for some reason the city council of petaluma california decided to
[01:47:08.620 --> 01:47:15.740]   honor kepler with kepler appreciation day and they had a little party at the metiquisical cafe
[01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:22.060]   in littia's sunflower center all right so i'm sorry you missed that california's awesome
