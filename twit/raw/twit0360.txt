[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.280]   Boy, there was a lot of it this week with some of the great minds, the pundits, the
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.560]   commentators, the great thinkers in the industry starting with a guy who's a regular on this
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.080]   week in Google, a professor of journalism at the City University of New York, the author
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.240]   of what would Google do in a brand new book called Public Parts, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.440]   It's good to have you.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.440]   Welcome.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.440]   It's good to be here.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.440]   I wore my Borg shirt in honor.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.920]   Does that mean you're in the Borg or what's it actually means I want to stock off, but
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.840]   why stock home?
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.840]   Bjorn.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.840]   Bjorn.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.840]   Bjorn Borg.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.840]   Oh, that Bjorn.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.840]   Oh, yes, yes.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.840]   A chain of stores there.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.640]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.240]   So he's original Borg, the tennis player.
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.240]   Hmm.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.240]   I get it.
[00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.240]   You can probably pronounce the name of that volcano.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.440]   Well, that's, you know, I was thinking Bjorn, the Icelandic singer.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.560]   No, that's a different Bjorn.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.560]   Is that Bjorn?
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.560]   Yes, Bjorn.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.560]   Bjork.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.560]   Bjork.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.560]   All right.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.560]   Boy, I always get the shows off to a Rousey star.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.560]   Should I show you my scars?
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.560]   No.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.560]   Hey, we should say.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.560]   It's also our scars.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.560]   We're covering from an epidemic a week ago.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.560]   And your daughter's fine.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.560]   She's good.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.560]   The surgery went well.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.560]   Okay.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.560]   That's good.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.560]   So we welcome you back.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.280]   You didn't get to be part of our coverage of Google I/O, but this is good because you'll
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.520]   give us delighted to be here.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.120]   I feel like I'm moving up from the kitty table to the grown up table.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.120]   Thanks, kitty.
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.120]   Same table.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.120]   I hate to tell you.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.120]   There's no turkey.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.120]   That's the only difference.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.120]   Also here.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.440]   Hey, it's really great to have my old friend, David Prager's here from, well, I don't know
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.440]   where you're from.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.360]   Used to be from revision three.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.640]   David, I am officially unemployed.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.320]   He's the founder of revision three, which was recently acquired by Discovery.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.560]   And we're going to get into that in just a second.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.560]   David was also an original Twit.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.560]   I was.
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.000]   He had done all the first few dozen shows, but then he had better things to do.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.800]   But maybe you make it more regular.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.800]   Yeah, I'd love to.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.800]   I'd love to.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.800]   Thanks for having me back.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.200]   I was hoping to see you climb jungles and things like that on Discovery.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.000]   I'll be doing a couple of projects at revision three.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.880]   Just a couple of them.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.240]   There might be a small opportunity for something semi-similar to what discovery type of programming
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.240]   is, which was my own idea before the acquisition happened.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.240]   I'll tell you about that.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.240]   Oh, fine.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.240]   That's interesting.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.680]   I want to say hi to Drew Allenoff, who is a good friend, longtime friend that drew on
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.680]   Twitter.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.160]   And Drew for many years was laboring in the vineyards of the public relations field.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.960]   No, I was getting the advantage for that.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.960]   I love that.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.880]   Community management's a little bit of everything.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.240]   I guess community management isn't exactly.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.000]   So now you're a journalist.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   I can have you on.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Indeed.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   You're at the next web.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   The next web.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.760]   And you've moved back out here, which is fantastic.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.760]   Indeed.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.600]   What is your beat on the next web?
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.760]   Pretty much everything.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.840]   But now I'm focusing in on Google, Facebook, Four Square, social stuff.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.440]   I really, I have for a long time really like the next web.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.440]   Thank you very much.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.680]   Yeah, it's a great site.
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.200]   So it's good to have you there.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.680]   It's good to have you here.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.680]   It's good to be here.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.080]   This is my first time at the studio.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.080]   Yeah, you've never been.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.720]   You've been in the cottage.
[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.720]   I did.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.720]   Well, thank you, Drew.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.960]   And I should ask as long as we're talking about health, I think people know that Drew
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.000]   was a very active.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.280]   You got cancer and you were very active in talking about it on the air and on the Twitter
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.440]   and and really became an advocate and you are telling me about your health.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.440]   You're in good shape.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.440]   November.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.200]   Yeah, November of three years, clear, Pachkin, Sonfoma.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.200]   So that's been good.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.200]   And that awesome.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.200]   Well, it's awesome.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.200]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.920]   So yeah, it's been a long road and I've started writing a chemo.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.920]   Yeah, I did chemo.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.920]   I was surgery.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.920]   Just chemo?
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.040]   No, I survived plenty of surgery.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.760]   And I didn't have to get radiation luckily.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.600]   And so I've been writing a book, but it's been changing like every year because every
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.520]   stage after cancer has been weird.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.000]   Like I could write a book about going through it and then right afterwards and then two
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   years later.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.200]   So it's it's still a fact.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.920]   It's it still affects me.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.320]   And you had a very effective Twitter campaign F cancer.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.320]   No, it was blame.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.320]   Drew's cancer.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.320]   It was blame Drew's cancer.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.320]   That's right.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.320]   That's right.
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.320]   That's right.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.440]   I went out on Twitter with that hashtag saying my and a rotten day blamers cancer.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.000]   And it was a really great campaign.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.360]   Drew, that was as as I've had two cancers since the show.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.360]   That was the greatest thing.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.640]   It really, really was it.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.520]   It brought the right attitude to it.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.840]   And people were able to rally around people and not get all mopey.
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.480]   And it was just really a perfect Twitter campaign against cancer.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.480]   Thanks, Jeff.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.480]   And you've been a huge inspiration with your stuff.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.480]   I mean, your champ.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.240]   You know, what's really interesting is that when when all this kind of began, we were
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.200]   all young and healthy, right?
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.200]   And then old.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.480]   What counts now?
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.480]   That people got sick.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.480]   People died.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.960]   People got had children.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.760]   Life started happening.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.480]   And it's been very interesting to watch the social stuff, Twitter and Facebook and so
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.680]   forth as that's been happening to this young San Francisco hip San Francisco grad and watch
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.400]   them kind of grapple with it.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.000]   And you know, blame Drew's cancer was a good example of that where perhaps for a lot of
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.720]   us, it was the first time we knew somebody who had cancer.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.760]   And so it was a chance to kind of explore that and the fear and the terror and the,
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.320]   you know, I knew that I wanted to raise a bunch of money and I just didn't know how
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.800]   to do it other than ask people for money, which doesn't really work for, you know, charities
[00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.800]   have a hard time doing that.
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.360]   So I was like, I'm going to do that.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.360]   Right.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.360]   But it was interesting.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.760]   How much money did you raise with Drew Carey involved?
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.760]   We raised $1.7 million.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.760]   Wow.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.760]   And for what?
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.760]   For what?
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.760]   For Livestrong.
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.760]   Yeah.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.760]   So that is awesome.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.560]   That is a huge amount of money.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.960]   How did Drew Carey get involved?
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:57.480]   So I was sitting around with a couple of my friends in San Francisco and I was like,
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.080]   okay, so I'm almost on treatment.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.200]   So I should do something else, like just go out with a bang.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.360]   So I had this Twitter username.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:09.120]   I was Drew on Twitter and I asked Ev Williams, if I could auction it off, I know you can't
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.280]   sell usernames, but if I auctioned it off, he said, yeah, go for it.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.240]   And I was like, Drew Barrymore doesn't use Twitter at all.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.800]   Maybe Drew Carey.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.240]   And I think it just got back to him.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.840]   A friend told him about it and he tweeted at me and I was like in a Starbucks and like
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.240]   literally dropped my coffee.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.240]   I'll take it.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:33.000]   And he's been super cool and super supportive ever since and he's a really, really good
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   guy.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.360]   It actually worked really well because you went from Drew to that Drew.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.360]   To that Drew.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.960]   And he still hasn't used at Drew.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.960]   He hasn't?
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.320]   No, it just kind of sits there and I think he just likes to look at.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:48.600]   I mean, it meant a lot to him.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.120]   So it was never about the username for him.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.760]   Plus, I'm not sure even though I've explained to him, he doesn't get his followers or anything.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.400]   He can just do the switch.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.840]   Now I, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I could take a little credit for that Drew.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.640]   Was it not at South by Southwest?
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.560]   When I was asking people what I should do.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.560]   You said what should I do?
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.280]   And I said, well, you should be that Drew.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.280]   There you go.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.280]   Was that not me?
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.280]   That's a little important.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.280]   Well, a lot of people that inspired by that role.
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.480]   You did that with that, Kevin Smith.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.760]   It wasn't the first, was it?
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.760]   No, no, no.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.760]   As opposed to the Drew or the real Drew.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.840]   All that Drew.com was available since you know you want to talk branding, but.
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.840]   There you go.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.840]   I don't like it.
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:27.840]   It didn't matter.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:33.720]   Well, you've got, it's easy for you now with a username that's not as common as the
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.600]   name Drew to be able to search at replies.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.600]   Like I know people that have.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.600]   Much better.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.160]   Like, like, you don't want to be Jack.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.080]   So, like, I mean, he's got at T and he can't do at replies.
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:47.200]   And like, even, you know, like, for me, I could have changed mine to just Prager even.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.200]   But I didn't want to.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:53.000]   I just have it as deal Prager because if I look for Prager's semi-unique, not really.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Right.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.920]   And I can find everything unique if I throw in my middle initial on there.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.360]   Brett Petersell at Brett every time football season.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.360]   Thank goodness.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.360]   Brett was retired.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.400]   He would get ridiculous amounts of tweets saying really don't want to be at Justin.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.000]   That's the last thing you'd ever want to be in life.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.360]   They're thinking they'll get it.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.400]   We should mention, we should say hello to Jenny Giardin, by the way, who is.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.400]   Love her.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.400]   I've heard about it.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.400]   I've heard about it a lot.
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.400]   Twit many times.
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.400]   It's wonderful commentary.
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.400]   I hear technology.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.320]   It's discovered a lump in her breast some months ago.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.320]   On Twitter live before the world.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.320]   And was very public about it.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.880]   As you were, Drew, I think in the ways you kind of led the way for that.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.720]   She has since undergone treatment and I think she's in good shape.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.080]   But we will find, you know, she's got radiation and chemo.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.680]   Just recently, surgery.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.720]   And she's promised that she will come on the show so she's feeling.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.360]   She went deep in the process that like nobody else has ever had in a public.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.920]   That would be, that was Jenny.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.920]   A couple of days ago, she had a picture on Twitter of her tumor.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.920]   Right.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.360]   She got all of her own imaging and everything and all those files.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.720]   I think actually they gave her the wrong ones and there is a, yeah.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.720]   There's a whole story.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.720]   It's great.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.720]   That would be a good one.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.880]   We'll ask her when she was in the midst of somebody else's bowels before she was discovered.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.840]   Anyway, we wish you the best Jenny and get better.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.240]   And I actually think she's really come through this beautifully.
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.240]   She's just a man.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.240]   And changed so many lives.
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.280]   Like there are so many people that are like, I went and got a test because you spoke up
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.280]   about it.
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.720]   Well, I remember when she went in for the mammogram, she said, we found a lump.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.600]   I'm going to go in for a mammogram and I'm going to tweet this.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.720]   Well, she went in for a mammogram because her friend was just diagnosed.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.720]   Right.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.720]   Oh, that's right.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:31.720]   It wasn't a lump.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:32.720]   It wasn't a lump.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.120]   She just, she just went in like, and she went in, it was kind of relaxed.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.120]   Yep.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.120]   But she tweeted it.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.640]   And finding the cancer, it was very dramatic.
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.400]   And she said before she was going to do it and then by God, she held to it.
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.400]   Oh, no.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.400]   And it was amazing.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.400]   Okay, enough.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.120]   Enough about cancer, darn it.
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.320]   This week in cancer.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.320]   It's week in cancer.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.320]   It's week in cancer.
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.320]   Well, it happens to us all.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.320]   There's many doctoral dissertations.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.760]   It's great to be able to raise money not only for education to find it quickly, but
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.760]   to raise money to, you know, make the treatments better and ultimately, you know, find cures
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.160]   for it as much as you can.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.760]   So Apple has done something I think is kind of reprehensible.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:11.680]   I wouldn't mind talking about, but we got Google I/O to talk about.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:12.680]   And there's a lot.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.680]   You were there, Drew Wright.
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.680]   I was.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.680]   Did you go, David?
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.680]   I didn't.
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.680]   I have a lot of friends that went, Jeff couldn't.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:22.520]   We were here covering it, but Jason from Jason Howell from All About Android went.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.320]   So did Gina Trapani from this week in Google.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.320]   She helped us with the coverage.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.320]   Kevin Marks helped us.
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.320]   Kevin Marks was me.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.320]   Did you know that?
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.640]   I gave him my driver's license in a badge.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.640]   And he looks enough like me.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.240]   I think he got away with it.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.640]   The accent is what we're going to do.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.840]   We got permission from Google.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.360]   Don't worry, we didn't hood wink anybody.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.840]   A record number of press there this year.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.840]   Yeah, you know why?
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.000]   They gave away a lot of crap.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   We'll talk about that.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.600]   Google I/O is one of the hardest conferences to get into.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.760]   6,000 people.
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.200]   It took 24 minutes to sell out, I think, where it was the official time.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.200]   400 press.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.440]   But you know why?
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:01.040]   Because everybody who went got a swag bag that was pretty much unbelievable.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.000]   It's hard to say about $1,100.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.760]   But then we spent it all, more than all, on this.
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:14.800]   And I'm going to tell you what this is all about and why it's worth $1,500 in just a
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.800]   moment.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.120]   But first, a little word from our friends at Citrix.
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.440]   If you need to, hey, vacation time's coming up.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:27.160]   And if you're a business owner, if you need to kind of stay in touch with what's going
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.760]   on at work.
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:32.600]   If you want to just go home early or take a day, extra day off, maybe you'd like to tell
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.440]   a commitment, this is the solution for you.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:37.600]   It's called go to my PC from the folks at Citrix.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.160]   You know, if you took one day off a week and didn't go into work but worked at home,
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.360]   you didn't go to my PC.
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:47.120]   20% less gas, 100% less wear and tear in your brain.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.560]   I think this is just a great solution.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:55.640]   And it sure is fast, easy, and most importantly, very secure for Mac or PC.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.960]   You can work on any program.
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:01.440]   You can send and receive email, access any file on the network, anywhere, even on the
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.760]   go, even on your iPad or iPhone.
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:09.720]   And that is a wild thing to be working on a Windows PC from an iPhone just as if the,
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.720]   but you know what the Reddit display, the desktop is actually right there.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.520]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.520]   It's a real lifesaver.
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.760]   If you're away from the office, if you're planning a vacation, actually it's a big time
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:18.760]   to do it.
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.760]   30-day free trial.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.440]   Before you go on vacation, visit go to my PC.com.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.760]   Click that try at free button.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.760]   You do this on the computer.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.800]   You want to access.

[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.160]   with the email.

[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.920]   And it's free for 30 days.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.640]   Visit go to my PC.com, use the offer code TWIT, and we thank Citrix for their support.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.800]   So swag.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.800]   You've got some of it.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.920]   This is the Nexus 7 phone, actually, women.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.320]   The Nexus phone is the first thing they gave you.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.880]   That's kind of not such a great thing because it's old.
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.600]   It's a whole six months old.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.920]   And there's no one that you can't buy anymore.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.920]   Oh, yeah, that.
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.920]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.920]   I've got one.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.920]   It's a nice phone.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:29.920]   It's a good phone.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:30.920]   You know what?
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:32.920]   After they gave it away, I revitalized my old one.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:34.920]   Jelly Bean.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.920]   Jelly Bean is nice.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:36.920]   With butter?
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.720]   Jelly Bean on the Nexus phone.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.600]   Yeah, it comes with jelly bean.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.600]   And on the 7.
[00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.800]   You won't get the upgrade for a while if you've got it from a carrier because the carriers
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.200]   are kind of holy.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.200]   Well done.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.200]   Hold on.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.480]   You don't need a new operating system.
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.040]   But is jelly bean nicer?
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.040]   True.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.040]   It's nice, see.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.600]   But I didn't get to use ice cream sandwich all that much because of the carriers.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.600]   Right.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.000]   I've jumped a version.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.260]   So some people that have gone in-depth with ice cream sandwich say there's some nice
[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:04.840]   tweaks there, speed, stuff.
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.320]   How many of you in the audience were here for Google I/O?
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.600]   Is that a good, goodly number?
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.760]   No, just three, four.
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:12.760]   What do you think?
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.200]   You feel like jelly bean is faster?
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.200]   Can you tell?
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.200]   Yes.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.200]   You can see the difference.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.200]   All right.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.200]   So if you feature this from a user perspective-
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.560]   Of a jelly bean.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:24.560]   Google now is unbelievable.
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:27.400]   Let's talk a little bit about Google now.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.400]   Okay.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.120]   So at the keynote.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.120]   Right.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.880]   So tell me what Google now is.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:39.440]   So Google now is just pulling all of your information together and trying to make suggestions
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.760]   to you and make it an easier springboard to do things.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:43.760]   So like is it a search?
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.920]   Like you use it as a search tool?
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.720]   It's a high-profile search tool.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.720]   And it's a word.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.200]   Let me just bring it up.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.480]   So it's a program that you run or no?
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.480]   It's constantly running.
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.480]   Okay.
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.520]   So let's look at it here.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.240]   This is Drew's Nexus 7.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.880]   So it's got a pretty interface.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.840]   It gives you, it says what you're doing, which is kind of interesting.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.840]   So it's showing-
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:09.000]   So if I look for the reaction, your calendar, bring it up, I can set up a place as a home.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.320]   You've got your score for the cubbies giant or reds giants.
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:13.320]   You can say Google.
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:15.960]   How did it know to put that there?
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.760]   Same data and just data about me that-
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.800]   Because everything's ties my Google account.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.800]   This is where-
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.720]   So it knows you're like a cub's fan, so it's going to pop up the cub's score.
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.040]   Well in this case giants, yeah.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.040]   But giants come.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.040]   I'm sorry, giant.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.040]   So it puts the-
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.040]   No, no, I'm not.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.040]   No, I'm actually a Phillies fan.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.040]   So it's location based.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.280]   Well, this is what they said.
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:36.160]   And this is where I thought there was a little bit of a tinier at the Google I/O conferences
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.520]   saying, "Hey, Google now, it's great.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:42.400]   It knows based on your previous searches, it knows what to put up in here."
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.680]   If you have that feature turned on.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.160]   But isn't that kind of creepy?
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.680]   Well, now we're going to go to the creepy world.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.680]   Let's go creepy.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.680]   Let's go creepy.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.680]   It's okay.
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.760]   No, but Jeff see, okay, you defend this.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:56.320]   I think you defend this because you're opting into it and it has value.
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:00.880]   When I met with the Google people in Munich who handle privacy stuff in the front line
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.080]   of privacy, they get all kinds of crap about Street View.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:08.160]   They got none zero, no complaint about Google Priority and Box.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.160]   Why?
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.160]   Because it gives you value back.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.800]   So I saw somebody's blog post this week that said that Google now had said, "Hello,
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:19.520]   you have an appointment this far in advance with traffic the way it is right now.
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.280]   You better leave right now."
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.280]   That's real value.
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.280]   You don't have that creepy.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.280]   You don't have that creepy.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:26.280]   Oh, no.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.280]   Define creepy.
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.960]   Okay, I agree with you.
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.000]   I understand and I agree with you that you're opting in.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.440]   This is something you want.
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.400]   What I'm really saying is Google needs to be thinking a little harder about how it states
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.400]   this stuff because it's--
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.400]   Why did it only be creepy?
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:44.720]   It's why it does it and how it does it and give you options at every position so the
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.640]   results you can choose to or not.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:52.720]   But the value potentially is so great that it's really the extreme of where we're headed.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.240]   And take away the idea.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.960]   I think mobile is an overused word and it's not about mobile.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.280]   It's about knowing you.
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:05.240]   And if the device and the cloud and the service know you and can deliver you value on that
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.080]   basis, that's the promised land.
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.040]   Well, and I--
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.040]   The promised land.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.160]   Okay, I said it was creepy, but I looked at it and I said, "Well, that's neat and I'm
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:16.360]   looking to see if I can put it on my Galaxy S3 and I can't because you have to have
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.360]   that jelly bean."
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.360]   Right.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.360]   Oh.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.360]   I don't--
[00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:21.360]   It's creepy, but I want it.
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.360]   Right.
[00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.280]   Well, I think there's privacy policies in place.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.200]   I mean, if you're keeping-- I mean, I saw you had a to-do list because you're a Google
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.200]   calendar.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.240]   Now, like, they have a privacy policy that they don't look at that.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.360]   They can't look at that.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.440]   It's encrypted.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:39.720]   If the biggest subpoena in the planet ever happened, somehow you get in there.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:43.120]   But in general, like anything you're keeping on Google documents is private and secure.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:47.360]   And even if there's ads that come up to the side of, you know, in your Gmail, that's all
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.600]   algorithmic basis and there's no people involved with it.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.640]   So in a way, like, I don't know, I kind of like as creepy as, you know, bigger companies
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:58.080]   get quite frankly and you can-- you have all the conspiracy theories you want.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:01.920]   I'm kind of kind of trusted that my privacy is pretty decent at Google.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.440]   And I think my privacy is a ton better Google than it is at Facebook.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.440]   All right.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:10.040]   Let me try some samples and see if you would find-- how far?
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.040]   So what if-- and I love this.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.680]   This came from the next guy in our chatroom.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.680]   OK.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.600]   What if it said, oh, here we go.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.000]   You're 48.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.120]   I'm going to make an appointment for a colonoscopy for you.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.400]   Would that be creepy?
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.360]   It could save your bloody life.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.360]   No, right.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.400]   I mean, Google eats-- eats data for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.400]   That's what it is.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.480]   What if it said, hey, you ought to get an appointment?
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.640]   That would be kind of creepy.
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:37.000]   Listen, I wrote a post about my colonoscopy.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.400]   See, I have so many different diseases.
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.120]   I have to predict me that I should have trusted Dr. Google.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.320]   I woke up last Sunday at 11 in the morning.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.320]   I had a new pain.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:47.320]   I went online.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.680]   I said, and I'm a hypochondriac.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.680]   So I thought I had--
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.680]   I never thought I had it.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:52.680]   I thought I had it.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.400]   I've had it up and up to me on my left side lots of times.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.400]   So it's on the right side.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.400]   It's on the right spot.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:57.840]   I should have gone to the hospital right then.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.840]   I didn't.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.680]   I waited until I was there at 730 that night.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.680]   As a result, it burst.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.840]   Now Google had said, and a feedback loop, and said, well, tell us why you're looking
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:07.840]   for this.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:08.840]   Wow.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.440]   Say, ouch, when that happened?
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.440]   Hey, asshole.
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.440]   You should get a hospital.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.440]   I called the hospital.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.240]   I said, you know, I got a pain on my left side.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.440]   And the woman said, I swear.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.440]   Yeah?
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.440]   What do you want me to do about it?
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.440]   Well, that's healthcare in America.
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.160]   That's that side manner right there.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:28.160]   So I will take-- and so people said, and I wrote about this post, people said, yeah,
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.520]   Google knows more about me than my doctor does.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.240]   I have more trust in Google than I do in my doctor.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:37.440]   Now, and Google didn't feedback all kinds of grapefruit diets, or, you know, don't
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:39.440]   I must take peppers for your cancer or diet?
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:40.440]   Sure.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:46.240]   It fed back WebMD and Wikipedia, which is OK, and NIH and Mayo.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:49.480]   And it gave me information that I was the idiot who didn't go in soon enough.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.480]   Right.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.080]   And if Google Health had really happened and had known why I was searching-- why are you
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.880]   searching for this, Mr. Jarvis?
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:55.880]   Hmm.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.840]   You know, let's talk about this, Jeff.
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:03.360]   So I would agree, as long as it's opt in and you're explicitly choosing to participate
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:04.360]   in this system.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.360]   Right.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.280]   So that's the case where there wasn't an opt in.
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:12.160]   Facebook recently changed everybody's email to at facebook.com.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.160]   Which--
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.160]   No opt in for that.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.240]   Which they kind of warned that they were doing.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.240]   In April, I--
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.240]   Yeah, God.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.600]   They did what they always do.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.680]   And I'll almost say that if I was Facebook, I would have done it the same way.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:28.160]   So what they do is that they roll out a feature, whether it's a privacy-related thing, or
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.240]   whether it's part of your profile.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.720]   They want everyone to use it.
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.480]   So they auto-opt people in.
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.840]   The majority of the people keep it.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:35.840]   They apologize.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:36.840]   They probably plan the apology.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.720]   They said, hey, we're really, really sorry.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:43.240]   As a result, more people are going to be using at Facebook for their email and they would
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.280]   have never been able to have that kind of adoption.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:47.640]   It's a really crappy way to do it.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:51.360]   But I'm pretty sure that they opt everyone in and apologize later.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.640]   It's kind of like, you know, that's how they do it.
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:56.480]   Ask for permission or apologize later.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.480]   Right.
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.240]   And they got more of what they wanted.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.680]   And I bet you they have no regrets.
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.680]   Wow.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.680]   Right.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.720]   And a lot of people's reaction was, oh, God, this is crazy.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.720]   How could they do this?
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.200]   And then you see, they plan at the seed months ago that they were doing this.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.840]   I'm not saying there's a right or wrong maneuver, but like you said, I mean, you have that
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.800]   many users and you're going to, that's how Facebook does it.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.800]   But you see the complaint.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.800]   Just do it.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:20.640]   Because for instance, on my iPhone and Android phone, I have my contactless syncing with
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.640]   Facebook.
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:26.800]   So everybody got their email replaced by at Facebook.com.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:32.080]   Now that's my fault because I did that, but there's a lot of people that act as your
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.080]   directory to your friends.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.080]   My mistake.
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.080]   It is a less effective directory.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.040]   I didn't realize when you rejoined Facebook, you joined in that hard.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:41.400]   Oh, I joined a big, I jumped in.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.520]   Well, and you know, and I was looking at a guy, oh, you don't have no one's full name.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:50.720]   He sent me a tweet saying, Hey, I'm quitting Facebook because of this, because I think
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.720]   this is finally going over the over the edge of photographer.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.440]   You know, I can't quit Facebook because I realized once I quit it the first time, this
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.720]   is where the stories are.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.720]   I got it.
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.720]   My job requires it.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.400]   Now, if I were a private citizen, would I do it?
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.400]   I might not.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.600]   On the other hand, I get huge benefit out of Facebook.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.200]   Don't we all stay in his head, Fred?
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.840]   I mean, Facebook is literally what the Yellow Pages should have done.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:16.360]   And if the Yellow Pages got in their business together, going online and did things, Facebook
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:24.440]   is an absolute utility that is this day in ages Yellow Pages or the personal contact,
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.600]   you know, contact book.
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:30.160]   Everything's stored there and it's social.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:37.160]   But you know, whether people use it a lot or don't use it a lot, I do some creepy stuff
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.400]   on my screen here.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.040]   This is my new email address.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.120]   And I actually did what life hacker had an article on how to turn this around.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:48.960]   I did it and it still says my email is leogealaportisfacebook.com.
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.640]   Now, if you send me something at that address, I don't even know where it goes.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.640]   Right.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.640]   90% of my--
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.640]   That's the issue.
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.040]   It's because people were, I saw one case of somebody who used it for business emails,
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.640]   but sent emails to somebody and they went in there.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.640]   Yeah.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.640]   And what anybody know where they were.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.080]   And as always, it's about surprise.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.880]   Surprise is stupid.
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.080]   Since it goes to Facebook messages, apparently.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.680]   Well, yeah, it's a challenge.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.280]   Some people say they haven't gotten any of these messages.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:17.840]   Well, and the thing that remember about Facebook messages is it has its own spam filter,
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.720]   which I don't really trust Facebook with spam.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:24.400]   I trust Google and Gmail because they've been doing it since I launched what eight, nine
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.400]   years ago with email.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:30.400]   Now, Facebook is new to email and messages, but if you check that spam area, you'll find
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.640]   messages you'll be very shocked that it got there.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.640]   And there's no reason why--
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:34.640]   There's no spam filtering.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:39.000]   Well, there is, but they kind of hide where the spam goes.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.440]   And there's no filtering or controls on why it went there.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.440]   That's weird, Leo.
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.440]   I'm looking at your page right now.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:50.360]   I think we're friends, but it won't show me even that email.
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:54.320]   I bet you it's because he has his privacy settings to not display email to his friends.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.880]   I said, well, no, wait a minute.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:58.880]   I said it.
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.920]   OK, maybe because I-- so what it said was--
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:01.920]   I got a--
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.720]   Because I was just going to do a test and send you an email.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:12.480]   I have this set only me, only me, and then this should be public.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.920]   And this is friends.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:15.920]   So you should see it.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.680]   So you've already done too much thinking.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:18.680]   Like that's what--
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.840]   This is a setting to a user.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:20.840]   Yes.
[00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:21.840]   Yeah.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.840]   So you should see it.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:23.840]   I don't know why you don't see it.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.760]   It's supposed to be there.
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.520]   It's set to friends.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:28.520]   All right.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.520]   All right.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.520]   OK.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:31.520]   That's two.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.520]   Here's one more.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:35.960]   I'll let Robert Scoble describe it to you.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.960]   Oh boy.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:43.360]   In fact, they got f***ing spammy on my frickin' calendar and started pushing hundreds of
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:44.880]   s*** on my calendar.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.040]   I am so pissed off.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.200]   Over the freaky line with Scoble.
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.360]   It's worse than the freaky line.
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.200]   How many are there with the Scoble?
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.200]   Did the event--
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.640]   The event thing is spam the s*** out of my calendar.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:27:01.240]   I thought that they had access to my calendar to put my s*** on my calendar.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.880]   That's my calendar, don't touch it.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:10.360]   They put hundreds and hundreds of events that people put on my calendar automatically
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.560]   without my approval, without my approval.
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:13.560]   It goes up my frickin' calendar.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.200]   Straight on the s*** calendar.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:19.560]   That is, of course, from the Gilmore gang.
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.960]   Thank you, Steve, for letting us play that clip.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.360]   We actually didn't ask, but I think you don't mind.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.280]   The chat of Brilliant Java Blipping.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.880]   Can we ask, please, some of the audience to do an auto-tune remix of that?
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.480]   I think there are remixes and I think it's just begun.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.760]   This was a couple of days ago on the Gilmore gang.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:39.640]   Now, what he's talking about is a new feature Google also announced at Google I/O called
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:45.560]   Events, which is essentially E-Vide or Eventbrite or an Invitation System on Google+.
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:46.560]   It's nothing spectacular.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.560]   It's nice.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.560]   It's pretty.
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:52.880]   It's a cool feature, which is when you have an event in Google+, you can make it a "party"
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.880]   I think they call it.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.880]   And so, if that, I lie to you.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.480]   And so, people that are at an event, they can start putting photos in on it.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:04.400]   And this, what this solved is, at my wedding, I always thought about doing photos.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.880]   Everybody take photos with digital cameras or whatever, and then you toss in one feed.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:08.880]   It's like, how do you do that?
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.760]   They're flicker with tags or something like that.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.200]   But yeah, it's literally like every photo you take while you're in party mode goes to
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.200]   the stream.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.800]   It's not just about by photographers and most popular.
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.440]   It's really good.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.440]   All right.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.440]   It is color-esque.
[00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.440]   And it's pretty.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.360]   They have a really nice template.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.560]   I mean, I think they did a nice job.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:33.000]   If you just look at mine, you could see that I have a few invitations as to just the few.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Just the few.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.560]   They started pouring in the minute Google announced this.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.960]   And I have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of invitations, many of them
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:42.960]   have now expired.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:49.280]   Now, fortunately, I had already found this, I think it's frankly, it's a mistake in Google
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.280]   Calendar.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:53.440]   The default in Google Calendar is when somebody invites you to something, just add it to the
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.480]   calendar, whether you accept or not.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.000]   Go into your calendar settings and change that.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.440]   So it only gets added to your calendar when you accept.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.440]   That's how it should be set.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.360]   And apparently, Robert has it set the same way.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:09.640]   I used to get, because my Gmail account is just my last name at Gmail, a reported Gmail.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:12.480]   It's apparently a lot of French people are something named La Porte.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:16.680]   I don't know, because I get invitations to a lot of French parties, to dentist's events,
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.680]   all sorts of crap.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.280]   And so I had to turn that off.
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.160]   And that happened months ago.
[00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.520]   So I understand what happened to Robert, but it really is his settings.
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:25.520]   Yeah.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:29.640]   And I think, I mean, we'll talk, probably talk about it later, what Google's actually doing
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.640]   with Google Plus.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:34.960]   And it's making all of their products more social like it's infusing.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.280]   So it is still very new.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:38.280]   And it's probably, I mean--
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:43.080]   Vic Conjotra in there and one of the interviews at Google I/O said, oh, it's not Google Plus?
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.160]   It's not even a social network.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.600]   It's not a social network.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.600]   It's Google.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.360]   He said, this is what Google is from now on.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.360]   This is the--
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.840]   It's aimed at for a year.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.160]   What the hell does that mean?
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.240]   And go back to Google now.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.160]   This is where it comes full circle, right?
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:00.240]   Google, and I've said it again and again and I say it on Twig is that Google is looking
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.440]   for signals about you.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.040]   Facebook is looking for signals about you.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:06.800]   Who you are, where you are, what you want to do, what you know, what you don't know.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:12.880]   And when it has those signals, it can deliver back hyper personal services to you.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.480]   And that's what's happening right now.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.040]   I mean, they've been saying this for a year since it launched.
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:24.000]   And before I/O, when I sat down with Vic and Bradley, they said the same thing.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.800]   It's a social layer.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.960]   It's a transformation that companies gone through within the past year and the way they
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:34.560]   do business with everything, the way they're handling their developers.
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:38.200]   And YouTube's becoming way more social, which is smart on their part.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.720]   And they're not freaking out about user base or numbers.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.480]   And Google has a lot of users.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.960]   And they're also not freaking out about how long people spend in the stream.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.000]   It's like 12 minutes now and they're like, we're fine with that.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   That's cool.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.520]   That's not very long compared to say Facebook where people may spend an hour or two.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:56.520]   If you're a Google+ user, which they're saying, they're working on making all their users
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:31:01.160]   Google+ users, they're always using Google+ then, whether doing a search.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.880]   Now they have social search, which everyone freaked out about.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:09.160]   Oh my gosh, this social search, that's an invasion, which you can turn off.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.520]   I like Google+ initially.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.680]   I like Buzz initially.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.040]   I want it to be something great.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:16.040]   I just don't-- it's not so compelling to me.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.600]   But I guess it doesn't matter.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.200]   You're saying they don't care if I spend any time at Google+.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:24.120]   No, because technically, if you're using a Google product and you're logged in and you
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.760]   have a Google+ account, you're always using Google+.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:27.560]   It's not as--
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.880]   And it's not as important.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:33.200]   Just because you go to plus.google.com, that's just the page.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.320]   Drew, that's a really good point.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.480]   Same as if you never go to Google.com.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.440]   You're using Google search all over creation.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.880]   If you're using it in Chrome or through Firefox.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.160]   One of the things that I know Gina Trapani was hoping for, many developers are hoping
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.520]   for, was an API, a right API to Google+.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.560]   And they did an interesting thing.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.480]   They did actually create a right API.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.480]   But it's a little weird.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:56.480]   It's called history.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:02.480]   And it lets third parties, like let's say, four square, a pump your previous four square
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:05.640]   check-ins into your Google+ and in effect, they created a timeline.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.800]   Nobody knows this, but Google now has timeline.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:08.800]   Right.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:09.800]   History, right?
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:10.800]   History.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:11.800]   History.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.400]   But the key difference here is that it puts control in the hand of the user so that it
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:21.040]   feeds this stuff into Google+ for me to have, I can then choose what to share on.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.040]   I like that.
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.040]   Right.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:28.240]   And so as I forget which story was, it's in the rundown, they added friction back to
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.240]   frictionless sharing.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:30.240]   Right.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.240]   Thank you.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.240]   Which is great, right?
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:36.720]   The friction says that I get to decide whether I want to take these things that are conveniently
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:41.160]   there for me now, very easy for me now, and choose to share them specifically.
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:42.560]   And I like that.
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:45.080]   You're probably talking about Mike Elgin's article in which he--
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.080]   Thank you.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:52.720]   He says-- and I'm waiting for somebody to do this, but I like the idea, and you're absolutely
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.720]   right.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:57.520]   If it's not automatically public, and this is why Facebook and Google are very different,
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:00.000]   Facebook's default is always kind of public.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Right?
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.680]   It used to be always private, and it's flipped at some point.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.480]   No, it's not really true either.
[00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.480]   All right.
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:10.880]   Well, if you turn on sharing on Spotify, everybody sees what I'm listening to, and I'm
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.560]   kind of embarrassed lately.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:15.120]   It's public to an audience, which are your friends.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.120]   Right.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.920]   Or if you turn on subscriptions, anybody who freaking wants it.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:24.160]   Well, you can be as transparent as you want with all of your history in Google, and they'll
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.160]   allow you to delete it.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.560]   They'll say that they'll delete anything you want.
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.560]   I like to do that.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:29.400]   I turned on-- this is about as creepy as it gets.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:33.040]   I had Google attitude on my phone, and I decided to just leave it on.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.040]   I do, too.
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.800]   And I know, but I also decided to let Google record the history of it, knowing that I
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:37.800]   can delete it.
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:41.760]   But it's neat, because after a month long period of time, I saw everywhere I went at
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:46.600]   every time of the day, and I happen to not be creeped out by it, and I know that if I
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.200]   am creeped out by it, I can turn it off, and I can delete the history.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.200]   And it's not public.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.400]   And if I'm doing anything illegal, I'll pause it for a while, and then turn it back on.
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.160]   This is the exact reason why I use 4-square.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.320]   I don't use 4-square to get mayor ships and badges and all that stuff.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.400]   I literally love going back and seeing where I was two years ago.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.400]   I'm using Time Hop.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:04.400]   I get the emails of like, what--
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.400]   I like Time Hop.
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.400]   --with the last year's--
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.400]   Isn't that fun?
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.400]   That's freaking awesome.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:11.960]   I check in on 4-square instead of using path to check me in on 4-square, because I like
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:15.200]   to have 4-square say, "You haven't been here in this much time."
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.480]   And I like seeing that screen.
[00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:20.520]   But I learned that you can go back open 4-square, and you can click on your check-in, and it'll
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.680]   give you that same information.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:22.680]   Okay, cool.
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:24.720]   So this is the latitude history.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.320]   This shows all the check-ins.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:30.560]   It shows them on a map, goes back months.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.280]   You can do your location history.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.280]   You just shared that with everyone.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.280]   I know.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.280]   I don't care.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.280]   I'm like you.
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.280]   I'm like, you know, look at this.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.280]   This is shows all the--
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.280]   That's pretty fun.
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.280]   You can play it.
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.280]   It's back and forth from your house.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.280]   You can play it.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:43.280]   Yeah, basically.
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.280]   My life is very dull.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.280]   It goes back and forth.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:48.280]   You're back and forth.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.480]   But I think this is very interesting.
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.480]   It's deep.
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.480]   That's one day.
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.480]   Let's show it larger.
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.480]   Let's show it 30 days.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:35:01.600]   And so now, you know, now Google can tell you not only does it think you should have
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.320]   a certain type of medical check-up, it'll tell you where to have it at because it knows
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.320]   where to run.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.320]   It knows where you go.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.040]   It's very cool stuff.
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.720]   It's actually following you all the time.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.680]   In fact, I was kind of sad.
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:14.080]   I got a new phone and I forgot to turn this on.
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.080]   I got a new phone.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.080]   I didn't turn it on.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:18.080]   So I have a whole gap, a month gap.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.080]   Oh my gosh.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.080]   I didn't go anywhere.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.080]   Go anywhere.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.080]   You just sat there.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.080]   You just sat there.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.080]   You just sat there.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:28.120]   Mike says he thinks of Google Plus history as an expansion of instant uploads.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:30.440]   Instead of uploads is that thing where you take a picture.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.440]   All the pictures are automatically uploaded to Google Plus.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.440]   Not visible.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.440]   They're private.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.440]   They sit.
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.440]   Right.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:37.840]   And then if you want to make it available, you look at it.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:43.520]   It's kind of like an iCloud kind of thing or just, you know, this does it not require
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:46.840]   a huge trust of Google?
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:51.440]   But Google, if Google violates that trust, Google is screwed as a business.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.440]   Right.
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.440]   Right.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:57.880]   These are all these companies want to be the one that hosts all of your data and information.
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.800]   That's what they want at the end of the day, right?
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.200]   And the worst thing they could possibly do is do something wrong with it because if everybody
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.880]   jets, then they lose.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:08.680]   So I've got a, you know, I've been using Gmail for years and years and years.
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:12.000]   I'm not going to move to another email address that would be horrific.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   Right.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   And Google knows that.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.160]   So this is an API.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.680]   And I think this isn't actually done right.
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:19.680]   This is what this was.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:26.080]   It's what you don't want is about 800 Google plus apps, which is what an API in effect.
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:28.160]   That's what people were hoping they've watched what Twitter did.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.760]   Well, look what Twitter is doing and we're going to talk about that a bit there.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:31.760]   They're pulling back.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:35.680]   In fact, some people are saying Twitter is breaking the contract that they had the very
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:36.680]   interesting.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:37.680]   Yeah.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.040]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:43.560]   I also want to talk about this phone because you can't, it's now banned.
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:47.720]   You have a banned phone banned in the USA temporarily.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.520]   And yeah, I'm not, I'm not too thrilled about it.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.520]   And we are going to talk.
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:55.920]   And we're going to talk a little bit about the swag bag from Google IO, including the
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:56.920]   Nexus QL.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:59.480]   I'd like you, we got you a pass, Jeff.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.680]   You just didn't come.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:01.680]   I know.
[00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.080]   I should explain what this is.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:04.080]   More important things to do.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.080]   I teased.
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:10.400]   If I had gone, I'd be in some hospitals and resist ghostills.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.560]   So I am so glad that we have this.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.280]   This is a beautiful box.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.160]   This is a glass brick.
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.160]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:20.680]   The number, it's 737, Google.
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:23.560]   And then a little, here I'll show you a close up here, a little check.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:26.080]   But you know, it's probably easier to see in the other place there.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.720]   Oh, look, you can zoom in.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:28.880]   You are a true professional.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:29.880]   Chad Johnson.
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.880]   That's impressive.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:31.880]   Look at that.
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:32.880]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.880]   It's nice wood color too.
[00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:34.880]   It's amazing.
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.880]   Hey.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.880]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.320]   Look, it looks like an exclamation mark.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:44.360]   Isn't that just looks like the crystal, the crystal knickknacks that they sell with
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.360]   laser edge.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.480]   So you know how much that cost?
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:49.480]   1500 smackers.
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.840]   So who dropped 15 bucks for it?
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:52.840]   Me.
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:53.840]   You did.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:54.840]   When do you ask Jason?
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.160]   Well, next year sometime, it'll be a prototype of course, it's Google Glass.
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:58.160]   And this is the number.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.280]   That's your order number out of 6000.
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.120]   Pretty good work from Jason.
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.280]   He ran right up to the front.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.840]   I didn't think that the stunt that they pulled off was very good for you.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:10.680]   I thought that the stunt was amazing, but I thought it wasn't representative of Google
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:11.680]   Glass.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:12.680]   Right.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.440]   Because we know honestly that takes pictures.
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.000]   But I mean, the stunt was amazing.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   It was cool.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   It was fun to watch.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   Let's describe it.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.400]   So Vicken Dutras talking about Google Plus on day one of the Google IO keynote.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.920]   And all of a sudden, Kanye West comes in.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:26.920]   It's Sergey Brin.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:28.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:29.920]   And he interrupts.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.240]   He says, we got something going on.
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:35.240]   And Vic is like, OK, well, I knew this was going to happen, but OK, go ahead.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.240]   He played well.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.840]   And it was kind of neat.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.560]   He said later he got Taylor Swifted.
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:42.040]   Well, they had a small window.
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.480]   And I think he was ready to interrupt at any time whenever that window dropped right.
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.480]   So they had a Zeppelin.
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.640]   By the way, I was informed it was a Zeppelin, not a blimp.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:49.640]   OK.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:50.640]   They had a separate difference.
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.120]   The difference is it's got a rigid side, right?
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:54.120]   Thank you.
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.360]   You've been talking to Roger Chang.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:58.800]   No, it's because I got to write on that Sanio light ship.
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:38:59.800]   Did you do that as well?
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:00.800]   No, I was invited.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:01.800]   I didn't get the chance to do it.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:02.800]   Oh, tech TV sponsors.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.800]   And that was a blimp or a dirigible.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.960]   They called it a light ship, but I don't-- I think that was maybe a branding thing by
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:09.960]   the people who--
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.960]   So this was a dirigible.
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:14.000]   It was moments about any topic on this.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.480]   It was never been launched.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.480]   This was a Zeppelin.
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:20.560]   It has a rigid skeleton, as opposed to just a balloon, I guess.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:24.640]   And so they had some divers up there wearing the Google glasses.
[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.360]   Like base jumpers in the--
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:27.360]   Right.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:28.360]   They were wearing squirrel suits.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:32.240]   And they also had a pouch with a pair of Google glasses.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:35.000]   That was-- I don't know if that was clear, but the idea was this was going to be a relay
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   race where they would hand the--
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   Yeah, they had a little liver torch.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   Right.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   So they had the pouch.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.840]   The guys-- and we can see in a Google Hangout five jumpers--
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.840]   That was pretty neat.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.840]   --we could see their view.
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:46.840]   It was amazing.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:47.840]   If you haven't seen it, go see it.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.680]   They jump out of the Zeppelin.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:52.360]   And you're seeing the way all the way down now, as it turns out, we found out the next
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:58.480]   day that the way that they get internet access is they had three foot dishes with laser sights
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.480]   on them.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:01.600]   And there's people on the roof aiming at it as people as they go down.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:02.600]   It's the only way they could--
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:05.000]   And they also had some broadband backpacks or something like that, right?
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.760]   Well, I think it was really-- it was this microwave connection.
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:08.760]   So they're coming down.
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.920]   They land perfectly on the roof.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:12.760]   Could have been really a disaster, but it wasn't.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:13.760]   It's a beautiful day.
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:14.760]   There was no wind in the wind.
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:15.760]   These were definitely trained professionals.
[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:16.760]   I can see them.
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:20.480]   They probably went out and found the best base jumpers, and then they asked the best ones
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.000]   who would be willing to participate in this done, and probably several-- most of them
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   probably said yes.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   Right.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   I mean, they had to get special permission from the FAA.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   Oh, man.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   I'm amazed they were able to get permission.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   And they were able to get permission.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   I--
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   This must have cost them all off.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   It's Google.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   Of course you can.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   They've probably spent a ton of money on it.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   And you know, the city was right to do it because the city looked gorgeous.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.880]   It was really a great thing for Texas, because they jumped.
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:38.960]   They land on the roof.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:43.120]   They hand off the pouch to some guys on a bicycle who also were in glass.
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:44.840]   So now we see their perspective.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:48.520]   They go up and off a ramp and do loop-de-loops, and they land on the roof of the next building
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:53.840]   over, and then they hand off the pouch to a guy in-- two guys in Mountaineering office.
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.760]   They repel down the side of the building.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.760]   One guy goes too far.
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:57.760]   Sergey says, stop, stop, stop.
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:58.760]   We're on the third floor.
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:01.240]   The guy went all the way to the ground.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.640]   But the guy, fortunately, the guy with the pouch stops on the third floor.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.640]   He goes in.
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.800]   He handed off to some more bicyclists who tear through the lobby.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.360]   Was anyone in the lobby when they did that?
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:11.880]   That looked like they were going to kill somebody.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.560]   They were surprised on luckers.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.560]   It was great.
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:16.920]   Tiving out of the way.
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:22.680]   They go up into the conference hall into this keynote and right up onto the stage, and
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.000]   they give the glasses to Sergey, and they don't work.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   But that was kind of funny.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.840]   But the point was, this all was shot with Google Glass.
[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.840]   But you're right.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.720]   We learned it was really a lot of noise about nothing.
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:32.720]   They basically did.
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:33.720]   They showed off--
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:34.720]   Oh, Webcam.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:35.720]   Webcam that you could--
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:36.720]   And then you could--
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:40.640]   I mean, the connectivity they were getting, like you said, was just because they had people
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:43.440]   outside shooting up some kind of a beam to them.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:47.320]   But they showed off a really cool Webcam and what you could do streaming it.
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.520]   And maybe it won't fall off your face while you're free-fucking--
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:50.520]   This is a Webcam.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:51.760]   I think Google Glass is cool.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.880]   But I mean, it's cool because I think it has the potential to be a really neat heads-up
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:55.880]   display and a really neat--
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:56.880]   But that's the key to it.
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.360]   Right, David, that's the key to it.
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.360]   Is that it's going to give you data back.
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:05.200]   We've yet seen no demonstration of that other than a canned one.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:09.640]   They brought people, Joshua Tapolsky, one of them from The Verge, into a room and said,
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:10.640]   "Here, you could put the glasses on there."
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.680]   It's locked to a fireworks display.
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:14.680]   Yeah.
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:19.000]   They don't-- they-- nobody-- the only person who has seen Google Glass work is Gavin Newsom,
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   our Lieutenant Governor.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   Right.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   Right.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   Well, I'm supposed to go up the mountain view soon to check them out.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   So we'll say--
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   Are you?
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   Who they'll say?
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   Okay.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   Please let us know.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   I want to know because--
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   I think it's about it the other day and I was just like, you know, because everybody's
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.200]   caught up in the-- the-- the wow of the plane and I think when you get past that, you can
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.980]   think about this would be great teaching tool for surgeons and doctors, you know?
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:42.980]   It can work.
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:43.980]   Seeing their perspective.
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:44.980]   Of course, it's going to work.
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:45.980]   Is it going to have voice control?
[00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:46.980]   Right.
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:49.680]   Is it going to have-- do you have to have a phone in your pocket?
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.020]   We don't know anything about it.
[00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:52.020]   Right.
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:54.020]   But so they've-- so if you-- you could--
[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:55.020]   So that's why I spent $1,600.
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:58.200]   You can follow project-- you can follow Project Glass on Google+ actually, and they're doing
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:03.360]   a glass sessions where they're showing video of what you can do.
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:06.200]   I mean, hopefully it's open to developers and very hackable.
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.200]   I'm sure--
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.200]   It's interesting.
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:12.040]   I mean, I don't-- I don't think it's like, this is the future of the world and this is
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.120]   the future of Google.
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:17.560]   I think it's yet again, it's like, here's something you could do to get data, capture
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:19.760]   data that Google can display in cool--
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:24.200]   I think it was a clever way to distract from the fact that there isn't really anything
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.200]   to show yet.
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:29.400]   Everybody paid attention to the jumpers and all this stuff.
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:32.400]   I think what they've done is they built the glass--
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.400]   Wasn't a demo.
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:34.400]   They've been able to--
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.400]   Wasn't a demo.
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:36.400]   That's the point.
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:37.400]   It was-- it takes pictures.
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.400]   I think it takes pictures.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.400]   It's got the lens on it.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:44.360]   I also think that you'll be able to-- I think it'll know where you are in time and space
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:49.360]   and be able to look around and have technology that does heads up display type of stuff.
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:52.840]   Theoretically, theoretically, and it sounds dorky and nerdy for the early adopters, but
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:55.440]   you have the glasses on, you're standing in the middle of the street, and it'll tell
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.440]   you that's the name of that restaurant, that's the name of that one.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.960]   And that's not video that they put out originally with it.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:00.960]   It'll get there.
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:01.960]   It's going to be--
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:04.880]   It's going to barely work and it's going to be super nerdy for early adopters and it's
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:09.400]   not going to be functional for your life, but down the road, it'll get there, I think.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:13.920]   This is the key to this is that I think this is this versus Siri.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.720]   This is eliminating the device from the interaction.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:21.480]   It takes the last mediator out between you and the world so that you can have a voice
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:26.880]   command or a simple command to the glasses to say, "Tell me what that is and tell me
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:31.160]   what the special is today," whatever, and it feeds back to you in a way that doesn't
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:33.640]   require you to be looking down into a phone.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:36.600]   I have high hopes for it, but we don't.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.440]   I mean, we've seen enough 3D.
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:42.400]   Well, the folks that were walking around with the units, they were tethered to a phone that
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:43.400]   were walking around the--
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:49.040]   Why haven't they shown anybody?
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:53.040]   Maybe the question is, why did they decide to announce this to the world now and it's
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.040]   not quite right?
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:55.040]   Maybe they were just so excited about it.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.040]   Like, we've got to give a teaser.
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:59.560]   Yeah, I thought when they put that original video out with all the like, you know, tell
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.560]   you why.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.560]   It seemed like it was accidentally put out there.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.560]   Surgating is Tony Stark.
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:04.560]   I thought that was--
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:06.800]   I thought Elon Musk was Tony Stark.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.960]   No, no, I think we now know who's Tony Stark.
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.320]   I don't think there's any question, right?
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.800]   Yeah, so Elon Musk has space.
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:17.200]   Maybe somebody else who's not sure other people are working on wearable technology every
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:18.200]   day.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.200]   So, you know, it's--
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.200]   Lots of people are.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:21.840]   Lots of people are farther along.
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:25.800]   The Google's secret project I'm most excited about is the self-driving cars.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:26.800]   Those things are kind of the same.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:27.800]   I agree.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.780]   Microsoft's got, apparently, something that they want to talk about trust called "Fortel
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:31.780]   War" and "Lucky Trust."
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:32.780]   Yeah.
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:35.600]   Well, it's too bad because one of those self-driving cars will get in an accident and the thing
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:40.120]   is it'll get in an accident based on a type of error that a human would make 100 times
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.120]   to one, I think.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.120]   Right.
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.280]   And it'll just bog it down in bureaucracy or something.
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:45.280]   Anyway, it's exciting.
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:46.280]   It's cool.
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:48.080]   And Surgi's got enough money to throw away on a bunch of stuff.
[00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:49.080]   And it's a lot of cars.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:52.880]   But I think if they do it right, and like I said, the way that Google's going, being
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:57.280]   more transparent, open, more social as a company, if they show us what's going on with this
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:58.920]   thing as they build it, great.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:45:59.920]   Awesome.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:00.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:01.920]   And what Google would like to see more.
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:02.920]   I would like to see more.
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:05.520]   Project X, you know, Batcave, and we don't hear about it in six months.
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:06.520]   I would say--
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:07.520]   I'd like to see it.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:08.520]   Project X, Batcave.
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.240]   They should add the Batcave to the end of Project X.
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.240]   The Surgi--
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:14.800]   Well, isn't that what Vivek said he said, I think-- the more and more, I think Surgi
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:16.040]   brain is Batman.
[00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:17.520]   That's what he said.
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:18.520]   Not Tony Stark.
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:20.520]   We're going to take-- you know, choose your comic book here.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.000]   We're going to take a break, come back with more.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.520]   Draw an office here from the next web, Jeff Jarvis from BuzzMachine.com.
[00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:30.200]   And this week in Google in Dayel Prager, I got to find out what David's up to when
[00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.200]   we come back.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:34.800]   Because Revision 3 is no longer in your resume.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:35.800]   It's in the back.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:36.800]   It's in the past of my resume.
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:39.360]   It's a small part of its current.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:40.360]   All right, we'll find out.
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:41.360]   I want to come back.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.360]   We'll ask you about that.
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:45.160]   But as long as we're talking about autonomous vehicles, self-driving vehicles, I want to
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.680]   talk about Ford Motor Company.
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:53.360]   I've asked them many times, when are you doing autonomous vehicles?
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:54.960]   Every time I asked, I get a little more.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:58.880]   And this last time I was talking to Paul Macarenes who's the CTO and Prasada's running
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:01.040]   their Silicon Valley thing.
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.800]   And they said, well, we're slowly getting there.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:06.240]   We're adding-- we've got now-- we're going to have lane detection.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:10.000]   So if you go out of the lane, the camera will detect it and let you know.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.880]   We've got automatic parking.
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:14.360]   We've got bliss, which is blind spot.
[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:19.880]   But more and more, I think, if you go to Ford.com/technology, you can see how much technology
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:20.880]   they're putting into these cars.
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:22.920]   They explain to me, they see the car as a platform.
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:23.920]   The vehicle's a platform.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:27.200]   It just is a computer's a platform, an operating system's a platform.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:32.640]   It's a way-- it gives developers sensors, tools, stuff they can interact with, and a
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.240]   full API so you can write software for this thing.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:37.520]   That's why they're open the Silicon Valley branch.
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:41.720]   Ford now has their first app called MyFord Mobile.
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:44.480]   It's for BlackBerry, Android, and iPhones.
[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.760]   And it is very, very cool.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:53.680]   Now you need-- in order to use this now, you need to have the 2012 electric focus.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:48:00.560]   It will be on the 2013 Fusion, the energy, the focus you can get now at your EV certified
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:01.560]   Ford dealer.
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.400]   And it does some really interesting things.
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:06.200]   First of all, it tells you what's going on with the car, the state of the charge.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:09.640]   You can be in the living room, car plugged into the garage, and you can say, hey, only
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:12.800]   charge at the lowest rates, it'll save you money.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:16.760]   That is actually something that Microsoft did called value charging.
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:19.360]   Is it all electric, or does it also have gas?
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:20.360]   It's all electric.
[00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.520]   There's no engine in there.
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:24.640]   By the way, you haven't driven one of these yet?
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:26.840]   I thought Ford was a sponsor.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:27.840]   They are.
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:29.480]   We didn't have that one.
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:30.480]   So sweet.
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:35.360]   110 miles per gallon E. 76 mile range.
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:38.440]   Charges in two to three hours on the 240 volt charger.
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:44.760]   On the phone, like you could say, on the app, you could say, I leave at 8.30 in the morning,
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:47.600]   make sure the car is 72 degrees.
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:51.240]   And the reason that is because heating and cooling has to be done from the battery, so
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:52.400]   they does it while it's plugged in.
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.600]   So the car is good to temperatures, you leave.
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.320]   And it has also some gamification.
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:01.360]   So it says how much CO2 you save, and you have leaderboards on the Web and the my Ford
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:02.360]   mobile website.
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:03.360]   I have saved.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:05.640]   I am number one in CO2 savings.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:10.480]   To give you eco-friendly routes, it's just very, very cool.
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:16.880]   You can see where all the charge stations are, wherever you're going so you can plug in.
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.640]   I think this is a great example.
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.760]   And I think Ford's doing this to show developers what's possible.
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:22.760]   So take a look at it.
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:27.080]   If he's the best way to do it, you go to your EV Certified Ford dealer, bring your smart
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:31.960]   phone and say, I want to try the 2012 electric focus, and I want to try the my for mobile
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:34.720]   app, and they'll put the app on the phone, and you're good to go.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:37.440]   Or just visit Ford.com/technology.
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:42.440]   We thank Ford for their support of, I can't do this on my 2012.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:45.240]   Did you get one of those that they lend you a mustang?
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:48.360]   We drove a bunch of them, but they don't, you know, you guys would get them for like
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:49.360]   a period of time.
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:50.920]   They come and they let you have them for an hour.
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:56.840]   We would, we'd go shoot all kinds of video, and we had a couple of the guys who were
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:57.840]   still here.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:01.960]   Well, no, they're, they moved from Florida to Dallas, but no, we've got Jordan Dertinger
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:02.960]   and Josh V.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:03.960]   We've got some good people.
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:07.040]   And you know, we have our production and our editorial calendars, and we put for them,
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:08.040]   you know, what are you doing tomorrow?
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:11.600]   I would, you know, we're going to give you the car and just go put a gopro's on it and
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:12.600]   get beauty shots.
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:14.280]   So, so you founded provision three.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.280]   You and Kevin.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:16.280]   Me, Kevin.
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:17.280]   It was just you and Kevin.
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.200]   Jay came in later, but it was really you and Kevin at first.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.200]   You did.
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:24.040]   Well, actually it was more, it was Dan Heward and Kevin who decided, oh, we're doing system.
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:28.240]   Let's do a show called System, which is kind of a hacker show.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.240]   Right.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:33.280]   And then a little bit more project based than the broken, which was how to, you know, social
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:34.280]   engineer people.
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.280]   Right.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:36.280]   It was great stuff.
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:37.280]   I wish they'd still do that.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:40.720]   And so they launched that independent of me.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:45.440]   And then when I got to be friends with, I mean, what I was friends with them and then
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:48.520]   Jay got involved because he thought it was cool and was like, Hey man, you know, there's
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:49.520]   a lot of people watching this.
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:51.240]   Maybe you can, you know, get an audience for it.
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:52.240]   I'll give you $50,000.
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:54.440]   That's also Jay funded it initially.
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:58.520]   Yeah, it was his, but you worked your butt off because it was all Prager for a long time.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:02.560]   So they had that, they, you know, they started a bank account, put the $50,000 in there.
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:07.280]   And then, you know, right as that was going on, like, let's get someone to help, you know,
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:09.880]   from, you know, and every, where every hack kind of person.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:13.360]   So, you know, Prager can produce and he can come up with random, business dev ideas and
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.360]   maybe start selling.
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:16.360]   I had no idea how to sell stuff.
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:20.600]   And it worked early on for us because I think, you know, I think a traditional sales
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:23.960]   person would have been kind of thinking inside the box, right, how that works.
[00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:24.960]   And there was no box for me.
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:25.960]   Right.
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:28.160]   And it wouldn't have worked if I had that because I would have gone after brands and
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:30.760]   agencies who had no budget placed in it at all.
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:31.760]   Right.
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:34.840]   So I just went after people like, Hey, we've got to show that targets the type of people
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:36.200]   that like your stuff.
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:40.040]   How about if we can sell some of your stuff, you give us some money back and then got them
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.040]   to say yes on that.
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:44.280]   Now, of course, we're in a vastly different world where a company like Ford is really
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.280]   smart.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:46.280]   Isn't that amazing.
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:49.320]   And putting money into a budget for digital distribution because you guys broke through
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:50.320]   it a lot of that stuff.
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:52.320]   It was cool.
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:53.320]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:54.320]   Yeah.
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:57.520]   Well, you also proved the ability of podcasts that the unaided recall to advertisers numbers
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:51:58.520]   that got what I wrote about.
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:51:59.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:04.240]   But there's three was phenomenal that 90 some percent of the audience would know that the
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:06.240]   zoom sponsored.
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:09.320]   Yeah, it was cool.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:13.240]   And that was just that was part of the what went into the sales tools is knowing that
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:15.840]   you have you can demonstrate that you have an engaged audience.
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:16.840]   Right.
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:20.800]   And engaged audience reacts to sponsors and absolutely the exact same thing.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:24.880]   How do they relate to all the twitches fast forward a couple of pivots with their vision
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:25.880]   three?
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:29.080]   I know Kevin kind of kind of dial out a little bit J left.
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:30.880]   And then I went to work at dig.
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:31.880]   They all went to work at dig.
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:32.880]   There was a mistake.
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:33.880]   I said, I don't want to do dig.
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:34.880]   I don't want to do it.
[00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:35.880]   You were so smart.
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:36.880]   You did not go over there.
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:38.640]   We were like, you know, we were like the small little sister company.
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:44.400]   And I even remember when when current TV wanted to per current wanted to purchase dig.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:47.480]   And they were, you know, the one of the only two companies that actually put it an offer
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:51.080]   out for dig actually, even though everyone thinks that really offers left and right.
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:54.640]   And, and so current just as a side note later, I'm like, yeah, you can throw in revision
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:55.640]   three.
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:58.240]   I was like, yeah, I just, you know, revision three, like what the hell?
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:52:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:00.240]   Wow.
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.240]   Wow.
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:02.240]   Dodge that boat.
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:04.240]   No kidding.
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.240]   That could have been really bad.
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:06.240]   There were a couple pivots.
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:07.240]   There was a pivot.
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:09.920]   One was the YouTube pivot where you instead of producing your own shows, you started to
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:14.580]   bring in YouTube successful YouTube people and work with them to make their shows better
[00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:15.640]   to build their audience.
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:16.640]   That was a smart move.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:21.440]   And I think also you had some great biz dev and you got in with discovery and discovery
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:24.600]   paid more and more attention and eventually bought revision three just a few months.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:26.960]   It goes for we heard 30 million is that about right?
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:27.960]   Is more than that.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:28.960]   More than that.
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:29.960]   Mm hmm.
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:31.960]   Then another thing.
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:32.960]   I'm still you're happy.
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:33.960]   Then another thing I heard.
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:34.960]   Well, I cry from a heart.
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:37.360]   Yeah, I heard, I don't know how happy I am.
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:40.000]   You had brought, you had brought in on here and you grilled the crap out of them and then
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.800]   you, I don't know, you're like, what the hell?
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:47.640]   Um, we were, we were absolutely thrilled to, you know, they, they ended up purchasing
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:52.720]   the company because they believed in what we were already doing and wanted to be able
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:57.280]   to, you know, have those resources and have a digital arm and even have an office in San
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:58.280]   Francisco.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:00.960]   And then they were also interested and they were interested in which was, you know, flattering
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:03.640]   to us is they have a backlog of stuff that they own.
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:09.080]   They know that our strategy is monetization exclusively via digital and they said, and
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:12.000]   you know, they've got some smart people there, but they said, you know, you guys know that
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   better than us.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.800]   We're interested in, you know, having you guys on the team so that we can understand
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:20.400]   how to better take advantage of what we're currently doing, whether it's for our existing
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.440]   television properties or new things that we're developing.
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:24.480]   And so that was flattering as well.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:28.040]   So well, I think it's also the case that a cable channel needs a digital arm because
[00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:32.280]   they are not allowed by their deals with the cable companies to take their existing content
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:33.800]   and start to put that on the net.
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:37.320]   It's really a touchy subject for the cable companies.
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:40.120]   And so they need to make new content that is net only.
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:44.560]   And I think this is exactly what messed up current, I would argue current should have
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:48.080]   been the first all digital, all online channel.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:53.840]   And I even said that to them way back when, and others did as well, and no, well, no,
[00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:56.760]   they were drawn by the money of the MSOs of the cable operators.
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:01.120]   They also could have been, I think current could have been YouTube quite frankly.
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:04.200]   I mean, they were asking people to send in their stuff.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:08.520]   And instead of putting it online for everyone else to quote unquote, vote up and vote down
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:11.640]   or just to decide what needs to go on TV is like, why don't you just show it?
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:12.640]   Everything to everyone.
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:16.200]   Instead, they made it a cable channel and they got tied the same way that tech TV had gotten
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:17.200]   tied by the MSO.
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:18.680]   And there's a new channel.
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:22.440]   There's a new thing coming out right now from Corey Booker, the mayor of Newark, the
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:26.160]   much below mayor of Newark, that's starting a whole new service that basically I'm told
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:28.440]   is trying to do current done right.
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:29.440]   Interesting.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:30.440]   Just announced yesterday.
[00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:32.760]   What is it about politicians they want to do TV?
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:34.800]   Because Corey's everywhere.
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.320]   That dude saving people from burning buildings.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:39.080]   He's on Twitter.
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:41.080]   He's a comic book.
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:43.600]   Now he's Tony Stark maybe.
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:48.240]   In any event, I hope you guys all got some money out of this.
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:52.280]   I talked to somebody who said founders didn't get as much as maybe the existing managers.
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:54.200]   They wanted to keep some of the existing managers around.
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:59.200]   Well, anytime there's an acquisition, I mean, how come they didn't lock you in?
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:02.640]   Well, they locked in several people and I didn't want to get locked in.
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:06.560]   And I was a little bit surprised, but I mean, I'm surprised at my own thoughts about it.
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:12.720]   But after having worked on and with and for revision three for seven years, and I'd always
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:16.000]   been passionate about being a TV producer type of person.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:22.640]   But I'd also been exposed to so much of the Silicon Valley technology world and the things
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:23.960]   that we're talking about here.
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:25.160]   And then just the startup community.
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:29.720]   And I've made so many friends and learned so many things about running businesses, starting
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:32.720]   businesses, and then having passions about creating products and services.
[00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:33.720]   You're going to follow Kevin's foots.
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:34.720]   No, no, no, no.
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:35.720]   I'm not going to be an investment.
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.920]   I'm not going to be an adventure capitalist.
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:43.000]   But I thought that it would be a good time to, what I enjoy doing most is kind of content
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.320]   and editorial and even being a journalist.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:48.200]   And not that that's what I'm going to focus on, but I thought, so at revision three, I'm
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:52.920]   going to continue doing a couple of productions, but it's fun to not have that be a full time
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:57.280]   job where even as a founder, you feel compelled, this is my full time job.
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:01.960]   I need to be there nine to five at the very, very, very least.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:02.960]   And so right now it's kind of fun.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.960]   I feel like I can work only for myself.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:10.040]   And so at revision three, I'm doing two experiments.
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:15.320]   One of them is I'm playing around with Glenn Mackelhoast, who was the camera guy.
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:16.320]   Blends the guy.
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:21.280]   And we would sometimes be like the two guys behind the scenes that would talk a lot.
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:25.280]   And I think, I don't know, I hope I'm wrong, but I think there's a vocal minority that
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:28.480]   said, hey, you guys could just have similar type of conversations and do that.
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:30.200]   And it's really quite frankly easy to do.
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:31.200]   I'm not easy to do.
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:32.200]   So we have-
[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:33.200]   This is like the one known as hippie glam.
[00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:34.200]   Yeah, hippie glam.
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:35.200]   Hippie glam.
[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.880]   And I told people, hey, we're going to put out a couple of things.
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:39.000]   If you don't like it, we hope you will.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   If you don't like the-
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   Behind the scenes from the-
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   No, we have a hippie glam.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   The feeds.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   We have all the dignity feed.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.560]   So in a way it's like, all right, we have this many subscribers, bam, here's content.
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:49.240]   There'll probably be some haters.
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:50.240]   I hope they're not.
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.240]   We can't just start that way.
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:52.720]   We'll say if you don't like it, we hope you do.
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:56.560]   So quite frankly, it's going to be he and I having some discussions about a few things
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:57.800]   that we're interested in.
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:00.240]   And then I want to bring in a lot of guests.
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:03.800]   So I had a guy named Barrett Lyon on who's going to be on in a couple of weeks.
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:09.720]   And we had him tell his whole history about deleting AOL from being an existing online
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:13.600]   entity and just talking about how his experience and starting CDNs and how that stuff works.
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:15.280]   And then I want to bring on more and more people.
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:16.600]   I thought that would be kind of fun.
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:22.800]   And so it formula was easy because we just, we sit there, turn the camera on and hit the
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:23.800]   red light.
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:27.360]   And then we've got a great guy named Michael Heung who was a fan who was great with Adobe
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:28.680]   Premiere probably wants to shoot and edit.
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.680]   So for me it's spending an hour and a half.
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:31.680]   So you're going to keep doing your content.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.800]   An hour and a half or more a week doing that.
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:37.200]   And then the other big project I'm doing which I haven't mentioned too much or the other
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:41.800]   revision three thing is we shot a bunch of pilot stuff with some high speed cameras.
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:45.440]   And so we're going to do a weekly, a weekly show where there's a story around something
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:49.320]   that involves a payoff of what a high speed camera can do.
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:52.400]   And one of them was I got stung by a scorpion.
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:53.400]   Ow.
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:54.400]   Here.
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:55.800]   Yeah, you did that on a high speed camera?
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:56.800]   You on purpose.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:57.800]   Yeah, it's showing up on the camera.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:59.800]   And it's 1650 frames a second.
[00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:01.200]   But there's a little story arc around this.
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:02.960]   It's not an original original idea.
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:04.240]   It'll be super slow most stuff.
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:08.760]   Or we'll do time lapse or do macro stuff.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:11.880]   Every week there'll be a little story around something like what's it look like when a
[00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:14.520]   scorpion stings somebody but we'll put some story around it.
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:20.400]   And then we'll be doing another one with the house of air with some airless like gold
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:22.400]   metal, Johnny Mosley and some of those people.
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:25.360]   And then the rest of the days of the week we'll just put out cool videos that with those
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:27.280]   sounds like you're pretty well employed.
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:29.280]   You're not really going to have a little three five.
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:30.680]   I don't know, these are two little projects.
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:32.040]   I've got two other things.
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:34.280]   I mean, I could dive into two other things that we're going to come up with.
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:35.280]   What else do you do?
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:36.280]   Let's hear it.
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:37.280]   All right.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:38.280]   I don't want to waste too much time.
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:41.440]   So I'm working with Randy Zuckerberg and helping her build her company.
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:42.440]   Mark's sister.
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:46.880]   So I've been friends with her for a long time and she's got some aspirations and she's
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:48.360]   raising money and she's getting it.
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:51.040]   She doesn't need to raise money but she's raising it anyway.
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:52.560]   And so I'm going to help her build this company up.
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:54.560]   So I'm excited about you know, our advisor.
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:55.560]   Yeah.
[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:57.920]   Well, it's art as a media and now it's art as a studios.
[00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:58.920]   Okay.
[00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:01.120]   I'm at RJZ and she just changed it to art disease.
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:04.520]   So I felt flattered that she had a similar shoulder that dropped the the.
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.720]   No, I should hurt her initials.
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:07.720]   RJZ.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:08.720]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.120]   Dropped the the.
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:15.880]   And then the last the last thing I'm doing is I'm advising a team of a very small team
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.920]   of guys that do an app called Yard Sale.
[01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:22.720]   It's a yard sale dot com but it's an app you can I could take a picture of this mug
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:23.720]   as many as I want.
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:27.280]   Say what it is and say how much I want and it's for sale online.
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.280]   And it's geotag geolocation.
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.280]   It seems like it'd be crazy to read.
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:31.280]   Let's talk about that.
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.600]   I run I work with a bunch of local newspapers.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.600]   Uh huh.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:38.560]   And I've wanted to do just that time and time and time again and there's a business deal
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.560]   to be done there.
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:42.520]   Well, this also is the it'll auto publish to Craigslist as well.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:47.400]   So I can tell that's the absolute fastest way you can put anything on Craigslist.
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:48.400]   Wow.
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:51.080]   So we're going to make that's a good start.
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:54.720]   We're going to we're going to make a run for Craigslist and make a run for eBay.
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.720]   Yeah.
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.000]   And then taking advantage of it.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.440]   You know, you could have it, you know, like a traditional yard sale.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:02.480]   People just hey, who's selling something nearby just want to know what it is.
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:06.680]   Seems like the best way to raise money is to do something that is kind of the neck like
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:10.080]   the flipped like the next Instagram or the next eBay, that kind of thing.
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:14.360]   Because people get it immediately and they go, oh, this is a great idea making those
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.720]   things easier too.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:19.120]   But instead of saying it's just here's the mobile version of it's also, you know, let's
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:22.840]   take advantage of the tools that a mobile phone provides, which is quite frankly right
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:25.720]   now the biggest cool thing is the hyper location, geolocation.
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:30.360]   So I could say anytime someone selling a kitchen item like a mug, I just want to let me know
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:33.400]   a kitchen item within a mile or within five miles or 50 miles.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:34.400]   Right.
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.400]   That is pretty cool.
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:37.320]   And then you've got, you know, all kinds of little biz dev things you could do.
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.240]   You could have them delivered via task rabbit or other.
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:42.920]   I mean, none of that is in place, but you know, there's ideas like that and then payment
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:44.040]   systems and that it.
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:48.560]   So has nothing to do with TV production, which is still my passion, but you know, doing,
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:52.040]   you know, mobile apps and stuff and having something that you can get passionate about
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:55.080]   and excited about, which I'm excited about this is pretty exciting and pretty.
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.080]   That is really neat.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.720]   This looks like a great startup.
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:58.720]   Yeah.
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:01:59.720]   Well, good for you.
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:00.720]   Yeah.
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:01.720]   You're staying busy.
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:02.720]   Busy.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:03.720]   Yeah.
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:04.720]   Good for you.
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.720]   Spent a little of that discovery money and some good places.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.560]   Well, it gives you, it gives you freedom.
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:10.400]   I didn't, I didn't make a ton.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:15.200]   I mean, I made enough that I can, I made enough that I can, I can step back, not worry
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.680]   about, you know, paying my mortgage.
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:20.160]   I can focus on some projects and take a little bit of a risk without, you know, worrying
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.160]   about losing my house.
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:22.160]   Yeah.
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.880]   Makes perfect sense.
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:24.880]   Well, congratulations.
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:25.880]   It's great.
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:26.880]   Yeah.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:27.880]   We're going to move on.
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:28.880]   There is more tech news.
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.440]   In fact, just a bit, I have to talk about this band phone that you have here.
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:36.600]   I want to read you the patent because it doesn't make any sense.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.240]   Makes sense.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:42.400]   When you read the patent, there are four patents that Samsung and Apple are fighting
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.400]   over.
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:44.400]   Right.
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:49.400]   One of them is slide the lock, but the judge focused on one particular patent and said,
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:55.000]   you know what, based on this patent, I'm going to ban the sale of this phone.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.840]   And when I read it to you, I'll let you be the judge.
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.720]   We're going to do that in just a second.
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:01.320]   Squarespace.com before we get any further.
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.320]   You use Squarespace.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.320]   I think you do.
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:05.320]   It's great.
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:06.320]   You use Squarespace.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:07.320]   That's what it is.
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:11.560]   It's about the people who work at Squarespace, who've put together the best hosting ever.
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.240]   You cannot bring a Squarespace site down.
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.240]   We try constantly.
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:15.240]   You can't.
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:16.960]   Go to inside twit.tv.
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:17.960]   That's our blog.
[01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:18.960]   It's not twit.tv.
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:23.440]   Go ahead, all of you, every one of you, and you can't bring it down.
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:28.000]   And the best content management software on top of that.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.760]   So it's everything you need to create a great website.
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:36.640]   They have, by the way, when you buy a year plan, what you should do, you will get your
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:39.960]   domain, the whole thing, the custom domain and everything, all integrated in is just
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.520]   part of the signup.
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:46.080]   So it could not be easier to set up a site to save money.
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:49.240]   And even if you cancel, the site is yours to keep.
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:51.080]   So I mean, it's your domain name.
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:52.080]   So here's what you do.
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:53.080]   Go to squarespace.com.
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:54.080]   Click the green try it free button.
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.080]   You don't need a credit card.
[01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:58.280]   Just your name, your email, the name of your site, and a password.
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:01.440]   For two weeks, you get to use the, whoops, that's the wrong page.
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:02.680]   Let me go back to squarespace.
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:08.880]   You get to use the full Squarespace software, all the iOS and Android apps that let you
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:12.560]   post, update, moderate, check stats.
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.760]   They've got photo galleries.
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:14.760]   They've got forms.
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:15.760]   I love this.
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:18.480]   So you can import your existing data in very easily.
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:23.160]   They support the four big APIs, WordPress blogger, movable type and type pad.
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:28.000]   And when you do this import, everything, not just the blog posts and comments, all the
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.720]   media has moved over, all the URLs continue to work.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.360]   All of your data is there.
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:38.040]   And if you decide to move on, I know you're not, but if you did, you can get it all out
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.040]   again.
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:40.320]   You're never trapped at Squarespace.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:45.400]   And there's probably a bunch of people who used iWeb on mobile me who today are going
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:50.240]   to, uh, oh, oh, oh, yeah.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.040]   Never use the solution that traps you.
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:55.920]   Squarespace lets you move on if you want, but you're not going to want to.
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:56.920]   Here's the deal.
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:00.320]   Go visit, try it for two weeks, then check out the pricing very.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.240]   This is the new pricing scheme they've got.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:05.840]   Eight dollars, build annually for the basic.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:11.160]   I would get the unlimited plan, 16 dollars unlimited pages, unlimited bandwidth, unlimited
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:13.800]   storage, nothing for 16 bucks a month.
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:16.080]   That's everything.
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:19.920]   And the free custom domain name, which is automatically set up 24/7 support, they have
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.520]   some interesting features like audiences.
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.240]   You can have password protected parts of your site.
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:26.440]   You can have people pay, for instance, to say, you know, you're going to get this extra
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:27.440]   thing.
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:31.160]   That's an audience unlimited editors, complete control, form builder, user registration,
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:35.760]   business features, all available 16 bucks a month would build annually and the domain
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:40.280]   name registration and connection for both beginners and experts alike.
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:43.160]   Squarespace is the best solution.
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:44.160]   Squarespace.com.
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:46.280]   If you buy, by the way, use our offer code.
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:47.960]   In the month of July, it's Twitch 7.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:51.000]   It's always the month that Twitch plus the month number.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.680]   So if you're listening in August, Twitch 8.
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:57.720]   But if you're listening in July, well, some people will listen next month, right?
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.720]   Yeah.
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:03.640]   For this month, it's Twitch and the number seven, all one word, and you can get 10% off
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:04.640]   your first purchase.
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.440]   So that makes it even more affordable.
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.440]   Squarespace.com.
[01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:13.080]   I got to find the patent for this.
[01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.080]   Actually found it on the US.
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.520]   While you're looking for it, I can make it patent rammed.
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:18.160]   Yeah, please do.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:21.520]   I think Google, it could be easily just as guilty.
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:27.280]   I think what's happening here is horrible, but it's just an example of how terrible software
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.280]   patents are.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:33.040]   So how many companies do we see doing billion dollar acquisitions for patent portfolios
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.840]   that so that they can use it against their competition?
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:39.880]   Yes, there's articles that show that maybe they're afraid of a lot of these features.
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:47.760]   But Google and Microsoft and Apple will all litigate over patents, guaranteed, and they
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:52.800]   will do it in ways that 99% of all of us think is BS.
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.120]   Well, let me read you the patent you tell me.
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:07:02.840]   So Judge Co said, you know, Samsung had sued seven months ago over the Galaxy Nexus saying
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:04.160]   it violated four patents.
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:07.360]   Judge Co said, you know what, patent 604 is germane.
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:09.960]   I am going to block sales of the Galaxy Nexus.
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:14.400]   Apple, you need to post a $96 million bond in case this is bogus.
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.720]   But for now, we're going to file it.
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:17.600]   We're going to accept this and we're going to file an injunction.
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:21.400]   You cannot sell the Galaxy Nexus in the US based on this patent.
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:22.360]   Now I'm going to read it to you.
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:23.680]   You tell me what this means.
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:24.680]   This is the abstract.
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:25.680]   This is Apple's patent.
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:29.480]   They applied for it in 2004, got it in 2011.
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:35.240]   The present invention provides convenient access to items of information that are related to
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:43.000]   various descriptors input by a user, like a search term by means of a unitary interface,
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.680]   which is capable of accessing information in a variety of locations through a number
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:47.680]   of different techniques.
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:52.000]   In other words, it's like Siri where you'd say search for Drew's hat.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:58.120]   It would look at a variety of locations, a variety of services, maybe a bull from alpha
[01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.400]   and Google or whatever.
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:06.840]   In a unitary surface, this is the quote again, "Using a plurality of heuristic algorithms
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:12.160]   to operate on information descriptors input by the user, the present invention locates
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:15.560]   and displays candidate items of information for selection or retrieval."
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:18.560]   Just like Siri, is this what you are looking for?
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:22.960]   Thus, the advantages of a search engine can be exploited by listing only relevant object
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:26.280]   candidates in items of information.
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:27.280]   That's the patent.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:30.520]   Jesus.
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:32.800]   They basically patented search.
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:36.000]   Well, Amazon patented one-click purchase.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   One-click, there's a physical thing.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   Clicking it once.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   I know, but there's a stupid.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:46.600]   This is a patent for, if I give you some stuff, you show me the results in a page.
[01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:47.600]   Right.
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:50.200]   So basically, nobody can ever make a phone in the show search results ever again, other
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:51.200]   than that.
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:55.360]   Well, if I'm a librarian and I go in and I ask you and you ask me questions and I give
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:00.000]   you back a list of possible choices, if I violated a patent, it's a cool package.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   That's a Q&A.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.440]   You violated it, it's a 604.
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:09.000]   Now I am not, I do, it's unified search, so it's kind of the idea is a one-page variety
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.800]   of sources pulled into one page.
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:16.560]   Well, it's just one of the, I mean, I'm not a lawyer and I don't understand these things
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:19.800]   and I know they run really deep, but at the same time, I mean, it's just...
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:20.800]   Just bugs the hell out of me.
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:21.800]   And right.
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:26.000]   It's huge, this is a great phone that Apple is preventing people from buying and I'll
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.440]   tell you right now, it's not because Apple says, "Well, we patented that."
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:34.680]   It's because Apple is scared to death of the Nexus phone.
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:36.120]   It's better than the iPhone.
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:37.120]   I see that argument.
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:40.000]   I don't know about scared to death, but it's a threat.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000]   Right.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000]   If they thought it was a piece of crap, there's many phones, there are phones, especially
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.560]   Android phones, there's a billion of new ones a day.
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.160]   Also, half of the features, they're gonna be amazing, the new features.
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:50.160]   Right.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:53.240]   I think it was an iPhone and I want a bunch of those features, which, you know, I think
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:54.240]   it was.
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:58.000]   I think the people at Apple should, in a way, if they want to develop things that function
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.440]   similarly, they should be able to, but I bet you that Google might end up suing them
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:04.280]   for copying features that are in a...
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:07.840]   Well, that's the thing, but it comes down to, well, who has enough?
[01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:10.280]   Who's got the real patent portfolio?
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.280]   But these pieces are ever changed.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:15.240]   He doesn't come down to what's good for consumers, what's actual innovation, we are
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:16.240]   wasting...
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.240]   I just heard a number.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.240]   Was it you, Jeff, that...
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.080]   No, Kevin Marks had this number.
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:26.200]   In your place on Twig this week, an estimate of how much is lost each year in patent litigation
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:27.200]   that could be put in.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.200]   And it was billions.
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:29.200]   It was like 24 billions.
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:30.200]   Is there anything we can do?
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:34.200]   I mean, you know, there's a nascent effort to start a boycott Apple movement, but I don't
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:37.000]   want to buy that that's gonna work for a second.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:41.600]   Is there anything that we as the people they supposedly care about the customers can do?
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:45.600]   I think, well, I think, and I don't know if it would work, but I think that the US patent
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:50.360]   office needs to stop granting stupid patents because they all expire eventually if they
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:55.360]   stopped right now because patents are valuable and Google has valuable patents and so does
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.160]   Apple and they can't give those up.
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:01.920]   They're not willing to give those up, but you can start now by stopping the stupid software
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:02.920]   patent.
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:06.400]   He has stopped granting software patents that are stupid now.
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:07.400]   Right.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.400]   Fortunately, Chad has a good memory.
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.400]   You can say that like Chad, it's $29 billion.
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.400]   $29 billion.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.800]   I mean, every year in direct costs.
[01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:15.800]   Not indirect costs.
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:16.800]   And that's just last year.
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:19.960]   Not indirect, just actual court costs.
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:21.760]   But here's the thing.
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:26.440]   Innovation actually happens not with individual patents and individual software things.
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:30.400]   These pieces all put together, right, creating the best experience and doing the best thing.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:33.760]   And Apple's a company that would be the first to tell you that they'll copy off everybody
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:35.080]   and they don't care, right?
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:37.120]   They don't get notifications on iOS.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:38.680]   That's an Android ripoff.
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:39.680]   Right.
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:40.680]   Well, they want it.
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:46.000]   It's a great picture online today from an earlier Samsung media player that had a grid
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:50.920]   of icons that gosh, looks just like an iPhone.
[01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:56.280]   So my question is, is the point of this to get license fees from Google, which is fine.
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:01.800]   If that's all it is, or is the point of this mutually assured destruction, what are they?
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:02.800]   What do they want?
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:03.800]   What do you want?
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:04.800]   What does Apple want?
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:07.400]   It's one of those stick in their spokes because people do it to them too.
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:11.960]   But the other thing is, too, is now that these companies have been around for so long, engineers
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:15.960]   and software developers are starting to leave one company for another company and these
[01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.640]   ideas happen.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:21.800]   And I don't know what that means at all.
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:26.760]   But to say that someone who may have worked at Apple a long, long time ago and is working
[01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:31.800]   at Google and works on a similar idea, how do you stop and block these things and how
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:32.800]   do you call a...
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:33.800]   Yeah.
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:34.800]   I think it's mind-boggling.
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.800]   I think the... Look at the Boycat's not going to work.
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:41.800]   Apple's going to sell... In fact, one of the analysts just said that they thought the iPhone
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:46.520]   5 was going to be the biggest consumer electronics launch in history.
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:47.520]   And they may be right.
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:48.520]   Yeah.
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:52.240]   But... So it's not going to... But I think we need to yell.
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:53.240]   We all need to yell.
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:55.400]   We need to say, "Apple, what the hell are you doing?
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.400]   This is not right."
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:59.760]   You want to make the best stuff, make the best stuff, and then compete.
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:00.760]   Don't litigate.
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:01.760]   Right.
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:06.640]   So we take one well-timed demonstration in front of an Apple store to say we're ashamed
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:07.640]   of you, Apple.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:08.640]   I'm serious.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:11.840]   We'll get more media attention, more press.
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:15.640]   Apple fanboys disappointed in our God.
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.720]   That would be kind of cool.
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:19.880]   And I mean, I think that's the other thing too.
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:23.440]   Is this Apple versus Google or is this Apple's lawyers versus Google's?
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:24.440]   Steve Jobs.
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:25.440]   I mean, lawyers...
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.440]   Steve Jobs.
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:27.440]   This is the legacy of Steve Jobs.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.280]   He said, "We are... It's scorched earth.
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.280]   It's nuclear war.
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:32.040]   We are going to annihilate Google.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:36.800]   They stole the Google... Android was stolen from Apple and we're going to annihilate them."
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:40.600]   Well, and we saw the... Who was the last company that went after Google and didn't win?
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:41.600]   I don't know who...
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:42.600]   Is that Oracle?
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:43.600]   Oracle.
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:44.600]   Oh yeah.
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:45.600]   Yeah, Oracle for Java.
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.600]   They didn't go so...
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:47.600]   They buy some microsystems and they all flat on their damn face.
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.600]   Yeah.
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:51.240]   So a couple of those happen and then it's not going to be such a sexy demonstration.
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:55.600]   But that was over not licensing the professional version of Java.
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:56.600]   Right.
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:57.600]   So what do you think?
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:58.600]   So you get the Nexus... Moving on.
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:13:59.600]   Nexus 7.
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:00.600]   This is the tablet.
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:01.600]   Right.
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:02.600]   This is 200 bucks.
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:04.920]   Google says we're not making any money on this.
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:06.080]   This is what it costs us.
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:09.360]   250 bucks with 16 gigs, 8 gigs is 200 bucks.
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:10.360]   Do you like it?
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:11.360]   Yeah.
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:16.560]   I mean, so I've heard a piece about it reviewing it and I didn't want to talk about whether...
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.960]   I didn't want to compare it to the iPad.
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:19.960]   I didn't want to compare it to Kindle Fire.
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:20.960]   Hi.
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.520]   For 200 bucks it's obvious that it's...
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:23.520]   Doesn't recognize me.
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:25.280]   Oh, you put face recognition in.
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.280]   Yeah.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:27.280]   Oh, that's awesome.
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.280]   Yeah.
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:29.280]   So it's awesome.
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:30.280]   We got to do this.
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:31.520]   Let's see it work.
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:32.520]   So it's a picture of Drew.
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:33.960]   And it immediately unlocked.
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:36.080]   That's much better by the way than it was.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.480]   Yeah, it's really improved.
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:38.480]   So it's...
[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:39.480]   Okay.
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:40.480]   So it's just Wi-Fi.
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:41.480]   It's not 3G.
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:42.480]   It's not...
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:43.480]   So you're going to use this at home.
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:47.000]   For me, I'm somebody who's always on my computer or on my phone and I don't really use an in-between
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.680]   device.
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:50.680]   But I think, you know, my...
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:53.160]   I think this 7 inches is a good size for a portability.
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.160]   Why isn't that the ability?
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:57.120]   They said we've always wanted to do a 7 inch and I was like, why?
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:59.720]   And because it's kind of like a bigger phone and a smaller tablet.
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:00.880]   Oh, we got to get you on Wi-Fi.
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:01.880]   But they liked it.
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:03.480]   You know, it feels good in the hands.
[01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:04.480]   It's well made.
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:05.880]   The screen is crystal clear.
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:08.440]   So a little dim, but usable.
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:14.360]   If you're a Google service user, if you're big into YouTube, if you use Gmail a lot,
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:17.000]   obviously Jelly Bean does a great job with...
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000]   It feels pretty fast.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000]   It feels pretty slippery.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000]   And it's really fast.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:26.040]   I mean, it's 8 gig for $200, $249 for $16.
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.040]   Now the real...
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.120]   This is not aimed at the iPad.
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:29.520]   This is aimed at the Kindle, right?
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:30.520]   Kindle Fire, yeah.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:31.520]   Yeah.
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:34.920]   I mean, it's for people who don't have a tablet right now, probably.
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:38.200]   I can't see a lot of iPad users running out and buying one.
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:39.200]   Unless they're...
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.200]   Well...
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:41.200]   Again, unless they're Google service users.
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:44.240]   Google plus one, it is gorgeous.
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:45.240]   Does...
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.240]   Here's a question.
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:49.600]   Does Amazon sell another one more fire?
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:50.600]   Or is it done?
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:52.160]   No, the fire too is coming out soon.
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.160]   They better hurry.
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:54.160]   Yeah.
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:55.720]   They better hurry, right?
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:56.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:57.720]   I mean, you know, this...
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.720]   Again, this thing is...
[01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:00.720]   It's...
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:02.640]   Well, I think people were shocked at how well it was made.
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:03.640]   It's very...
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.120]   When you hear $200, you think, wow, that's going to be...
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:08.400]   Didn't they design it in four months?
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.400]   That's what they said.
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:12.120]   They said four months and it was based off of something that ASOS...
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:14.720]   Yeah, ASOS showed this in CES.
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:15.720]   Yes, basically.
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:17.360]   And they updated it.
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.280]   But it has a Tegra 3.
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.280]   It's very fast.
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:22.560]   Gigabyte of RAM.
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:23.560]   It's interesting.
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.000]   Front-facing camera, not...
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.000]   On a rear.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.000]   Back camera.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000]   Yeah.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.840]   But now I've also seen that Google is going to do gesture-based.
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:32.640]   They're going to do not just face recognition, but they're going to start...
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:33.640]   I have game...
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:34.640]   It looked like they showed...
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:39.080]   Remember the demo with Cirque du Soleil, where it could see your body.
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:40.080]   And there was an...
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:41.080]   It looked a lot like connect.
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:42.080]   A lot like that.
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:45.880]   I thought that was kind of interesting using the front-facing camera on this in some interesting
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:46.880]   ways.
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:50.840]   And for directions and things, you can use gestures for directions when you're driving.
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:51.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:52.840]   Right.
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:53.840]   These aren't the droids you're looking for.
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:54.840]   There's the connector.
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:56.380]   There's infrared, right?
[01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:57.380]   Or not infrared.
[01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:58.380]   Yeah, infrared.
[01:16:58.380 --> 01:17:00.640]   Yeah, it has all three cameras.
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:01.640]   It has infrared.
[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:03.040]   It has a Z camera for depth.
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.240]   I mean, it's more sophisticated.
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:05.240]   But you know what?
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:08.080]   I don't know if that's anything better, frankly.
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.440]   So this is 200 bucks.
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:11.080]   I think this is a really compelling product.
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:12.400]   It's a device my mom would love.
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:14.640]   And it's a device that I haven't had a problem using the last couple of days.
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:17.400]   And explain this to me for 300 bucks.
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:18.400]   Don't get it.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.400]   Okay.
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:21.120]   I think I'm pre-grads some thoughts on it.
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:22.120]   So I think you should let it in.
[01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:23.120]   I admire.
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:26.600]   One thing I think is great is that this is made in the USA.
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:27.600]   And it is hackable.
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:30.360]   They've already said we want people to hack it, right?
[01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:31.360]   But what is it?
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:32.360]   I don't know.
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:34.280]   This is the Q, the letter Q.
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:35.840]   I thought they said Q but first.
[01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:36.840]   Yeah.
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:37.840]   But why don't they share it?
[01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:40.920]   Shake it up and it'll tell you your answer is in the future.
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:41.920]   Yeah.
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.160]   No, the volume control spins the top.
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:45.160]   That's the volume.
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.960]   It has 29 LEDs around it, the glow blue.
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:48.960]   That's cool.
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:52.080]   This is where you hook up speakers because it's got a 25 watt amplifier in it.
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:53.880]   It has a mini HDMI port.
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:57.960]   They keep saying hook it up to your best TV and speakers, your best TV and speakers.
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:58.960]   You could, it's like a Sonos.
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:01.200]   You could have multiple cues in multiple rooms.
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:04.560]   Somebody could come over with their Android device, Gingerbread or Better and put some
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:08.320]   music or a video even if they own it on here.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:10.320]   And then it would play to your TV set.
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:15.600]   See, I was just saying it's like a 300% more expensive Apple TV.
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:16.600]   Yes.
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:17.920]   Apple TV is 100 bucks.
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:21.160]   And part of the problem also is that someone who's willing to spend $300 on that already
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:24.760]   has a home stereo, they don't need the amp and they shouldn't put the amp in the app.
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:25.760]   That's crazy.
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:28.400]   I do, I mean, I applaud the made in the USA, which probably popped the prize up a little
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:32.000]   bit, but other than that, I mean, there's a much better wireless media server.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.000]   But what's the case?
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000]   Is that the competition?
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000]   Is it the Sonos or?
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.560]   Well, no, this is, I mean, this is using all the Google Play stuff.
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.240]   So it's clearly their version of iTunes.
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:41.960]   You know what's wrong with this?
[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:44.840]   No Netflix, no Amazon.
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:45.840]   Exactly.
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:46.680]   It's Play.
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:47.680]   That's Google.com.
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:49.120]   It's all Play stuff, period.
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:50.120]   And it's 300 bucks.
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:51.120]   And it's 300 bucks.
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:52.320]   I don't know who you sell this to.
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.320]   And it's ridiculously heavy.
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.320]   They've sold 6,000.
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:55.560]   Not that you have the same.
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:56.560]   Oh, yes.
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:57.560]   Well, gave away.
[01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:58.560]   They gave away 6,000.
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:02.760]   If you go back to the VC world, if someone made that as a prototype and went to try and
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:05.880]   raise money for the company to make those, they wouldn't get it.
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:06.880]   They wouldn't get any money.
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:07.880]   Really?
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:08.880]   That is absolutely true.
[01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:09.880]   Who would invest in this?
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:10.880]   Absolutely true.
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:11.880]   I wouldn't.
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.240]   Well, they get anything on Kickstarter.
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.240]   You know, Kickstarter's kind of cool.
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.240]   They make a lot of money on Kickstarter.
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:17.240]   Yeah.
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:18.240]   Exactly.
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:25.920]   Google could be a savior because I saw on Google+, somebody did a video of what if you
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:29.680]   could have some widgets up on the screen and do some other things, some social stuff.
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:31.880]   Sure, that'd be cool.
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:35.240]   But as it stands right now out of the box, it's like, I like the packing though.
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:37.440]   It's very, very happily.
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:41.520]   Apple will sue them over that too, no doubt.
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:42.520]   Anything circular?
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:43.520]   Yeah.
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:44.520]   Yeah.
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:45.520]   So that's the cue.
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:46.520]   Not so impressive.
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.520]   I'm not sure.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:50.000]   It's just a whole convergence deal, right?
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.120]   They want you to have the seven inch tablet.
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:55.480]   They want you to have the phone and the cup that you drop on the floor.
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:57.480]   Is there one in it?
[01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:59.080]   Did you like something in that?
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:00.080]   No, I'm good.
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.080]   Thanks.
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:02.840]   But that would be nice.
[01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:06.120]   But I think they just want to have that device for all those.
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:11.280]   Just like Apple, just like Microsoft is going with the Surface.
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:16.640]   Now they have the Windows, the desktop Windows 8.
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.240]   Give me a start about the Surface.
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:21.160]   I thought I was excited that they did it.
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:25.720]   Aside from the Xbox, and some peripherals, that's their first major piece of hardware
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:26.720]   that they make.
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:30.720]   And they gave the finger to a lot of OEMs.
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:32.920]   But it's kind of exciting to me to see.
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:34.080]   It was really ballsy.
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:38.440]   But I think it's really, I'm excited to see what kind of software they'll make.
[01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:42.840]   It's custom designed for a controlled, no one likes the controlled walled environment,
[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:43.840]   but they made it.
[01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:46.240]   And they're going to give it a go with Windows 8.
[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:51.120]   Windows 8, as it stands right now, is super buggy on the developer preview or consumer
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:52.120]   preview.
[01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:54.200]   But damn, it's pretty good.
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:57.040]   And if you're familiar with the Xbox, it's that user interface.
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:00.640]   This is where all three companies are going, Google, Microsoft.
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:02.120]   It's the dumbening of America.
[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:03.120]   It's the convergence.
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:04.120]   I don't know.
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:08.480]   I have three user interfaces when you could have one.
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:09.720]   Let everything talk to each other.
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:12.480]   Why should there be a university?
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:14.880]   Let's make everything look the same.
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:15.880]   But that's what the queue's going to look like.
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:17.480]   Can we have a moment of silence?
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:20.480]   Just a moment of silence for BlackBerry.
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:25.560]   Oh, hey, rims results.
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:28.120]   They lost $2.8 billion.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:31.000]   The analysts thought they'd lose seven cents a share.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.600]   They lost 37 cents a share.
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:39.320]   That's not good when you exceed the analyst's analyst estimate by minus 30 cents.
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.840]   Not a good start.
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:43.640]   They say, and this is the thing that's good.
[01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:48.320]   This is the reason this is the last shovel of dirt on the already almost completely buried
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:49.440]   company.
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:53.760]   The next version of the BlackBerry OS, BlackBerry 10, it's delayed.
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:57.800]   It'll be out maybe next year.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:00.440]   It's fine when I go to Canada.
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:04.000]   There's real cognitive distance about this because everybody there has a BlackBerry.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.880]   It's not a matter of national pride and loyalty.
[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:14.160]   And it made them, I think, somewhat deaf to the shrugging, laughing reaction to BlackBerry's
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:16.720]   products in the last two years elsewhere in the world.
[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:17.720]   Sad.
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:20.840]   I mean, I was a BlackBerry user.
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:21.840]   I was a big fan.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:24.160]   In fact, my last phone before the iPhone was a career.
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:27.440]   I love BlackBerry users are very dedicated.
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:29.360]   That's an example.
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:30.360]   We're dedicated.
[01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:32.520]   No, still value in the BBM.
[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:34.280]   There's a lot of people who really love BBM.
[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:35.280]   BBM is a teenager.
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:37.160]   Oh, teenagers love it.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:38.520]   High school kids really love.
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:40.080]   Yes, that's who uses blackboard messenger.
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:42.240]   It's kind of similar to Salesforce chatter.
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:43.240]   Right.
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:44.240]   That's the problem.
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:45.480]   It's kind of similar to everything that's already.
[01:22:45.480 --> 01:22:47.520]   That's where Apple came out with iMessage.
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:49.760]   That's their kind of messaging service.
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:52.120]   They're, you know, doesn't matter what device you're on.
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:53.120]   It's really interesting.
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:56.160]   I mean, what you have to say, this, the beginning of the end was the iPhone, right?
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:00.040]   This just, it just, I think if you're going to say anything, iPhone killed BlackBerry.
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:04.440]   But if you're, if you're operating next operating system is delayed, then why are you working
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:05.600]   on the playbook?
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:12.120]   Why are you working on a tablet if you can't get your operating system out on time for
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:13.760]   the people who really care about your device?
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:17.160]   Apparently, out of date, teenagers haven't liked the BlackBerry messenger since 2004.
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:20.320]   So, moves of the Microsoft should buy BBM and incorporate it in.
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:21.480]   They're not teenagers anymore.
[01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:22.480]   I absolutely agree.
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:23.960]   I think it would make complete sense.
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:29.940]   That's why Skype bought GroupMe because to bring messaging and texting into the Skype
[01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:31.840]   product, because that's not something they've done.
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:33.320]   They've focused on voice.
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:35.560]   I think it would make perfect sense to integrate that.
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:40.800]   But can you, I mean, does it want all of, I mean, just want the BBM stuff.
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:43.560]   Do you buy the valuable assets and to solve the, I don't know.
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:45.320]   I mean, actually, I don't know a lot about that.
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:46.480]   What fun, what fun do you hear?
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.080]   I've been an iPhone user for a long time.
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:50.080]   I still am.
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:54.200]   I'm not that interested in Android, although I should give it a shot because I really like
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:57.760]   a lot of the, specifically because I was reading all the news about Jelly Bean.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:59.240]   And I like what you can do with the widgets.
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:01.840]   I like what you have on the new notification capabilities.
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:07.400]   And, and I feel stupid for not being familiar with Android.
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:09.800]   Like, I feel like I need, I want to start using Windows.
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:12.000]   It sounds like a bridal fan.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.160]   Look at the fish.
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:14.880]   I feed the fish this.
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:15.880]   Look, isn't that pretty?
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:17.880]   I'm a little different.
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:18.880]   No, I'm not.
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:20.880]   I don't care what you carry.
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:21.880]   But I carry an iPhone.
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:23.120]   Also, I have an extra one.
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:24.120]   You can find it.
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:27.280]   For some reason, all of the developers, I know everyone who does mobile development,
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:31.360]   everyone says they really love and enjoy developing iOS first.
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.960]   And I'm not sure why people hate developing for Android.
[01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:37.600]   But I even asked, I asked tons of developers.
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:40.200]   And I was surprised because I thought it was a controversial thing.
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:44.760]   And I was at the, one of the carcinified shows for mobile development.
[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:49.600]   And I asked the developers in the audience about developing for iOS versus Android.
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.520]   And they all preferred developing for iOS.
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:54.920]   I was kind of surprised by that.
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:57.880]   I would say one of them is, I think there was a temple run.
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:59.880]   So, temple run came, finally came out on Android.
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:05.760]   And they said that 75% or something like that, 75% of their support, incoming support questions
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:11.240]   and issues were because of the devices weren't working with the app.
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:12.840]   Meaning there's a lot, much.
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:13.840]   Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:14.840]   Fragmentation.
[01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:18.880]   There's a much bigger ecosystem because there's lots of choice.
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:22.480]   You can call it fragmentation, but there's lots of choice in the Android space.
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:24.400]   There's only, you know, iPhone's iPhone.
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:25.400]   Right.
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:27.160]   You're not developing for a bunch of handsets.
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:28.280]   By the way, this is a great game.
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:29.280]   I just don't know.
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:30.280]   Look at that.
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:31.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:32.280]   And look how good that looks.
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:33.280]   A gaming session here.
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:34.360]   Yeah, this is beautiful.
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:35.360]   This is the brave.
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.360]   How much is the game?
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:37.360]   99 cents.
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.240]   Oh, there's a bear chasing me.
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:41.120]   This reminds me so much of Indiana Jones.
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:42.120]   It's not even funny.
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:43.120]   It's pretty awesome.
[01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:46.080]   This is a temple run, but this is the Disney Brave edition.
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:47.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:48.080]   So much.
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:49.080]   I ran into it.
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:50.080]   Bear got me.
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:51.080]   It's good stuff.
[01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:58.080]   But if you're a developer, would you go to Android first over iOS and there's plenty of
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.960]   developers here so you can fix.
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:01.360]   You can correct me here.
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:02.480]   But there's a lot.
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:04.680]   I think the primitive support in iOS is better.
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:05.840]   So things like animation.
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:08.000]   It's just kind of the libraries are more complete.
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.240]   Would you say roughly that's the case?
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:11.240]   Android is very cool.
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:15.000]   There's some really neat stuff, but I think it's just a little rougher in terms of demo.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.000]   You have to use a clip.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000]   You're not using Xcode.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.640]   It's just a little bit.
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:20.640]   You're a developer.
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:21.640]   You're kind of nodding.
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:22.640]   You're agreeing with me.
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:23.640]   Or are you drunk?
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:24.640]   You're tired?
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:25.640]   No.
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:26.640]   Did she get the whiskey?
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:27.640]   No.
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:30.440]   I think that that's kind of the common point of view.
[01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:32.040]   On the other hand, I know a lot of developers.
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:35.720]   I include Gene Intrapani, who say, "But I don't care because I want to work in an open system.
[01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:38.760]   I don't want to have to get Apple to say, "Okay, you can make your thing."
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:39.760]   Yeah.
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:40.760]   I don't.
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:44.360]   You know, from a political point of view, Android, I think, is far superior.
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:45.600]   And that's kind of why I support it.
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:47.720]   I want the openness.
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:53.080]   By the way, the other problem, Siri, only gets its request 62% of the time on a loud
[01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:56.160]   street and 68% of the time in the quieter setting.
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:57.160]   Really?
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:58.160]   How's your Siri experience?
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:26:59.160]   I don't have a 4S.
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:00.400]   I don't have a 4S either.
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.440]   If I was excited about Siri, I would have wanted to.
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:03.680]   Well, Siri doesn't work for either.
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:05.240]   You guys 100% of the time.
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:08.200]   Well, I had the Siri app before they bought it.
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:09.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:10.200]   And then it disappeared.
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:16.600]   So Piper Jaffrey, which is an analyst company, did 1,600 common searches.
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:19.040]   They found that the results were about and were not good.
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:22.400]   About 62% if it was noisy, 68% if it was quiet.
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:24.920]   A D for accuracy.
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:26.680]   I find Siri pretty accurate.
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:27.680]   I use it to dictate.
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:28.680]   I like it to dictate.
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:30.160]   I think it's pretty remarkable.
[01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:34.000]   Leo, did you see the clip right above that in the rundown?
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:39.800]   Is it video with the shoot out at the OS corral with Siri versus Google Jelly Bean Boy Search?
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:41.280]   And it's really pretty cool.
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:43.800]   Pretty than one for one against each other.
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:49.080]   Oh, let me find that because I have to say that at least from terms of capabilities,
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:54.200]   whether I will almost say how well one of the other works, but in terms of capabilities,
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:56.960]   the Android dictations bet you can launch applications.
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:01.800]   You can do a lot of stuff that is only now coming to Siri and iOS 6.
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:02.800]   So here's the shoot out.
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:03.800]   Who did this?
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:06.600]   I forget because that's the link to I think.
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:07.600]   Estro-Ojikis.
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:09.640]   Yeah, she cross posted it.
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:10.800]   Yeah, so I'm sorry.
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:12.800]   Chad, I should have put the direct link up.
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:15.360]   Oh, we got a nice picture of Esther.
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:16.880]   Esther's wonderful.
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:21.400]   Esther is a magnificent high school journalism teacher and mother-in-law to one of Google's
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:24.400]   major executives.
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:30.760]   Of course, because Sergey's wife is Wojiki.
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:33.400]   I don't know her first name.
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:34.400]   That's her mom.
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:35.400]   What's up, everyone?
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:39.800]   John Rhett and Jeff from Techno Buffaloon here with a voice assistant head to show down.
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:42.320]   On the left, we have Siri and on the right.
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:43.320]   We should have done this.
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:44.320]   We could do this, correct.
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:47.520]   Google's new search found in Android 4.1 Jelly Bean.
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:49.480]   Let's go ahead and put these guys head to head.
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:50.400]   See who comes out on top.
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:52.400]   Oh.
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:53.400]   Oh.
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:54.400]   Oh.
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:56.400]   It needs like a rah.
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.400]   What did Buffaloon do to think?
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:28:59.400]   It's a beta ch-
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:00.400]   There you go.
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:04.400]   This is running a pre-release, 4.1 Jelly Bean.
[01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:06.400]   Let's go ahead and exit out.
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:10.400]   I'm going to ask it simple questions that I use all the time for my voice assistants.
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:13.400]   Let's go ahead and get started.
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:16.400]   What's the weather?
[01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:18.400]   It's 18 degrees with hay.
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:20.400]   It's 18 degrees with hay.
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:22.400]   It's 18 degrees with hay.
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:23.400]   It's 18 degrees with hay.
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:24.400]   It's 18 degrees with hay.
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:26.400]   The galaxy nexus came through first.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.400]   Oh, the voice is here.
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:32.400]   It was a little less robotic on the galaxy nexus than it is on Siri.
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.400]   In fact, let me just go ahead and do a quick demonstration here.
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:38.400]   In both cases, you have to learn how to use this.
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:39.400]   You have to learn how to speak to it.
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:40.400]   You have to learn what...
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:41.400]   Yeah.
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:46.400]   The forecast for Irvine today is 29 degrees and clear.
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:48.400]   It sounds a little more...
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:49.400]   He's in the mic.
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:50.400]   He's in the mic.
[01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:52.400]   He's in the Celsius because I haven't changed those settings yet.
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:54.400]   Let's go ahead and try something new.
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:55.400]   Yeah, this is very unsightly difficult.
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:57.400]   This is for his results.
[01:29:57.400 --> 01:29:58.400]   Yeah.
[01:29:58.400 --> 01:29:59.400]   That's the problem.
[01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:01.400]   Is it a timer for 10 minutes?
[01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:03.400]   I guess the point is that...
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:05.400]   10 minutes and counting.
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:11.400]   That was almost exactly the same time, but it looked like the galaxy nexus actually came through a little bit faster.
[01:30:11.400 --> 01:30:12.400]   Let's go ahead...
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:14.400]   And this is Jelly Bean?
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:15.400]   Yeah, it's just.
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:16.400]   Yeah.
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:17.400]   So it's a little bit better.
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:18.400]   It looks like than the...
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:19.400]   You won the Angels game yesterday.
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:20.400]   [Ding]
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:21.400]   [Ding]
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:23.400]   Angels beat the Orioles one moment.
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:24.400]   One moment.
[01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:26.400]   The Angels definitively beat the Orioles.
[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:28.400]   Yes, but Ceres is definitively.
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:31.400]   And this is a perfect example.
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:32.400]   Look how nice it looks.
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:34.400]   They add things like definitively.
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:35.400]   Sure.
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:37.400]   The results are there from Google and they're faster.
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:39.400]   What about the Easter eggs?
[01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:40.400]   What if you ask it to open the Podbay doors?
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:41.400]   It doesn't do any of that stuff.
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:42.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:44.400]   You know, what I really want to do is I want to throw it away.
[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:47.400]   I want to try to get the two of them into an argument.
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:48.400]   That would be fun.
[01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:49.400]   Talking to each other.
[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:50.400]   That's like in the old days.
[01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:51.400]   It's like the Furbies.
[01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:52.400]   Yeah.
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:55.400]   Where you get the two Furbies sitting there.
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:59.400]   How many consumers are actually going to like the two phones together?
[01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:02.400]   I think very few people actually even use these features.
[01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:03.400]   I think it requires some...
[01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:04.400]   You have to remember the syntax.
[01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:06.400]   You have to remember to press the button.
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:07.400]   I use Siri a lot.
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:10.400]   I do actually text when I do text.
[01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:11.400]   I often will speak text.
[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:15.400]   The other problem is that when it makes a mistake, it's such a pain in the ass.
[01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:17.400]   And that's the problem with all voice dictation.
[01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:18.400]   Sure.
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:20.400]   If it's 100% perfect, it's great.
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:26.400]   If it's 5% off, if it's 95% perfect, that means one time, every 20 times you use it, you've got to fix it.
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:28.400]   And that's kind of a pain.
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:30.400]   So, it's a difficult technology.
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:35.400]   And then there's the issue, of course, of looking like a complete nitwit as you walk down the street talking to your phone.
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:37.400]   Yelling at your phone more likely.
[01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:39.400]   I am happy the new iPhone.
[01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:40.400]   Good news and bad news.
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:42.400]   Good news is NFC, it looks like.
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:44.400]   We're seeing a lot of rumors.
[01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:46.400]   That with the past book will make a huge difference.
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:48.400]   I think that will put NFC over the top.
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:51.400]   These phones have NFC already, the Android phones.
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:55.400]   And now that iPhone, if it comes out with iPhone 5 with NFC, I think that's going to be great.
[01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:56.400]   It means you'll tap things.
[01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:57.400]   Did you come...
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:59.400]   When you came in, I don't know if you noticed it, everybody should know.
[01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:02.400]   There's a sticker on the wall that says, "Tap this to check in on 4-square."
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:03.400]   That's no way.
[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:04.400]   But you have to have NFC.
[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:06.400]   You got the watch more calls.
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:07.400]   Yeah, textiles from Samsung.
[01:32:07.400 --> 01:32:13.400]   But I think the best thing that Apple does will do and what the users won't be thinking of it as NFC.
[01:32:13.400 --> 01:32:16.400]   They're going to be like, "I have my past book and I take my phone on the phone."
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:17.400]   Exactly.
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:18.400]   They don't need to know NFC.
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:19.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:22.400]   So Apple's very good at leaving the technology out of the technology.
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:24.400]   Google has a lot of catch-up to do on that.
[01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:25.400]   The negative is Apple.
[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:30.400]   Apparently, this new iPhone is going to eliminate the 30-pin connector and have a now completely incompatible connector
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:31.400]   with one more person.
[01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:32.400]   That's interesting.
[01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:33.400]   Oh, no.
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:34.400]   It's not even USB?
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:35.400]   No.
[01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:38.400]   It's a 19-pin proprietary connector.
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:41.400]   Wait, it's still USB.
[01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:44.400]   It's just the different connector at the bottom.
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:45.400]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:47.400]   You still plug it into the wall to charge it.
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:48.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:49.400]   Or the computer.
[01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:50.400]   But it's not USB.
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:55.400]   Sunjake is teaching at ID Tech Camp, which is a great organization in Princeton this summer.
[01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:59.400]   And he's teaching, uh, programming, uh, iOS apps.
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:04.400]   So we just went through the house last night to find extra, uh, I, you know, iPod, I too.
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:09.400]   I would ever, uh, charging cables so that his students, his eight students could all use their charge at the same time.
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:11.400]   And you know, we found 10 of them around the house.
[01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:14.400]   And now we're going to have to go off and buy 10 more.
[01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:16.400]   And then every time you lose one, you'll have to.
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:17.400]   Yeah.
[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:19.400]   I've liked so many of those things over the years.
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:21.400]   Yeah, that's weird.
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:26.400]   I have, I have very, I have a $200 radio that has a 30-pin connector on it.
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:28.400]   I can't, I mean, I don't know.
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:29.400]   I don't know.
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:32.400]   It's got, I have a dock for my Sonos dock as a 30-pin, I don't know.
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:33.400]   I don't know.
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:38.400]   Accessory companies are screwed because all the little docks and the little things and all the little.
[01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:42.400]   Now I'm hoping, and I don't think Apple will do this, I mentioned this on Mac break weekly.
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:46.400]   I apologize if you watched that show and you're hearing this again, but I'm hoping Apple will make a little adapter.
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:48.400]   They'll snap in and it will give it a 30-pin connector.
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:51.400]   And I know that's the last thing Apple would ever do.
[01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:52.400]   Remind.
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:53.400]   Yeah.
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:54.400]   Okay, I was just hoping, I'm just saying I'm hoping.
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:55.400]   The iBridge.
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:56.400]   We're going to take a break.
[01:33:56.400 --> 01:34:02.400]   If you did not watch our shows this week, this is what you might have missed.
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:03.400]   Roll it.
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:07.400]   This is what it has to be elite.
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:09.400]   How do you get a license?
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:11.400]   Oh my God, the chumps.
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:13.400]   Oh my God, they jumped.
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:15.400]   That is incredible.
[01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:16.400]   Look at the view.
[01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:17.400]   Look at this.
[01:34:17.400 --> 01:34:18.400]   Unbelievable.
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:25.400]   I'm carrying a cloud in my head.
[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:26.400]   You should see this.
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:27.400]   This is incredible.
[01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:28.400]   The Pogo plug.
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:29.400]   Oh.
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:30.400]   Oh.
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:31.400]   Oh.
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:32.400]   This is before you buy John Shit.
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:33.400]   This has a galsy note.
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:34.400]   I'm holding it.
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:35.400]   No, okay, that's fine.
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:36.400]   That's posed.
[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:43.400]   We want you to go undercover and get that picture of that girl across the aisle on the subway.
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:46.400]   Or that guy over the shoulder at the library.
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:47.400]   Like, that's what we're looking for.
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:54.400]   This guy single-handedly has set back marijuana utilization by a hundred years, which I run
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:57.400]   and take it all the way back to what it was.
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:34:58.400]   No.
[01:34:58.400 --> 01:34:59.400]   No.
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:00.400]   No.
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:01.400]   Boy.
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:08.400]   Ted MacArthur AC7II in his super secret, uh, spud gun for launching antenna support systems
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:10.400]   way up in the tree.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:12.400]   The sounds are crazier.
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:13.400]   Whoa.
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:14.400]   [laughter]
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:15.400]   Wait.
[01:35:15.400 --> 01:35:21.400]   If it happens in the world with technology, you've got your back.
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:22.400]   [laughter]
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:29.400]   All of that was this week on our shows, The Ham Nation Before You Buy, uh, some stuff, huh?
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:30.400]   Who cut it all together, that's cool.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:33.400]   Uh, we're going to start doing that on a regular basis because I think people don't know.
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:35.400]   They watch this show and they go, "Oh, that, I saw a twit."
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:37.400]   There's, what is it, 25 shows?
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:39.400]   We need twits and seven shows.
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:40.400]   Twenty-seven shows.
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:41.400]   Twenty-seven shows.
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:42.400]   Twits center.
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:45.400]   Anyway, we're going to start doing that just so you can see some of this issue.
[01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:46.400]   Just got raped, huh.
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:47.400]   What a small child.
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:48.400]   What a nothing.
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:49.400]   [laughter]
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:50.400]   Here's what Leo has.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:52.400]   How much more than 30 million a lot?
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:53.400]   [laughter]
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:54.400]   A big chunk?
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:57.400]   Can you show us with jelly bean?
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:58.400]   Yeah.
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:35:59.400]   Each of these jelly beans represents now.
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:02.400]   Each of these beans were a million dollars.
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:03.400]   Just count them out.
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:04.400]   That's all right.
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:06.400]   And how, and then shows how many you ate.
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:07.400]   So, uh, I don't know.
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:09.400]   See, he won't, he won't do it.
[01:36:09.400 --> 01:36:10.400]   The count is on.
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:11.400]   We've got one.
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:15.640]   This show brought to you as always by our good friends at Audible, the audiobook, place
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:18.640]   of just exceptional stuff.
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:20.640]   A hundred thousand plus titles.
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:23.640]   I'm going to show you how you can get two free right now.
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:25.640]   Visit audible.com/twits.
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:28.640]   You'll be signed up for the platinum account.
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:31.640]   And, uh, and that gives you two books a month.
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:32.640]   But your first month is free.
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:33.640]   Your first two books are free.
[01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:34.640]   Two credits, anyway.
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:38.040]   Some books, most books are one credit, but if, like Game of Thrones is two credits, a really
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:39.640]   long book sometimes aren't.
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:42.640]   Anybody here listening to audio, audio books at all?
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:43.640]   Anybody?
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:48.640]   I listened to, uh, I listened to Steve Jobs' book.
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:49.640]   That was good.
[01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:52.640]   Actually, that was the only way to really get through that in a fast way.
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:53.640]   I really enjoyed it.
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:57.640]   I listened to, I listened to all these spoken words of including Audible while running.
[01:36:57.640 --> 01:36:58.640]   A lot of people listen to music.
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:01.640]   I go, I go running and you get so into the story that you keep running.
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:02.640]   I know.
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:03.640]   That's the idea.
[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:04.640]   It's good for your exercise.
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:05.640]   I do that on the gym.
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:09.720]   Now, if you, you may not, we name it and have people who listened on, but we have somebody
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:12.640]   who's read two Audible books so far right here, sitting to my left.
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:15.640]   Both of your books are on Audible in a second.
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:16.640]   Right.
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:19.640]   And, and, and pity the poor producer who had to say to find a hundred million ways to say
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:23.640]   to me, uh, Jeff, could you take that again a little slower?
[01:37:23.640 --> 01:37:25.640]   I mean, listen, this is, this is the latest.
[01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:27.640]   Public parts are sharing in the digital age.
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:32.640]   Also easier improves the way I always have researchers and editors at the ready.
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:37.640]   At this moment, I'm at my laptop trying to catalog the benefits of publicness.
[01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:38.640]   This is good, Jeff.
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:41.640]   As a reflex, I turned to Twitter and asked people to know what to do.
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:42.640]   It's good.
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:43.640]   And value in relation to others.
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:44.640]   You are good at this.
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:45.640]   This is good.
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:47.640]   This is, it sounds, it's in your voice.
[01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:48.640]   It's personal.
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:50.640]   But what you can also do with Audible is you can speed it up if you want.
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:53.640]   So you can speed Jeff up to his normal speed if you want.
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:58.360]   That's a, that's actually that's on those Audible apps on a, uh, now on Windows Phone,
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:00.000]   by the way, they just came out with a Windows Phone.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.240]   Of course, Sandra and iOS as well.
[01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:03.640]   You got to get the Audible app.
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:05.960]   Um, there's some really good books on here.
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:09.480]   I'm listening, uh, to about three audio books at the same time.
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:11.480]   That's kind of how I, that's going to be a role.
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:12.480]   Listen to the stand.
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:14.080]   Well, the stand is like 800 hours.
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:15.520]   So you just keep listening.
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:19.160]   This is Stephen King, but really good, really, really good.
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:21.320]   That's a new version of that that just recorded.
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:25.600]   Um, I'm, I'm listening to Barrett-Tundays how to be black because I have ambitions.
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:26.600]   That's great.
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:27.600]   I haven't listened to that yet.
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:28.600]   That's great.
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:29.600]   I play a little bit of Barrett-Tund.
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:30.600]   I love Barrett.
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:34.800]   He's a little of American opportunity could be satisfied either through a comprehensive
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:36.800]   program of economic and political empowerment.
[01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:37.800]   You know what I like about you?
[01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:39.240]   You could tell he's smiling the whole time.
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:40.240]   Every time you're doing it.
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:41.240]   He's smiling.
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:43.240]   You could see the smart ass.
[01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:44.240]   Yeah.
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:45.240]   With that.
[01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:46.920]   That's on the smart.
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:47.920]   That's a great book.
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:48.920]   Kevin Smith.
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:50.960]   Kevin Smith has a new book.
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:52.320]   You look kind of like Kevin Smith.
[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:53.320]   That's it.
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:54.320]   Yeah.
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:57.680]   It's called Tough Life Advice from a Fat Lazy Slob Who Did Good.
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:38:58.680]   Nice.
[01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:01.160]   That's, that, he took my title.
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:06.560]   So, uh, I'll tell you the Nerk Chris Hardest has a, uh, Hardwick has a book, The Nerdist.
[01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:08.840]   How to Reach the Next Level, The Nerdist Way.
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:10.720]   Look, I'm, I can't go on it.
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:11.720]   There's so many choices.
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:12.720]   This is the problem.
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:16.480]   You go to audible.com, browse around, pick the book you want to listen to.
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:20.320]   It plays on all of your devices, you know, all your eye devices, your Android devices,
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:21.320]   your iPad.
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:24.800]   It also, it plays on like a lot of GPS and stuff like that.
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:28.440]   It doesn't yet play on the Google Q, but could you work on that and make that happen?
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:34.000]   Cause that needs, it really needs to, and then go to audible.com/twitto and you get two

[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:45.560]   Just audible, audible.com/twitto.
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:49.560]   Pendulets got a new book.
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:51.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:52.560]   He's lost Leo.
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:54.560]   Can I play a little bit of pendule?
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:56.480]   Cause he's got that voice.
[01:39:56.480 --> 01:39:57.480]   He's got the voice.
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:39:58.480]   Professional dishwasher.
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:39:59.480]   I work with a man named Harold.
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:01.480]   That's all you need to hear.
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:02.480]   Professional dishwasher.
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:04.240]   I worked with a man named Harold.
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:08.760]   Harold, I said it's called God, no signs you may already be an atheist.
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:09.760]   Oof.
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:10.760]   Yeah.
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:12.280]   Pend is not pole punches.
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:13.280]   That's one thing.
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:14.680]   Did you work with Ben when he did that show?
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:15.680]   I didn't.
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:18.760]   Although Ryan Vance, you know him, he went down to his house.
[01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:20.720]   We set up a little studio forum.
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:21.720]   Crazy.
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:25.400]   Basically, we put a bunch of cameras and he likes to just look at cameras and speak
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:26.400]   his mind.
[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:30.520]   And then we'd take those and chop them together and pretty much edit it together, put a couple
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:31.520]   of images in there.
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:32.520]   That's huge.
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:33.520]   Huge.
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:34.520]   Is he still doing it?
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:35.520]   No, he stopped doing it.
[01:40:35.520 --> 01:40:37.080]   And now, well, he's got another show.
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:38.080]   He's got another TV show.
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:40.080]   No, it's not.
[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:42.560]   I'm just wondering if it's on Discovery or not.
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:43.560]   What?
[01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:44.560]   You heard it.
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:46.480]   It's like one of the one of those science types.
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:47.480]   So, right.
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:52.640]   There's a couple of days ago, I'm trying to take some pictures of my food and post it
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:55.240]   on Instagram and I couldn't.
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:57.760]   So I had to actually go around the restaurant and show everybody.
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:00.720]   That's a bad joke.
[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:02.040]   Instagram was down.
[01:41:02.040 --> 01:41:03.600]   A spot of fine was down.
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:04.600]   What a gauze.
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:06.160]   It looks like the real food.
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:10.280]   Somebody tweeted, "I'm living life unfiltered.
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:11.280]   Help."
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:13.480]   Oh, M.G. Seagler, he's got so many followers.
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:17.280]   He said, "My ego is getting destroyed because I'm not getting all the likes and my photos."
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:18.280]   And he's in France.
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:19.280]   Right.
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:21.320]   So he wants to show his great photos.
[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:24.800]   So, it was all because everybody uses Amazon Web Services.
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:28.400]   They were down and it was a pretty bad crash due to get this.
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:30.000]   Storms in Northern Virginia.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000]   Yeah.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.600]   We say redundancy?
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:33.600]   No.
[01:41:33.600 --> 01:41:34.600]   Hard to believe.
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:35.600]   Really is.
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:37.920]   It was very hard to believe.
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:38.920]   Pinterest was down.
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:39.920]   Pinterest was down.
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:43.720]   Ten years from now we're going to find out it was some kind of cyber terrorism.
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:44.880]   You know what?
[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:50.360]   Well, for one thing, everybody published the story as if North Virginia were a state.
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:51.360]   Capital and capital.
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:52.360]   Right.
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:53.360]   There's a North Virginia.
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:54.360]   There is no North Virginia.
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:55.360]   There's North Carolina.
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:41:56.360]   There's North Dakota.
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:57.360]   There's one Virginia.
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:58.360]   There's a West Virginia.
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:41:59.360]   West Virginia.
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:00.360]   That's a part of it.
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:01.360]   There's a Northern Virginia notice.
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:03.080]   I said truth is Leo.
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:04.600]   There is a Northern California.
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:05.440]   Yeah.
[01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:06.920]   So they're actually in similar ways.
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:10.560]   There's a North Virginia because that's the liberal part of the state up by Washington.
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:14.760]   And the rest of Virginia is not.
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:15.760]   You're nodding.
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:16.760]   Are you from Virginia, sir?
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:17.760]   Yeah, he's nodding.
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:18.760]   He knows.
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:20.920]   To live in North Virginia or South Virginia.
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:22.520]   He lives in Richmond.
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:23.520]   So that's kind of the central.
[01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:24.520]   That's the exception.
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:26.080]   That's like East West Berlin.
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:31.600]   Richmond is an area carved out.
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:33.240]   But what's your name again?
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:35.400]   Kevin, thank you for letting us use your cue, by the way.
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:36.400]   Do you want it back?
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:39.440]   We've never wanted to carry it.
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:40.640]   We have plenty, believe me.
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:44.300]   I understand that when you go through the airport, X-rays, though, they pretty much
[01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:45.600]   assume that's a bomb.
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:48.240]   Yeah, take that sucker out and just a word of warning.
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:50.200]   I just put it on the thing.
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:54.080]   By now, enough people have left San Francisco with these things that they probably are right.
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:55.800]   Thank you for helping us out, Kevin.
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:56.960]   I appreciate it.
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:42:59.520]   So yeah, it's a little scary that the...
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:03.400]   But I think you might be right, Kevin, because the storm story doesn't sound...
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:04.400]   That doesn't sound right.
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:05.400]   I love that you called me Kevin.
[01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:08.600]   I was going to say something, but I was going to let it go.
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:10.080]   I was not going to say anything.
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:11.080]   Prager.
[01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:14.200]   You should have him back on because he can tell you about what it's like to use Google
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:15.200]   Glass.
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:16.800]   He'll tell you in private.
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:18.200]   I think they try...
[01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:19.200]   Well, you know...
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:21.440]   So Kevin, we should mention this.
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:28.800]   Kevin Rose, our good friend and co-founder of revision 3-N-Dig, is now a venture capitalist,
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:30.480]   Google Ventures.
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:32.440]   Was that the original plan, do you think?
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:33.960]   It was not the original plan from Google.
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:36.040]   Yeah, it sounded like they put him in products.
[01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:40.080]   But I mean, he got what he wanted at the end because he somehow looks out a lot.
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:43.040]   It's perfect for him because he really does have a good eye for stuff.
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:44.200]   Oh, no, it's a great job.
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:45.200]   And he's also...
[01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:46.640]   Look, what he's invested in.
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:49.680]   If you look at Kevin's primary investments, they're all huge.
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:51.280]   His list is impressive.
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:52.880]   But it's great for him because...
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:56.320]   And this is not to knock him at all, but a lot of us are kind of ADD into things that
[01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:57.920]   we're really interested in.
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:00.240]   This gives him the opportunity to get really excited about something.
[01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:05.200]   So excited that he's able to tell Google the people who've put the LP to tell him to give
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:06.200]   money to it.
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:07.200]   Right.
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:08.520]   And then he'll go run off and look at something else, but then he'll get to come back and
[01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:09.520]   check on how they're doing.
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:10.520]   Exactly.
[01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:11.520]   And then go run off and look at other stuff.
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:13.080]   I mean, talk about it at a dream job for him, holy crap.
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:15.520]   So he was an angel investor in...
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:17.520]   There's this guy.
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:20.640]   Fab, path, form-spring, go wall.
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:22.480]   Okay, that's not so good.
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:23.480]   Simple Gia.
[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:24.480]   I'll sold to Facebook.
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:25.480]   All right.
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:26.480]   Zinga.
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:27.480]   You've heard of them.
[01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:28.480]   Square.
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:29.480]   Four square.
[01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:30.920]   I think you've seen with the word square.
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:32.880]   I think he said Zinga because it was N.G.
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:33.880]   Not N.G.
[01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:34.880]   Milko.
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:35.880]   Who's the ones that made the draw some?
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:36.880]   Oh, no.
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:37.880]   He also has on G-Pop.
[01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:38.880]   He also has on G-Pop.
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:39.880]   And a little thing called Twitter.
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:42.440]   I would hire him if I had money to invest.
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:44.280]   I'd say, Kevin, here's money.
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:45.280]   Here's money.
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:46.280]   Go.
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:47.280]   Most of those are his.
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:48.280]   I think he also has a couple of...
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:51.280]   He put money into funds that other people...
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:53.320]   But maybe those are all his own personal ones.
[01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:56.280]   This is according to Crunchbase and you know they would never lie.
[01:44:56.280 --> 01:44:57.280]   Crunchbase was down.
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:44:58.280]   Crunchbase was down too.
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:02.520]   Yeah, I was trying to look up information about some company like that.
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:04.440]   Learn about the companies that are down.
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:06.120]   I think it was cybertirons.
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:07.120]   I really do.
[01:45:07.120 --> 01:45:08.120]   I think it was cybertirons.
[01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:09.120]   It sucked.
[01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:14.320]   How could Amazon Web Services be vulnerable to a single point of failure?
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:16.040]   That doesn't sound right.
[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:17.040]   It just does not.
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:20.000]   Well, you know what they say when this thing happens is, "Oh, well, it was a cascading
[01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:21.000]   failure."
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:27.680]   So we had one server in North Virginia, the small state of North Virginia.
[01:45:27.680 --> 01:45:28.680]   And there was a storm.
[01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:31.640]   A storm came through and the server got wet.
[01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:35.200]   And then it all cascaded downhill from there.
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:36.680]   They all failed one after the...
[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:37.680]   That's what they say.
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:38.680]   I was a cascade...
[01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:41.840]   Padre S.J., who's going to be the host of this weekend Enterprise Technology.
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:45.000]   He's a priest and an IT expert in our chat room.
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:46.000]   That's impressive.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.000]   Would you...
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.000]   I know.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.000]   That's impressive.
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:50.000]   We tried to pay him.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:55.040]   He said, "Well, I just have to give it to the Vatican."
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:56.720]   He set up Skype for the Pope.
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:59.040]   I wonder if he would like Pendulets in the book.
[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:00.040]   I doubt it.
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:02.040]   We call him Friertech.
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:03.040]   Friertech.
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:08.120]   He's setting up X for the Pope, Pinterest or Instagram.
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:10.000]   I want to put it on Pinterest.
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.920]   I have the Pope.
[01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:15.760]   Rupert Murdoch, argue about evil and good in Twitter, please, please.
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:16.760]   That would be good.
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:17.760]   That would be good.
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:19.320]   A group of people in Santhology today.
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:21.160]   So it would be kind of a continuing theme here.
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:22.160]   I think, Rupert...
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:26.680]   He says, "This is a failure by the clients, Netflix, to properly etc. to properly configure
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:27.680]   their systems."
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:28.680]   Right.
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:32.760]   So instead of them saying, "Load balance throughout Amazon," they said, "We like this
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:37.480]   one server in North Virginia, that small state north of South Virginia, and we'd like
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:38.800]   to use that, please."
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:40.800]   And then when it went down, they were all screwed.
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:41.800]   Right.
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:45.600]   Yeah, because all the services came back at different points in time.
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:47.720]   You're on earth saying that the Pope is German.
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:48.720]   I forgot Benedict.
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:51.720]   So now I need to do a little like this.
[01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:52.720]   Yes.
[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:54.040]   Hey, we're done.
[01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:55.040]   Yeah.
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:59.240]   All the topics and add in fin item.
[01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:03.040]   I want to really want to thank Drew, all enough for coming here from the Next Web.
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:06.280]   You're a West Coast editor, as I know now, because my entire Twitter stream has been
[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:10.960]   spammed 800 times by apparently everybody else who works for the Next Web saying, "Check
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:12.520]   out Drew on Twitter."
[01:47:12.520 --> 01:47:13.520]   That's nice.
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:15.520]   We're a great team.
[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:16.520]   That Drew.
[01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:17.520]   Yeah.
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:18.520]   They're all happy about you being on there.
[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:19.520]   That Drew on Twitter.
[01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:21.320]   Some really smart people right there for the Next Web.
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:22.320]   Yeah.
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:23.320]   Really good.
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:27.440]   And everybody, they're all watching.
[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:35.520]   So by the way, July 4th, Wednesday, it is in the US Independence Day.
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:41.960]   But according to the cosmic log on MSNBC, it may also be the day the announcement goes
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:45.000]   out about the Higgs boson.
[01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.000]   Is this using the--
[01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:47.000]   Yes.
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:48.000]   --particle accelerant?
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:49.000]   Mm-hmm.
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:50.640]   This is our independence from the universe day.
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:51.640]   Yeah.
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:52.640]   This is the day.
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:55.640]   We make piles of little mini black holes.
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:48:00.920]   The large Hadron collider was really built, I think.
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:03.160]   One of the main things was to hunt for the Higgs boson.
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:06.320]   It is believed they may have found conclusive data.
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:08.480]   We'll find out on the fourth of July.
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:09.480]   Stay tuned.
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:10.480]   Stay tuned.
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:11.480]   Stay tuned.
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:13.680]   Thank you, Drew, for being here.
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:14.680]   Thank you, David Prager.
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:15.680]   Thank you.
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:16.680]   I'm excited about all the cool stuff you're going to do.
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:17.680]   Thanks.
[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:19.720]   What's the best way to follow what you're up to?
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:24.640]   Well, my Twitter account at @dellprager and then, quite frankly, if things go well with
[01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:29.240]   what I'm doing with hippie Glenn, I'll basically have a little soapbox there every week.
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:31.280]   The show's called Toasted Donut.
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:32.280]   Toasted Donut?
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:33.280]   Toasted Donut.
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:34.280]   Nice.
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:35.280]   Is that Pregnation?
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:36.280]   No, no, no.
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:37.280]   Toasted Donut.
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:38.280]   Does that have be a good name?
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:40.320]   It was just a case.
[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:41.480]   I could have called it Pregrapedia.
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:42.480]   Or in Pregnation.
[01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:45.240]   So, yeah, that Toasted Donut.
[01:48:45.240 --> 01:48:48.920]   It'll be on revision3.com/toasteddonut.
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:50.920]   That makes me hungry.
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:54.080]   Well, the name is a little of a weird derivation.
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:59.840]   Glenn, one day, in a Dignation episode, said something about how if there's a stale donut
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:02.600]   sitting there, you just kind of have to drop it in a toaster and then it's a fresh donut
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:03.600]   again.
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:08.520]   And a very hippie-glen type of way to say something like, "How hippie-ish is hippie
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:09.520]   Glenn?
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:14.840]   Hippie is something from Leo's in my era, not from Glenn's era."
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:19.560]   He encompasses a lot of what hippie from that era might have.
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:26.560]   He's also very into environmental, good, and eating well.
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:27.560]   Free using donuts.
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:31.120]   And then things that hippies in the '60s might have done as well as a lot of people in San
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:32.120]   Francisco.
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:36.040]   It really strikes me like a kind of bizarro-reheuser-vays and company.
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:37.040]   I can't wait.
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:38.040]   I can't wait.
[01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:40.640]   Toasted Donut on revision3.
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:44.840]   Of course, you can catch Jeff Jarvis on this week in Google every Wednesday.
[01:49:44.840 --> 01:49:46.040]   We won't do a show this week, I guess.
[01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:47.040]   We'll just take it off.
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:48.040]   That's what I get.
[01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:50.520]   I'm poor Steve on security now.
[01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:52.440]   He did not want to take a day off.
[01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:54.280]   His week was thrown open.
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:55.600]   What do you mean we're not doing a show?
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:56.600]   We always do a show.
[01:49:56.600 --> 01:49:57.600]   All the show we've done.
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:58.600]   You heard that.
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:00.200]   He was like, "What do you mean?
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:01.400]   We've never missed a show."
[01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:02.800]   But it's Independence Day.
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:05.040]   No, but I want to do a show.
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:06.040]   So I'm not coming in.
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:07.040]   I'm sorry.
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:08.040]   I'm not coming in.
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:09.040]   If he wants to do a show, he could do it by himself.
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:10.040]   I'm just doing it.
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:12.560]   I'm not coming in.
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:14.640]   But we can catch Twig every Wednesday.
[01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:17.400]   Normally 11 AM Pacific 2 PM Eastern time.
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:22.040]   Lots of good stuff on that show with Gina and Jeff.
[01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:24.560]   You often some great guests talking about the latest in the cloud.
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:25.560]   It's not just Google.
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:28.320]   It's the cloud, Google, Facebook, all that stuff.
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:29.320]   Thank you for being here, Jeff.
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:30.320]   I really appreciate it.
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:31.320]   I'm glad you're feeling well.
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:32.320]   Thank you.
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:36.800]   I share all my ailments and public parts here on Twitter and Twig.
[01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:39.800]   That's because he's the Borg.
[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:40.840]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:46.240]   We do Twig every Sunday, 3 PM Pacific, 6 PM Eastern time, 2,200 UTC.
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:49.440]   We have people from Australia who are using it live for the first time because it's not
[01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:51.120]   only in the middle of the night or something, right?
[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:52.120]   Yeah.
[01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:54.080]   Nice to have you from Sydney, from Canada.
[01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:55.080]   Happy Canada Day.
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:57.800]   All of our friends from Canada are here.
[01:50:57.800 --> 01:50:58.800]   Who else?
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:50:59.800]   Anybody?
[01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:00.800]   Anybody?
[01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:01.800]   Where are you from?
[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:02.800]   New Jersey.
[01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:03.800]   Hey!
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:04.800]   Yo!
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:05.800]   Hey, I got a pain.
[01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:08.040]   I got a pain in the left side of my stomach.
[01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:09.680]   What do you want me to do about that?
[01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:10.680]   What?
[01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:11.680]   Oh, wait.
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:12.680]   Forget about it.
[01:51:12.680 --> 01:51:13.680]   Forget about it.
[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:14.680]   Forget about it.
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:16.680]   It's close enough to Philadelphia.
[01:51:16.680 --> 01:51:17.680]   Awesome.
[01:51:17.680 --> 01:51:22.280]   What did she say when you said I have a pain in the left side of my stomach?
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:23.680]   What do you want me to say about?
[01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:25.680]   What do you want me to do about it?
[01:51:25.680 --> 01:51:27.680]   What do you want me to do about it?
[01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:28.680]   What do you want me to do about it?
[01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:32.600]   If it wouldn't appendix, it would be on the right side.
[01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:34.600]   That's what serious should sound like, actually.
[01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:35.600]   Exactly.
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:36.600]   It's not like snookies.
[01:51:36.600 --> 01:51:37.600]   They should have wasted.
[01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:39.600]   It's like they do for the navigation stuff.
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:41.600]   No, I don't want Syria.
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:42.600]   I want Snooki.
[01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:46.600]   Yeah, like you were saying, Tom Tommy can have Yoda or Darth Vader talk to you?
[01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:49.360]   Emma Lewis has given us a new bumper sticker for Virginia.
[01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:51.600]   North Virginia is for servers.
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:53.600]   I like it.
[01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:55.600]   That's pretty awesome.
[01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:56.600]   Yeah.
[01:51:56.600 --> 01:51:59.600]   Virginia is for lovers, but North Virginia, that's for servers.
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:00.600]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:01.600]   We'll see you next week.
[01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:03.600]   Another twin is in the can.
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:06.600]   Hey, we got applause.
[01:52:06.600 --> 01:52:08.600]   That's great.
[01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:09.600]   That's great.
[01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:11.600]   What a great, great round.
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:12.600]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:13.600]   It's really appreciate it.
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:14.600]   It's an amazing...
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:16.600]   Name Craig Nation.
[01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:18.600]   I knew it.
[01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:20.600]   [laughter]
[01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:22.600]   Hey, whoo!
[01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:23.600]   Alright.
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:28.600]   So let me just quickly, one more thing I'd like to mention, you see right here in our latest post at Twit.TV.
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:30.600]   We're re-jigginging our live schedule.
[01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:33.600]   That's one effect anybody who subscribes and downloads to shows.
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:41.600]   But for those of you watching live, Tech News today is moving from 3 p.m. in Pacific to 10 a.m. Pacific or 2 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:46.600]   Earlier in the day, and a few other shows are going to move around as a result of it.
[01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:51.600]   We've got the schedule posted on our Twit.TV site, and you can see what all the changes are.
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:53.600]   They're not all occurring this week.
[01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:57.600]   The big one is Home Theater Geeks moving up half an hour, T&T moving to 10 a.m.
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:52:59.600]   Frame rate, 3 p.m. Mondays.
[01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:00.600]   That's on Monday.
[01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:03.600]   So just, you know, a word of warning to take a look at that.
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:07.600]   If you do watch live, if you don't watch live, you won't notice anything at all.
[01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:10.600]   The shows will still show up at the same place at the same time.
[01:53:10.600 --> 01:53:18.600]   [music]
[01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:20.600]   It's time for Twig this week.
[01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:21.600]   No, it's not.
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:23.600]   [laughter]
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:24.600]   It's not!
[01:53:24.600 --> 01:53:26.600]   You fooled me!
[01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:28.600]   What is he doing here?
[01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:31.600]   [laughter]
[01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:33.600]   Okay, start over.
