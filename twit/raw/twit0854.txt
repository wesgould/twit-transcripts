[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   It's time for Twig this week in Tech, our last live show of the year.
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.880]   We've got a great panel for you.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.160]   And JJ Stone is here.
[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.200]   Tim Stevens from CNET's Roadshow.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.400]   From Twig, Jeff Jarvis joins us.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.040]   We'll talk about the worst security exploit ever, in my opinion.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.640]   YouTube and Disney reach a deal.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.600]   Elon Musk, the person of the year, really?
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.960]   I'll make a very embarrassing revelation.
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.720]   And then we'll talk about the dog that talks.
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.720]   Or does it?
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.720]   Really?
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.720]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.720]   It tick-tocks on Twig.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.720]   It's time for TWIT this week at Tech, the show where we cover the week's Tech News with
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.720]   my little metal dear friend here.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.720]   I get that out of the shop.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.720]   [laughter]
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.720]   Hey, we got a great panel for you.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.720]   Martin, with Upper New York State in the house, Tim Stevens of the Roadshow at CNET.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.720]   Great to see you, Tim.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.720]   Hey, it was great to be here.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.720]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.720]   I know you're an ice racer.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.720]   Is there ice?
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.720]   We had an ice storm yesterday.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.720]   That's about as close as we've got so far.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.720]   We had temperatures in the '60s this past week, so now it's not really been a typical winter.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.720]   I'm looking like another bummer of a season.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.720]   Sorry, Sam.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.720]   What a bummer.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.720]   I think it's just so cool.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.720]   I don't know.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.720]   I always bring that up when I see you.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.720]   It's really cool that you race on ice, which just seems like self-defeating.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.720]   But anyway, that's what turns you on.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.720]   Also, from this week in Google, our dear friend Jeff Jarvis, I guess I got to do the whole rigmarole.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.720]   I can stand up on ice.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.720]   I just fall down.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.720]   Can you imagine?
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.720]   Racing other people on an ice, a frozen lake.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.720]   Jeff is the director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Craig Newmark.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.720]   Craig Newmark.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.720]   Wow, we got a new one.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.720]   Graduate school journalism.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.720]   I do one.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.720]   The City University of New York.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.720]   Very nice.
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.720]   Very nice.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.720]   Good to see you, Jeff.
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.720]   Oh, it's twig- twig gets all the benefit.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.720]   Oh, this is a big show, baby.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.720]   You're not a twiggly at any more.
[00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.720]   Notice I'm wearing a three-piece suit and a bow tie.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.720]   This is serious journalism.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.720]   Also with this.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.720]   Oh, Doctor.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.720]   Oh, and J. J. Stone.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.720]   Speaking of serious journalism, 'tis the seasonings.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.720]   Oh, look at you.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.720]   For seasonings.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.720]   Look at you.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.020]   It's almost like somebody loves me and knows that I like to eat flavorful food, so they
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.120]   sent me some delicious seasonings for Christmas.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.720]   You know that face on that salt, Hank salt, is my son?
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.720]   Did you know that?
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.720]   I did.
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.720]   Oh, good.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.720]   You didn't just think we randomly sent you salt.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.720]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.720]   I'm following them on the TikToks.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.720]   I'm stealing stuff all the time, so I was very honored to have it.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.720]   My daughter wants to take this and keep it for herself.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.720]   I said, "That just seems like it's greedy."
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.720]   I think you should save it.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.720]   I think it's like the first can of Chef Boyardee.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.720]   If you would save that, if you were something today.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.720]   I'm going to do it a whole world here.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.720]   I mean, if that's the case, then send me another pack, because you know I'm going to be cooking.
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.720]   I mean, it's impossible for me not to...
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.720]   It's really good.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.720]   It says "Trouple garlic" on there.
[00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.720]   It's really, really good.
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.720]   I think...
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.720]   And I'm a little prejudiced, but it's...
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.720]   Actually, I guess I have to...
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.720]   Let me ask Professor Jarvis.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.720]   I have to disclose I am an investor in the salt, Hank enterprise.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.720]   I...
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.720]   Yes, I guess you should.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.720]   And I think it's doing very well.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.720]   Good Lord.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.720]   27.4 million for one of his videos on TikTok?
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.720]   Yeah, isn't that amazing?
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.720]   Wow.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.720]   Wow.
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.720]   Wow.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.720]   1.7 million followers.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.720]   Let's see, we get that to 1.8, featuring the show.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.720]   Salt.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.720]   Salt.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.720]   On your score, Hank.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.720]   On the TikTok.
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.720]   And on Instagram, actually, that's where the...
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.720]   Somebody who sent me an email saying, "I don't like your son's videos."
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.720]   He never says what ingredients are in there.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.720]   Well, the TikTok is just like, you know, pretty pictures.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.720]   It's food porn, but all the ingredients are on the Instagram.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.720]   So, follow them on Instagram if you care about the recipes.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.720]   But I think it's really just to look at and make you hungry.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.720]   That's all.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.520]   I will tell you, and I cook.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.720]   I tell you, like 75% of it I'm never going to make up my lifetime.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.720]   But there's like 25% where I'm like, "All right, I got to go to the Amish market like today.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.720]   I need this now."
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.720]   Hey, what's your specialty, O doctor?
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.720]   What's your specialty?
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.120]   Meatballs are my jam.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.720]   I make the best meatballs in the world, and I make the best macaroni and cheese in the world.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.720]   I'm coming over.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.720]   I will do both through the show from there.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.720]   Now let me ask you, because we took you out.
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.320]   I did not know that you considered mac and cheese your specialty.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:41.040]   We took you out when you and your daughter were here to a little restaurant where we had,
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.680]   I think, was lobster mac and cheese.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.680]   Was that...
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.680]   Yes.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.680]   How did that compare?
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.680]   It was adequate.
[00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.680]   It was adequate.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.680]   It was adequate.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.480]   It wasn't bad by any step of the means, and it was good for what it was.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.480]   It was very delicious.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.120]   I just am...
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:57.920]   I'm like a southern snob when it comes back and forth.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.520]   My mac and cheese is my grandmother's recipe.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.280]   My meatball recipe is from my friends Italian grandmother.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.040]   She taught me and didn't teach her granddaughter because she knows that I cook and she doesn't.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.440]   I spent time crafting certain meals and that cook really well.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.360]   So the only time I made meatballs, I brown them in a skillet and then bake them to finish
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.560]   them off, and then you throw them in sauce.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.560]   Is that kind of...
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.040]   Yeah, that's a good way to do it.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.040]   There's multiple ways, but that's a good way.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.040]   I have a good question.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.040]   I have a good question.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.720]   Have you had the Popeyes new macaroni and cheese?
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.720]   Why?
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.720]   Why, Jeff?
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.720]   Why?
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.560]   Every time with the Popeyes.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:44.440]   Well, about the time I got a hold of that chicken sandwich, I started selling them like
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.600]   there were drugs on the street.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.880]   I don't understand why people thought these things were so good.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.880]   Marketing is amazing.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:55.320]   They have tricked the world into believing that diamonds have value and that Popeyes is filling
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.200]   it in macaroni and cheese and chicken sandwich.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.200]   Marketing on human beings.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.200]   What are you saying?
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.200]   It is amazing.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.400]   Popeyes is the de beers of chicken sandwiches.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.400]   Yes.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.400]   Yes.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.520]   They couldn't sell chocolate diamonds because they were trash diamonds and then they'd tell
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.040]   you they're chocolate diamonds and then you gotta have them.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.400]   They're in a bit of a barrel for decades.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.800]   It's not the chocolate.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.800]   It's chocolate.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.800]   Mmm.
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.200]   One of my favorite Leo lines ever is when the sandwich came out and it's kind of thick
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.440]   at one end.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.840]   He said there was a chicken bolus in the sandwich.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.120]   It's got a bolus.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.360]   A chicken in there.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.840]   I'm not a fan.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.720]   I think you should preform this.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.280]   Oh, I think it's good.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.680]   Do you know what you would not like when I was in China and I don't know why I did
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.680]   it.
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.680]   When I was in China, I saw a KFC and I said, "Huh, let me go to a KFC in China.
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.680]   Why not?"
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:44.680]   Yeah, why not?
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.680]   I go to get a chicken sandwich.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.960]   I bite into the chicken sandwich and somehow the breading was around loose pieces of chicken.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.520]   Like it was real chicken.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.120]   Like it wasn't foreign to a patty.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.240]   It was just like I was biting out like breast pieces of chicken out of the breading and
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.600]   I'm like, "This is really weird."
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:04.600]   I don't understand why they say that, you know, the Chinese are going to rule the world
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.440]   and all that.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.440]   But I say, there's a KFC on every corner in China.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.040]   I don't think so.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.040]   I don't think so.
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.720]   I think we are socially and culturally dominant.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.720]   I think it's because they got tourists.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.720]   I don't think so.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.720]   No, no, no.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.720]   The Chinese love KFC.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.720]   Oh, my God.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.720]   Oh, do that.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.720]   Japan as well.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.720]   Huge.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.720]   I was not supposed to.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.720]   I was not supposed to.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.640]   It's not what I was there to.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.640]   There's nobody in there but Americans what I went.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:43.000]   They're calling this log 4 shell exploit the worst security vulnerability in a decade,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   somebody called it.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.800]   I think it's the worst ever and it's the gift it's going to keep on giving discovered
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.560]   the weekend of Thanksgiving.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:59.440]   Log4J is a widely used Java based logging tool from the Apache Foundation.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.840]   It's used everywhere.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.720]   First discovered in Minecraft servers.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.160]   It's very easy to exploit.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:12.920]   It's literally you can put it in the URL of a website and it'll get it entered in the
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:20.800]   log and as soon as it's in the log gets executed and remote command execution profit.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:28.000]   It is now we see being used by nation states dramatically China and others.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.400]   It was a zero day.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:36.600]   It was so easily exploited that the minute it was revealed everybody knew how to do it.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.320]   Everybody's working very hard to resolve this.
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:45.520]   We're also hearing from other security sources that this isn't the only flaw in log4J that
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.800]   there will be others.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:53.760]   That even though you close the back door, you update to the latest version of log4J which
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:55.840]   fixes it.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:00.080]   If you've been compromised, it's the gift that keeps on giving.
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:06.200]   People say for years we're going to run across servers that have this problem.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:12.560]   The US officials said this week that adversarial governments would inevitably seek to exploit
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.440]   the security hole.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.880]   But companies like Mandiant and Microsoft have said that they already have, dudes.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.400]   They already have including China.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.040]   Ransomware attack groups are using the attack.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.040]   Go ahead.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:29.720]   I was going to say, thankfully so far, most of what we've seen has been the typical bot
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.680]   farm and crypto mining stuff.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.880]   But yeah, it's still very early days.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.440]   I've got a good friend who's a sister been at a very large company and he had a very long
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.440]   week.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.440]   Oh, I've done.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.440]   Pashing on bank systems.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.840]   It's been about, I used to be a software engineer and an architect.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.800]   It's been about 15 years since I've written any code.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.640]   I remember using log4J in everything.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.800]   I'm sure some of those things that I wrote way back in the day are probably still running
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.720]   on production servers right now.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.880]   If someone's got the keys to go on and do some updating.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:00.280]   Check one person who created it who's saying, "Oh hell."
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.680]   Well, this is the irony.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.360]   It was created by one guy.
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.520]   It is, of course, as with all open source projects now, there are other committers.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.800]   But they're all volunteers.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.240]   They're all part-time open source developers.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:17.320]   And suddenly they're on the line.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.320]   It's used by everybody.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.320]   It's Java.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:28.920]   There's always that notion that Java is somehow sandboxed and safe, but this clearly shows
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.360]   that it's not.
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:37.600]   I think part of it is the problem is that it's so ubiquitous, as you say, Tim Stevens.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.600]   Everybody uses it.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:42.360]   It's just the default logging tool.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.600]   Part of the problem is it's so easy to exploit.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.600]   I could do it.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.600]   Anybody could do it.
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.240]   It's a simple text string.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.240]   By Tuesday...
[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:55.160]   Because it's running to system logs and really needs pre-level access to these systems to
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.720]   do its job effectively.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.360]   It tends to be given a lot of permissions.
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:02.000]   That means it can do a lot of harm in the wrong hands.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.360]   Checkpoint software says it had counted 600...
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.240]   By the way, this is Tuesday.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.360]   This is almost a week ago.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.880]   600,000 attempts to exploit the bug by malicious cross-siber criminals.
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:20.720]   44% of corporate networks worldwide had been hit by these attempts.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:25.960]   As you said, Tim, a lot of it relatively benign, like crypto miners.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:29.000]   Once you see China and other nation states starting to use it, it's going to be about
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.360]   data exfiltration and perhaps worse.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:38.960]   To date, SISA is unaware of a federal agency being breached, but federal agencies have
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:45.040]   been given till Christmas Eve to patch their software.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.360]   Cancel that vacation, everybody.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.360]   All right, God.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.360]   The attack works.
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.680]   This is what the Wall Street Journal says.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.040]   The attack works reliably and is trivial to exploit.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.440]   That's about as bad as you can get.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.760]   CrowdStrike, Adam Myers, senior vice president of intelligence with CrowdStrike, one of our
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.840]   sponsors says it's a surprise.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.960]   It's not more widespread.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.840]   The question everyone's asking is, what aren't we seeing?
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:21.880]   That's really where this is going to be a long-term problem because I would guess many, many
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:28.240]   servers have been impacted and affected, but the people who have used it are laying low.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:35.120]   They're in there, but they're sitting in there and they will do something later with it.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:40.760]   Terrifying, just really awful.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:45.360]   SISA is actually saying that it probably will affect hundreds of millions of devices.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:50.000]   The thing I say all the time, just to reassure people, it's not affecting your individual
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   computer.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.040]   You're a home user, a business user of Windows or Mac or Linux.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.040]   It's not going to affect you.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.320]   It only affects servers.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.640]   It's the logging tool used for servers.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:05.840]   Definitely, because it affects all servers, including Apple's iCloud, from Minecraft to
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:10.240]   iCloud and everywhere in between, it's very likely that something you use is impacted by
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.280]   it and it could then turn around and bite you.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.600]   That's why it's really important that you keep your own systems up to date because it
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:21.680]   will be looking for weaknesses in your systems.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.040]   Really the people's most affecting people who like Tim used to be sysadmins.
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:31.320]   People have to keep their servers running.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:39.480]   I guess normally on a show like this, we go, "Well, let's point a finger of blame."
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.280]   There's no blame.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:42.280]   This happens.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.480]   It is somebody who said, "Oh, this shows you should never use open source.
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.640]   I don't think that shows that."
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.280]   Yeah, that's not it.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.960]   Everything's got a problem.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.400]   Everything's got a problem.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.120]   Software always has bugs.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:01.280]   In fact, I think you could say the fact that this guy patched almost immediately is testament
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:07.800]   to the fact that these unpaid part-time volunteers who maintain this thing care a lot about quality
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.800]   and fixing it.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.960]   I've also heard a number of people say, "This has been a problem for a lot longer than anybody's
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.200]   admitting.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.560]   I don't know about that.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.560]   I haven't seen that evidence of that yet."
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.960]   Just be careful.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.360]   What's the nightmare scenario?
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.080]   What's the worst that can be done with it?
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:32.280]   Anybody want to use their imaginations?
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.840]   As far as I know, you can run arbitrary code.
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.080]   You can basically inject whatever you want to.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.800]   As far as I know, worst case scenario is basically complete control of any system that's available
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:42.800]   publicly.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:48.480]   Hopefully, things are properly firewalled or even airgapped, truly secure systems like
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.200]   that obviously should be fine.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.640]   I think that's got some kind of public access.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.120]   Potentially is completely exploitable.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:00.000]   At that point, you may be able to get inside of a firewall and gain access to some more
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.040]   secure system that way.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.320]   The potential advantage here is really problematic.
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.880]   Thanks, Tim.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:12.600]   Wired magazine, the next wave of log4j attacks will be brutal.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.200]   This was three days ago.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.920]   That's the Omicron wave, in other words.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:23.560]   Exactly, we've only seen Delta so far.
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:28.120]   It's my guess that a lot of servers have already been compromised, but that the nation
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:33.040]   states who've compromised those servers, the bad actors, are not the script kiddies putting
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.680]   crypto miners on there.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.120]   But people who are saying, "Good, we got access."
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.360]   You want the real nightmare scenario?
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:45.640]   It really is going to depend on how well these servers have been secured if they're
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.360]   opened to the public.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.560]   That's the notion of a server is it's open to the public.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.680]   It's a Minecraft server, it's iCloud, or it's Amazon.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.280]   People are using it.
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:04.240]   If somebody with malicious intent is one of those users, you can do it.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:10.280]   What we've seen in the past is things like our electric grid, not super secure.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:15.440]   In fact, there's evidence that virtually every electrical provider in the country has been
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.840]   compromised in one way or the other.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:24.920]   I think fairly likely that nation state actors, Russia, probably already in the electrical
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.720]   grid, financial services.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:32.920]   I have to think most financial services probably do a better job of securing themselves than
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:39.840]   the nation's electric providers, but they probably still, some of them are online somewhere.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.400]   That could be devastating.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:46.240]   You could bring the grid down, which is worse, turning the power off or destroying America's
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.320]   financial system.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.720]   The financial system.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.680]   That would be pretty bad.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:19:00.720]   You could trigger a recession, a depression, economic meltdown.
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:06.880]   I'm sure our military systems are well protected, except that I wouldn't be surprised at all
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:14.560]   if military contractors don't have somewhere publicly accessible servers or themselves
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.600]   access these servers.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.240]   I suspect it's as bad as it gets.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:23.560]   The only bright side is we are also probably in Russia's electrical grid because they're
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.920]   using it too.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.840]   It's mutually assured destruction.
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.840]   Don't worry.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.840]   All of your NFTs should be safe because they are a person on the table.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.360]   All of your investments, all of our retirement funds really should be totally fine.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:42.640]   If it's on the blockchain, whatever it is, the blockchain, everything's going to be okay.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.360]   It's safe.
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:50.800]   I meet your and CEO of Tenable, Cybersecurity Firm and founding director of US cert.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:58.800]   It is by far the single biggest, most critical vulnerability ever.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.800]   I have to agree.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.560]   I can't think of anything.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.880]   People might say, "Look at Intel's meltdown inspector problem."
[00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.320]   Yeah, but that was really, really hard to exploit.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:11.080]   Every machine has it, but it was really, really hard to exploit.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:15.400]   As far as we know, we haven't seen any exploits in the wild because it took such a skill to
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.400]   implement.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.840]   This, I could do.
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:24.720]   It's not hard at all.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:29.120]   Checkpoint says they've seen 1.8 million attempts to exploit the vulnerability in the
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.440]   past week.
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.200]   In some cases, 100 attempts per minute.
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:39.240]   China and Iran have been spotted using it to establish footholds.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.440]   That's really the thing.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.440]   Footholds is the thing.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:47.200]   I think China and Iran, they're not going in there and putting in crypto miners or defacing
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.200]   your website.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.440]   They're going in there for the long haul.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.600]   They're going in there to live.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.840]   No way to detect it.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:58.440]   Of course, there's always a way to detect APTs.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.880]   There's always a way to find somebody in your server.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.520]   The problem is they're savvy.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.520]   They're good.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.920]   They're probably leaving very little trace.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:12.920]   They're probably being smart enough not to trigger any trip wires.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.640]   I think it's a safe bet that they'll be there undetected for some time.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:22.640]   It's really a question of how well your network technology is defined because, again, this
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.000]   is giving easy access to public servers.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.360]   Realistically, if you're designing your network right, you should be able to have some kind
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:34.320]   of firewall or some kind of a barrier in between these public servers and anything in
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.600]   terms of really truly mission critical stuff.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:41.080]   Like you said, Leo, there's this perception of course that Java is inherently safe.
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.680]   Therefore, I think a lot of admins out there probably were a little bit relaxed and setting
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:49.200]   up access permissions to these and from these job servers thinking, well, there's really
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.360]   low likelihood of anything really dramatic happening.
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:55.960]   Those network technologies aren't correct if there aren't the proper checks and balances
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:00.520]   kind of in place to prevent someone from hopping from a public facing server to something
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.400]   internal that's supposed to be kind of blocked off from the world.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:07.240]   Yeah, that's when this starts to get really problematic.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:17.120]   Anyway, we don't have our usual pundit level information to talk about this because it
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.120]   is.
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:21.560]   There's not much we can say about it.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:25.880]   This is the gift that's going to keep on giving probably for years they're saying that they'll
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:31.560]   be compromised servers in closets everywhere that nobody even pays any attention to that
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.040]   will just be sitting there.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:39.560]   One day you'll log in and boom, you'll be sorry.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.960]   I think probably most servers will be patched pretty quickly.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:43.960]   The patch is out there.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.240]   It's easy to fix.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.800]   But the problem is that patch doesn't eliminate the person who already got in.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:55.080]   It's just closing the barn door after the hackers already inside.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.920]   Anyway, well, this is a depressing show.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.440]   Okay, I'm going to cheer you up.
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.680]   Actually, I'm looking at all the top stories.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.160]   There's nothing to sell a little bit of happy there.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.160]   Nothing happy.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.080]   All right, here's the good news.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.720]   Here's the good news.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:17.760]   Disney's back on YouTube TV.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:23.520]   I hate, I have to say, I really hate these clearance negotiations.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.520]   It happens all the time.
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.560]   It happens with cable networks in local television stations.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.720]   It happens with Roku.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.200]   It happens with Apple TV, YouTube TV.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:36.760]   Disney said, look, if you want to carry our channels, all 18 of them, you've got to give
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.760]   us more money.
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.760]   Google said, well, the heck with you.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.880]   We went back and forth.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.320]   It's really a game of chicken, whoever blinks first, right?
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.320]   We've seen it happen before.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:50.960]   And almost always, these are resolved the day before they're going to pull the plug.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.840]   Well, it didn't happen this time.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.200]   And on Friday, Disney pulled the plug.
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.800]   A lot of Disney channels disappeared from YouTube TV.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.680]   Now, this is not YouTube.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.440]   This is YouTube streaming TV service.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.520]   I actually subscribed to it.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.440]   It's expensive, 65 bucks a month.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.920]   But it's basically like cable.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.520]   It has some nice features.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.720]   It has a DVR for up to six people, everybody in your family.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.720]   Condemu-
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.720]   I'm limited DVR.
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.440]   Except we learned something with this.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.800]   Something really important.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:27.760]   Not only did the channels go away, ESPN, FX, National Geographic, your ABC locals, but all
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:31.520]   your DVR recordings for those channels went away.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.480]   They're not recordings.
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.880]   They're not permanent.
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.040]   They're, I'm not sure how it works.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:40.000]   I'm not sure what the mechanics of it are.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.920]   But when you lose that channel, you lose the DVR recordings.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.600]   So like everything else in the cybersphere, you don't own it.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.600]   You're running.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.600]   They're just pointers.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.600]   They're just pointers.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:56.120]   Google said we've had good faith negotiation with Disney for several months.
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:25:00.080]   Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we've been unable to reach an equitable agreement
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.360]   before our existing one expired.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.440]   Their channels are no longer available on YouTube TV.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.360]   We're going to give you 15 bucks off.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.360]   It is expensive.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.360]   It's 65 bucks.
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.840]   Now, I think that's a little bit of a PR thing on Google's part.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:17.080]   See how much Disney cost is impacting your bottom line.
[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:22.080]   So it went from 65 bucks to $49.99, 50 bucks.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.680]   I'm less interested in fix because I use YouTube TV.
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:32.480]   I'd rather pay the $49.99 than pay the extra $15 because again, as being, at this point,
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.880]   I'm over, I might as well pay for cable again because I have the Hulu package where I get
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.600]   ESPN, Disney and Hulu anyway.
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.240]   So I might as well, I was thinking to myself, what already got it?
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:46.240]   So go ahead and take a $15 off, save me some extra money off the top of my bill.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:50.800]   But that just goes again, like you're about to say that's how much it costs.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.800]   Disney had to flinch.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.240]   I'm happy Disney got to take a little bit less money.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.040]   And then hopefully that means, well, I don't know who flinched.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.200]   It could be Google flinched.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.200]   We don't know.
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.640]   It had to be Disney because goop.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.040]   Okay, if it was Google, they would have not went out and said, I'm going to give you $15
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.720]   discount and all those kinds of stuff because nobody's going to cancel their service right
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.720]   away.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:08.880]   Remember, do you feel the impact?
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:13.120]   All of this is a little bit of jock, like jockeying in the public sphere.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:17.840]   For instance, I think ESPN alone is almost $15.
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.040]   So it's the most expensive cable channel.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.920]   It's wise of the shortage anymore.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:22.920]   It's pretty expensive.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:28.280]   And this weekend, because of the bowl games was a, of course, they always do it like right
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:32.760]   before you're going to really yeah, pissed.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:35.640]   And I, I'm not convinced what we, I don't think we'll ever know.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:40.880]   We never do who blinked, but they, but they, but they took them a day, right?
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:42.360]   So they came for them.
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.360]   It's a game.
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.200]   What I worked, what I worked in the cable is to the side of the cable industry.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.320]   They would all brag that they leave no scrap of meat on the table.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.960]   Even if we're everybody's satisfied, they still just want to fight for the sport of
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:53.960]   it.
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:54.960]   It's a bunch of Logan Royce.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:55.960]   Yes.
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.960]   And each other.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:26:59.960]   Exactly.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:00.960]   That's off.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.960]   That's off.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:08.000]   Lisa, we're talking about this TV show on HBO, which is still, I think the best TV show
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   ever succession.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   It's really good.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   And Lisa loves it.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   In fact, we like it so much.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.720]   We're doing something I'm calling now the rebinge where the season three ended.
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.720]   And now we're so desperate.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.000]   We're actually starting over.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.240]   We're just going to keep watching.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:25.040]   How do I keep hearing people say it's the best TV show ever?
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.040]   I know you.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.600]   Okay, you don't agree.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:29.600]   That's fine.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.520]   You know, it's not only do I not agree.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:33.800]   It's just like, that is such hyperbole.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:39.040]   I live in a world of like breaking bad, the sopranos better, better, better, like better.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:41.640]   Yeah, it never is bad.
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.640]   It's better.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.640]   It's the Shakespeare of our time.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.400]   But anyway, you don't, we don't have to agree on that.
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.400]   That's not important.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:50.720]   Lisa, Lisa has started using Logan isms against me.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:54.880]   The other day she says, stop buzzing in my ear.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:55.880]   What?
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.280]   Has she yet told you to F off?
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.280]   Oh, yes.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.280]   Many times.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.960]   I'm sure that was, I was sure I was pre succession.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.720]   No, no, well, maybe.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.720]   Okay.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.920]   But she's gotten more eloquent in it.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:10.920]   Thanks to Logan.
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.560]   Anyway, it's a bit with the accent.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:13.560]   Does she do the accent?
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:14.560]   She does it like it.
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.160]   Yeah, she does it exactly like Logan does.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:23.120]   Brian, the great Shakespearean actor, Brian Cox, who's I think 76 is in his 70s.
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.920]   He's the, he's the eminent squeeze of this show.
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.920]   He's wonderful.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:30.360]   In fact, the episodes without him are not quite as good, I have to say.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.360]   Yes.
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.360]   He's so good.
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:37.400]   But they give him some, every actor in this show is brilliant and the writing is brilliant.
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:42.960]   So they all have wonderful lines, but they give Logan such, such salty speech.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.960]   It's wonderful.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:49.640]   In any event, it's a show about a media mogul, Logan Royce, kind of the Rupert Murdoch.
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:55.120]   But, but in every negotiation he has, there's, there's one of him and everybody else gets
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.120]   cowed.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:01.440]   I feel like with these, it's too Logan Royce going, and nobody's the winner.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.680]   You know, who's the loser?
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.680]   Us.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.720]   In every case, these carriage battles, it's us.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:13.400]   It's the users who are harangued by the cable company saying, you're going to lose the CW,
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:18.920]   write them a letter, they're going to, and, and if, and if it very rarely happens, but
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:23.600]   in this case, it's like this one where you do lose a channel, maybe you didn't see the,
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.160]   what's the Jimmy Kimmel bowl?
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:30.240]   How does he get a bowl, by the way?
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.640]   That's what I want the Leo bowl.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.640]   Really?
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:34.680]   There's a Jimmy Kimmel bowl.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.680]   That's the way.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:39.720]   Anyway, so you're going to, you're not going to get to see the Jimmy Kimmel bowl, but,
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.560]   and I think that was the whole negotiation strategy behind.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:46.440]   You see, back in the day that, back in the day that affected the user, but now, you know,
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.240]   I don't get stars network.
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.240]   Okay.
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:51.040]   Well, I'll just go pay $2.99 a month to get stars.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.040]   That's true.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.040]   In many ways.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:56.640]   Like before, before, like, yeah, oh man, I don't have the, guess what?
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.640]   Everybody's got their own app.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:01.560]   If you take it, like I said, if they took this away from me, I don't care.
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:05.440]   It didn't freak out and buy the one I would, I logged in the day, had this big blip on my
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.240]   screen, sorry, no longer.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.240]   I said, okay, cool.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.640]   Now I got to actually go to their native app.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.200]   Oh, it sucks for me.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.200]   It's so hard.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.200]   Now they have to worry about that.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.200]   The user doesn't suffer anymore.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.200]   The world's changed.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.200]   I'm still paying too much for subscriptions.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.840]   YouTube TV is my favorite of all of these.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:25.440]   Hulu has streaming service where you get local channels.
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:30.840]   And it is in fact one of the US's biggest internet pay TV services, according to variety,
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.120]   four million subscribers.
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.800]   They don't reveal numbers, but that's the end.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:35.800]   That's pretty small.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.760]   Yeah, it's small, but it's in a universe where there's a million little.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.200]   And it's kind of grow like crazy.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.200]   Yeah.
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:45.440]   YouTube TV had more than three million customers in the third quarter of 2020.
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.480]   So it is growing.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.480]   Hulu plus computer.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.480]   What do you like about it?
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.200]   Is there anything beyond just what it has, what it offers and channels?
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.200]   Or is there anything?
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.200]   Well, and the DVR.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:01.640]   If you've got Logan Roy money, because it is the most expensive of these, it's 65 bucks.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:07.720]   And if you're willing to pay an additional $20 a month, so it's $85 a month, they have
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.080]   4K content.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.800]   Not a lot of 4K content yet.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:16.640]   But if you have a 4K TV, it's one way to get see a lot of, for instance, NFL is not in
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.360]   4K, but a lot of college football, weirdly is.
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:23.120]   So if you want 4K sports, this is one of the best ways to get it.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.120]   The other thing.
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.120]   Look at that green.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.120]   It's so green, isn't it?
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.280]   Oh, I've never seen green like this.
[00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.280]   You know what?
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:34.360]   If you're a football fan, it's the difference between watching it on TV and being in the stands.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.120]   You really feel like you're right there.
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.360]   I can see the sweat in their armpits.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.000]   Almost can smell it.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   The other thing I like is the DVR.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.840]   Although it's very interesting to see that the DVR, you lose the rights to your content
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.840]   if the channel goes away.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.960]   I don't know why you didn't think that that would happen.
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:55.760]   It's in the servers, in the clouds, not on your device.
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.880]   I know, but you recorded it, right?
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:01.200]   I mean, no, no, you recorded on there.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.280]   Yeah, you say, you didn't record it, you saved it.
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.920]   But you saved ads on your hard drive.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:06.920]   It's a bookmark.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:07.920]   Okay, but bookmark.
[00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:09.920]   Okay, yeah.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:11.920]   It's not, it's not Tevo.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.400]   I don't have a box in my house.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.960]   No, I'm not that stupid.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.880]   Well, I mean, you sound it right now.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:20.240]   Stop complaining about the thing you're playing about.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:23.680]   And side note, obviously, I should never say anything that because you're the smartest
[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:24.880]   person I know besides yourself.
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:25.880]   You're a genius.
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:26.880]   But let me tell you something.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:30.440]   If you're looking right now, if you have it, I know Uncle Leo said it's expensive.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.480]   But if you have family that lives in your Tri-S A-
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.480]   That's right.
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.480]   Cap you globally.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.320]   I've got up to six family members.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.120]   I've got four on my line right now.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.120]   That's right.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.120]   25 hours a piece.
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.120]   I actually make 20.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:45.560]   You charge your family members for access to your YouTube TV.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.200]   I have to pay.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.640]   They have to pay.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:51.160]   And $25 is better than 65.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.160]   Is it not?
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:56.920]   I'm not good at math, but I'm just saying $25 is better than 65.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:01.800]   So if you're out here and you live in California, you just hook up six people on the line and
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:02.800]   you're good to go.
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.480]   You can't go out of your region though because they're smart.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:08.120]   And they stop it and only give you three weeks of viewing because I have like 42 accounts
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.120]   all comes country.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.560]   But you get the New York station.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.800]   You get the New York station and the Philly stations.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.520]   I get the Philly stations.
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.840]   I think that's one of the.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:19.080]   So we don't get locals here.
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.440]   You have to get cable.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.600]   I guess if you have an antenna 50 feet above your house, you might.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.640]   But we're far enough from the big city that we don't get anything.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:31.240]   We get like one UHF station up the road a bit.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:36.000]   So I need something and YouTube TV gives in the San Francisco locals.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   That's good.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.280]   It is good.
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:43.840]   You know what's the only negative is you can't.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:48.960]   So with the Tivo, you can skip easier skip commercial.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.880]   I shouldn't talk about this.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:54.240]   Never ever skip commercials, boys and girls.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:58.280]   It's like it's a moral.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.280]   You should feel guilty.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.280]   It's unethical.
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.280]   It's wrong.
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.280]   Ask.
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.800]   You should say for hail lio's every time you do it.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:09.480]   So the YouTube TV scrubber is not depends, I guess, on what device you're using.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.000]   But on the Apple TV, you got to do it like this.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.160]   But then I realized this was a big real thing.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.040]   If you live this life, you'd be happier.
[00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:17.040]   You need this life.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.200]   This is what right here.
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.200]   Does that get better?
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.200]   Oh, they're remote.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:22.280]   Oh, I'll be skipping to do that day all day long.
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:25.280]   This thing right here is the quickness right here.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.920]   See, you in the Apple universe, you got to get over here to the air universe.
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:29.280]   Once you get into the air device.
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:31.480]   Hey, I found a workaround.
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:32.920]   Siri will skip for you.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:39.320]   So you can say, "Diri, skip ahead one minute, two minutes, whatever length you want."
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:46.800]   So the only time I skip is if I have a recorded football game or the F1 races or things like
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.760]   that where I just want to see the results, right?
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.960]   But you can say, and with football, you know that's going to be a minute break.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:53.960]   That's going to be a two minute break through.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.000]   So you can say skip ahead.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.680]   Or as you would say, "Skippity doodah."
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:04.560]   And also, with the fun that they do with sports is if I come into a game and I'm late, I could
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.000]   just hit that catch up on all the key moments thing.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   Love that.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.640]   That they have and they really do have all the key moments.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.640]   That's YouTube at work.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:12.640]   That's YouTube.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.800]   And I thought, yes, I was like, "Man, this isn't going to work out.
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.800]   Let me see this works."
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:19.360]   I watched three games like that and they hit the notes boy.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.320]   It was like, it was impressive.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.960]   That's the other great benefit of YouTube TV.
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.640]   It has that summary kind of.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.640]   Yeah, it really do a good job.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.720]   All right.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.200]   So now we have we sold you.
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.200]   That's a happy.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.200]   That was a happy, right?
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.200]   That was happy.
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.520]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:38.200]   Now that we're ending on a happy note, it'll be a good time to do a commercial.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.200]   We'll come back.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:48.440]   Love it having you guys on our last show of the year exactly.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:51.960]   So we're going to have next Sunday, it will be a little bit prerecorded.
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:56.560]   It's the best of, not best of holiday special, Twit.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:00.640]   And this year, you know, you've been on that Jeff in the past.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:01.880]   We actually flew hosts in.
[00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:03.080]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.080]   But this year-
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.080]   Those were the days.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.360]   Those were the days because of Omicron.
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.520]   We aren't even going to be able to have people in the studio.
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:14.200]   So our holiday special will feature our in-house hosts, Jason Howell, Mike Asargent, Ant Pruitt
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.400]   and I.
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:20.320]   And we'll gather virtually with our virtual eggnog and have some fun.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:24.760]   That'll be the holiday special December 26th, a week from today.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:29.720]   And then the following week, January 2nd, is our best of where you've been hearing us
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:33.600]   ask all year long, you know, let us know what the best moments were in Twit so we could
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.600]   pile them.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.600]   Those are always fun.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:37.880]   And then we'll be back live on January 9th.
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.440]   That's actually going to be a special show as well.
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.360]   That's going to be our prognosticator show.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:48.560]   This was something Amy Webb who's a regular on Twit said, "I would like to come on."
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.560]   She's a futurist.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.920]   That's what she does.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.600]   She helps companies strategize plan for the future.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:57.560]   She said, "I'd like to come on and do a kind of look ahead to the future show."
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.720]   I thought, "That's a great idea."
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:00.960]   So Amy Webb will join us.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.160]   Then I thought, "Well, we shouldn't just have a futurist.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:06.520]   We should have somebody whose imagination lives in the future.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.120]   Daniel Suarez will join us."
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:14.920]   He's of course one of my favorite science fiction authors, Demon, Freedom, TM, a home
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:19.440]   bunch of books in which he's really, that's especially, is thinking about what the future
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.880]   will bring.
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.040]   We're also working on a third and I won't say any names yet.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:27.800]   We've reached out to some very interesting people, but I wanted to get a scientist.
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:35.240]   A scientist, a science fiction author, and a futurist walked into a twit bar.
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:37.240]   That should be a very interesting episode.
[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:38.240]   No, Leo.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:41.720]   Can I do a looking back show?
[00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:48.080]   You know, I remember when Gutenberg invented the Bible.
[00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:50.680]   I could do the whole 400 years of history.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.960]   Actually, that's a great idea.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:56.920]   We should mention for those of you not watching video, Jeff is somewhere found a Gutenberg
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:57.920]   t-shirt.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:01.600]   Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:03.960]   At the Gutenberg Museum in months.
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:04.960]   Watch this.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:09.000]   Stop buzzing in my ear!
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.240]   Place is here with Christmas cookies for everyone.
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.240]   Lisa!
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.240]   Hi Lisa.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.240]   They're all saying hi to you.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:16.240]   Hi Lisa.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:17.240]   Oh, these look really good.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.240]   I might eat bacon and a fish.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.240]   Sugar cookies, gingerbread.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.120]   Oh, also, also side note.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.520]   Oh, I was just texted.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:32.480]   If you use custom guide with your YouTube TV, you can re-add all of the Disney channels
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.720]   and they will appear.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:37.160]   DVR recordings and save library items will remain also.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.160]   No, I know.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.800]   That was the thing.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.200]   When they went away, the DVR went away.
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.560]   When they came back, so did the DVR.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.960]   You got to say that out loud.
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.880]   You have me thinking all my old stuff was going on.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.880]   Oh, no, no.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:50.880]   That's the beauty of it.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.680]   As long as you got an agreement, you can have it.
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:53.680]   All right.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:54.680]   Well, we agree on the agreement.
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:55.680]   Yeah.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.680]   For today.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:58.680]   Let's take a little break.
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:01.400]   Well, I eat a gingerbread man.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:02.640]   He bit his head off.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:06.120]   Do you start with the toes or do you go with the head?
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.120]   I work with it.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.120]   They're all the same.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.120]   It's all the same.
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.120]   You can't really tell.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.120]   It's just a cookie, folks.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:16.160]   You buy stamps.com.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.640]   This is a tough time at the post office.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.640]   I love the post office.
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.800]   I love my postal workers.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:25.160]   I know we know our mail carriers name by, you know, I won't say her name, but we know
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:26.160]   her and she's great.
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:29.040]   We give her a Christmas card and we'll bonus every year.
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:34.280]   But I have to say, you don't want to go to the post office around this time of year
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.560]   because there's all that's amateur hour.
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:41.800]   All the people who go to the post office once a year will be there with 20 packages
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.800]   in their arms and you will be in line.
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:46.720]   I've been watching the lines get longer and longer.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:49.000]   Here's a pro tip.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.240]   You don't need to.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:53.560]   You don't need to go drive down the post office, wait and line on there.
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:55.240]   Because you've got stamps.com.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.720]   You can do everything you would do in the post office without leaving your desk with
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:39:59.880]   your computer, your printer.
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:02.400]   You don't need a postage meter.
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.720]   Stamps.com is amazing.
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:08.320]   And by the way, it's not just the US Postal Service anymore.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:11.880]   Stamps.com also does UPS.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:16.320]   So now, I mean, this is now the all in one service you need.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:22.620]   Stamps.com lets you compare rates between UPS, USPS, various services that each offer,
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.680]   print labels for packages.
[00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:27.440]   You could even print right on the envelope for the Postal Service.
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:29.520]   Plus, and I love this, you'll get discounts.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.800]   You cannot get anywhere else.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:34.080]   You can't get at the Postal Service.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:38.920]   We are, I love stamps.com, they've been an advertiser on our shows.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:41.920]   This is, we're now going into our tenth year.
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:44.140]   We've been using them for even longer.
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:48.240]   If you haven't tried them yet, I got to ask, I don't know what, how can I entice you?
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:51.720]   I don't know what you're waiting for, except that this is the time of year.
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:55.920]   Whether you're selling online, or especially if you are, if you're eBay, Etsy, Amazon,
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:01.360]   seller, and you know, stamps.com actually pull the address from the website.
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.160]   You can put a logo on there.
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:07.000]   You can put your return address, all of this automatic, less data entry on your part.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.080]   Plus, you always have exactly the right postage.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:12.120]   I can't tell you how many times I've received packages for Etsy.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.720]   Clearly they licked the stamps.
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.840]   They put the wrong number on there.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.720]   Postage do is not a good look for your business.
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.120]   Stamps.com can do it right.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:24.360]   You'll even get a USB scale, so you put exactly the right postage.
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:29.520]   You get all the services, the post office, and UPS without taking the trip.
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:39.360]   Discounts up to 40%, 40% off US Postal Service rates and 76% off UPS.
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.360]   It's amazing.
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.520]   Go into the post office instead of using stamps.com.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.560]   What's like taking the stairs?
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.120]   Take the elevator.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.520]   I guess if you're just going on a couple of floors, take the stairs.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:54.760]   But if you're going up 30 flights a day, you need stamps.com.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:58.840]   Stamps.com for anyone who spends more than a few minutes a week dealing with mailing
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:01.360]   and shipping, you'll save time, you'll save money.
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.800]   It's just the right way to do it.

[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:04.800]   Here's a great deal.

[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:27.840]   This year.
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.160]   I know you've been thinking about it.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:30.640]   Let's do it this time.
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:35.560]   Stamps.com, click the microphone, enter the code TWIT.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:37.360]   Thank you stamps.com.
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:41.720]   Do you still, Owen, you still do a UPS store, right?
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.000]   Yes.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.920]   But since you bring it up, I'm going into a pre-reretirement after our Christmas Eve this
[00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:48.920]   year.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.600]   Oh, is that good or bad?
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.800]   What are you eating, by the way?
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.600]   Are you eating a Mountball macaroni and cheese?
[00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:56.840]   You had a cookie, so I figured I'd have something to say.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:57.840]   Okay.
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.640]   I didn't mean to interrupt your cookie.
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.720]   No, no, no, you're fine.
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:05.680]   No, pre-reretirement is me just not having to go back in the store.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:10.600]   Since COVID happened, it was hard hiring people and keeping people in.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:14.960]   So I had to actually go into the stores and work for the last year and a half, but that
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.760]   ends on Friday.
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:17.760]   Yay.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.160]   Congratulations.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.160]   Going back to just collecting my royalty checks as it were.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.160]   That's nice.
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:24.160]   Have you?
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.600]   I've experienced what they're calling the great resignation.
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:35.800]   Yes, which is so what happens is it cracks me up so much because there is a thing to
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.640]   where people are like, "Oh, nobody wants to work."
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.400]   No, nobody wants to work for you.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.840]   I think that's right.
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:41.840]   I think that's right.
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:42.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:46.440]   You know, there's a kid that I hired, I call my kid.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:48.840]   I don't know why I hate when I call people because he's a grown man.
[00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:53.320]   Anyway, he worked at Target for three years and he's a hardworking guy.
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:54.840]   He's like, "I just wanted to raise.
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:56.240]   I wanted to be promoted."
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.240]   And they would not promote me.
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:00.400]   And he comes to the store the time because he's doing side houses and whatever and he's
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.400]   complaining.
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.400]   I'm like, "Dude, I need somebody.
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.400]   Come work for me."
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:04.400]   I hire him.
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:07.360]   This kid buses, but he's making more money now than he was there.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:10.840]   And they call him every week, promising him a manager position to come back.
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:15.000]   And he's like, "No, because when I was there, you wouldn't pay me and give me any kind
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   of increase."
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.840]   He's like, "So what I want to come back there because you need people and you're not going
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:22.640]   to give me what I would deserve for growth?"
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:26.880]   So nowadays, you're like, "Look, I can go work a Sam's Club or Costco making $24 an
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:27.880]   hour.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:32.440]   I get an email from Amazon every day saying, "Look, we'll pay you $3,000 bonus in a week
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:34.440]   and we're paying, first it was $18.
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:36.160]   It was $22 now it's up to $24.
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:37.920]   So I mean, there's options out there."
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:42.240]   So when you go to a store and they say, "Oh, we can't find help.
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.240]   Look at yourself."
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.240]   I think that's true.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.240]   What you're offering?
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.240]   Yeah.
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:50.240]   I mean, people are, I guess they're not dumb.
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:53.960]   They're going to take the job that's competitive.
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:54.960]   It's competition.
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:55.960]   It's competition.
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.600]   Hey, Capitalist, welcome to Capitalism.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:02.280]   I'm not sure I'd want to work in an Amazon warehouse for any price though.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:04.840]   Well, Amazon's had huge problems this last two weeks.
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:05.840]   Yeah, they're claps.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:10.200]   Talking about UPS store, that happened and their systems went down multiple times.
[00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:15.440]   I love when I get an email that says, "We get a big red alert in the morning because we
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:18.440]   pre-seated the system down for returns and things like that."
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:21.840]   And it says in there, "Don't tell anything to the customers.
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.480]   Don't tell them the system down."
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:27.280]   And I'm like, "If you turn on the news, it's on nine o'clock morning or so."
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:30.960]   So I'm supposed to get cussed out by customers because your stuff is working, but I'm not
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.160]   going to tell them that your system's down.
[00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:37.520]   When they get, it's on ABC 20 minutes ago, like, "No, dude, I'm telling everybody, "Yo,
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:38.520]   Amy, it's Amazon."
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:39.720]   Can they enforce that though?
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:42.280]   Can they make it hard for you to work with them if you...
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.280]   No, no.
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:47.280]   It's a suggestion from them because, yes, you don't embarrass us.
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:48.280]   Thank you very much.
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:52.040]   I mean, just in our stores, we do a lot of volume.
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:56.040]   And like I said, I wish I could talk to someone at Amazon because there's so many scams that
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.120]   see people doing, and I can't say anything about it.
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.360]   I just got to sit there and watch it go.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.520]   But I wonder how much money they lose left and right.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.240]   And again, when their system was down, that was really bad.
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:09.440]   Like the whole nation, you couldn't return anything for like a day and a half.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:10.440]   No returns.
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.440]   People are upset.
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:15.480]   Are the scams you're seeing people returning stuff?
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:21.000]   So I'll tell you two scams that make me angry physically, angry.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.640]   Halloween comes November 2nd.
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.480]   Families come in with five costumes.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:29.280]   One for the mom, one for the dad, one for his kid.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.600]   And they're like, "Oh, didn't work out."
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:35.400]   So you went and trick or treated and got this costume all funky and returned it because
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:39.000]   you don't have to look at a person, you'd never go to a Halloween store and return those
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   costumes.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:42.360]   You would never walk into Walmart and return to the sky and say, "Look at you."
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:45.240]   But when you go on Amazon, you click and you click and you ain't got to talk to nobody,
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.560]   you walk and you hand it to me.
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:47.560]   I don't wear a frame.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.560]   I don't care.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:49.560]   I have to think.
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:53.640]   My store alone, we do thousands of Halloween costumes, returns every year.
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.640]   I have to.
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:55.640]   Because people found out about it.
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.640]   Amazon knows this and they go, "Well, it's the cost of doing business.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:00.880]   We're still making money."
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:04.800]   But there's so many individual people out there that are losing money on that too.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:08.400]   Again, I don't know how the math works out, but I'm like, "Man alive.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.720]   That's just one thing that I see."
[00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:14.000]   My other favorite thing is because again, because you're not checking the product, why
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   are you sitting here?
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   I shouldn't be sitting.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   I guess people could learn more to do it.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.680]   Anyway, you come in and you say you bought an apple, right?
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:23.920]   This is why you listened to it, ladies and gentlemen, to learn how to scam Amazon.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:25.360]   You bought an apple from Amazon.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:29.840]   You come into me again, not an Amazon employee and you're returning it and you give me a
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:33.440]   penny in the bag and I just close up the bag and put the label on it.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:34.720]   Now it goes back to the warehouse.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:38.160]   Now sometimes they just bulk ship them off somewhere else, but half the time nobody's
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.160]   checking.
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:43.480]   So once people realize that you could get away with this, you get away with it.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.480]   Now mind you, I've got the point at times.
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:46.480]   You buy expensive and return some expensive.
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:47.480]   Yes.
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:48.480]   Yes.
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:53.240]   Now mind you, just so people don't go crazy, there was a guy who just got caught.
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:48:00.240]   After $290,000 of the stuff, he'd buy a $1,200 laptop, send in a $300 laptop return.
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:04.480]   He'd buy a $400 toaster and send a $25 toaster return.
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:10.200]   But after a while he got caught up and went, "How did you let it go up to $200,000, $500,000?"
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.200]   Wow.
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.640]   People come in, I had a guy come in with a trash can.
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:16.800]   It was one of those fancy, and the box was empty.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:20.400]   I said, "Sir, did you forget the trash can?"
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:23.680]   He's like, "No, it came delivered like this to me, so I'm returning it to Amazon."
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:25.680]   And I'm like, "Okay."
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:28.600]   But it's not your job to enforce those rules.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:30.640]   No, I can't say anything about it.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:32.560]   I don't just let the button go on.
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:35.560]   But when I see it, it's in recurrence of my men.
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:37.120]   People catch on really quick.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:40.360]   So, I got some attention from Amazon.
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:41.360]   Go ahead.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.360]   Go ahead, Tim.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:45.320]   That actually can burn consumers down the road to.
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:49.360]   I actually bought a roof rack attachment kit for a car.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.960]   And it was on Amazon warehouse use.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.640]   So it was like 20% cheap, so that's not sure.
[00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:55.640]   It's no big deal.
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:56.640]   I'll save some money.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.240]   I get it, and it's actually the wrong kit.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:01.680]   And what somebody had done was purchased the kit that they needed for their car, but
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:04.920]   the kit for their old car in the box, which is like Amazon.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.200]   Amazon hadn't actually checked it.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.600]   So they just said, "Oh, it's in good shape."
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:10.080]   So we'll sell it as used through Amazon warehouse.
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.920]   And then they sold it to me, and I get it, and it's the wrong kit, because it's the
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:16.360]   kit from the previous person's last car that they had returned and got in a full refund
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:17.360]   on.
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:21.120]   So, it's kind of carried down the road and burned the next person.
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:22.120]   All right.
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.720]   I'm going to admit an embarrassing story.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.880]   I think I told this on Twig, Jeff.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.040]   But I'm going to further embarrass myself.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:34.920]   I spent, when at the heart of the COVID thing, I thought, "I've got to get a big HEPA filter
[00:49:34.920 --> 00:49:39.600]   that can do the whole house, like a thousand cubic meters of air."
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:44.880]   So I got a giant, it was like $700, but because it was the time, you couldn't get a new one.
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:49.760]   So I got a giant one that was used, and as I've been running it for a year, and after
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:52.840]   a year, the light comes on and says, "You need to replace the filters."
[00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:55.360]   So I open it up and say, "Well, where are the filters?"
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.880]   And I got online.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:01.400]   I'd been running it for a year without the filters because somebody...
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.040]   I know what happened.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:07.040]   Somebody bought it new, took out the filters, returned it, got their money back, but they
[00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:10.080]   got the $100 worth of filters for free.
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:12.280]   And I end up buying the one.
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:15.080]   I foot the bill because I bought the one...
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.800]   And you had dirty air for a year.
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:19.760]   And I didn't even know it because I didn't look at it.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:24.040]   I'm so angry at you, and I'm so angry at that company.
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:27.800]   First of all, the fact that it didn't alert you that there was no filter in the system
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:29.800]   for over a year, it just shows you...
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:33.960]   And those lights that come on and say it's time for a new filter have nothing to do with
[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:34.960]   anything.
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:37.120]   They're just a timer, I guess.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:40.920]   And second of all, you need to check everything you open.
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:43.160]   Well, I didn't know how it worked.
[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:45.680]   I thought the filters were inside or something.
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:46.680]   I didn't know...
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:47.680]   You're a nerd.
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:49.680]   The first thing I want to do...
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:50.680]   I got air filters too.
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:51.680]   I go look at them.
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:52.680]   I'm trying to look at the design.
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:55.760]   I'm trying to make sure that the thing ain't got extra holes in it.
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:57.680]   Well, I will from now on.
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:58.680]   I've looked at filters.
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:00.440]   Maybe I'm just a loser, but I look at filters.
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:01.440]   I want to know what kind of...
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.440]   For a whole year.
[00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:03.440]   I've been going there.
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:04.440]   We're safe.
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:05.440]   We're safe.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:06.440]   We've got the filters.
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.440]   We've got all the air is clean.
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.440]   We're safe.
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:09.440]   Nothing.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.680]   You've been running a $700 fan and I'm so sad right now.
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:14.880]   I'm so sad with you right now.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:17.120]   So I had to return a TV to Costco.
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:19.440]   They checked the serial number.
[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:21.600]   They checked everything.
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:22.600]   Which could have on them.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:25.600]   But I also got some from Amazon that was expensive.
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:26.600]   And it was defective.
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:28.560]   It wasn't working well.
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:29.880]   I wanted to return it.
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:33.440]   They first gave me some rigor oil and they said, "Okay."
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:34.440]   And they said, "Just keep it."
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:35.680]   I said, "I'm not trying to keep it.
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:36.680]   I don't want to keep it.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:37.680]   I want to return it."
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:38.680]   No, no, just keep it.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:39.680]   Yes.
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.000]   There's certain list of items that they can't return.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.880]   Again, I shouldn't say these things either.
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:46.680]   There's certain things that they can't return to people.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:49.160]   They won't take back.
[00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:52.400]   Anything that ever had any kind of fuel in it, they tell you, "Just keep it."
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:55.280]   Anything that's a medical device that's been touching your skin.
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.280]   They tell you, "Keep it."
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:58.160]   Which I'm wondering, "How do they take back clothes then?"
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.320]   Because I put the clothes on.
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:00.400]   They touch my skin.
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:02.160]   But anyway, that's the new here and the other.
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:07.000]   Nobody wants to buy a used, you know, a philosophy bag or something.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.440]   Well, you go right there, Leo.
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:13.240]   You want to go over and watch a possible illustration.
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:16.200]   You know, you might be able to buy a used jacket.
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:20.120]   But if it's, you know, I mean, if it's a, you know, a hernia belt, you're not going
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:23.720]   to maybe want to buy somebody's old hernia belt.
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:28.840]   And shout out to Costco, after Christmas, go on a hashtag Costco on Christmas tree.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:32.040]   People return Christmas trees after Christmas day and New Year's Day.
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.960]   Yes, because Costco will return anything.
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:37.840]   They do check all the numbers, but you can return anything to Costco.
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:41.640]   If you bought a bed from like Sam's Club Costco's or B-Dizz, that's one of the things they can't
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:42.640]   take back.
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:46.040]   I'm not going to ask you this, Owen, because I know what your answer will be.
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:47.040]   What's my answer?
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.040]   No, I know your answer.
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:51.320]   So I'm going to ask Jeff and Tim, and then I know what your answer is going to be.
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:53.520]   Do you think people are more dishonest than they used to be?
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:57.680]   I know you think they are because you see the worst of life, Owen.
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:59.840]   But Jeff, this, I mean, what is all of this?
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:02.080]   This is all little minor scams.
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:04.160]   And I think some of it is because it's anonymous.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.360]   I think Owen's right.
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:11.360]   But this is these little like people just in, do people care less than they used to about
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:15.400]   just order the way they feel like it ripped off more and this is their, this is their
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:16.800]   recompense or I don't know.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:17.800]   Maybe that's it.
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.360]   Maybe they feel justified.
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:20.880]   You and I are old and grumpy, Tim.
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:21.880]   What do you think?
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:27.160]   No, I definitely think that there is a general perception of I deserve this, which is, I think
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:28.440]   it's more widespread than before.
[00:53:28.440 --> 00:53:30.680]   But honestly, I think that it's just easier than before.
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:34.240]   Like Owen said, there's no eye contact with anyone who's really directly affected.
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:39.200]   So I think that that level of corruption or whatever it is, it probably roughly the same
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:40.200]   place it was before.
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:42.840]   It's just so much easier to do it now that more and more people are doing it.
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:44.840]   And Owen, so what are you going to say?
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:46.760]   I'm going to give you the chance now.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:50.960]   So this is what I tell people about the world, right?
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:52.720]   The world is the exact same.
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:55.960]   I hear people say all the time, kids nowadays don't want to work.
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:59.600]   My son doesn't want to, back in my day, I was like, first of all, who raised the kids
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:00.600]   that are in this day?
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:01.600]   You did.
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:05.280]   Second of all, I remember when they used to make kids work in mines and coal fields and
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:08.000]   I remember slavery and I remember people, waterboarding people.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.120]   I remember Romans and Egyptians and slaves.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:15.160]   I remember the whole world being crappy throughout history because human beings are crappy.
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:18.240]   So the world is a beautiful ugly place.
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:21.480]   There's always been crime, there's always been theft, it's just on different levels.
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:24.080]   Ask Alexander Gray how he acquired so much.
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:28.280]   Did he just get it for free or did he do something extra to go get it?
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:31.440]   So getting the Halloween costumes is stummy for sure.
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:36.840]   But I mean, human history is shown that we are beautiful, evil creatures throughout the
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.440]   arc of our time in this planet.
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:42.800]   So I'm not saying it's worse right now when it was yesterday because my great grandfather
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:47.080]   would disagree about how I'm living, talk on a show with you guys as opposed to how he
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:48.440]   had to go above that.
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:52.040]   That's Stephen Pinker's contention.
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:56.840]   He says, "You think we're more violent, but really if you compare it with history, we're
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:57.840]   less violent."
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:04.840]   Although I have to say the 20th century was pretty darn violent and nasty because weapons
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:08.240]   of mass destruction, we were able to kill more than ever before.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:11.480]   So anyway, Pinker makes a pretty strong case.
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:16.480]   Oh, the 30 years war was pretty awful.
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:19.840]   It's not that they wouldn't have used weapons of mass destruction, they just didn't have
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:20.840]   them.
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:23.040]   That's what it went on for 30 years.
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:24.040]   I did a panel.
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:25.040]   Wait a minute.
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:27.040]   How long were we in Afghanistan?
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:28.040]   That's true.
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:29.040]   Not quite.
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:30.040]   We got to 20.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:32.040]   We would have gone to 30.
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:33.040]   Could have easily.
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:37.760]   Well, the Swedes just kind of did big stuff in Europe, but then they became Swedes.
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:38.760]   Right.
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:39.760]   Now they're nice.
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:40.760]   But you can't change.
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:41.760]   All of a sudden.
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:42.760]   Other Swedes.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:43.760]   They're nice.
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:44.760]   Beautiful, horrible place.
[00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:45.760]   Maybe humans have been bad all along.
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:46.760]   Just feel like they did.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:47.760]   That's what we do, baby.
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:48.760]   That's what we do.
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:51.040]   It's not a big evil.
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:56.160]   It's kind of a low level of I'm going to get mine kind of thing.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:59.960]   It's the hubris of present tense that we think everything the matter is worse.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:01.400]   No, I guess you're right.
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:05.600]   You know, I have to say there is one social network I really like.
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:09.360]   You know, I know you're a big Twitter fan, Jeff.
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:13.680]   But to me, Reddit gives me the news I want.
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:14.880]   It's the social network I want.
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:19.320]   And I realized I was thinking the other day why I like Reddit because I am an enthusiast.
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:24.560]   You know, I get excited about a thing and I want to go all in on it.
[00:56:24.560 --> 00:56:27.600]   And with Reddit, I could say, good, I'm going to follow those three subs.
[00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:31.200]   And then when I move on to the next thing, I unfollow them and I follow the next three
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:32.200]   subs.
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:36.920]   So Reddit always kind of is perfectly suited to the thing I'm interested in right now.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:38.960]   I happen to think it's a really good social network.
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:44.840]   They have apparently announced they're going to do an IPO owned by Conde Nast.
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:45.840]   Right, Jeff?
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:47.720]   Yeah, the majority.
[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:50.120]   So Conde, I told the story on Twig.
[00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.120]   That's not here.
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:55.120]   My old boss, Steve Newhouse, was desperate to buy dig and they weren't interested.
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:56.880]   And so he bought what was then kind of the second choice.
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:59.720]   Oh, Kevin, you should have sold when you had the chance.
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:03.120]   So it was the second choice was all this thing called Reddit.
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:04.120]   They're pretty cool.
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:06.840]   They're a little weird and different, but they were a dig clone initially.
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:08.760]   They clearly copied dig.
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:09.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:10.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:11.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:12.760]   And Steve taught me in her activity.
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:13.760]   Steve Newhouse.
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:15.080]   He's visionary about it.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:20.120]   So he got Reddit and it owed it fully for not much money at all, but then very wise, they
[00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:22.120]   kind of spun it out a bit.
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:29.240]   So he created equity to motivate the former owners to keep going and new staff.
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:31.480]   And then they were able to acquire things and work that way.
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:35.640]   And so now going to a full IPO was really kind of a brilliant arc of the story where
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:38.680]   they could get the full value now of Reddit.
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:43.640]   If I were Tim Stevens and Ice Racer, I'm sure there's a subreddit.
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:47.200]   I'm sure there is for every little nation.
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.560]   And I bet you there's a nice Reddit.
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:51.120]   I'm actually not sure.
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:54.280]   I know there's a super rice Reddit and I'm certainly on it, but I'm not sure there's
[00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:55.280]   a stuff right.
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:56.760]   I'm checking right now as we speak.
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:57.760]   There are Cloth's Reddit.
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:59.320]   I'd be there.
[00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:04.600]   So it's so interesting because you can, I think it's a good IPO.
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:08.200]   I think this, there are definitely issues like with every social network.
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:14.960]   I mean, Reddit was hosting a lot of horrible stuff, but they under Conde, I think for a
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:19.880]   long time under Alexis Ohanian and then Steve Hoffman, they kind of wanted to be the free
[00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:24.000]   speech, wing of the free speech party like Twitter.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.560]   But I think they realized that's not going to fly in Conde certainly didn't want to be
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:30.800]   host to some of the horrible stuff that was on Reddit.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:32.480]   So they've gotten rid of all of those, I think.
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:34.040]   Have you got rid of all of it?
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:36.480]   No, they're still not visible now.
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:38.520]   It's like Tumblr.
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:42.520]   There's still adult content, but the thing about Reddit is you don't, you only see what
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:43.880]   you want to see.
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:47.080]   So you get to follow what you're interested in.
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:50.720]   And I think that the, I think, I don't know, I believe in it.
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:53.000]   Anyway, I think the IPO, I think it'll be very interesting.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.080]   I feel like they'll do well.
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:58.440]   Let's, let's just say that, but maybe that's just me.
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:01.560]   They wanted to be the, somebody dwindle in the chat from saying they wanted to be the
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:03.280]   civil for Chan.
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:07.520]   I think they predate for Chan, maybe not.
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:08.680]   But yeah, I think they do.
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:13.560]   I mean, Steve, my old boss did call me after the company kind of said, what do we do when
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:14.800]   there's bad stuff here?
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:21.000]   Because as you say, the owners, the founders wanted to keep it as free speech.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:26.280]   And it's the difficulty of number one, setting a policy and number two, enforcing it at scale.
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:29.680]   It's a problem with everybody says that the thing that Reddit does differently that is
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:32.040]   different from say Twitter.
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:33.040]   It's not different Facebook.
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:37.120]   The difference with Twitter is you have moderators for each subreddit.
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:41.400]   So they are kind of responsible for what that subreddit's rules are.
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:44.840]   And so because there are people who have some ownership of it, they're not paid, but they
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:46.720]   have some ownership of it.
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:48.800]   I think it works pretty well.
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:50.800]   I don't know.
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:52.880]   How does that's your point, Lee?
[00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:53.880]   Go ahead.
[00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:55.640]   How does Reddit make money advertising, right?
[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:56.640]   Is advertising advertising?
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:57.640]   Yeah, it is advertising there.
[00:59:57.640 --> 00:59:59.040]   But most of it wasn't for a long time.
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.240]   And I pay for Reddit.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:04.080]   I mean, there is you can pay for gold coins or something.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.080]   I don't know what I get.
[01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:07.080]   I'm just wondering how much gold.
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.080]   Go ahead.
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:09.080]   Oh, and sorry.
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:11.840]   No, I'm just I'm just wondering how much money you have is for having an IPO.
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:13.880]   Like I just don't I don't know if the market's going to like.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.520]   I guess the market cares about that.
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.520]   That's right.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.520]   Yeah.
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:23.600]   I mean, I'm just I still think of Reddit as like Nerdville and like hyper finite Nerdville.
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:27.040]   So I mean, as far as money for the masses, I'd be interested to see it.
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.040]   I just don't think it'll work.
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.040]   But that's just me.
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.040]   I don't know anything.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:37.520]   So Leo, actually your point about Reddit proves what you keep on whining about with Facebook
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:40.560]   and Twitter is how you want what you want to see.
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:43.320]   You don't want to see anything else that somebody else recommends to you.
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.720]   That's why you like Reddit so much, right?
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:46.720]   Yes.
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.280]   That's exactly right.
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.280]   It's not algorithm.
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:54.080]   That's another one like my algorithm masters, but you don't know.
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:58.040]   We've had this conversation on this and twig and on this show and there are people who say,
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:01.040]   oh no, you wouldn't want you'd be bored to tears.
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:06.520]   Adam Masseri, the guy in charge of Instagram says you'd be bored to tears if you only had
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:09.600]   a chronological feed of the people you're following.
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.000]   See, I don't I disagree.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.440]   That's up to me to make it what I wanted to be.
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.920]   Where do you fall on this?
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:19.360]   Tim Stevens.
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.560]   I think it depends on the platform.
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:25.280]   I actually genuinely enjoy on Instagram, for example, seeing kind of interesting things
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.280]   on there.
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:30.200]   I absolutely want a linear feed of the people that I'm following and I maintain pretty
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:32.680]   strictly lists in terms of what I want to see.
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:35.720]   I'll hop from one list to the next depending upon what kind of content I'm looking for.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:39.400]   If I'm looking for news that we need to hit, for example, I have one list for that.
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.680]   If I'm just checking out with what my friends are up to, I have lists for those sorts of
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:43.680]   things too.
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:47.240]   I definitely like the Reddit model in terms of subscribing to what you want to see.
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:51.000]   It does bubble up things to the front page that are just genuinely interesting.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.080]   I think it does a pretty good job of that too.
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:57.080]   I tend to prefer to curate my own things like that.
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:03.080]   Anyway, I don't mean to turn this into a referendum.
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.520]   Let me ask a question about it.
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:09.000]   What's the smartest way for the you who love it because I have not been on it much?
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.680]   What's the smartest way to use Reddit?
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:13.080]   How do you use Reddit well?
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:17.680]   I would say you should pick some and a small number of sub-readits.
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:23.520]   So where it is, it's kind of like forum software, it's divided into sections of interest.
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:29.040]   I would pick a few things that you are really interested in and follow those.
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:35.800]   So I follow, for instance, slash r, slash politics.
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:37.480]   I think that's a good one.
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:41.640]   Obviously, you're not going to follow our Linux or slash r slash Valheim.
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:44.040]   That's not going to be in your, there's Pixel 6.
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.040]   See, that's a good one.
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:46.680]   Let's say, I know you have a Pixel 6.
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.120]   You've had some problems with it.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.720]   That would be a good one to follow.
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:53.600]   Unfortunately, the Pixel 6 subreddit has a problem.
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:59.040]   A lot of Reddit's do where people post pictures of stuff.
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.440]   The Mac subreddit, I don't know why everybody posts their picture of their new Mac like
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:04.480]   I could care less.
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.800]   It's a Pixel 6 subreddit.
[01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:11.520]   Got all of a sudden a lot of cats.
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:15.000]   I pick politics or news.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.680]   I follow the succession subreddit.
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:19.240]   I follow the chess subreddit, things like that.
[01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:20.920]   I also follow a lot of tech stuff.
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:24.120]   So pick three or four things you're really interested in.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.960]   Because a lot of these are very active.
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:31.120]   A lot of them will have multiple dozens of posts, but they're not like Twitter active.
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.280]   And they're very specific.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:37.120]   I find Reddit to be some of the smartest regular people on earth.
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.840]   Again, it's a very finite window for people that are under groups.
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:43.720]   But when you get into a group, sometimes I read stuff and I'm like, man, you should
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.760]   be running a country or something.
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.600]   What are you doing?
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.080]   Just posting on here.
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:50.720]   You should be a company.
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:57.120]   There is a Reddit subreddit called best of slash r slash best of where it is.
[01:03:57.120 --> 01:03:58.200]   That's exactly what people do.
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.640]   This was the best post.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:04.320]   This guy nailed it on some topic.
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:09.080]   That's a good example of, but I will also say that Reddit has its own culture and some
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:14.360]   of the comments on any given post can devolve into Reddit stupidity.
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:16.440]   Where America, yeah, it's America.
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:20.680]   In general, I think Reddit is the one social network where you should always read the comments.
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:24.640]   And I think, you know, on YouTube and elsewhere, you kind of say, well, don't read the comments.
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:28.400]   But in Reddit, you really should because quite often something will bump up to the home page.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:31.240]   And the first comment will be, actually, this is fake and here's why it's fake and here's
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.240]   how you can tell it's fake.
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:35.760]   And you want to be learning, oh, now I can identify this as being fake in the future.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:37.600]   And you don't really see that level.
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:38.600]   That's a good point.
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:39.800]   And that's a very good point.
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:40.800]   Yeah.
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:47.040]   A lot of times, yeah, there's a meme going around and the Redditors are smart.
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:50.560]   And we'll say, yeah, see, you could tell this is faked.
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:54.920]   But what I usually will do is I'll read the comments until it gets to the point where
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:58.200]   it starts to descend into Reddit, you know, punning.
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:01.880]   And I'll say, OK, this comment is done.
[01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:04.120]   Let's go to the next one.
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:05.120]   I don't know.
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:06.120]   I really like it.
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.800]   I'll be very curious how well it'll do.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:08.800]   I think you're right.
[01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:11.440]   I don't know how the markets will react to this, but they have a bug.
[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:13.720]   Buzzfeed was a disaster.
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:14.720]   Well, exactly right.
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:19.040]   I mean, it's interesting that Reddit's planning this out on the heels of a horrific Buzzfeed
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.040]   idea.
[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:25.080]   Oh, why do you think it's almost like, go ahead.
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:29.080]   It almost seems like somebody sure to that thing, they go to AMZ stop one day.
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:31.640]   They just went down quick.
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:33.320]   So Buzzfeed was a spec.
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:34.320]   It was a spec.
[01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:35.320]   And that's not an idea.
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:38.120]   It was a particular spec that would let them say in charge.
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:46.400]   And NBC was pissed about the falling valuation and got a carve out, which ruined it for everybody
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:47.400]   else more.
[01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:48.840]   And then a lot of people left the spec.
[01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:50.640]   And so the actual money they raised was tiny.
[01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:51.800]   And then it went down.
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:55.840]   Actually, the employees couldn't get out because there was some bureaucratic mess up.
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.200]   So they're all pissed off.
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:02.280]   That's a particular vulnerability of specs that I was not aware of.
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:06.600]   A spec, can you explain what a spec is?
[01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:08.160]   I don't want to.
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:11.240]   A spec is a thing that already has people investing in it.
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:13.120]   And then it's a nothing company.
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.120]   And then they can merge with a company.
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:18.960]   It's kind of a made up company that has raised money in order to merge with another
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.600]   company and make a real company.
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:21.600]   It's been on the come.
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:22.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:27.920]   The problem, which I didn't know about, is the people who said, oh, yeah, we definitely
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:29.600]   want to buy Buzzfeed.
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:31.080]   Here's, you know, we'll put it a million bucks.
[01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:35.440]   I didn't realize they could say, no, never mind and take it out afterwards.
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:39.000]   And apparently that's what happened to Buzzfeed.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:44.680]   They had raised, I don't know, tens of millions of dollars for this spec and most of those
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:47.360]   investors withdrew.
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:50.200]   They decided not to participate.
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:56.760]   How can that even seems like it's a public entity with liquid assets liquid?
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:58.760]   I'm getting that's what they're going to buy.
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:06:59.760]   Oh hell.
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.640]   What are the hills when you get out?
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:02.640]   Yeah.
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:07.680]   So, I think maybe we've learned a lesson about specs this week.
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:09.360]   It didn't work out so well.
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:15.880]   Jonah Peretti, who was the founder and she's probably to make a lot of money on this.
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:17.960]   Jonah, let's be clear, is brilliant.
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:21.360]   He's a visionary and very smart.
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:22.360]   Yep.
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:26.640]   Probably hoped for, you know, a nice exit in effect.
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:29.000]   And it's an exit without an exit, isn't it?
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.920]   That was the other side of it and probably one of the reasons it didn't do well is it
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:36.760]   wasn't really an IPO or a sale or a merger.
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:42.440]   It was just give us some money and we're going to still run the place.
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:45.920]   Does it assign that Buzzfeed's model is not good?
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:48.520]   No, I don't think so.
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:54.880]   But what it inspires in me, we talked about this a little bit on Twig, is that I think
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:59.840]   we're seeing the last gasp, the last supernova of scale.
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:05.920]   And what Peretti said is that we've got to ramp up together and do roll-ups to compete
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:11.040]   with the big boys, even though they're tiny compared to the big boys, Google and Facebook.
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:19.400]   You saw Vox and Group 9 merging and other efforts saying scales it.
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:23.680]   You see the magazine companies are, you know, look at what happened to the time, Inc. and
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:28.960]   Meredith came together and then sold off a couple and now they're just on the content
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:33.480]   factory floor for Barry Diller because of scale.
[01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:37.200]   So I think scale has just cheapened media towards extreme here.
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.240]   Scale allowed all kinds of new things to start.
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:41.520]   Scale created the mass market.
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:46.040]   Scale created the advertising market, the consumer economy, but the internet ruined all
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:48.120]   of that and they haven't realized it yet.
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:51.760]   So I think that's what's happening here is that what I don't blame these guys.
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:57.560]   So if you're a business owner's brilliant, the management of both Vox and Group 9 are
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:00.960]   brilliant, but they're doing what they have to do with the present advertising market
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.480]   because they depend upon advertising.
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:03.480]   Yeah.
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:06.400]   It's always advertising, isn't it?
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:09.200]   Well, it's happening in the subscription market too.
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:14.080]   But that's, you know, what benefit does sub-stack scale really bring you if they don't use it
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:15.080]   to market across?
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:17.480]   What benefit does Spotify bring you?
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:20.760]   Well, Spotify says we owe it all the podcast, but hey, buy this one.
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:21.760]   Right.
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:23.760]   They don't own this one yet.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.240]   Yep.
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:32.360]   And I don't think yet is a very optimistic way of putting that.
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:33.360]   Let's take a little break.
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:43.320]   When we come back, the most successful mobile gaming year of all time, kind of a remarkable
[01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:44.640]   year for mobile gaming.
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:49.080]   But first word, speaking of sponsors from UserWake, this is a sponsor.
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:52.160]   I almost feel like this is a public service announcement because I'm a big believer that
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:54.240]   the internet should be accessible.
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:58.920]   We have a lot of blind listeners who can't use your website because their screen reader
[01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:04.640]   just chokes on things like images that have no alt tags or weird navigation menus.
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:10.440]   You know where you really want those screen readers to work on your shopping cart.
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:14.400]   You're leaving behind millions of people who would like to be your customers because
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.400]   they can't use your site.
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:19.160]   Now I'm also sympathetic for anybody who runs websites.
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:22.320]   That's a challenge because I know we thought, oh, what are we going to do?
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:26.640]   This is going to take a lot of extra development, a lot of extra time.
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.000]   Along comes UserWake.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.360]   This is a big, big, big break.
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:34.120]   UserWake.org is amazing.
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:35.680]   Every website has to be accessible.
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:37.480]   The ADA requires it.
[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:43.160]   UserWake is an incredible AI powered solution that automatically remediates and enforces
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:46.960]   the hundreds of web content accessibility guidelines.
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.320]   It does it with one line of JavaScript.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:52.040]   It could do more than an entire team of developers.
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:56.320]   Making your website accessible, I know, can be overwhelming, but UserWake solutions make
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:01.880]   it simple, easy, and I really want to underscore this cost effective.
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:04.640]   It's much less than you think.
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:08.600]   Probably it's less than we spend on web fonts every month.
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:10.360]   It's really affordable.
[01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:13.200]   Now first thing to do, go to UserWake.org/twit.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.120]   They've got a free scanning tool.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:16.120]   Run it.
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:17.840]   See if your site's ADA compliant.
[01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.880]   If it's not, now that's caused our concern.
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:22.280]   You're open to ADA related lawsuits.
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:25.440]   You're also leaving behind a lot of potential users.
[01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:31.560]   UserWake's AI and machine learning solutions are used by more than one million websites,
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:38.520]   some of the biggest websites in the world, Coca-Cola, Disney, eBay, FedEx, Walmart, UNICEF.
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:43.080]   UNICEF uses UserWake to make its site accessible.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:47.040]   And now UserWake is taking those best in class enterprise tools that are used by the
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:51.680]   big companies and making them available to small and medium sized businesses at a price
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:54.600]   small businesses can afford.
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:59.080]   Operating an accessible, compliant website just makes business sense.
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:03.040]   And if you do take off, you suddenly scale UserWake can help you there too.
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.960]   I mean, if they can work for Disney, they can work for you.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:10.000]   You'll automatically generate using UserWake's computer vision.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.920]   The code for those image results, it'll see the Golden Gate Bridge in an image as an example
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:16.600]   and say, "That's the Golden Gate Bridge."
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.520]   By the way, it gives you an easy way to add to that.
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:19.520]   That's the Golden Gate Bridge.
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:23.320]   It's sunset with bicyclists or whatever you want to have it say, but it gets you the base
[01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:24.320]   level there.
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:26.120]   It gets you the basic description in there.
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:32.760]   It'll take those complex nav menus that are the bane of screen readers and make them accessible.
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.520]   All the pop-ups will be accessible.
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:38.720]   All the forms, your shopping cart will be accessible.
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:42.680]   And you'll get a detailed report of all the violations that were fixed plus an easy way
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:46.360]   to modify it to enhance it to improvement.
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:49.760]   UserWake completely platform agnostic, one line of JavaScript.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:55.240]   It works almost everywhere on WordPress Shopify, Wix, AEM, Psych or SharePoint.
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:57.640]   On many of these sites, it's just a plugin.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:59.840]   On any site, you can always add that line of JavaScript.
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:02.440]   It integrates seamlessly and it gets the job done.
[01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:04.600]   It's really kind of remarkable.
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:08.360]   Just ask Susan Bennett, the voice of Siri, what she thinks of UserWake.
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:12.400]   Hi, I'm Susan Bennett, the original voice of Siri.
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:15.280]   You won't hear me say something like this too often.
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:19.480]   I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're looking for.
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:25.520]   But every day, that's what the Internet is like for millions of people with disabilities.
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:30.560]   UserWake fixes all of that with just one line of code.
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:33.720]   In line of code, it's kind of amazing.
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:37.840]   UserWake can make any website fully accessible, fully ADA compliant.
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:42.480]   With UserWake, everyone who visits your site can browse seamlessly and customize it to
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:43.960]   fit their needs.
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:48.120]   This is how you could show your brand's commitment to the millions of people with disabilities.
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.280]   They want to use your site.
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:50.280]   Make it easy.
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:58.440]   Go to userway.org/twit, 30% off right now on UserWake's AI powered accessibility solution.
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:04.560]   UserWake, making the Internet accessible for everyone visit userway.org/twit.
[01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:10.080]   Today we thank you UserWake for supporting this week in tech.
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:16.160]   Elon Musk, person of the year 2021.
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:22.920]   As you point out, Jeff's been in these editorial boards making these decisions.
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:25.240]   You never did the person of the year for time, did you?
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:26.240]   No, no, no.
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:31.440]   I was at people when we had a picture of, I don't know who was, Tom Selick or somebody.
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:34.440]   The editor, Pat Ryan, my mentor, couldn't figure out what to do as a cover building.
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:36.240]   Just another boring, good looking celebrity.
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:39.720]   And she finally decided, let's call him the sexiest man alive.
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:41.240]   That became an institution every year.
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:43.160]   Like, "Oh, look, I don't decide who the sexiest man alive."
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:46.120]   I'm like, "It had any meaning whatsoever.
[01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.680]   It's just a cheap trick."
[01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:55.600]   I realized that time used to, you find they put Hitler on as a manager.
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:59.640]   Okay, but their goal was to sell magazines.
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:00.680]   That's no longer the case.
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:02.680]   I realized this after we talked about this last time.
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:05.760]   Yeah, because now Tom's magazine is to troll.
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:08.120]   They want the attention that we're giving them right now.
[01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:10.320]   They did it to time trolls.
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:11.800]   That's what this is about.
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:12.800]   If it works...
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:13.800]   It worked.
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:14.800]   It worked.
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:15.800]   We're talking about it.
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:16.800]   Schmucks.
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:17.800]   We are.
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:22.760]   In 2006, it was us, by the way, you were the person of the year because of the worldwide
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:23.760]   web.
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:24.760]   You.
[01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:27.000]   The world is all about you now.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.640]   That's talking about ridiculous.
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:31.000]   That run right there is ridiculous.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:35.160]   2011, it was the protester.
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:41.880]   2005 was the Good Samaritans, the American soldier, the whistleblowers.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:43.840]   But more often it's somebody.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.760]   2018, it was the Guardians and the War on Truth.
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.320]   What?
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:53.520]   So, you know, your plane is well taken.
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:55.080]   This is just trolling.
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:58.120]   On the other hand, I think, and we talked about this on the radio show with Rod Pyle,
[01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:04.240]   who's our space expert, you can make a case that what Elon has done in many respects is
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:05.240]   world-changing.
[01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:09.080]   I mean, SpaceX, what SpaceX is doing is mind-boggling.
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:15.680]   They're worlds ahead of not just Jeff Bezos, but a Vanessa of the military industrial complex.
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:16.680]   Electric vehicles?
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:19.040]   That was two years ago.
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:20.040]   Okay.
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:21.960]   It wasn't 2021.
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:28.560]   I think, Tim, the impact of Tesla can't be understated on the world of vehicles.
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:32.800]   Definitely, they've raised awareness of EVs in a big, big way.
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:36.560]   But you have to ask, you know, how much of that was Elon Musk responsible for himself?
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:37.960]   The Tesla was not his company.
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:41.200]   He basically was a very deep pocketbook to keep Tesla alive for sure.
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:44.480]   And he's certainly done a lot to raise a profile of Tesla and has certainly had a major influence
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:46.960]   in shaping Tesla's destiny.
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:49.160]   But you know, was that really a major story?
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:56.400]   In 2021, this is supposed to be the most, you know, news impacting individual or group
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:58.080]   of individuals of the year.
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:02.940]   And you know, it's hard for me to say that he was the one who was the person that was
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:04.600]   most talked about in the past year.
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:07.280]   That seems unlikely to me.
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:09.360]   Certainly there are a lot of other deserving folks.
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:14.220]   I think either the political side of things, you know, with the team's erection or certainly
[01:17:14.220 --> 01:17:15.880]   on the COVID research side of things.
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:21.360]   Whoever invented the MR and the vaccine might have been a more important person this year.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:22.800]   Yeah, you might say.
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:27.960]   In fact, if Elon was in the, in the, on the headlines this year, it was almost invariably
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:29.600]   about his weird tweets.
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:30.600]   Yeah.
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:31.600]   Yeah.
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:32.600]   It wasn't anything he'd done.
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:34.760]   Can I ask the panel a question?
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:35.920]   Yes.
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:37.440]   What is time magazine?
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:40.440]   Well, my son.
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:46.840]   I listened to him and we'll get there in about an hour.
[01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:50.720]   I listened for the last three minutes and for the life of me, I still understand what
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:52.280]   any of you are talking about.
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:56.800]   Oh, when, when was the last time you bought, if ever, a physical magazine?
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:57.800]   What's the magazine?
[01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:58.800]   Is your next question?
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:01.480]   Well, this is a family show.
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:05.320]   So I mean, I've had a company that's saying what it was.
[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:09.960]   Nobody, by the way, magazines are publishing my daily magazines.
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:10.960]   What the hell?
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:11.960]   Who's buying Curly Man?
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:12.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:13.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:14.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:15.960]   Really?
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:16.960]   I mean, what is that business?
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:17.960]   It's still around.
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:18.960]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:19.960]   I still, I go into Bodega's.
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:20.960]   I see them top row with the black bag.
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:21.960]   Yeah, I know.
[01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:22.960]   There's somebody selling them.
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:23.960]   Like physical media, brother, physical media.
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.960]   Some people still like tangible objects, you know.
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:29.680]   Some people do not trust digital devices and I think there's probably a pretty good, you
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:32.640]   know, if you have the vendor diagram of people who need that kind of content and people
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:36.760]   who are really distrustful digital devices, there's probably something over there.
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:40.280]   People like cyber, I'm getting back into and have a lot of blockchain.
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:46.320]   My mom, my dear mom, 88 years old, sent me a subscription to the New York Review of
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:50.520]   Books, which is, you know, so every, I think it's every week.
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:52.680]   I get this big tabloid size paper.
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:53.680]   Is it monthly?
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:55.640]   It feels like it's all the time.
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:59.920]   But in time you get around to looking at it as a week.
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:02.840]   And it's a magazine about books.
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:06.280]   Like, I mean, it's like paper on paper.
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:07.280]   It's meta paper.
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:08.280]   I love it.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:09.880]   I actually, she's right.
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:10.880]   She knows.
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:11.880]   I love books.
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:12.880]   Not buying a lot of books these days.
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:17.120]   Usually buying them in ebooks, but still that's a book you're reading it or audio books.
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:21.640]   But anyway, she asked me and she said, should I get you the New York Review of Books?
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:22.800]   Do you enjoy that?
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:27.560]   And it broke my heart, but I'd say, Mom, I just, I love it, but I don't need to read it.
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:30.120]   I read everything online and it's probably not online.
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:32.040]   I don't even know if it is, but don't.
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:33.040]   I said, don't know that.
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.240]   This is like the reverse of that great.
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:40.160]   He loves Raymond episode where Raymond bought his parents fruit of the month club.
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:41.760]   Why would you do that?
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:44.320]   Who needs a fruit every month?
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.880]   What am I going to do with all this grapefruit?
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:47.880]   What are you doing?
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:48.880]   What are you thinking?
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:51.320]   Yeah, the first one's always grapefruit, isn't it?
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:53.600]   Who needs a case of grapefruit?
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:54.600]   No one.
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:56.320]   No one needs a case of grapefruit.
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:57.320]   No one.
[01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:01.840]   Speaking of EVs, we shouldn't go ahead.
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:03.760]   You want to tell an anecdote about your dad?
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:07.200]   I accidentally bought my father seven bags of grapefruit.
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:09.560]   I got the same routine.
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:11.760]   What am I supposed to do?
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:13.280]   That's a grapefruit.
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:16.360]   I said I don't.
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:22.520]   What about speaking of EVs, I think now I guess the Build Back Better Bill is dead thanks
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:25.320]   to Joe Manchin.
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:29.280]   But that was going to include a fairly hefty incentive.
[01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:34.520]   The current EV incentive is $7,500 only available to car makers who have sold less than correct
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:37.600]   me if I'm wronged him, 200,000 units.
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:39.360]   So Tesla's over.
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:40.720]   You can't get an EV credit for that.
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:49.800]   But I did get one for my Mustang Mach E. How important is this to EV growth, these incentives?
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:54.080]   Right now it reminds me of seeing because there are such dramatic supply chain shortages
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:57.120]   that I don't really know that is going to impact the economy that much.
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:21:00.960]   But certainly there were a lot of pricing decisions on these EVs made with the expectation
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:03.160]   that incentives were coming.
[01:21:03.160 --> 01:21:06.240]   And so these going away has a pretty significant impact.
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:10.760]   But it reminds me of seeing we may see this come back again.
[01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:11.760]   I hope we do.
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:16.860]   The incentive was going to get even stronger, especially for US made and the union made
[01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:22.880]   EVs, which was a controversial addition to the thing, but ultimately meant that a lot
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:28.280]   of people would get up to $1,500, excuse me, $1,500 off of an EV, which would really substantially
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:32.040]   bridge the gap between a traditional gasoline powered car and an EV can get a lot of people
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:33.040]   into these things.
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:36.520]   And I think ultimately that would be very good for the economy and for the environment.
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:38.040]   So I do hope that we see this come back.
[01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:41.280]   But yeah, I'm not sure exactly what it's going to mean given these things are so hard
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:42.640]   to fund right now anyway.
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:46.840]   Yeah, I would not actually have covered the Mustang Mach E because it's made in Mexico.
[01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:47.840]   Right.
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:51.160]   So you would still get an incentive, but you would not get the full 2,500.
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:53.240]   I think you would lose about 4,500 off the top.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:56.600]   I don't have a problem with that bringing auto manufacturer back in the United States
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:58.520]   that creates jobs.
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:00.480]   Part of the incentive was for union jobs.
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:03.040]   Again, I don't have a problem with that.
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:05.360]   You get more money if the battery is made in the US.
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:08.960]   Again, that seems like a good idea.
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:12.040]   I'm sure it makes a big difference in the purchase.
[01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:16.400]   I mean, if people feel like they're getting a nice big chunk of change, is it a tax credit
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.080]   or is it actual money?
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:19.080]   It's a tax credit.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:20.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:24.080]   It depends on some manufacturers and some dealerships were actually kind of taking that off with
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:25.080]   the least price, for example.
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:27.200]   So it would be often factored into the price of the car.
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:31.160]   It depended on state incentives too, which would sometimes be factored in that way.
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:34.840]   But it would definitely, that's a significant amount of money on a car that's in the $40,
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:37.440]   to $50,000 price range you're talking about.
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:38.720]   Maybe 20% discount.
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:41.320]   And that really would be enough to encourage someone to go to an EV.
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:42.880]   You might not have been thinking about it otherwise.
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:43.880]   Yeah.
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:44.880]   Yeah.
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:50.200]   Is it the case that it's a good thing to encourage EV?
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:54.440]   I mean, I'm not all, I am not in favor of just general subsidies for American industry
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:23:00.680]   for just because they're American, but is it a good thing for the environment or the
[01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:03.880]   economy to have EV sales go up?
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:05.600]   Yeah, I definitely think it is.
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:09.040]   It's one of those things where right now we're still in such early stages.
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:14.200]   You know, EVs make up less than 2% of the US overall car market at this point.
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:17.680]   And so we're still kind of in that unfortunate chicken in the egg state where there aren't
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:21.160]   enough chargers to make people comfortable, but there aren't enough EVs out there to really
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:24.240]   make the investment in a charging network worthwhile.
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:28.000]   So this was really, you know, it continues to be an attempt to kind of kickstart that
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.840]   industry to get more of these cars on the road to make it make more financial sense,
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:34.960]   to incentivize other companies to come in and build more chargers, which will then encourage
[01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:38.280]   more people to buy more cars, which will mean more chargers, and everybody's happy at that
[01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:39.280]   point.
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.280]   So that's definitely good.
[01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:45.360]   Well, you know, you can, if you take the worst case scenario in terms of if you are charging
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:51.120]   your car based on electricity that comes from a coal burning old school power plant, at that
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:54.280]   point the emissions are roughly the same as a gasoline powered car.
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:58.520]   So you can make the argument that it's actually maybe not helping things, but you can also
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:00.840]   yet to look at this as kind of a transitional period.
[01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:04.720]   If we can get more people on the EVs, well, then there's more incentive for us to get more
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:10.040]   renewable power sources and more opportunities to get more green energy into more people's
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:11.040]   homes.
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:13.040]   And that just helps to kickstart that industry.
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:17.360]   So there's a lot of carry on secondary tertiary effects here, which I think are all very positive.
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:21.400]   And ultimately, this could be a bit of a handicap for those efforts.
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:24.960]   There is money already in the infrastructure bill for the charging network, right?
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:26.600]   I think it's significant amount of money.
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:27.600]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:28.840]   We have that as far as to.
[01:24:28.840 --> 01:24:30.480]   Yeah, some billions of dollars.
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:31.480]   Go ahead.
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:35.240]   I'm happy you said at the end about their noble energy temp because the thing to crack
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:38.920]   me up the most about these things is how do these batteries get made?
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:40.240]   How do we mine these batteries?
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:42.800]   Are we just taking flowers and making batteries?
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:48.640]   Are we just blowing up, but be parts of the earth with large machinery and exposing things
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:53.720]   and digging and drilling to get the materials to make all these EV batteries that only last
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:56.760]   a certain amount of time and then the way that we charge them.
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:01.440]   If we were a solar, wind, water, generating power plays, it'd be great.
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:05.240]   But I mean, we're destroying the planet to get the batteries and then half the places
[01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:08.280]   aren't even using good power to regenerate the power of the battery.
[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:11.880]   So it's a cash 22 one, whether it's better for the environment or not.
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:14.440]   I mean, it's absolutely better for the environment.
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:16.600]   It's clearly better gas.
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:17.600]   It's definitely better.
[01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:18.600]   We pollute.
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:21.440]   If we don't transition, then it's a dentistry.
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:25.240]   Oh, we're all vehicles pull research out of the earth.
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:30.920]   I think you could make a strong case that private ownership of cars is a bad idea.
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:33.840]   But as long as you're going to have them, it's a lot better to make them electric vehicles
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:35.320]   than it is gas vehicles.
[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:38.560]   By the way, there's a lot of effort made to recycling these batteries.
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.200]   They're getting very good at that.
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:45.440]   So you don't always pull in a lithium out of the environment to make these batteries.
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:48.400]   They're lasting a pretty long, surprisingly long time.
[01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:51.560]   It feels like longer than we expected.
[01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:56.640]   And that's what I said towards the end is what we want to work towards, the reusing
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:00.000]   of the materials that we're using and the way that we power those materials.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.200]   That's really important too.
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:03.000]   So hopefully we can get to it.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000]   Absolutely.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000]   Going forward.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.680]   And this perception that having more EVs on the road means that in 10 years, we're going
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:12.400]   to have a bunch of lead acid batteries sitting in landfills kind of dripping into the earth,
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:13.600]   which is absolutely not true.
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:16.640]   Even after 10 years, even if these battery packs are down to 80% capacity and they're
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:21.520]   not good enough for powering a car anymore, there's still going to be incredibly valid
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:25.560]   and valuable batteries, much more valuable than any component of a used car that we have
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:27.120]   right now is 10 years old.
[01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:30.460]   So people are absolutely going to spend a lot of money researching ways to get those
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:31.460]   batteries out.
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:35.800]   Some of them will be in industrial applications working as industrial UPSs.
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:39.360]   But certainly we've seen a lot of interesting research into how to basically break those
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:40.360]   batteries down.
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:44.640]   And as he said, Leo, extract those raw elements back out because you have a lithium-ion battery
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:46.880]   pack that's 10 years old and it's not good enough to power a car anymore.
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:49.960]   If you can compositionally break that down, you can theoretically make a new battery out
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:55.880]   of the same raw elements and start new without having to go to those really unfortunate parts
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:58.360]   of the world as you mentioned and do some unfortunate things in the environment to get
[01:26:58.360 --> 01:26:59.360]   those batteries.
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:02.400]   So those elements must remind out they can be reused and in 10 years we'll see some really
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:05.320]   interesting recycling technology to make this work.
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:06.320]   Yeah.
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:08.560]   I feel like it's not perfect.
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:13.000]   No, we're not saying it's perfect, but it's better than gas cars.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:14.720]   I have solar panels.
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:21.320]   So I'm putting power back into the grid partly because I have EVs.
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:27.840]   Also I have two big Tesla power wall batteries, which it's my understanding are actually recycled
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:32.880]   Tesla batteries from cars that aren't sufficient for cars, but work fine to power my home.
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:35.880]   So I think it's partly it's jump-starting this, right?
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:39.760]   Yeah, it's not there yet, but jump-starting it.
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:46.720]   You know, can I ask a safe, I promise, but fairly ignorant political question?
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:52.480]   I would think that would take one Republican to say, I can be Joe Manchin.
[01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:57.800]   I can have the whole world coming to my door begging me to vote for these things.
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:02.280]   If I just hold the temptation out, yeah, Trump's not going to like me, but it doesn't have
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:04.080]   to be a Democrat, does it?
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:06.160]   No, you're the center of power.
[01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:08.720]   You're the first or second most powerful person in Washington.
[01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:09.720]   You're the first person.
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:10.720]   You're the first person.
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:11.720]   You're the first person.
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:12.720]   You're the first person.
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:13.720]   You're the first person.
[01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:14.720]   You're the first person.
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:15.720]   You're the first person in Washington.
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:16.720]   You're the first person in Washington.
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:17.720]   You're the first person in Washington.
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:18.720]   You're the first person in Washington.
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:19.720]   You're the first person in Washington.
[01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:20.720]   You're the first person in Washington.
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:21.720]   You're the first person in Washington.
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:22.720]   You're the first person in Washington.
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:23.720]   You're the first person in Washington.
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:24.720]   You're the first person in Washington.
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:25.720]   You're the first person in Washington.
[01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:26.720]   You're the first person in Washington.
[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:27.720]   You're the first person in Washington.
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:28.720]   You're the first person in Washington.
[01:28:28.720 --> 01:28:29.720]   You're the first person in Washington.
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:30.720]   You're the first person in Washington.
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:31.720]   You're the first person in Washington.
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:38.720]   You're the first person in Washington.
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:45.720]   You're the first person in Washington.
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:52.720]   You're the first person in Washington.
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:59.720]   You're the first person in Washington.
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:01.720]   You want to be in a good business.
[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:03.720]   Make a mobile game.
[01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:08.720]   Eight mobile games this year suppressed a billion dollars in revenue.
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:12.720]   And I think all of them are free.
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:20.720]   The way to make money now is free to play games that encourage players to spend money as they're playing.
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:26.720]   The number one mobile games this year, two of them made $2.8 billion.
[01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:27.720]   It's not profit.
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:28.720]   It's revenue.
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:31.720]   Imagine it's a fairly high margin business.
[01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:37.720]   PUBG Mobile, which is player underground, player unknowns battlegrounds.
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:41.720]   It was the original Battle Royale game before Fortnite.
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:43.720]   Made $2.8 billion.
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:50.720]   Honor of Kings, which is kind of another top down scenario game.
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:51.720]   $2.8 billion.
[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:54.720]   Gen Shen Impact $1.8 billion.
[01:29:54.720 --> 01:30:01.720]   Roblox, the old kids game, free to play, but lots of subscription features.
[01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:02.720]   $1.3 billion.
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:07.720]   Coinmaster, aptly named $1.3 billion.
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:08.720]   Here's a funny one.
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:13.720]   Pokemon Go made more last year than it's made in its entire five years of life.
[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:15.720]   $1.2 billion.
[01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:18.720]   More people are playing Pokemon Go and giving money.
[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:23.720]   And I guess that really comes down to COVID except Pokemon Go is one of those...
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:27.720]   The only one in all of these games that requires you to leave the house.
[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:29.720]   But you don't have to be around people.
[01:30:29.720 --> 01:30:33.720]   No, although it was a very social game when it came out in 2016.
[01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:35.720]   But even then, it's outside.
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:36.720]   Yeah.
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:37.720]   And now they've changed the rules.
[01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:38.720]   They were smart.
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:41.720]   They changed the rules so that you could do a lot of what you would have to go out to do.
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:43.720]   You could do it without leaving the house.
[01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:48.720]   Then Candy Crush Saga, I'm sad to say, Candy Crush Saga made $1.2 billion.
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:49.720]   She's huge.
[01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:50.720]   And something called...
[01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:51.720]   They're still holding on.
[01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:52.720]   They're hanging in there.
[01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:55.720]   It was Candy Crush and Farmville back in the day.
[01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:59.720]   You go to a bar, you hear some weird 23-year-old talking about Farmville and Candy Crush.
[01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:00.720]   What are we doing?
[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:01.720]   What are we doing?
[01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:03.720]   Candy Crush is still strong.
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:05.720]   Candy Crush is still strong.
[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:11.720]   I think Saga is a variant of the original Candy Crush, but it's still doing very well.
[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:13.720]   It's Crazy Birds still around?
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:14.720]   Angry Birds.
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:15.720]   They're angry.
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:16.720]   They're not crazy.
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:18.720]   Angry Birds not on this list.
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:19.720]   That's a good point.
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:22.720]   Oh, they kind of...
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:23.720]   Maybe they burned out their welcome.
[01:31:23.720 --> 01:31:24.720]   I don't know.
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:29.720]   It is the first time that eight games have crossed the billion-dollar mark ever.
[01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:32.720]   It was five games in 2020.
[01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:36.720]   It was three in 2018 and 2019.
[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:42.720]   So the money being made by mobile games, this is according to Sensor Tower because nobody reveals the actual amount of money.
[01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:45.720]   But Sensor Tower seems to have a pretty good handle on this.
[01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:51.720]   A number of games making more than a billion dollars in mobile revenue in 2021.
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:54.720]   A record eight.
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:32:05.720]   Actually, Apple just released Swift Playgrounds for the iPad, which is for the first time allows you to make an app on the iPad.
[01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:11.720]   Stand alone without any use of a Mac that you could sell in the App Store on the iPhone and the iPad.
[01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:13.720]   I've played with it a little bit this morning.
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:14.720]   It's pretty amazing.
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:19.720]   I'm going to make a game and use my favorite revenue model, which is...
[01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:22.720]   I'm not even going to name this game, but I'm addicted to this game.
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:30.720]   And the way they got me to pay the money is that every single thing that I did came up with an ad after my accomplishment.
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:35.720]   And to get to the next thing, I had to watch another crappy game.
[01:32:35.720 --> 01:32:38.720]   And I was like, "You know what? What was it? $4.99? Take my money."
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:41.720]   I paid them instantly because after...
[01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:43.720]   It took a day where I was like, "Ah, it's not a big deal to watch."
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:48.720]   And I'm like, "Oh, I don't have time to do this."
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:49.720]   They got my money.
[01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:52.720]   That is the best model to get me to pay for a game.
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:54.720]   So I'm just working on something addictive.
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:33:01.720]   I want to just throw spam at somebody and be like, "Just give me $2 and you feel free to play this game for the rest of your life."
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:03.720]   That's the best model they got going.
[01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:05.720]   None of these games in that list do that, obviously.
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:07.720]   I heard the breakfast table yesterday Lisa's playing.
[01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:09.720]   I think she's playing words with friends.
[01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:10.720]   She gets up and walks away.
[01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:11.720]   I said, "What's happening?"
[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:14.720]   She said, "Oh, there's an ad. I don't want to watch it."
[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:15.720]   "I'm coming back in a minute."
[01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:21.720]   "Yeah, get a commercial break. You know what I mean? Run under fridge, get a sandwich, come back."
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:23.720]   Speaking of making money.
[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:24.720]   Now, I don't...
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:25.720]   Here's what Tim, what you think about this.
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:27.720]   Toyota got a lot of heat for this.
[01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:28.720]   I don't know if they deserve it.
[01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:31.720]   They made its key fob remote start.
[01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:33.720]   This is the ability to start the car from a distance.
[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:36.720]   A subscription feature.
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:40.720]   But I'm not sure this is as bad as it plays out to be.
[01:33:40.720 --> 01:33:44.720]   It was initially reported and it was perceived to be pretty gross.
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:46.720]   And it is still kind of gross.
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:48.720]   But it's not as bad as it was perceived to be.
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:50.720]   Basically, if you have a Toyota at a certain age,
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:53.720]   I think this is 2018 and onward cars.
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:56.720]   Many of them have a remote start button on your key fob,
[01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:58.720]   which actually makes a direct connection to your car,
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:01.720]   an RF connection, so it's not going through the cloud or anything like that.
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:03.720]   You hold that button down, the car starts.
[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:05.720]   So the belief would be, well, this is connecting directly to my car.
[01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:06.720]   It doesn't use the cloud.
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:09.720]   So it doesn't matter if I'm subscribing to Toyota's premium services.
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:11.720]   Because it's directly connected to the car.
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:15.720]   However, it is actually included in part of Toyota's package of digital services.
[01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:19.720]   It's just that those cars got that for a certain amount of time for free.
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:22.720]   And that is now becoming no longer free.
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:25.720]   Those customers are kind of falling out of that free window
[01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:30.720]   and now they're being asked to pay $8 a month or $80 a year to continue to use this feature,
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:32.720]   which again, doesn't use the cloud at all.
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:34.720]   So I can see both sides of the argument.
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:36.720]   It was kind of always the way it was.
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:39.720]   It's just that people are starting to realize it now.
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:44.720]   But it's almost like when we used to play games on physical media
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:47.720]   and they would charge you money for quote unquote DLC that was actually already on the disc
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:49.720]   and they were just kind of unlocking it.
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:54.720]   It's a little bit like that and that kind of makes, you know, it tastes bad in the back of your mouth.
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:58.720]   But it is ultimately something that's not really a change as it were.
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:34:59.720]   It's just really unfortunate.
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:01.720]   So Tim, and it's the way it's going to be.
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:02.720]   Sorry, Tim.
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:06.720]   Not to make you feel bad, but being at your near Albany,
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:12.720]   and I'll be one of the places on Earth where I think you might actually find use in pre-star in your car.
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:13.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:14.720]   Is it a useful service?
[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:17.720]   So you warm everything up before you get into it and drive away.
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:20.720]   You melt the ice and went to all that stuff.
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:21.720]   Yeah.
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:23.720]   This time of year, it's definitely an invaluable thing.
[01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:26.720]   And, you know, there are multiple ways of looking at this service
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:28.720]   as based economy as applied to automobiles.
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:32.720]   One of them being, you know, would you pay a couple thousand dollars extra for this feature?
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:33.720]   Certainly a lot of people do.
[01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:37.720]   But you really only need this feature maybe four months out of the year, five months out of the year.
[01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:42.720]   And so maybe it's actually cheaper in the long run if you only pay for it in October through April.
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:44.720]   Oh, you can see that you can turn it off.
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:46.720]   You can cancel it and re-up.
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:48.720]   You can actually do go much by month if you want to.
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:51.720]   So that's kind of the argument that a lot of people are making.
[01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:57.720]   BMW has been an early proponent of this kind of software based application to seemingly hardware based
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:35:59.720]   services in cars.
[01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:04.720]   Tesla's certainly doing it as well, where you can kind of pay as you need for these sorts of features.
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:08.720]   It's going to be becoming a much more common thing, you know, recurring revenue is everything
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:10.720]   in the modern economy and the automakers.
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:11.720]   Yeah, it's a precedent.
[01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:12.720]   I don't like it.
[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:14.720]   I don't like this at all.
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:15.720]   I don't like it at all.
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:16.720]   I don't like it at all.
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:19.720]   So I drive Honda's and I've driven them for a while.
[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:25.720]   Now, I pay like, it ends up being like 12 dollars a month, but I pay for the year.
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:26.720]   But guess what?
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:32.720]   I can be in California and start my car, warm up my seats, turn on the defrost and do what
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:33.720]   I need to do.
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:34.720]   That's what I'm paying for.
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:35.720]   I'm paying for that.
[01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:39.720]   And if I drive in a ditch, they send out a beacon and somebody comes to me even among colleges
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:40.720]   and then come help me.
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:41.720]   That's what I pay for.
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:45.720]   You're going to charge somebody 8.99 for a physical connection and they've got to be visibly being
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:48.720]   able to see their car with the RF connection to do that.
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:49.720]   Guess what?
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:51.720]   Go to your local Best Buy car dealership guy.
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:56.720]   Pay $199 for a remote start on your car and be done with it for the next 10 years of your
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:58.720]   car's life or 20 minutes.
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:02.720]   There's no reason some third party solution.
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:03.720]   America.
[01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:04.720]   Yeah.
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:08.720]   If you'll have to create a second key fob we need to make that work.
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:11.720]   Man, we're vipers in the future right now.
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:15.080]   You can have Viper be your whole new key fob where you don't have to have a secondary key
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:16.080]   fob.
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:17.080]   Okay.
[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:18.080]   I'm not saying I know what I'm just saying.
[01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:21.480]   It's products out there where you don't have to have three key fobs anymore to do that.
[01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:25.000]   And the fact that they're doing this just irks me so much because if you're going to
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:28.120]   charge me then give me full service.
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:31.760]   Don't tell me that my key that already costs $500 for a place.
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:37.040]   When you lose a car, I got my car key in this place to bag on my desk because if I lose
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:38.560]   this and my life is over.
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:39.560]   I got it.
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:40.560]   Yeah.
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:42.640]   Why are they so expensive actually?
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:45.160]   The fact that they're charged that money drives me crazy.
[01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:46.160]   I don't like it.
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:47.160]   I don't like it.
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:49.160]   Why are fobs so expensive?
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:50.160]   That's a very good point.
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:54.640]   They should be a fair bit of encryption going on in keys.
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:59.240]   You basically get private key encryption set up going on and it is key directly to your
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:00.240]   vehicle.
[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:01.920]   So the process of replacing is a little bit complicated.
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:03.320]   But certainly there's some technology in there.
[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:05.320]   And the big thing is it's proprietary technology.
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:07.240]   So it's not the kind of thing that they can really mass produce.
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:11.440]   Viper can't sell a key fob that necessarily starts money.
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:13.320]   They actually, so they can't work on it.
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:14.320]   People get robbed.
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:15.320]   Yes.
[01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:16.320]   That's the work around it.
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:17.320]   It's actually.
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:21.320]   I can't get your key.
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:25.560]   So some of these third party ones would actually entail kind of installing your key inside the
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:28.080]   car and then having always be in there.
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:31.760]   And then the third party thing kind of takes a little functionality.
[01:38:31.760 --> 01:38:35.400]   But yeah, one of the exploits to get around these things and the encryption involved is
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:40.400]   basically to do like a man in the middle attack where somebody triggers the car and then is
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:44.240]   close enough to your home to trigger the key and then they can kind of trigger the response
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:47.000]   and enable your car to start and then drive it away at that point.
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.520]   There are some vulnerabilities in the older versions of these things in like 2018 is probably
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:51.520]   old enough.
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:39:01.040]   But anyway, it all comes down to the ugliest acronym in the world, ARPU, ARPU, average revenue
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:03.280]   per user.
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:08.360]   Although the people, a lot of people call average revs new per unit, which tells you
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:10.920]   how much they think of the users.
[01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:13.560]   You're a unit.
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:14.560]   But this.
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:19.800]   I wonder, is this the, is this the way the car business is going to go?
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:21.640]   You mentioned BMW for a while.
[01:39:21.640 --> 01:39:25.560]   They were getting a lot of heat because they charged, they put car play in your car.
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:30.720]   But if you wanted to use it, even though it's an Apple feature, you had to pay BMW a monthly
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:31.720]   fee.
[01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:36.560]   I already pay, I don't, I don't have a Toyota, but if I did, I would have already paid $500
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:38.000]   for this remote start feature.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.560]   And then on top of that, you want $8 a month?
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:43.160]   Is this, is this what's happening with a car business?
[01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:47.400]   If you're going to pay, pay, get the right amount of services for something that you're
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:48.400]   trying to charge.
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:51.040]   Like I said, the fact this attached to your physical key in it, there's still charging
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:53.280]   me $8 a month seems scammy to me.
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:54.280]   You know what I mean?
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:56.960]   When you buy a Tesla, they say, do you want the technology package for 10 grand?
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:59.120]   I don't know who's not buying that up front.
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:00.120]   You know what I mean?
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:01.120]   But because that's what you need.
[01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:07.160]   And there's a lot of people like there's a who paid 5,000 or even $10,000 to get full
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:08.160]   self driving.
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:09.160]   Yeah.
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:13.120]   And they, and they, you're looking at one of them.
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:14.120]   Did you?
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:15.120]   Well, that hurts.
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:16.120]   That's okay, Tim.
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:18.120]   I don't because I feel stupid.
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:19.120]   It's okay.
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:20.120]   I got glasses.
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:21.120]   Well, yeah.
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:22.120]   Oh, you win.
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:26.160]   We need to, we need to test this.
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:28.160]   So this is actually car that we leased through road shows.
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:29.160]   That's different.
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:30.160]   So we can do testing of the car.
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:34.640]   So if not my money directly, but we needed to have access to the functionality of the
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:35.640]   10 grand for the model.
[01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:41.040]   Why do we lease so that we can, we now own a Tesla that we can do testing on and we paid
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:42.040]   the 10 grand.
[01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:43.520]   And yeah, we don't have full self driving.
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:45.520]   And honestly, it's a two year lease.
[01:40:45.520 --> 01:40:48.240]   I wouldn't put money on the fact that we're going to have full self driving by the end
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:49.240]   of this lease.
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:50.280]   Yeah, it's probably a bad idea to do it on a lease.
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:56.720]   I did it when it was $5,000 on a leased Model X. Three years later, I turned it back and
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:41:00.280]   never got anything for that $5,000 in.
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:01.280]   It's funny.
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:06.200]   In my mind, and this is I think 2016, I felt like I don't mind paying Elon a little
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:12.600]   big for my bio weapon hazard mode, which is just a HEPA filter.
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:17.240]   But because I feel like I'm kind of subsidizing this move to electric vehicles, I don't know
[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:18.240]   why I was probably.
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:22.240]   But did you open a hood and check to make sure you're sure it is a filter in there?
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:24.160]   Are you sure it is a filter in there?
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:25.560]   You might have paid for that filter never.
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:27.920]   You've been just blowing another $20,000 fan.
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:28.920]   I'll go, Leo.
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:30.920]   I mean, it's what you do.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:36.080]   Lisa, Lisa, if you can hear my voice from now on Lisa, you were in charge in the peer
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:37.080]   verification of that home.
[01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:38.960]   This man cannot be trusted, Lisa.
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:39.960]   You are in charge.
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:40.960]   Okay.
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:44.040]   I must really just look like a sucker.
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:45.040]   I saw like it's saying.
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:47.040]   I can't see me coming.
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:49.280]   I'm mad at you and a device.
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:53.760]   I'm mad that the device did not alert you before a year of the fact that they're just
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:55.680]   spitting out the same old air.
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:42:00.160]   Like that's just terrible, terrible.
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:03.040]   I need their name offline so I can make sure I don't have it.
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:05.040]   Yeah, I didn't mention the company's name.
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:06.240]   Yeah, you're a good man.
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:07.960]   You're not our sponsor.
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:11.080]   Those guys actually do what they said they would do.
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:12.080]   Let's take a little break.
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:14.080]   We'll come back with more.
[01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:21.920]   Razzan, Mo Doctor, O and JJ Stone, IQMZ.TIS the season.
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:23.680]   His phone number, please call him.
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:24.680]   Give him a hard time.
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:29.600]   844 96 4563.
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:31.400]   That's text only, of course.
[01:42:31.400 --> 01:42:34.800]   Owen was saying he's been giving this out every time he appears in the show all year
[01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:37.480]   long and he's never had a problem.
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:40.080]   I've met some awesome people.
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:42.280]   Shout out to one of your fans.
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:44.040]   Her name is Joanne.
[01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:45.960]   She doesn't message or anything like that to you, I'm sure.
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:50.880]   But this woman has been a fan of mine for a long time since I've been on your show.
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:51.880]   She's 75 years old.
[01:42:51.880 --> 01:42:53.800]   She's one of the sweetest women in the whole world.
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:56.880]   I don't even know why she listens to me because I'll be ranting and raving and talking crazy.
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:42:59.360]   But she tells me all the time, "I love you and I love Leo."
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:03.200]   And I'm like, "I don't know why I want to listen, but thank you for following me all
[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:04.200]   the time."
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:05.200]   And she says, "Me notes and emails."
[01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:06.200]   I know if they come in on the start.
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:08.200]   She comes in with my daughter.
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:10.880]   Again, you might not notice it, but shout out to Joanne.
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:11.880]   I know she's watching.
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:12.880]   I know she's listening.
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:13.880]   Love you Joanne.
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:14.880]   Hi Joanne.
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:15.880]   There you go.
[01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:16.880]   There you go.
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:17.880]   Yeah, that's sweet.
[01:43:17.880 --> 01:43:18.880]   See, that's...
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:19.880]   See, that's...
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:23.080]   This is why it's good to be trusting like you are, Owen, and give out that phone number
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:26.160]   and everything and look at all the stuff you get as a result.
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:29.800]   I might not believe in batteries yet, but I believe in people.
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:33.200]   Well, you follow right along with Jeff Jarvis.
[01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:36.200]   There's always been a man who lives in public.
[01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:37.680]   You know, he wrote public parts.
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:42.720]   He believes in the value and the power of sharing.
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:45.080]   And so you're also one of those people.
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:46.680]   Buzzmachine.com is his blog.
[01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:48.320]   It's great to have you.
[01:43:48.320 --> 01:43:53.600]   And from CNET's road show, he's the editor in chief, which makes it really fun because
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:54.600]   you get to...
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:59.440]   Is that the only car CNET leases or do you have other vehicles as well?
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:02.480]   That's actually the first one we've ever leased when Tesla nicks their PR department.
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:05.760]   They stopped really giving out cars to anybody, but you know...
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:06.760]   You had to buy it.
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:09.080]   I'm very favorable YouTubers, let's say.
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:11.480]   So I got pretty hard to actually get access to cars.
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:13.440]   So we wanted to get the full ownership experience.
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:15.200]   And so we put the money down to make it happen.
[01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:19.480]   It's kind of what I've always done, not in anything that expensive.
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:20.480]   Because I don't...
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:22.800]   Mostly because I don't want to deal with PR departments.
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:24.440]   I just don't want to...
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:25.440]   It's a pain in the butt.
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:27.840]   They go, "Well, we didn't like that review."
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:31.800]   It's like, "No, I'm just going to buy it and then we don't have to think about it."
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:33.280]   But not cars.
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:34.280]   Although, wait a minute.
[01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:35.280]   I take it back.
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:36.280]   I bought a Mustang.
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:37.280]   I bought a Tesla.
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:38.280]   Yeah.
[01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:40.560]   You bought a Ford when they were a sponsor.
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:41.560]   I did.
[01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:42.560]   I bought it because they were a sponsor.
[01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:45.960]   And we were talking about Ford's sink and I wanted to be able to legitimately talk about
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:46.960]   it.
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:49.000]   I bought the Mach-E because I wanted to talk about...
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:50.000]   I thought that was interesting.
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:55.280]   By the way, the Mach-E kind of peripherals and story, but it's been a huge success for
[01:44:55.280 --> 01:44:59.320]   Ford, they are going to make 200,000 next year.
[01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:00.320]   Yeah.
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:04.400]   And they are, of course, like a lot of cars, but there's a huge back order if you want
[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:06.080]   one, especially with the long range battery.
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:08.640]   And yeah, as you said, they're doubling production for next year.
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:10.720]   And that's a really great success story.
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:12.560]   Kind of Ford's first big EV.
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:15.000]   We've got the lightning coming out next year, which should be a big story too.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:16.680]   I'm really looking forward to that.
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:17.680]   I want that thing.
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:18.680]   That thing looks amazing.
[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:19.680]   No, Owen, you want...
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:20.680]   That thing looks amazing.
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:21.680]   The cyber truck.
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:22.680]   Man, look.
[01:45:22.680 --> 01:45:23.680]   I'm not going to lie.
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:24.680]   I'm not going to lie.
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:28.480]   I did want a cyber truck just because I wanted the little four-way 8-D-V to game with it.
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:33.760]   But that Ford lightning, that Ford lightning, that thing is a jet.
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:34.760]   The utility.
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:39.080]   I'm not even a man's man, but I tell you what, give me one of them things.
[01:45:39.080 --> 01:45:42.960]   I'm going to be power people's houses on the side delivering couches, just going off into
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:43.960]   the woods.
[01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:44.960]   That thing looks amazing.
[01:45:44.960 --> 01:45:45.960]   I don't know though.
[01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:48.560]   You might like the Rivian with the built-in kitchen.
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:49.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:50.560]   Yeah.
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:51.560]   Yeah.
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:52.560]   I'm already too big.
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:54.960]   The last thing I need is another place to eat food at.
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:57.400]   That's the last thing I need.
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:45:58.920]   I'm trying to cut down on fast food.
[01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:02.200]   Last thing I need to do is have fast food on my back in my vehicle.
[01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:04.800]   I'm going to skip that one.
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:05.800]   That's right.
[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:06.800]   All right.
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:09.320]   Our show today, it's great to have Noom speaking of...
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:13.760]   Actually, Owen, this is going to be my prescription for you.
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:15.160]   You've seen the ads.
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:17.880]   I want to tell you, Lisa and I have been doing Noom.
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:18.880]   It works.
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:20.280]   We love it.
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:25.200]   I have done every diet in the world and I've learned one thing.
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:28.960]   Diots don't work.
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:29.960]   One of the things...
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:31.680]   You saw me eat that gingerbread cookie, right?
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:35.040]   The trick with Noom is there are no bad foods.
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:37.120]   There are no good foods.
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:39.200]   There's no pressure.
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:44.440]   Noom is here to change how you think of food.
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:50.200]   It's a psychology-based approach that looks at what you eat but also more importantly,
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:51.400]   how you eat.
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:55.680]   With Noom I discovered I'm doing a lot of fog eating, unconscious eating.
[01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:59.160]   I was able to track down those habits that weren't supporting me.
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:00.400]   I can still have a cookie.
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:03.840]   In fact, I remember very early on when I was doing Noom.
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:06.400]   You get a coach, you get a group you can talk to.
[01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:07.920]   I told my coach, "Tia."
[01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:10.520]   I said, "Tia, I had a hot dog."
[01:47:10.520 --> 01:47:11.680]   She said, "That's fine.
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:13.320]   That's not nothing wrong with that.
[01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:14.320]   You logged it?"
[01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:15.960]   I said, "Yeah?"
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:17.560]   She said, "There are no bad foods."
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:20.000]   That was a light bulb went off.
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:27.160]   I think my psychology, I bet it's many others as well, is if I am feeling deprived, I overeat.
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:28.160]   I compensate.
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:29.320]   I said, "Well, screw you.
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:31.360]   I'm going to have an extra piece of cake."
[01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:36.320]   Noom, instead of making you feel guilt or regret, empowers you to keep going.
[01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:38.120]   I got to tell you, it really works.
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:40.280]   You don't have a strict set of rules.
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:45.480]   Noom, weight, empowers you with the practical knowledge to build smarter, more sustainable
[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:47.600]   habits and behaviors.
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:50.280]   It's using something that psychologists have known about for a long time.
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:53.640]   I'm a big believer in called CBT.
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:48:03.160]   Instead of getting weird and deep with it, you focus on the why instead of the what.
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:05.840]   That isn't really, it changes your relationship with eating.
[01:48:05.840 --> 01:48:09.360]   You understand why you eat when you eat and what's going on.
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:12.160]   By just simply the knowledge helps you control it.
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:15.760]   You are now in charge of your eating.
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:16.760]   Everybody's journey is different, though.
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:21.600]   I don't want to say this is, but I'm just going to say noom knows it's about progress,
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:22.600]   not perfection.
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:23.720]   There are no bad foods.
[01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:25.080]   There are no good foods.
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:30.800]   There is no pressure to change yourself to fit someone else's expectations.
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:33.520]   You just find things that work for you and that is freeing.
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:35.160]   It feels good.
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:38.280]   Not everybody needs to be or wants to be on a strict diet.
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:43.560]   Two days at the gym, two days at the gym or weird tees or anything like that.
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:48.920]   Instead of trying to fit yourself into the jam yourself into the lifestyle that somebody
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:51.360]   else tells you, try noom.
[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:55.360]   It's a psychology-based approach to find a healthier balance that's moldable to your
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:56.360]   life.
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:48:57.480]   As a result, it's more sustainable.
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:01.280]   By the way, one of the Reddit subforms I follow is the Noom Subform.
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:03.440]   It's a subreddit because it's great.
[01:49:03.440 --> 01:49:07.000]   There's even more support from Noomers there talking about our experience.
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:08.520]   There's a Noom group that you get.
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:13.240]   The Noom app, it starts with a Noom app on your iPhone or your Android device.
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:15.480]   I have to say, I can have a cookie.
[01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:16.480]   I write it down.
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:21.040]   I put it in the Noom app and I write it down and it helps me understand what I'm eating,
[01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:23.080]   what I'm eating, why I'm eating.
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:24.840]   That helps me lose weight.
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:26.280]   You don't need rules to lose weight.
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:29.000]   You just need knowledge and wisdom.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:33.600]   You need empowerment so that you can build a smarter, more sustainable relationship with
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:35.040]   the food you eat.
[01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:36.040]   New habits.
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:39.560]   Noom's cognitive behavioral approach helps you better understand your relationship with
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:40.560]   food.
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:43.200]   How to be more mindful of your habits gives you the knowledge and support you need.
[01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:44.800]   You need for long lasting change.
[01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:48.560]   It all starts when you go to noom.com/twit.
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:50.000]   Answer the questionnaire.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:53.600]   By the way, that's a great onboarding process because it starts right there.
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:55.240]   You start thinking about it.
[01:49:55.240 --> 01:49:56.320]   You start thinking about it.
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:49:58.600]   Your relationship with food.
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:49:59.920]   Noom is very effective.
[01:49:59.920 --> 01:50:09.520]   75% of Noom users finish the program and more than 60%, 60% keep the weight off for a year
[01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:10.680]   or more.
[01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:12.960]   It really, really works.
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:16.280]   I feel like it's changed my life.
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:18.720]   And Lisa will vouch for it too.
[01:50:18.720 --> 01:50:20.840]   It's amazing what she's done.
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:24.520]   With Noom taking care of your health is empowering instead of stress inducing because you know
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:26.240]   what happens when you get stressed?
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:27.240]   Yee-ee!
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:29.240]   So why did I have stress?
[01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:30.480]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:33.600]   No need to fear ruining the whole program with one off day.
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:38.080]   Believe me, I have when we went to Mexico, I said, "Dalisa, I'm not Noom-ing."
[01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:39.160]   I'm not Noom-ing.
[01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:40.160]   She said, "I'm Noom-ing."
[01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:41.160]   She did.
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:42.560]   Noom the whole time.
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:47.000]   Did her lessons, logged her food, got her exercise.
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:48.360]   She lost weight.
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:51.360]   It's so bad at her.
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:52.560]   I gained a little bit, but you know what?
[01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:57.000]   I was able to lose it right away because Noom got me back on track.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.320]   All you need is a daily 10 minute check-in.
[01:50:59.320 --> 01:51:00.560]   By the way, that's the other thing.
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:02.240]   It's very, very, very easy.
[01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:06.560]   No grueling early mornings or huge chunks of your day spent doing stuff.
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:07.560]   It's simple.
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:08.560]   It's fast.
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:11.080]   It's a lifetime habit that will stay with you forever.
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:14.920]   Start building better habits for healthier, long-term results.
[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:16.160]   This is not a diet.
[01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:21.440]   This is the right way to learn about how you eat and make it work for you.
[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:26.240]   Sign up for your trial at Noom.com/twit.
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:27.800]   Noom.com/twit.
[01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:29.640]   Sign up for your trial.
[01:51:29.640 --> 01:51:30.640]   Absolutely.
[01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:31.640]   Go ahead.
[01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:35.240]   I'm going to Noom Uncle Leo because you've heard about it.
[01:51:35.240 --> 01:51:37.360]   Yeah, I saw you eating a cookie and then what was I doing?
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:39.160]   I had to get a snack too.
[01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:40.160]   There's some psychological-
[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:41.760]   It's totally psychological.
[01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:43.600]   I had to get a cookie too.
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:44.600]   They talk about-
[01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:45.600]   It's not going to figure it out.
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:50.440]   They talk about the elephant and the rider.
[01:51:50.440 --> 01:51:53.360]   You're trying to control an elephant by riding it.
[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:56.360]   The elephant gone do what it wants to do.
[01:51:56.360 --> 01:51:59.440]   You have to learn how to work with the elephant.
[01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:01.440]   It really works.
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:02.440]   I don't know.
[01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:03.440]   It's hard to describe.
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:04.440]   You've got to do it.
[01:52:04.440 --> 01:52:05.440]   It's fun.
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:06.440]   You're going to love it.
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:07.440]   Noom.
[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:08.440]   Education is the key.
[01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:09.440]   That is the trick.
[01:52:09.440 --> 01:52:11.120]   Big, big, big believer in this.
[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:12.120]   We really-
[01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:16.400]   In fact, we started doing the beginning of this year, I think in March, something like
[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:18.000]   that, maybe January of March.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.000]   I started doing it.
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:22.400]   Lisa said, "I'll keep you company because she was going to be a supportive wife."
[01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:24.040]   She looks great.
[01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:27.520]   Then she fell in love with it.
[01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:32.600]   She didn't need to lose a lot, but she's at her lowest weight that I've ever known her
[01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:34.040]   and sustaining it.
[01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:36.640]   She's very, very happy about that.
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:38.120]   She's always been slim.
[01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:40.720]   Me, on the other hand, I've always battled with my weight.
[01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:47.080]   It's just a really nice way to handle that for my health and for my long-term goals.
[01:52:47.080 --> 01:52:50.040]   I'm really, really, really happy with it.
[01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:55.040]   Over the year, it's just been great.
[01:52:55.040 --> 01:53:01.840]   This one, you clearly you put in, Jeff Jarvis, the words "Yan Lekun" just tells me everything.
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:03.600]   He's a professor at your school.
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:04.840]   He's a NYU.
[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:06.600]   Are you there, Jeff?
[01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:08.000]   No, I didn't put this in.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:09.000]   Oh.
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.640]   Chief AI scientist at Facebook.
[01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:13.120]   Oh, I did put it in.
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:16.120]   Yes, you're right.
[01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:17.160]   Yeah, you got me.
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:18.160]   You got me.
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:20.760]   I just say dog and I know him.
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.560]   You're still a good dog.
[01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:24.360]   I know from him.
[01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:31.320]   Turing Award Laureate from the ACM, his tweet, "World Models, Intuitive Physics, Planning,
[01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:37.160]   and Resume Solving," "Discrete Search for Solutions, Continuous Optimization of Control,
[01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:38.160]   Parameters.
[01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:41.640]   Dogs managed to do this with two billion neurons.
[01:53:41.640 --> 01:53:47.000]   Why debate human-level AI when we can't approach dog-level intelligence yet?"
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:51.600]   And he posts this video of a human and a dog.
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:52.600]   The dog is helping.
[01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:53.600]   He's a good boy.
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:55.960]   Can I show the video, John?
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:56.960]   Are you not?
[01:53:56.960 --> 01:53:58.760]   Oh, we are.
[01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:03.240]   Oh, I'm not seeing it because I'm not seeing it.
[01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:08.680]   So the human's putting what tires up and then the dog's dog wants to help.
[01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:09.680]   Wants to help.
[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:13.360]   So he's sorting the tires.
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:17.680]   He's figuring out how to carry four at once, which is a challenge.
[01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:18.680]   But you know what?
[01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:20.640]   He's rearranging the tires to figure it out.
[01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:21.640]   He figures it out.
[01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:22.640]   And out by bit.
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:23.640]   Well, you'll see.
[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:24.640]   Yes, he does.
[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:26.640]   Spoiler, he does.
[01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:27.640]   Oh my God.
[01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:29.240]   He figures out, well, that works.
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:31.080]   Okay, well, we're tired to deal with him.
[01:54:31.080 --> 01:54:33.080]   I don't think I could figure this out.
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:34.080]   No.
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:35.840]   Especially if you had to use your teeth.
[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:39.200]   No, it didn't quite work.
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:46.000]   He's actually solved the problem of how to pick up one tire and move all four at the
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:47.000]   same time.
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:48.000]   We don't deserve dogs.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:49.000]   We don't deserve dogs.
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:53.440]   Dogs are the best pets in the world.
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:54.440]   Wait a minute.
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:55.440]   I have to watch that again.
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:56.440]   That's crazy.
[01:54:56.440 --> 01:54:57.440]   You know that?
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:02.760]   Have you seen that little, like the little, like it almost looked like a buzzers that they
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:07.520]   have and you put a word on there and it like the dog hits and says treat outdoors, whatever.
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:09.080]   Oh, that was great on TikTok.
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:14.480]   Man, I've seen somebody with like 37 buttons and the dogs literally writing essays every
[01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:18.360]   morning like, Hey, let's go for 15 minute walks and I'm going to take a bath and you
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:20.280]   know, Susie came by earlier, right?
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:21.280]   I'm like, what?
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:23.400]   A dog knows what the most amazing thing is.
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:24.680]   I trust that if it's on TikTok.
[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:29.000]   But this is not a buddy, buddy, the talking dog, the talking dog.
[01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:30.000]   It's not.
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:31.480]   I mean, other people's dogs do it too.
[01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:32.480]   And not just on TikTok.
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:33.480]   I've seen on YouTube.
[01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:35.280]   Like I've seen people in their house use.
[01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:36.280]   I'm not smart.
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:37.280]   I'm a dream.
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:41.280]   I got a town, but I mean these dogs once they learn these buttons, boy, it's hard to shut
[01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:42.280]   them up.
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:44.080]   They were like treat, treat, treat.
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:47.920]   Okay, then I understand because they figured out somehow I press this button, whatever
[01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:48.920]   it means.
[01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:51.120]   I'm going to do a lot of buttons.
[01:55:51.120 --> 01:55:52.120]   Where do you see it?
[01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:53.120]   There's a lot of buttons.
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:54.880]   I want TikTok to look up bunny.
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:58.440]   Okay, here's bunny, the talking dog.
[01:55:58.440 --> 01:56:01.240]   Wait a minute, they're training this dog to talk.
[01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:02.240]   Look at those buttons.
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:04.600]   Look at that.
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:05.640]   You couldn't do it, Leo.
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:09.600]   I always want bunny's haircut.
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:10.600]   You got a little photo.
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:12.000]   Okay, wait a minute now.
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:13.240]   So turn on the sound.
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:14.240]   Thank you, baby.
[01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:15.240]   Okay.
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:17.280]   I'm up on the couch for speeches.
[01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:18.280]   Okay.
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:19.280]   Okay.
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:20.280]   I missed.
[01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:21.280]   I got.
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:22.280]   Go to know.
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:23.280]   Okay.
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:26.640]   Here's, here's mom poop in here.
[01:56:26.640 --> 01:56:27.640]   Okay.
[01:56:27.640 --> 01:56:29.640]   Mom, where?
[01:56:29.640 --> 01:56:30.640]   Mom poop where?
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:37.080]   I guess we could go for a walk on the trail to poop.
[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:40.480]   This dog is not talking.
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:41.480]   You watch it.
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:43.320]   You watch this all the time.
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:44.320]   You're going to believe in that.
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:46.440]   Where are you asking where I poop?
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:49.640]   Mom poop in here.
[01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:51.400]   Mom poop over here.
[01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:52.880]   Did a dog wanted an answer?
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:53.880]   You don't know.
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:54.880]   No, no, no.
[01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:59.960]   Mom has, as, as assuming a lot, the dog's just going there.
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:01.800]   I don't buy that for a minute.
[01:57:01.800 --> 01:57:03.560]   We don't have time to tell them.
[01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:04.560]   You watch this dog.
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:06.080]   You watch any of these dogs.
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:07.160]   Tim, I'm sorry.
[01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:09.200]   I've made you suffer through this, Tim.
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:11.720]   But I'm telling you, these dogs are genius.
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:13.080]   Which one should I watch?
[01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:14.960]   I don't care about where I don't know.
[01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:15.960]   All right.
[01:57:15.960 --> 01:57:16.960]   Let's watch.
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:17.960]   Watch what I own time.
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:18.960]   Stop making me suffer.
[01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:20.560]   Does everybody go watch the dog talk?
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:22.440]   I'm telling you, it's real.
[01:57:22.440 --> 01:57:24.000]   No, it's real.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.000]   It is.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.920]   This always proves how dumb humans are.
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:31.680]   I've seen dogs get beers out of fridge when the dad says they're going to pee.
[01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:33.040]   I mean, he goes to the mirror.
[01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:36.080]   And then look in the mirror.
[01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:39.040]   There's a lot of human interpretation going on.
[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:40.760]   Who this?
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:42.560]   That's bunny.
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:44.560]   That's bunny.
[01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:49.560]   Because when I teach a dog, you don't understand.
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:52.240]   Okay, I'm sorry.
[01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:56.840]   You can't watch it too much TikTok.
[01:57:56.840 --> 01:57:58.400]   It's going to your brain cells.
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:00.880]   Oh, what an eye are holding you for a second.
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:01.880]   Stop.
[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:03.200]   See, this is what I like about TikTok.
[01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:04.840]   We need to talk about these TikTok stories.
[01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:08.760]   Just because it's something on TikTok, so I've blamed TikTok for you not to understand
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:10.280]   or the way the world happens.
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:13.360]   There's other forms of media, there's other forms of content.
[01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:17.120]   And this content is after saying because of TikTok, the things happen.
[01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:20.840]   Let's talk about the TikTok school thing because that personally affected me this week and
[01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:21.840]   it made me angry.
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:25.400]   Let's talk about something you want to be TikTok and let's get to somebody's TikTok stories.
[01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:31.280]   So this was a case of students posting on TikTok, what, bomb threats?
[01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:33.480]   Well, or just threats.
[01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:36.120]   Nations-wise, school attacks.
[01:58:36.120 --> 01:58:37.280]   Okay.
[01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:41.640]   And school districts were shutting down, sending kids home.
[01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:43.560]   Did this happen to Aliyah?
[01:58:43.560 --> 01:58:44.560]   Yes.
[01:58:44.560 --> 01:58:46.880]   So I get a text message.
[01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:51.920]   Now, mind you, since Aliyah has been in the third grade, we've had a thing where I go
[01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:56.120]   in her classroom, I scout her school, I tell if there's ever an event, like I give her
[01:58:56.120 --> 01:58:59.920]   certain places to hide and go to and her mother's always hated that I do this.
[01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:00.920]   But it's what I do.
[01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:04.800]   So anytime that there's a fire drill, learn anything, her first thing to do is to text
[01:59:04.800 --> 01:59:05.800]   me.
[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:08.640]   So she texted me and said, "There's a drill going on."
[01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:09.640]   And I said, "Okay."
[01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:12.640]   Five minutes later, she says, "Dad, this isn't a regular drill.
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:13.640]   Something's wrong."
[01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:14.640]   So I go up to the school.
[01:59:14.640 --> 01:59:18.320]   Now, mind you, I'm not Rambo, but I like for her to know that I'm close by.
[01:59:18.320 --> 01:59:20.280]   So I sat at the edge of the school parking lot.
[01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:21.280]   They got Amber lights up.
[01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:22.960]   You can't approach the school.
[01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:24.360]   And I just find out where she's at.
[01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:25.560]   And we're talking back and forth.
[01:59:25.560 --> 01:59:30.040]   And her mom starts texting me because now her mom's a teacher.
[01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:32.080]   Her school started shutting down.
[01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:36.840]   And then after you realize it's more than just one school, one location.
[01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:40.720]   And then you start hearing about the threats being made online and TikTok and Twitter and
[01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:41.720]   all that kind of stuff.
[01:59:41.720 --> 01:59:46.000]   So it made me feel a little bit better that there wasn't an actual threat at the school.
[01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:49.400]   But mind you, last year our kid had a knife and the school got shut down.
[01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:50.920]   So things do happen.
[01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:57.280]   But this freaked me out because schools aren't really equipped for things like this.
[01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:59.080]   They really do happen in the moment.
[01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:03.200]   They have no one has yet to find the original post.
[02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:04.680]   That's the issue.
[02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:05.680]   Yeah.
[02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:12.600]   Somebody supposedly posted it, you know, December 17th would be national shoot up your school
[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:14.000]   day.
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:15.560]   No one has found the original post.
[02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:16.560]   Nobody had none.
[02:00:16.560 --> 02:00:17.560]   No journalists.
[02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:18.560]   Nobody confined it.
[02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:24.160]   But there are a lot of follow posts saying, yeah, oh, yeah.
[02:00:24.160 --> 02:00:25.160]   Did you see that?
[02:00:25.160 --> 02:00:26.160]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:27.160]   Yeah.
[02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:29.760]   Oh, and you said there was an Amber light at the school.
[02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:32.200]   Is there a warning traffic light at the school?
[02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:35.240]   So yeah, our school we had an incident.
[02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:40.600]   Like I said, where a kid had a knife and he threatened to hurt somebody and they were
[02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:41.600]   woeful and prepared.
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:45.600]   So then our school put in an institution where there's huge signs before you enter the school
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:50.360]   to say if the Amber light is flashing, do not enter the school.
[02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:53.000]   Do not come on school property, things like that.
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.360]   So if you just were to happen to drive up, you'd know this.
[02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:56.360]   It's going on.
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:00:58.200]   Is this sad that we have to know?
[02:00:58.200 --> 02:00:59.600]   It's just you would know.
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:04.480]   So first of all, it'd be crazy to blame this on TikTok anymore than you'd blame the
[02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:05.480]   phone company.
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:09.480]   If a bomb threat were phoned in, which has happened, by the way, since I was a kid in
[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:10.480]   school.
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:11.600]   And that's what I mean about that.
[02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:14.400]   Everybody on line was like, this is why they should be in TikTok.
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:19.560]   And the kids in the TikTok and the guy was like, bro, like this is not a TikTok issue
[02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:20.560]   per se.
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:23.760]   Like these things have been going on long before TikTok.
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:26.200]   So let's focus on the real problem.
[02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:33.600]   And police department put out a warning saying there's a trend on TikTok that could be very
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:34.600]   dangerous.
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:36.080]   Now, I never saw this trend.
[02:01:36.080 --> 02:01:39.280]   I'm not, I guess, enough of a TikTok user or maybe because I'm an old guy.
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:40.520]   I don't see this.
[02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:48.720]   But apparently people were hammering out the rhythm of a Kesha song on people's door.
[02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:55.400]   And so the Puddle Member police were saying, A, it could damage the door and B, and this
[02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:57.600]   is actually a legitimate concern.
[02:01:57.600 --> 02:02:02.200]   Don't do this, kids, because a homeowner might open the door and shoot your dad.
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:06.200]   So thinking that this is like some beginning of some assault on the house or something
[02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:07.200]   like that.
[02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:09.200]   Knock, knock, zoom, zoom, anybody.
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:13.280]   Is that what a flaming, putting a flaming bag of poo on somebody's doorstep?
[02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:14.280]   There you go.
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:15.280]   Knocking and having them come out.
[02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:19.160]   Like I said, like we blame technology for the things that dumb children have done for
[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:20.160]   a lifetime.
[02:02:20.160 --> 02:02:24.800]   They're going teepee on people's houses and trees and egging somebody's car or windows.
[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:28.960]   I mean, like long before the, long before the internet happened, these things were going
[02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:29.960]   on.
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:33.960]   And I have to say, Jeff, you're famous for the use of the phrase moral panic.
[02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:35.800]   This is moral panic.
[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:43.280]   The pedal of a police blaming TikTok for this, because they almost want to believe it and
[02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:45.560]   they want to blame somebody for it.
[02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:50.000]   And I, you know, the same thing with the Tide Pod challenge and all of that stuff.
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:51.360]   I don't know.
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:56.760]   I don't feel like it's worse than it was because the TikTok exists.
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:02:58.760]   So anyway.
[02:02:58.760 --> 02:03:01.960]   It's the fallacy here that everything was okay.
[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:02.960]   America was just fine.
[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:03.960]   We were just fine.
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:08.160]   We had no problems, no racism, no sexism, no inequity until the internet came along.
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:15.000]   Now, on the other hand, and I talked about this and you had it, Jeff, on, on Wednesday,
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:19.880]   everybody in the world got a cyclone warning from the Philippines.
[02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:20.880]   You did not get it.
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:21.880]   You did not get it.
[02:03:21.880 --> 02:03:24.280]   Oh, I thought everybody, I certainly unread it.
[02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:26.240]   Everybody said, I got it all over the world.
[02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:31.760]   A public storm warning for a storm going to hitting the Philippines from the Philippines
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:36.800]   era, what is the air and space, you know, the weather, weather group.
[02:03:36.800 --> 02:03:41.400]   I never heard anything from Google, but I sure did hear on Reddit a lot of people saying,
[02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:42.600]   I'm in Germany.
[02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:43.600]   I got it.
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:44.600]   I'm in New Jersey.
[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:47.400]   I'm in the UK.
[02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:50.720]   I saw it when I got up and I thought, this is weird.
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:53.200]   Are we getting a big storm?
[02:03:53.200 --> 02:04:00.720]   So that's just a strange feature of our modern world that we're all interconnected somehow.
[02:04:00.720 --> 02:04:07.960]   Alert, alert, alert, alert.
[02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:10.320]   I guess we haven't done any Facebook stories, Jeff.
[02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:12.120]   You want to, should we delve in?
[02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:13.120]   What's here?
[02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:14.120]   Well, it's here.
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:17.960]   Well, the big, I think the big one, actually maybe it's not even here.
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:18.960]   Look, did we miss it?
[02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:19.960]   Did I somehow miss it?
[02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:25.400]   The big one is that Facebook had to, or should I call it meta or Facebook?
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:26.640]   Oh, Facebook.
[02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:30.880]   You know, it's the Pan Am building still.
[02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:32.240]   Meta, I refuse to.
[02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:37.240]   I'm going to call it from now in the company formerly known as Facebook.
[02:04:37.240 --> 02:04:44.760]   Says 50,000 Facebook users may have been spied upon by private surveillance firms, seven
[02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:50.000]   surveillance for higher firms, they have now banned them from the meta platforms.
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:54.920]   They say the firms carried out a combination of reconnaissance, engagement and exploitation.
[02:04:54.920 --> 02:04:56.800]   Defined spied upon.
[02:04:56.800 --> 02:04:58.520]   Well, it's not my phrase.
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:01.680]   It's Meta's phrase.
[02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:08.360]   Cobwebs technology, cognite, black cube, blue hawk, Belltrox, Cytrox, and an unknown
[02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:09.360]   Chinese entity.
[02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:14.720]   Four of them located in Israel, one in India, one in North Macedonia, one in China.
[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:19.400]   They all denied it, of course.
[02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:24.920]   Meta said the seven firms carried out a combination of reconnaissance, engagement and exploitation.
[02:05:24.920 --> 02:05:28.920]   Some carried out all three, while others focused on one or two.
[02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:35.480]   1500 accounts linked to the seven firms have been removed from meta platforms they targeted,
[02:05:35.480 --> 02:05:40.840]   journalists and human rights activists in over a hundred countries.
[02:05:40.840 --> 02:05:46.120]   And fake accounts befriended targets, you're attacking methods to acquire information.
[02:05:46.120 --> 02:05:49.720]   I guess, you know, if Facebook's the internet, this stuff happens on the internet all the
[02:05:49.720 --> 02:05:51.720]   time, but does feel like Facebook.
[02:05:51.720 --> 02:05:53.880]   I want to know what was their goal?
[02:05:53.880 --> 02:05:54.880]   What did they do?
[02:05:54.880 --> 02:05:55.880]   What was the risk?
[02:05:55.880 --> 02:05:56.880]   Not saying it's not there.
[02:05:56.880 --> 02:05:58.880]   I'm not saying it's not real.
[02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:02.240]   It's rather amorphous as stated.
[02:06:02.240 --> 02:06:04.600]   The global surveillance for higher industry.
[02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:07.280]   This is from Meta's post.
[02:06:07.280 --> 02:06:12.160]   People across the internet to collect intelligence, manipulate them into revealing information
[02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:15.920]   and compromise their device and accounts.
[02:06:15.920 --> 02:06:19.240]   That's the closest it's gotten to harm.
[02:06:19.240 --> 02:06:21.080]   It's like Pegasus.
[02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:26.240]   You know, what is Facebook's obligation to protect you?
[02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:30.720]   I mean, part of the problem is that Facebook is uniquely positioned to let bad guys into
[02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:31.720]   your life.
[02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:33.680]   You know, we all get emails.
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:35.280]   I just got an email this morning.
[02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:41.200]   And I'm so excited saying I have $14 million in a bank account in Nigeria just waiting for
[02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:42.200]   me.
[02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:43.200]   But that's an email.
[02:06:43.200 --> 02:06:45.000]   It's easy to ignore Facebook somehow.
[02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:49.800]   You feel like friends and family, they're letting them in to your life.
[02:06:49.800 --> 02:06:50.800]   Do they have a high-end?
[02:06:50.800 --> 02:06:53.160]   What's we wanted to know in a minute ago saying this is going on for ages.
[02:06:53.160 --> 02:06:58.640]   I got a physical letter for somebody saying that there's a Jarvis who died in Canada with
[02:06:58.640 --> 02:06:59.640]   $6 million.
[02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:01.680]   They only have to assign a piece of paper.
[02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:02.680]   Physical letter.
[02:07:02.680 --> 02:07:05.680]   Can't change letters.
[02:07:05.680 --> 02:07:06.680]   Yeah, right.
[02:07:06.680 --> 02:07:07.680]   Right.
[02:07:07.680 --> 02:07:08.680]   Oh, man.
[02:07:08.680 --> 02:07:09.680]   Good stuff.
[02:07:09.680 --> 02:07:10.680]   Good old time.
[02:07:10.680 --> 02:07:11.680]   So Facebook doesn't have a responsibility.
[02:07:11.680 --> 02:07:12.680]   Oh, yeah.
[02:07:12.680 --> 02:07:15.080]   I think it does.
[02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:19.960]   But this is one of, you know, I think that Facebook should make a warrant a covenant with
[02:07:19.960 --> 02:07:24.000]   its users to say this is what we will do for you and then stick up to it.
[02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.800]   But they're afraid of doing that because every time they don't, every time they mess
[02:07:26.800 --> 02:07:31.400]   up, every time they forget one, then they're not going to...
[02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:35.880]   The good news is Facebook did say something about it and said this is what we've done
[02:07:35.880 --> 02:07:36.880]   about it.
[02:07:36.880 --> 02:07:37.840]   This was on Thursday.
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:43.100]   But they say nearly 50,000 journalists and activists were targeted in over a hundred
[02:07:43.100 --> 02:07:44.100]   countries.
[02:07:44.100 --> 02:07:49.400]   I mean, this is, to me, this is just the other arm of Pegasus.
[02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:55.760]   This is one more way that we can get at the journalists and activists, people we don't
[02:07:55.760 --> 02:07:57.400]   want to have anything to do with.
[02:07:57.400 --> 02:08:01.400]   I'm sure we'll only get a free year of credit monitoring and everything.
[02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:06.080]   It's so important.
[02:08:06.080 --> 02:08:08.840]   So important.
[02:08:08.840 --> 02:08:15.640]   Melania Trump getting into the NFT biz.
[02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:22.760]   The good news is this is NFTs meant to inspire and earn cash and it talks.
[02:08:22.760 --> 02:08:28.160]   She's looking at you, she's spying on you.
[02:08:28.160 --> 02:08:31.800]   Her eyes are going to stare at you and then it talks.
[02:08:31.800 --> 02:08:32.800]   Okay.
[02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:38.720]   You know, Tom Brady is doing NFTs including digital ownership of his college resume and
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:39.960]   his old cleats.
[02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:44.640]   By the way, you don't get the cleats.
[02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:46.560]   He keeps the cleats.
[02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:51.520]   You get digital ownership of the cleats.
[02:08:51.520 --> 02:08:58.560]   He grossed $1.3 million on his NFT sale.
[02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:05.080]   Melania's first NFT offering a watercolor depiction of her quote, "cobalt blue eyes."
[02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:10.120]   It's called Melania's Vision.
[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:17.040]   For $187, you're going to get an amulet to inspire and I don't know, you get a piece
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:18.040]   of her eyes.
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:19.040]   I don't know.
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:21.680]   I don't know how many of these.
[02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:28.520]   She calls it a one of a kind auction of historical importance that will include digital artwork,
[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:32.600]   physical artwork and a physical one of a kind accessory.
[02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:36.560]   See, this makes me mad because I'm an NFT person.
[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:37.560]   I'm an NFT believer.
[02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:39.680]   But when you read this, it makes me angry.
[02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:41.400]   I'm mad that I have to get angry by.
[02:09:41.400 --> 02:09:43.760]   Like I shouldn't care, but it makes me angry.
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:48.440]   I think the first thing I think is, is your demographic even going to be capable of purchasing
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:49.440]   your NFT?
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:55.240]   Are they really like, you might as well just be selling iodine pills on what's in his website?
[02:09:55.240 --> 02:09:56.240]   What's the guy's name?
[02:09:56.240 --> 02:09:58.240]   You know what I'm talking about?
[02:09:58.240 --> 02:09:59.240]   I just...
[02:09:59.240 --> 02:10:00.240]   The pillow guy?
[02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:01.240]   Mike Pillow?
[02:10:01.240 --> 02:10:02.240]   Yeah, my pillow guy.
[02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:05.840]   I feel like you should be sending out feathers, like physical feathers.
[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:09.520]   Who's really buying NFTs from wherever they're aiming at?
[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:10.760]   Stop making me mad about NFTs.
[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:11.760]   I like NFTs.
[02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:13.000]   Well, this is another problem.
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.360]   I don't know exactly the solution.
[02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:22.640]   But an NFT artist has withdrawn all of his art from deviant art because somebody's just
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:24.120]   taking it, selling it.
[02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:26.080]   It's identical to his original.
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:27.520]   That's terrible.
[02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:28.680]   And they're just selling it.
[02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:33.800]   The thing is, the people who admit NFTs don't do anything to say, "Oh, do you own this?"
[02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:37.680]   No, most people don't even write descriptions of their stuff after time.
[02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:39.960]   So it's a definite problem.
[02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:41.960]   They've got to fix that.
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:43.480]   What do you use NFTs for?
[02:10:43.480 --> 02:10:44.680]   What do you like them for?
[02:10:44.680 --> 02:10:46.920]   What do they do for you?
[02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:53.480]   So, we are human beings and we collect things and we save things that have value.
[02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:54.680]   Can I buy your cleats?
[02:10:54.680 --> 02:10:55.680]   Right.
[02:10:55.680 --> 02:10:56.680]   Right.
[02:10:56.680 --> 02:10:58.040]   So again, the cleats thing isn't a big deal, right?
[02:10:58.040 --> 02:11:00.040]   Like, that's dumb because it's a physical item.
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:02.080]   Let's say, let's take the Mona Lisa, right?
[02:11:02.080 --> 02:11:06.360]   How many people have put up pictures of the Mona Lisa on their background or on a t-shirt
[02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:09.480]   and they've worn it just because it's the Mona Lisa and they love the Mona Lisa?
[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:12.960]   That picture doesn't have value, but the actual Mona Lisa does.
[02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:16.840]   So when people say, "Oh, I could just copy and paste the picture," the real value is
[02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:18.240]   in the ownership of things.
[02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:22.000]   So let's say I wanted to make Dr. Bots and put them out of my discord and give them to
[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:23.680]   people that were fans of mine, right?
[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:26.880]   So let's say I have 1,000 fans and I make 1,000 things and they want to save them and
[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:27.880]   collect them.
[02:11:27.880 --> 02:11:28.880]   They'd be the first one to have them.
[02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:31.680]   If they wanted to resell them one day down the line, what if I died yesterday, they'd
[02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:32.680]   be worse than money?
[02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:34.280]   I don't know, but as humans, it's what we do.
[02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:38.480]   We collect baseball cards and songs and music and records.
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:39.480]   It's what we do.
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:43.400]   We really understand and get the concept and grasp of NFTs, but there's also like with
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:46.880]   everything, like I said, beautiful, horrible human beings that are stealing people's content
[02:11:46.880 --> 02:11:50.600]   and distributing it and Mona Lisa's eyes and things that make me angry too.
[02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:55.640]   But I just understand the stored value of NFTs and the process that we're doing it.
[02:11:55.640 --> 02:12:00.280]   And it's also something that is disruptive in a new way for artists to get paid for their
[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:01.280]   stuff.
[02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:06.440]   Like if you're a musician, there's no reason for you to go slave yourself out to a big company
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:10.320]   that's just gonna advance you some money and rip off your royalties for rest of your life.
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:14.440]   Go make your song, put on an FTE, put it out to your fans and say, hey, you'll get royalties
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:18.160]   as I get spins on Spotify, which means they're gonna put you on their playlist and listen
[02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:21.880]   to you every single night because they're gonna end up getting two cents a day or whatever.
[02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:25.440]   There's multiple different ways I can reign on it forever, but I just believe in the power
[02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:27.920]   that's given back to regular people and content creators.
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:29.960]   And I know that there's also things wrong with that too.
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:30.960]   Bye, Humbug.
[02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:31.960]   Merry Christmas.
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:32.960]   Bye, my NFTs when I start selling.
[02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:37.000]   Right now, right now I do all my stuff in public.
[02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:41.360]   I've made some good money flipping some NFTs and I just believe in the process.
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:42.440]   That's all I'm saying.
[02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:45.080]   But I know that there's also a problem.
[02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:47.160]   So there's also a problem.
[02:12:47.160 --> 02:12:51.080]   Radio Shack went bankrupt in 2015, right?
[02:12:51.080 --> 02:12:54.320]   They closed all the stores, which is the same because in a lot of towns, that was the
[02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:57.520]   only place you could get, you know, components.
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:02.360]   And then of course, the battery club.
[02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:07.320]   I don't know then somebody bought it and then there's kind of a round and then they're not
[02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:08.320]   around.
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:09.560]   But this is the latest.
[02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:11.360]   This is the latest.
[02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:17.280]   Yeah, I don't know who actually owns the brand Radio Shack or the site Radio Shack.com.
[02:13:17.280 --> 02:13:25.560]   But if you go to Radio Shack.com, this is the latest bringing cryptocurrency to the mainstream.
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:30.680]   Our mission is to be the first protocol to bridge the gap in mainstream use of DeFi,
[02:13:30.680 --> 02:13:32.280]   decentralized finance.
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:36.600]   They're going to issue a radio token.
[02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:43.040]   They're getting into crypto brand recognition, brand recognition.
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:46.320]   They got the Radio Shack logo.
[02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:48.120]   I don't know who these people are.
[02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:52.120]   They must have.
[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:55.320]   They've got a Radio Shack Super Bowl commercial on the site.
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:58.600]   It's just weird.
[02:13:58.600 --> 02:13:59.600]   It's weird.
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:04.160]   Like I said, I'm not trying to tell anybody to go buy anything or invest anything.
[02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:06.960]   I'm just saying, I understand why we do it as human beings.
[02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:07.960]   I understand this value.
[02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:12.360]   I also understand that just like Amazon, people are turning Halloween costumes, that there's
[02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:14.600]   some fishy stuff out here in the water.
[02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:15.600]   I get it.
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:16.600]   Yeah.
[02:14:16.600 --> 02:14:17.600]   I mean, you nailed it.
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:18.880]   I mean, why do we collect baseball cards?
[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:23.320]   They have no intrinsic value or bottle caps or you don't get any babies.
[02:14:23.320 --> 02:14:25.120]   They don't have any intrinsic value.
[02:14:25.120 --> 02:14:26.120]   Yeah.
[02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:29.640]   I'm going to hang on to them because you love them and then hopefully one day a billionaire
[02:14:29.640 --> 02:14:34.200]   says, I want to buy my childhood back and he's willing to pay you a million for it.
[02:14:34.200 --> 02:14:39.120]   Or you go up in your grandmother's attic and you find a plate from World War three that
[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:41.880]   there's only two left in the world and now it's worth something.
[02:14:41.880 --> 02:14:45.520]   I mean, why do you think people watch antique roadshow?
[02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:47.880]   Because they're, man, they figure somewhere in the attic.
[02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:48.880]   I got something.
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:50.080]   Well, that's my favorite thing.
[02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:51.080]   That's my favorite thing.
[02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:52.400]   My wife cleans everything out.
[02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:54.240]   We have nothing to value them.
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:55.240]   Oh, God.
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:57.240]   I'm mortgaging your future.
[02:14:57.240 --> 02:14:59.240]   Just take a little bit.
[02:14:59.240 --> 02:15:03.080]   Just sign a couple of those books in the back there, Jeff's the one I can come visit
[02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:04.080]   and change your life.
[02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:06.960]   I can grab a couple personally signed autograph, harvest books.
[02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:07.960]   There you go.
[02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:10.560]   I have lots of copies of my books that didn't sell.
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:12.800]   I can do as many of those as you want.
[02:15:12.800 --> 02:15:14.920]   I love you too, Jeff.
[02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:19.680]   Our show today brought to you by here's where if you're a millionaire, you should spend
[02:15:19.680 --> 02:15:20.680]   some money.
[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:23.760]   Look at Ryan Reynolds has done with Mint Mobile.
[02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:28.080]   It has become my go to mobile carrier.
[02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:32.400]   When you switch to Mint Mobile and buy any three month plan, you'll get another three
[02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:34.000]   months for free.
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:40.240]   Now I got to tell you, Mint Mobile was already the company to go to for affordable wireless
[02:15:40.240 --> 02:15:41.240]   service.
[02:15:41.240 --> 02:15:45.560]   They were the first company to sell premium wireless online only.
[02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:46.640]   You can order from home.
[02:15:46.640 --> 02:15:49.760]   You save a ton because they don't have to pay the overhead of stores.
[02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:51.960]   Then started just $15 a month.
[02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:58.960]   All plans, all plans include unlimited nationwide talk and text and high speed data delivered
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:03.120]   on the nation's largest 5G network, T-Mobile.
[02:16:03.120 --> 02:16:07.760]   And now they're best offer of the year for a limited time by any three month plan, even
[02:16:07.760 --> 02:16:11.720]   the $15 a month plan and get three more months free.
[02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:13.800]   That's incredible savings.
[02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:16.920]   And I can tell you, as a long time Mint Mobile user, they're great.
[02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:20.040]   You choose the amount of monthly data that's right for you.
[02:16:20.040 --> 02:16:22.160]   Don't pay for data you don't use.
[02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:25.880]   They do have an unlimited plan, but I would suggest you look at the site and pick a plan
[02:16:25.880 --> 02:16:26.880]   that makes sense.
[02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:29.320]   Look at your existing cell phone bill.
[02:16:29.320 --> 02:16:35.160]   And after you burst into tears when you see the bottom line, switch to Mint Mobile.
[02:16:35.160 --> 02:16:39.200]   I'm paying a third, less than a third of what I was paying for T-Mobile service.
[02:16:39.200 --> 02:16:40.880]   You could bring your own phone.
[02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:42.520]   Mint Mobile will send you a SIM for free.
[02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:43.680]   Another way they don't get you.
[02:16:43.680 --> 02:16:47.200]   Those other companies charge you just to send you a SIM.
[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:48.840]   You can keep your phone number if you want.
[02:16:48.840 --> 02:16:50.160]   Port it over to Mint Mobile.
[02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:52.640]   If you keep your phone, you know, nothing changes.
[02:16:52.640 --> 02:16:54.320]   They also sell phones.
[02:16:54.320 --> 02:16:55.640]   It's up to you.
[02:16:55.640 --> 02:16:58.320]   Mint Mobile.com/twit.
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:16:59.400]   Switch to Mint Mobile.
[02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:03.600]   Get premium wireless service starting at $15 a month.
[02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:06.400]   That's for unlimited talk and text.
[02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:11.600]   Why are you paying 80, 90, $100 a month when you get the same for 15?
[02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:12.840]   It doesn't make any sense.
[02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:14.600]   And now, three months free.
[02:17:14.600 --> 02:17:19.080]   When you buy any three month plan, mintmobile.com/twit.
[02:17:19.080 --> 02:17:20.280]   It's just a no-brainer.
[02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:22.600]   Mintmobile.com/twit.
[02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:31.440]   Cut your wireless bill to $15 a month at mintmobile.com/twit.
[02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:32.640]   I just think it's an amazing thing.
[02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:37.200]   I end up, they sent me a SIM for, I think, three months and I said, I'm buying a year.
[02:17:37.200 --> 02:17:38.720]   This is such a good deal.
[02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:44.280]   I ended up, I looked at all the, and I use a lot of data, so I got the 15 gig plan, 25
[02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:45.960]   bucks a month.
[02:17:45.960 --> 02:17:47.960]   Come on.
[02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:50.160]   For 15 gigs, you're never going to use that much.
[02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:53.880]   That's why you should go to the site and look and pick a plan that makes sense based on
[02:17:53.880 --> 02:17:55.760]   your usage because it's great.
[02:17:55.760 --> 02:17:58.000]   Mintmobile.com/twit.
[02:17:58.000 --> 02:17:59.560]   Thank you, Mint Mobile.
[02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:00.840]   We had a fun week this week.
[02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:04.800]   I know we're going into the best of starting later this week.
[02:18:04.800 --> 02:18:07.640]   Actually, that's always a lot of fun, wherever.
[02:18:07.640 --> 02:18:13.480]   Good holiday special will be a week from tonight at Sunday, the, what is that, the 26th of
[02:18:13.480 --> 02:18:14.780]   the day after Christmas?
[02:18:14.780 --> 02:18:18.800]   That's going to be our holiday special with Jason Howell and Pruitt, Michael Sargent.
[02:18:18.800 --> 02:18:23.360]   The following week will be the best of, and all week long between Christmas and New Year's
[02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:29.320]   Day, best ofs, but this week, all fresh material and what a week it was.
[02:18:29.320 --> 02:18:30.320]   Watch.
[02:18:30.320 --> 02:18:31.320]   There, you look good.
[02:18:31.320 --> 02:18:32.320]   You look scary.
[02:18:32.320 --> 02:18:35.000]   Actually, you know, you look more like an aged monk.
[02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.800]   You look like a Sith Lord.
[02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:38.800]   A Sith Lord?
[02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:42.720]   It may be somebody in the Sith Lord retirement community.
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:47.760]   Oh, ages of men.
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:51.720]   Previously on Twit, iOS today.
[02:18:51.720 --> 02:18:58.600]   Apple has released iOS 15.2 and Rosemary Orchard and I look through the new features
[02:18:58.600 --> 02:19:00.600]   you can expect.
[02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:01.600]   Floss Weekly.
[02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:07.920]   Blog 4J, which is a Java library for logging, and it's used in a whole bunch of things,
[02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:11.160]   like Minecraft is one of the big ones.
[02:19:11.160 --> 02:19:17.240]   When there's a security and flaw in something that's written in Java, it can be years before
[02:19:17.240 --> 02:19:18.240]   everybody is sort of noticed.
[02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:24.320]   Oh, actually, I do have a log4j jar file sitting around doing something.
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:27.640]   They don't get updated very automatically in a lot of cases.
[02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:28.640]   This week in Google.
[02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:29.640]   Yeah.
[02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:34.640]   Twit should make a new feature every December.
[02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:36.680]   I'm going to go in Twitter here.
[02:19:36.680 --> 02:19:37.680]   Yeah.
[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:38.680]   There you go.
[02:19:38.680 --> 02:19:40.680]   Our Twitter this year, Ant Pruitt.
[02:19:40.680 --> 02:19:45.680]   I'd like to go in with the official Twitter of the year award.
[02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:47.640]   It is a lovely.
[02:19:47.640 --> 02:19:48.640]   I don't know.
[02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:49.640]   A golden deer.
[02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:51.640]   A golden deer award.
[02:19:51.640 --> 02:19:52.640]   Twit.
[02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:57.000]   Can you have the receipt for that?
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:58.640]   He threw the deer back, by the way.
[02:19:58.640 --> 02:19:59.640]   Yeah, he didn't pick up the award.
[02:19:59.640 --> 02:20:03.240]   He didn't pick up his award, so I could give it to somebody else next year.
[02:20:03.240 --> 02:20:06.120]   It's a, I'll just say, "grave his name on the back."
[02:20:06.120 --> 02:20:07.120]   On the back.
[02:20:07.120 --> 02:20:08.120]   Do you take the price off?
[02:20:08.120 --> 02:20:09.120]   No, it's still there.
[02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:10.120]   It's 39.
[02:20:10.120 --> 02:20:11.120]   99.
[02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:16.560]   Also, a random update for the people in the world.
[02:20:16.560 --> 02:20:21.920]   Guess who, after complaining on national Twit television, that I couldn't get my Apple
[02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:22.920]   card.
[02:20:22.920 --> 02:20:23.920]   Yeah.
[02:20:23.920 --> 02:20:24.920]   Who got their Apple card?
[02:20:24.920 --> 02:20:25.920]   Did you get their Apple card?
[02:20:25.920 --> 02:20:27.920]   I may finally improve your boy.
[02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:28.920]   I hear these streets.
[02:20:28.920 --> 02:20:31.520]   I mean, it only took a 790 credit score.
[02:20:31.520 --> 02:20:33.440]   I mean, that's all it took.
[02:20:33.440 --> 02:20:34.440]   It's just bad.
[02:20:34.440 --> 02:20:35.440]   I have to push over 780.
[02:20:35.440 --> 02:20:36.440]   We actually-
[02:20:36.440 --> 02:20:37.440]   We had to get up to 790.
[02:20:37.440 --> 02:20:42.440]   You were on and applied for it and it got rejected again with a very, that's a very good
[02:20:42.440 --> 02:20:45.680]   dispedded of my credit score.
[02:20:45.680 --> 02:20:48.720]   And we never could figure out, so did they send you a letter saying we're sorry or just
[02:20:48.720 --> 02:20:49.720]   suddenly it worked out?
[02:20:49.720 --> 02:20:51.920]   No, no, I just, I've been on my random.
[02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:56.760]   I applied every couple of months because I was buying, I was buying Apple stuff randomly.
[02:20:56.760 --> 02:20:59.400]   But mind you, I bought the MacBook Pro Max 24.
[02:20:59.400 --> 02:21:00.400]   Oh.
[02:21:00.400 --> 02:21:01.400]   Guess what?
[02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:02.400]   Guess what though?
[02:21:02.400 --> 02:21:03.400]   Guess what?
[02:21:03.400 --> 02:21:04.400]   Yeah.
[02:21:04.400 --> 02:21:05.400]   It hasn't been delivered yet.
[02:21:05.400 --> 02:21:07.200]   It was supposed to be here by the 17th.
[02:21:07.200 --> 02:21:09.840]   Then it got pushed back now to January 14th.
[02:21:09.840 --> 02:21:11.640]   And now I'm like, should I cancel?
[02:21:11.640 --> 02:21:16.800]   I think that what they did was that 24 core, which I was trying to be getting my sweet spot.
[02:21:16.800 --> 02:21:20.440]   I think it's really a 32 core and they shut down cores and they're scared to send on the
[02:21:20.440 --> 02:21:23.440]   people because they think I might hack it and get the full 32 core.
[02:21:23.440 --> 02:21:27.320]   I don't know why they keep pushing this shipment back for me for this laptop.
[02:21:27.320 --> 02:21:29.680]   This is part of this supply chain.
[02:21:29.680 --> 02:21:31.360]   This is just part of the supply chain.
[02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:35.680]   Did we order, did we were one for Anthony?
[02:21:35.680 --> 02:21:37.960]   And what is the delivery date?
[02:21:37.960 --> 02:21:44.080]   So this, we ordered, I ordered one for Anthony, our head editor and graphics guy.
[02:21:44.080 --> 02:21:47.520]   The day it came out and it was going to be delivered December 17th.
[02:21:47.520 --> 02:21:51.040]   No, no, it was going to be delivered back in November.
[02:21:51.040 --> 02:21:52.040]   It was like November 5th.
[02:21:52.040 --> 02:21:55.480]   In fact, I got to notice saying FedEx can't find you.
[02:21:55.480 --> 02:21:57.560]   So we're sending it back on November 5th.
[02:21:57.560 --> 02:21:58.560]   What?
[02:21:58.560 --> 02:21:59.560]   I told you, I called Apple.
[02:21:59.560 --> 02:22:00.560]   I said, what do you mean?
[02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:02.560]   We get FedEx deliveries every day at this address.
[02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:04.360]   Of course, FedEx can find us.
[02:22:04.360 --> 02:22:05.360]   Apple sits too late.
[02:22:05.360 --> 02:22:06.360]   They return it.
[02:22:06.360 --> 02:22:07.560]   We're crediting a refund.
[02:22:07.560 --> 02:22:09.200]   So I didn't get the money back.
[02:22:09.200 --> 02:22:12.880]   But then we turned around and we ordered it and it was going to be like Christmas.
[02:22:12.880 --> 02:22:13.880]   When is it now?
[02:22:13.880 --> 02:22:14.880]   Do you know, John?
[02:22:14.880 --> 02:22:18.520]   When we ordered it in mid November, it was six to eight weeks and now it says January
[02:22:18.520 --> 02:22:19.520]   18th is assumed.
[02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:20.520]   Yeah.
[02:22:20.520 --> 02:22:21.520]   So this is-
[02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:22.720]   Yeah, welcome to the club.
[02:22:22.720 --> 02:22:24.840]   This is just what it is.
[02:22:24.840 --> 02:22:28.160]   If you order one now, it'll say it says Valentine's Day.
[02:22:28.160 --> 02:22:29.160]   Yeah.
[02:22:29.160 --> 02:22:31.960]   And my mind puts back now to the end of January.
[02:22:31.960 --> 02:22:36.160]   But at this point, I'm like, I might as well hold on and wait and buy a Mac Pro desktop
[02:22:36.160 --> 02:22:37.160]   or whatever comes out.
[02:22:37.160 --> 02:22:39.160]   By the time I get it, they're going to be announcing new stuff.
[02:22:39.160 --> 02:22:40.160]   You know what?
[02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:41.160]   That will be.
[02:22:41.160 --> 02:22:42.160]   I bet you will.
[02:22:42.160 --> 02:22:44.160]   That will be that they'll have a Mac Pro or an iMac Pro.
[02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:45.160]   Yeah.
[02:22:45.160 --> 02:22:46.160]   At least they'll announce it.
[02:22:46.160 --> 02:22:47.160]   So, but yeah, I got to prove.
[02:22:47.160 --> 02:22:51.200]   I had to do was come on to it and complain and then somebody saw it.
[02:22:51.200 --> 02:22:52.200]   They saw you by all the stuff.
[02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:53.200]   Give them his car.
[02:22:53.200 --> 02:22:54.520]   We should give this guy is three percent.
[02:22:54.520 --> 02:22:55.520]   That's what it is.
[02:22:55.520 --> 02:22:56.520]   And I don't spend a lot of money.
[02:22:56.520 --> 02:22:59.120]   They don't say you should have been gave me that thing.
[02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:00.120]   So weird.
[02:23:00.120 --> 02:23:01.120]   This is weird.
[02:23:01.120 --> 02:23:02.120]   Yeah.
[02:23:02.120 --> 02:23:03.120]   Super weird.
[02:23:03.120 --> 02:23:04.120]   Yeah.
[02:23:04.120 --> 02:23:06.560]   And even stranger that it turned around because you didn't do anything differently.
[02:23:06.560 --> 02:23:08.320]   You should have been accepted previous.
[02:23:08.320 --> 02:23:11.760]   I mean, my score went up like a little bit, but I mean, like, again, like once you're
[02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:12.760]   over 700, I'm like-
[02:23:12.760 --> 02:23:13.760]   It's not just score.
[02:23:13.760 --> 02:23:14.760]   I think it's usage.
[02:23:14.760 --> 02:23:15.760]   It's a lot of the factors.
[02:23:15.760 --> 02:23:16.960]   It's Goldman Sachs, by the way, that does this.
[02:23:16.960 --> 02:23:17.960]   Yeah.
[02:23:17.960 --> 02:23:18.960]   Yeah.
[02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:20.760]   Well, I'm sorry that I'm glad to hear you got it.
[02:23:20.760 --> 02:23:21.760]   Yeah.
[02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:22.760]   I'm in the community.
[02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:23.760]   I got my Apple car NFT.
[02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:24.760]   Yeah.
[02:23:24.760 --> 02:23:25.760]   I mean, I got in the club, baby.
[02:23:25.760 --> 02:23:26.760]   I got my Apple NFT.
[02:23:26.760 --> 02:23:27.760]   Yeah.
[02:23:27.760 --> 02:23:28.760]   I'm sorry.
[02:23:28.760 --> 02:23:30.760]   Again, three percent royalties on everything I bought.
[02:23:30.760 --> 02:23:31.760]   I don't believe in NFTs.
[02:23:31.760 --> 02:23:32.760]   You don't understand.
[02:23:32.760 --> 02:23:33.760]   You don't get it.
[02:23:33.760 --> 02:23:34.760]   I'm not.
[02:23:34.760 --> 02:23:38.760]   My plan to get rich is to use the Homeland Security Bug Bounty.
[02:23:38.760 --> 02:23:40.800]   Actually, I'm being sarcastic.
[02:23:40.800 --> 02:23:42.200]   Department of Homeland Security.
[02:23:42.200 --> 02:23:45.880]   Remember, Bug Bounties are a very good way for companies to make sure that if somebody
[02:23:45.880 --> 02:23:52.560]   finds a security flaw, they tell you instead of telling the NSO group and selling it to
[02:23:52.560 --> 02:24:02.400]   some nation state to attack people's devices, DHS wants to get people hackers to submit
[02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:05.320]   a flaws directly to DHS so they can fix them.
[02:24:05.320 --> 02:24:06.960]   So they've got a Bug Bounty program.
[02:24:06.960 --> 02:24:11.320]   But guys, it's called Hack DHS.
[02:24:11.320 --> 02:24:12.320]   And the Bug Bounty.
[02:24:12.320 --> 02:24:16.080]   Now, remember, companies like the NSO group are paying millions.
[02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:19.120]   Apple's paying 50,000, 60,000, 100,000.
[02:24:19.120 --> 02:24:28.240]   The DHS is going to give you $500 to $5,000 for each flaw depending on the gravity of
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:30.680]   the vulnerability.
[02:24:30.680 --> 02:24:33.240]   I made more money than that, Snitch, to IRS.
[02:24:33.240 --> 02:24:38.560]   It seems like they maybe could increase the amount of that.
[02:24:38.560 --> 02:24:39.560]   I don't know.
[02:24:39.560 --> 02:24:42.560]   I said that they're doing something.
[02:24:42.560 --> 02:24:43.560]   There was a hack, the Pentagon event.
[02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:48.280]   I think it was under our friend Matt Cutz's e-gis at the United States Digital Service.
[02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:57.320]   They found 140 unidentified vulnerabilities, 140 on the department's websites, Pentagon
[02:24:57.320 --> 02:25:02.720]   success prompted congressional lawmakers to do the same at other federal agencies, including
[02:25:02.720 --> 02:25:05.840]   the State Department.
[02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:07.040]   But I don't know.
[02:25:07.040 --> 02:25:08.040]   Maybe that's plenty.
[02:25:08.040 --> 02:25:11.560]   I mean, just the bad guys I know, 500 bucks.
[02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:15.160]   I think the IRS pays you like $1,000 to start when you snitch on people.
[02:25:15.160 --> 02:25:16.160]   I think it's like $1,500.
[02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:17.160]   It seems kind of low.
[02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:19.160]   I mean, this seems low.
[02:25:19.160 --> 02:25:22.280]   I don't know if you don't know about that.
[02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:23.360]   You're not going to come to my house.
[02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:24.360]   I don't trust you.
[02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:25.360]   I'm worried.
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:26.360]   I'm not doing it.
[02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:29.360]   I'm just saying there's people out there that flash money and then other people report
[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:30.360]   those people.
[02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:32.880]   And then the IRS shows them and say, "How do you get all this money on YouTube?"
[02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:33.880]   I'm just saying.
[02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:34.880]   Mr. Beast, watch out.
[02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:35.880]   That's all I'm saying.
[02:25:35.880 --> 02:25:36.880]   Somebody out there.
[02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:38.840]   They're performing this more than 500 bucks.
[02:25:38.840 --> 02:25:40.200]   So that's why they doing it.
[02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:44.800]   Actually, the president did sign an executive order or will sign an executive order to move
[02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:53.280]   17 agencies, 17 government services online, including this is a big change, allowing you
[02:25:53.280 --> 02:25:55.880]   to apply for a passport online.
[02:25:55.880 --> 02:25:57.680]   Whoa, at last.
[02:25:57.680 --> 02:25:58.680]   Finally.
[02:25:58.680 --> 02:25:59.680]   That's great.
[02:25:59.680 --> 02:26:00.680]   Yeah.
[02:26:00.680 --> 02:26:04.720]   Filing taxes, applying for social security benefits, waiting in TSA lines.
[02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:05.720]   Wait a minute.
[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:09.360]   I can't do that online.
[02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:11.160]   My avatar is going to wait for me.
[02:26:11.160 --> 02:26:14.160]   Thank you very much.
[02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:19.040]   30 specific updates they need to make according to this executive order, including allowing
[02:26:19.040 --> 02:26:22.440]   Americans to renew passports or renew passwords online.
[02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:25.080]   Yeah, it would be a little weird to actually get your first passport.
[02:26:25.080 --> 02:26:26.080]   I guess so.
[02:26:26.080 --> 02:26:27.080]   Look at you and say, yes, that's the one.
[02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:28.440]   Yeah, you go to the post office to do it, right?
[02:26:28.440 --> 02:26:29.600]   And they look at you and you're done.
[02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:33.320]   Which is really new, actually, because you used to have to go to the state department.
[02:26:33.320 --> 02:26:34.320]   Yeah.
[02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:35.640]   So you can renew online though.
[02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:36.640]   That's good.
[02:26:36.640 --> 02:26:41.640]   Disaster victims will be able to submit photos of damage via their mobile phones.
[02:26:41.640 --> 02:26:42.640]   That's good.
[02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:44.640]   Smart, good.
[02:26:44.640 --> 02:26:49.440]   All of these actions are near-term in nature according to the deputy director of management
[02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:53.800]   at the OMB and they will generally be completed in the months, the coming months within one
[02:26:53.800 --> 02:26:55.800]   year.
[02:26:55.800 --> 02:27:00.120]   USDS at the forefront of this.
[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:02.520]   That cuts, our friend Matt cuts is no longer administrator there.
[02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:07.040]   He retired, but the United States Digital Digital Service, which was created to get Silicon
[02:27:07.040 --> 02:27:12.120]   Valley to come help with the Obamacare site, the ACA site.
[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:14.040]   Now is doing stuff for all.
[02:27:14.040 --> 02:27:15.880]   The Veterans Administration and stuff.
[02:27:15.880 --> 02:27:19.000]   There's also a tech team inside the White House.
[02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:22.680]   Oh, that is the tech team.
[02:27:22.680 --> 02:27:27.920]   The US Digital Service, they're inside the Pentagon, I think, but that's all right.
[02:27:27.920 --> 02:27:31.320]   Protocol says the White House.
[02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:32.320]   The modern.
[02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:35.600]   I said that's one thing that COVID did for us.
[02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:41.040]   The fact that the DMV, before you had to go in and do the whole process to get an ID,
[02:27:41.040 --> 02:27:44.400]   now you just go online, they mail to you.
[02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:48.240]   I got my new ID and within a week I lost my wallet.
[02:27:48.240 --> 02:27:51.320]   And all I was thinking to myself was, I got to go all the way to DMV.
[02:27:51.320 --> 02:27:52.640]   My friend's like, didn't you do it online?
[02:27:52.640 --> 02:27:54.560]   I was like, he's like, go online.
[02:27:54.560 --> 02:27:55.560]   I paid $5.
[02:27:55.560 --> 02:27:57.840]   I had a new driver's license in three days.
[02:27:57.840 --> 02:27:59.840]   I'm like, wow, wow.
[02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:00.840]   This is a junior.
[02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:02.760]   The special one, unless you fly.
[02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:04.400]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:28:04.400 --> 02:28:07.760]   They have a driver's license that lets you fly.
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:08.760]   It's real ID.
[02:28:08.760 --> 02:28:10.240]   You got to have the real ID.
[02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:11.760]   Oh, you mean let's get on an airplane.
[02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:13.240]   The airplane's going to fly.
[02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:14.240]   No, no, no.
[02:28:14.240 --> 02:28:18.760]   Once you get it, they've got a chip in your brain, Eli made it, and I can now fly across
[02:28:18.760 --> 02:28:20.000]   the front of these guys.
[02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.240]   Don't worry about a Neural Lake 2022 coming up.
[02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:25.120]   Isn't that horrible that it's 2022?
[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:26.720]   It's actually going to be 2020.
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:28.720]   So it was 2020.
[02:28:28.720 --> 02:28:29.720]   It's not allowed.
[02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:30.720]   Oh, wow.
[02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:33.480]   That's in 2021 WON.
[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:34.480]   And now it's 2022.
[02:28:34.480 --> 02:28:40.160]   It's going to be the Twickening or something.
[02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:42.080]   I don't know.
[02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:43.080]   I need a foil hat.
[02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:44.920]   It's saying I had something's going on.
[02:28:44.920 --> 02:28:45.920]   I just sold myself.
[02:28:45.920 --> 02:28:47.560]   By the way, I just oversized myself.
[02:28:47.560 --> 02:28:51.000]   Matt was replaced by an engineer who worked on the healthcare.gov rollout.
[02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:56.520]   Mina Shang is the new administrator at the United States Digital Services.
[02:28:56.520 --> 02:29:00.840]   And they have a big new job, which is to get things like the passport renewals online.
[02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:01.840]   Yay.
[02:29:01.840 --> 02:29:02.840]   Yay.
[02:29:02.840 --> 02:29:08.080]   Finally, a little word of warning.
[02:29:08.080 --> 02:29:13.360]   In the UK, apparently, they're very worried about the health threat posed by 5G.
[02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:16.800]   Again.
[02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:23.480]   And there's been a brisk business in the Netherlands for these necklaces.
[02:29:23.480 --> 02:29:32.560]   The quantum pendant, which protects you against 5G, except these 5G necklaces are radioactive
[02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:40.160]   at the touch authority for nuclear safety and radiation protection has issued a warning
[02:29:40.160 --> 02:29:44.920]   about the 10 products have found gave off harmful ionizing radiation.
[02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:47.160]   By the way, we're moral panic gets you.
[02:29:47.160 --> 02:29:48.160]   Right?
[02:29:48.160 --> 02:29:52.120]   People constantly saying your cell phone is going to kill you.
[02:29:52.120 --> 02:29:58.240]   I always say, no, no, it's non ionizing radiation, which means as far as we know, it's harmless
[02:29:58.240 --> 02:29:59.880]   to human cells.
[02:29:59.880 --> 02:30:04.960]   So what do you buy a necklace with ionizing radiation to protect you from non-ionizing?
[02:30:04.960 --> 02:30:06.720]   By the way, does it do anything with the 5G?
[02:30:06.720 --> 02:30:07.720]   No, of course not.
[02:30:07.720 --> 02:30:09.880]   Actually, do what I didn't know.
[02:30:09.880 --> 02:30:10.880]   It just kills you.
[02:30:10.880 --> 02:30:17.240]   The necklace, the products identified included an energy armor sleeping mask, bracelet and
[02:30:17.240 --> 02:30:20.600]   necklace, a bracelet for children.
[02:30:20.600 --> 02:30:22.000]   Oh, no.
[02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:26.200]   But magnetic's wellness also emitting ionizing radiation.
[02:30:26.200 --> 02:30:27.200]   It's radioactive.
[02:30:27.200 --> 02:30:30.480]   Is this on my pillow site too?
[02:30:30.480 --> 02:30:31.480]   Probably.
[02:30:31.480 --> 02:30:34.760]   The Dutch agency said, don't wear it anymore.
[02:30:34.760 --> 02:30:37.760]   Put it away safely and wait for the return instructions.
[02:30:37.760 --> 02:30:45.120]   That's the worst Dutch accent I have ever, ever heard.
[02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:49.000]   Excuse me.
[02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:58.400]   In the UK in May of last year, the UK's trading standards sought to halt sales of a 339 pound.
[02:30:58.400 --> 02:31:02.520]   I mean British pounds not wait.
[02:31:02.520 --> 02:31:05.640]   USB stick.
[02:31:05.640 --> 02:31:06.640]   So it's about $500.
[02:31:06.640 --> 02:31:11.640]   A $500 USB stick that claimed to offer protection from 5G.
[02:31:11.640 --> 02:31:17.080]   And you can also right now go on Amazon and buy anti-radiation stickers.
[02:31:17.080 --> 02:31:19.960]   There's one born every minute.
[02:31:19.960 --> 02:31:21.920]   There's a sucker born every minute.
[02:31:21.920 --> 02:31:29.600]   The stickers protect you against electromagnetic fields from phones.
[02:31:29.600 --> 02:31:34.080]   Scientists say the stickers have no effect.
[02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:35.080]   No effect at all.
[02:31:35.080 --> 02:31:36.880]   Except identifying you as a schmuck.
[02:31:36.880 --> 02:31:38.640]   It's the sucker hat that I was talking about.
[02:31:38.640 --> 02:31:41.720]   When they see that sticker, they see you coming.
[02:31:41.720 --> 02:31:46.920]   Actually, you think it's bad, but I just minted a million NFTI and I's tokens.
[02:31:46.920 --> 02:31:47.920]   That will protect you.
[02:31:47.920 --> 02:31:53.720]   That's not the only 1099 if you'd like to purchase one today on my Suck Owens Pillow.com.
[02:31:53.720 --> 02:31:54.720]   I agree.
[02:31:54.720 --> 02:31:55.720]   I admit it.
[02:31:55.720 --> 02:31:58.720]   Do you guys know what Tarda grades are?
[02:31:58.720 --> 02:31:59.720]   Well, they're so good.
[02:31:59.720 --> 02:32:01.720]   How are the star ship discoveries?
[02:32:01.720 --> 02:32:02.720]   Excuse me.
[02:32:02.720 --> 02:32:03.720]   Do they really?
[02:32:03.720 --> 02:32:04.720]   Do what's right?
[02:32:04.720 --> 02:32:05.720]   Yeah.
[02:32:05.720 --> 02:32:10.640]   So these are little microscopic multicellular organisms.
[02:32:10.640 --> 02:32:11.640]   They are cute.
[02:32:11.640 --> 02:32:12.640]   Look how cute they are.
[02:32:12.640 --> 02:32:14.800]   They look like little, I don't know, pigs.
[02:32:14.800 --> 02:32:16.320]   They got little claws in their feet.
[02:32:16.320 --> 02:32:18.480]   But they're also virtually indestructible.
[02:32:18.480 --> 02:32:23.640]   They have been sent into the vacuum of space for more than a week, survived.
[02:32:23.640 --> 02:32:30.080]   They've been shot from guns, survived in most cases, a few gave up.
[02:32:30.080 --> 02:32:36.360]   Well, lately we've found a new way to torture Tarda grades.
[02:32:36.360 --> 02:32:37.360]   This is nuts.
[02:32:37.360 --> 02:32:39.720]   I don't even know what this means.
[02:32:39.720 --> 02:32:46.840]   But Rainier, Dumke, and his colleagues at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore
[02:32:46.840 --> 02:32:54.520]   have taken a hibernating target, the Tarda grade, placed it on a superconducting qubit.
[02:32:54.520 --> 02:32:59.680]   And it is now the first multicellular organism to be quantum entangled.
[02:32:59.680 --> 02:33:03.880]   So go to full screen real quick, auto panelists.
[02:33:03.880 --> 02:33:04.880]   Okay.
[02:33:04.880 --> 02:33:05.880]   Everybody.
[02:33:05.880 --> 02:33:06.880]   Yeah.
[02:33:06.880 --> 02:33:08.440]   Tim, I don't know you, but I love you.
[02:33:08.440 --> 02:33:09.440]   We are now friends.
[02:33:09.440 --> 02:33:13.480]   First of all, you answered that question very quickly and precisely.
[02:33:13.480 --> 02:33:16.640]   And I was scared to say it because I thought I was going to sound like an idiot, but you
[02:33:16.640 --> 02:33:20.240]   knew exactly what it was because we were, we were thrown in.
[02:33:20.240 --> 02:33:24.560]   Now secondly, the fact that that's a real thing and that we're trying to do things to
[02:33:24.560 --> 02:33:28.480]   that thing makes me upset because sometimes I watch TV shows and I don't Google stuff.
[02:33:28.480 --> 02:33:29.480]   Sometimes I just enjoy the show.
[02:33:29.480 --> 02:33:33.720]   But the fact that that thing is real and is like impervious to everything is crazy.
[02:33:33.720 --> 02:33:34.960]   And Tim knows what I'm talking to.
[02:33:34.960 --> 02:33:35.960]   Tim watches.
[02:33:35.960 --> 02:33:36.960]   So it's my star track.
[02:33:36.960 --> 02:33:41.960]   I'm a great reboot star track.
[02:33:41.960 --> 02:33:44.720]   And we lose everything.
[02:33:44.720 --> 02:33:45.720]   Stop it right now.
[02:33:45.720 --> 02:33:50.840]   All the research that I'm a Peter, get on it, Peter, Peter, protect the TARDIS.
[02:33:50.840 --> 02:33:51.840]   Yes.
[02:33:51.840 --> 02:33:52.840]   Yes.
[02:33:52.840 --> 02:33:53.840]   Yes.
[02:33:53.840 --> 02:33:59.320]   Tarda grades are microscopic eight legged animals, sometimes referred to as water bears.
[02:33:59.320 --> 02:34:00.840]   Oh, they live in you.
[02:34:00.840 --> 02:34:02.480]   You want to water bear.
[02:34:02.480 --> 02:34:03.480]   Yeah.
[02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:08.120]   And just start a new hashtag and a new campaign, protect the Tarda grades.
[02:34:08.120 --> 02:34:10.000]   Sometimes they're our campaign.
[02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:15.320]   Sometimes they're known as moss piglets.
[02:34:15.320 --> 02:34:20.160]   And we have listened to what we've done when they're when they're in extremes, they shrink
[02:34:20.160 --> 02:34:23.280]   into something called a ton to UN state.
[02:34:23.280 --> 02:34:25.600]   Their metabolism practically zero.
[02:34:25.600 --> 02:34:28.120]   They're still alive and they can survive.
[02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:30.760]   They can survive without water for decades.
[02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:34.360]   They can tolerate high doses of gamma and x-ray radiation.
[02:34:34.360 --> 02:34:41.400]   They have been shown to survive temperatures as low as 270 degrees below zero Celsius
[02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:45.360]   and 150 degrees Celsius above.
[02:34:45.360 --> 02:34:51.880]   They've also breezed through 10 days in the vacuum of space on anything else.
[02:34:51.880 --> 02:34:53.960]   It would destroy your DNA.
[02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:58.960]   Terrible, but they have some weird damage suppressor protein that some of our patients
[02:34:58.960 --> 02:34:59.960]   talk roaches.
[02:34:59.960 --> 02:35:01.320]   That's all it's going to be left.
[02:35:01.320 --> 02:35:04.320]   Their DNA.
[02:35:04.320 --> 02:35:05.760]   It's a fascinating animal.
[02:35:05.760 --> 02:35:09.360]   I don't know though, to be frank.
[02:35:09.360 --> 02:35:12.880]   I mean, I've heard the phrase quantum entanglement.
[02:35:12.880 --> 02:35:17.960]   I study, you know, when I studied physics in high school and read about it, I read about
[02:35:17.960 --> 02:35:23.640]   quantum mechanics, but I don't really understand what it would be to be in a quantum entanglement.
[02:35:23.640 --> 02:35:25.440]   John, do you?
[02:35:25.440 --> 02:35:26.840]   Does it make any sense to you?
[02:35:26.840 --> 02:35:27.840]   I know you like science.
[02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:30.440]   You want to know what it is to put a tardigrade on a qubit?
[02:35:30.440 --> 02:35:31.440]   What does that mean?
[02:35:31.440 --> 02:35:32.440]   I don't either.
[02:35:32.440 --> 02:35:34.560]   None of this makes sense.
[02:35:34.560 --> 02:35:39.800]   I think we're going to have to get Rainier-Dumkey and his colleagues at Nan Yang Technological
[02:35:39.800 --> 02:35:46.640]   University in Singapore on the show and explain.
[02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:48.800]   But tardigrades are fascinating.
[02:35:48.800 --> 02:35:55.200]   However, the first multicellular organism to survive a quantum entanglement, just one
[02:35:55.200 --> 02:36:00.320]   more notch in the tardigrade in the moss piglet belt, if you will.
[02:36:00.320 --> 02:36:04.800]   Get on it, Jason.
[02:36:04.800 --> 02:36:11.640]   Superconducting qubit, which is part of a quantum computing device, I think.
[02:36:11.640 --> 02:36:13.160]   I know.
[02:36:13.160 --> 02:36:15.760]   This is sci-fi as far as I can tell.
[02:36:15.760 --> 02:36:16.760]   Super sci-fi.
[02:36:16.760 --> 02:36:17.760]   Super sci-fi.
[02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:19.560]   Super fly sci-fi.
[02:36:19.560 --> 02:36:23.160]   Ladies and gentlemen, we are at the conclusion of this episode.
[02:36:23.160 --> 02:36:29.080]   I'm Steve as I want to thank you so much for coming out of the cold and joining us.
[02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:34.280]   I hope you get some snow and ice so you can race on that lake of yours.
[02:36:34.280 --> 02:36:35.280]   Thanks.
[02:36:35.280 --> 02:36:36.280]   Still open for a white Christmas.
[02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:37.280]   We'll see fingers crossed.
[02:36:37.280 --> 02:36:39.440]   Crossing your fingers up there and way up and up.
[02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:42.160]   If anybody has a chance, you do up there.
[02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:43.160]   Yeah.
[02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:44.160]   Thanks very much.
[02:36:44.160 --> 02:36:45.160]   Great to see you, Leo, as always.
[02:36:45.160 --> 02:36:46.160]   Great to see you.
[02:36:46.160 --> 02:36:48.520]   Follow his exploits at Roadshow at the Roadshow.
[02:36:48.520 --> 02:36:49.960]   That's CNET's Roadshow.
[02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:50.960]   Is it roadshow.cNET.com?
[02:36:50.960 --> 02:36:54.960]   CNET.com/roadshow or theroadshow.com.
[02:36:54.960 --> 02:36:58.600]   Oh, just go to roadshow.com.
[02:36:58.600 --> 02:37:01.360]   And of course, he's on the Twitters.
[02:37:01.360 --> 02:37:03.440]   What are you laughing at now?
[02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:04.440]   Oh, wait a minute.
[02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:05.440]   Wait a minute.
[02:37:05.440 --> 02:37:06.680]   Leah is joining us.
[02:37:06.680 --> 02:37:07.680]   Hello, Leah.
[02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:08.680]   Yay.
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:14.520]   She's got the week off after the TikTok bombing, I guess.
[02:37:14.520 --> 02:37:15.520]   Yeah.
[02:37:15.520 --> 02:37:16.520]   After the what?
[02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:17.520]   No, never mind.
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:18.520]   Forget it.
[02:37:18.520 --> 02:37:19.520]   I don't want to.
[02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:20.520]   Never nightmares.
[02:37:20.520 --> 02:37:22.400]   She doesn't even claim it as a TikTok.
[02:37:22.400 --> 02:37:23.560]   She just claims this.
[02:37:23.560 --> 02:37:25.760]   I got five tests on Monday now.
[02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:26.760]   Oh, no.
[02:37:26.760 --> 02:37:27.760]   Oh, no.
[02:37:27.760 --> 02:37:29.600]   There should be a wall.
[02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:30.600]   Oh, no.
[02:37:30.600 --> 02:37:33.800]   L.A. are you wearing that necklace?
[02:37:33.800 --> 02:37:34.800]   Oh.
[02:37:34.800 --> 02:37:37.400]   I literally was just wearing it.
[02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:39.400]   She was wearing it too.
[02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:40.400]   Okay.
[02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:41.400]   So go ahead and tell them.
[02:37:41.400 --> 02:37:44.560]   Oh, every Christmas and it was really nice meeting even later.
[02:37:44.560 --> 02:37:46.440]   Yeah, we had a wonderful dinner.
[02:37:46.440 --> 02:37:48.480]   Thank you all for the soap.
[02:37:48.480 --> 02:37:49.480]   Bye.
[02:37:49.480 --> 02:37:50.480]   Oh, we love your soap.
[02:37:50.480 --> 02:37:52.800]   Thank you for the salt buying.
[02:37:52.800 --> 02:37:54.080]   You know, my son's in salt.
[02:37:54.080 --> 02:37:55.080]   You're in soap.
[02:37:55.080 --> 02:37:56.080]   It's great.
[02:37:56.080 --> 02:37:57.080]   You could use to, well, he's the world.
[02:37:57.080 --> 02:37:58.080]   Yeah.
[02:37:58.080 --> 02:37:59.080]   Yeah, that's that's my son.
[02:37:59.080 --> 02:38:00.560]   Lee is very excited about the salty.
[02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:01.560]   Yeah.
[02:38:01.560 --> 02:38:02.560]   Yeah, she's a queen of merchandising.
[02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:03.560]   Yeah.
[02:38:03.560 --> 02:38:08.240]   We had a wonderful dinner with Owen and Leah in Petaluma and then Lisa apparently had taken
[02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:09.240]   Leah's shopping.
[02:38:09.240 --> 02:38:10.240]   Yeah.
[02:38:10.240 --> 02:38:13.600]   And always are always a risky thing.
[02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:15.600]   Merry Christmas, Leah.
[02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:16.600]   Merry Christmas.
[02:38:16.600 --> 02:38:17.600]   Merry Christmas.
[02:38:17.600 --> 02:38:18.600]   Merry Christmas.
[02:38:18.600 --> 02:38:21.400]   Jeff Jarvis, thank you so much, Professor.
[02:38:21.400 --> 02:38:22.400]   Jeff Jarvis, wait a minute.
[02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:25.280]   Let me get the thing because we got the music and all that.
[02:38:25.280 --> 02:38:30.040]   He is the Leonard Taill Professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig.
[02:38:30.040 --> 02:38:37.080]   Craig, Craig, you're my graduate school of journalism at the City University of.
[02:38:37.080 --> 02:38:38.640]   Did you buy that one?
[02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:41.120]   I don't know where we get where that come from, John.
[02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:42.120]   That's good.
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:43.320]   Do we do that or do we buy it?
[02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:44.320]   I came in the mail.
[02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:45.320]   Came in the mail.
[02:38:45.320 --> 02:38:46.320]   Hang on.
[02:38:46.320 --> 02:38:47.320]   That's to say.
[02:38:47.320 --> 02:38:49.560]   I'd be bringing more of those.
[02:38:49.560 --> 02:38:50.560]   That's great.
[02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:51.560]   Yes, we do.
[02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:52.560]   Yes.
[02:38:52.560 --> 02:38:54.760]   Craig will be alerted.
[02:38:54.760 --> 02:38:57.560]   We can summon Craig from the other world again.
[02:38:57.560 --> 02:38:59.320]   Oh, yeah, that might be fun.
[02:38:59.320 --> 02:39:00.320]   That might be fun.
[02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:02.360]   It came from Eric Jones, who--
[02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:03.360]   Thank you, Eric.
[02:39:03.360 --> 02:39:07.400]   Artistic director of the Master Singers of Virginia.
[02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:08.400]   Oh, wow.
[02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:09.400]   So that's why--
[02:39:09.400 --> 02:39:10.400]   Thank you, Eric.
[02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:11.400]   And thank you, Eric.
[02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:15.800]   And Master Singers of Virginia, thank you for your kind gift.
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:17.240]   We also do this show.
[02:39:17.240 --> 02:39:18.880]   I'm going to let Owen close it out.
[02:39:18.880 --> 02:39:23.080]   So as we traditionally do, I want to thank everybody for joining us.
[02:39:23.080 --> 02:39:26.280]   I remind you next week, it's the holiday special.
[02:39:26.280 --> 02:39:27.280]   We are recording early.
[02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:32.160]   We're recording it on Monday, so you can also watch us do that live Monday, the 20th,
[02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:35.880]   tomorrow, 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern, 2200 UTC.
[02:39:35.880 --> 02:39:38.360]   Same time, new day.
[02:39:38.360 --> 02:39:46.960]   We always do Twitter, actually 2 30 p.m. Pacific, 5 30 Eastern on a Sunday, 2 230 UTC.
[02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:52.320]   As always, you can watch us record the holiday special tomorrow or any Twitch show by going
[02:39:52.320 --> 02:39:53.320]   to live.tuit.tv.
[02:39:53.320 --> 02:39:55.280]   You can chat with us at IRC.tuit.tv.
[02:39:55.280 --> 02:39:59.640]   So I encourage you to do that.
[02:39:59.640 --> 02:40:02.160]   The following week will be our best episode.
[02:40:02.160 --> 02:40:06.600]   That's January 2nd and January 9th will come back live with a live Twitch.
[02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:09.040]   And that one is going to be very interesting.
[02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:15.800]   Our futurist panel, including Daniel Suarez, sci-fi author with Amy Webb and futurist.
[02:40:15.800 --> 02:40:19.120]   We're working on a scientist to get somebody in there.
[02:40:19.120 --> 02:40:21.280]   So that way we'll kind of cover it all.
[02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:23.440]   That should be a lot of fun on January 9th.
[02:40:23.440 --> 02:40:27.400]   If you're a member of club Twitch, you can also chat with us all the time at any time
[02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:29.120]   in our Discord server.
[02:40:29.120 --> 02:40:34.040]   You also get ad-free versions of all of our shows and the Twitch+ feed, which has things
[02:40:34.040 --> 02:40:37.600]   that we don't put out on the regular podcast feed like our untitled Linux show.
[02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:41.640]   The Giz Fizz Stacey Higginbotham's book club.
[02:40:41.640 --> 02:40:43.040]   We have asked, you're coming up on us?
[02:40:43.040 --> 02:40:44.520]   Ask me anything, aren't you, Jeff, pretty soon?
[02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:45.520]   You're going to be on...
[02:40:45.520 --> 02:40:46.520]   Yep, pretty soon.
[02:40:46.520 --> 02:40:47.520]   Yeah, pretty soon.
[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:48.520]   In January.
[02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:49.520]   March.
[02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:50.520]   Or March.
[02:40:50.520 --> 02:40:51.520]   March.
[02:40:51.520 --> 02:40:52.520]   We're booked at some March.
[02:40:52.520 --> 02:40:53.520]   He's organized.
[02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:54.520]   He has booked...
[02:40:54.520 --> 02:40:55.520]   Holy...
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:40:58.840]   He booked me three years ago and he keeps bothering me about it.
[02:40:58.840 --> 02:41:00.520]   I'm like, "Bro, I don't need the answer.
[02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:01.520]   Yes, yet, okay?"
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:03.520]   He booked me 17 years ago.
[02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:04.520]   Don't put it off.
[02:41:04.520 --> 02:41:05.520]   Don't put it off.
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:08.960]   But if you want to access all that great content, just join club Twitch.
[02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:10.520]   Seven dollars a month, it supports us.
[02:41:10.520 --> 02:41:11.520]   And everything we're doing.
[02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:12.520]   Please do it.
[02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:13.520]   It's fun people.
[02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:14.520]   It's really great.
[02:41:14.520 --> 02:41:15.920]   It's turned out to be really, really great.
[02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:19.520]   We thank all of the thousands of people who are members now.
[02:41:19.520 --> 02:41:24.160]   You have a nice welcoming meme up on there right now, if you can do the video.
[02:41:24.160 --> 02:41:26.760]   Oh, I go to our Discord.
[02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:27.760]   You mean that...
[02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:28.760]   Join us.
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:29.760]   Join us.
[02:41:29.760 --> 02:41:30.760]   Join us.
[02:41:30.760 --> 02:41:31.760]   Join us.
[02:41:31.760 --> 02:41:37.320]   And also, there have been a number of Tarda-grade things.
[02:41:37.320 --> 02:41:44.320]   Here's a video of Tim trying to get his truck across the lake.
[02:41:44.320 --> 02:41:45.320]   I don't know.
[02:41:45.320 --> 02:41:47.320]   I don't know what it is.
[02:41:47.320 --> 02:41:52.880]   Definitely not you.
[02:41:52.880 --> 02:41:53.880]   I'm sorry.
[02:41:53.880 --> 02:41:58.480]   I've now gone down the rabbit hole of animated GIFs on the Discord.
[02:41:58.480 --> 02:42:01.400]   Club Twitch is available at twitch.tv/clubtwit.
[02:42:01.400 --> 02:42:03.880]   And we do have, by the way, corporate memberships.
[02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:06.600]   We've now got two companies with corporate memberships.
[02:42:06.600 --> 02:42:08.120]   So that's really great.
[02:42:08.120 --> 02:42:11.240]   It's a good way to kind of spiff your employees.
[02:42:11.240 --> 02:42:13.360]   Tends to be off in the IT department, people like that.
[02:42:13.360 --> 02:42:14.360]   They really appreciate it.
[02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:17.640]   So, twitch.tv/clubtwit.
[02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:25.680]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, to close out our last episode of 2021, I give you the right
[02:42:25.680 --> 02:42:29.880]   Reverend Owen J.J. Stone.
[02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:33.840]   First of all, if you're in the Discord, you are the backbone of this show.
[02:42:33.840 --> 02:42:35.800]   You guys are smart and creative.
[02:42:35.800 --> 02:42:41.960]   I'd also suggest that you say the name of this show should be fake filtration, imaginary
[02:42:41.960 --> 02:42:44.600]   filtration, something with filtration.
[02:42:44.600 --> 02:42:46.120]   Think of one yourselves, talk about it.
[02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:48.120]   I was going to do skippity too.
[02:42:48.120 --> 02:42:54.600]   I mean, no, no, we really need to emphasize this filtration, chat room and Discord.
[02:42:54.600 --> 02:42:55.800]   Just focus on that for me.
[02:42:55.800 --> 02:42:57.800]   Come up with something quippy and we'll come out.
[02:42:57.800 --> 02:42:58.800]   Having to do a filtration.
[02:42:58.800 --> 02:42:59.800]   Okay.
[02:42:59.800 --> 02:43:00.800]   All right.
[02:43:00.800 --> 02:43:05.120]   Secondly, it is the most wonderful time of the year, which also means that for some people,
[02:43:05.120 --> 02:43:07.160]   it is the worst time of the year.
[02:43:07.160 --> 02:43:12.760]   So if you have family members that have, don't have kids or alone or maybe their spouse passed
[02:43:12.760 --> 02:43:17.240]   away, make sure you check on your aunts, your uncles, your nieces, your nephews, your
[02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:18.240]   cousins.
[02:43:18.240 --> 02:43:22.160]   Call them, stop by, pick them up, go watch Spider-Man together, spend some time because
[02:43:22.160 --> 02:43:23.600]   you got a couple of days off.
[02:43:23.600 --> 02:43:26.800]   But don't forget about the people that are usually alone at this time of the year that
[02:43:26.800 --> 02:43:27.800]   are in your circle.
[02:43:27.800 --> 02:43:31.240]   I know I'm the crimes out there, but if you could even just give them a call to check
[02:43:31.240 --> 02:43:33.280]   on them, I'm sure they would appreciate you.
[02:43:33.280 --> 02:43:37.320]   I will tell you that the one show that I don't do enough, but I'll start doing next year
[02:43:37.320 --> 02:43:41.280]   is raising an engine because people love you talking to Leah and about Leah.
[02:43:41.280 --> 02:43:45.960]   And I'll tell you the other night I came home and we bought all these candles.
[02:43:45.960 --> 02:43:47.760]   If you look on the internet, you can see it.
[02:43:47.760 --> 02:43:51.480]   And the candle was fresh in her room and I'm like, man, it was just fresh.
[02:43:51.480 --> 02:43:52.480]   Her lights were out.
[02:43:52.480 --> 02:43:53.480]   Everything was dark.
[02:43:53.480 --> 02:43:56.160]   And I was like, there's no way she went to bed that quick.
[02:43:56.160 --> 02:43:58.400]   And so the next day I'm like, yo, what happened last night?
[02:43:58.400 --> 02:44:00.440]   She was like, oh, it's actually crying.
[02:44:00.440 --> 02:44:03.400]   And when I heard you come in, I didn't want to bother you.
[02:44:03.400 --> 02:44:05.440]   So I just blew the candle out and I jumped in bed.
[02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:07.120]   And when someone's like, well, why were you upset?
[02:44:07.120 --> 02:44:08.280]   And she was like, it's not a big deal.
[02:44:08.280 --> 02:44:10.960]   You know, at holidays, you know, just pressure school and all that.
[02:44:10.960 --> 02:44:13.240]   And I was like, no, like literally let's talk about why.
[02:44:13.240 --> 02:44:17.720]   And she said she's wrestling, you know, it's two hours after school is beating her body
[02:44:17.720 --> 02:44:22.560]   up, you know, school work tests and, you know, just the general things of life.
[02:44:22.560 --> 02:44:24.440]   And you know, she's making soap and doing all this stuff.
[02:44:24.440 --> 02:44:29.840]   So long story short, Christmas Eve is going to be the last order for taking for soap.
[02:44:29.840 --> 02:44:33.800]   We're going to shut it down for next year so she can focus on her sports and the other
[02:44:33.800 --> 02:44:35.600]   things that she wants to do.
[02:44:35.600 --> 02:44:36.880]   And it's totally fine.
[02:44:36.880 --> 02:44:41.680]   But my point is that my kid is one of the happiest kids on earth, you know, but her mom's
[02:44:41.680 --> 02:44:42.680]   a great mom.
[02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:43.800]   I do the best I can.
[02:44:43.800 --> 02:44:46.800]   But even she was just super sad and down for a day.
[02:44:46.800 --> 02:44:50.360]   And if you don't think to take the time to check on your kids or your parents or your
[02:44:50.360 --> 02:44:54.600]   loved ones, your significant other, sometimes that moment can cascade into something else.
[02:44:54.600 --> 02:44:56.360]   So make sure you're paying attention.
[02:44:56.360 --> 02:44:57.680]   Make sure you're looking out.
[02:44:57.680 --> 02:44:59.960]   And again, Merry Christmas.
[02:44:59.960 --> 02:45:03.000]   Happy New Year, Happy Hanukkah, Happy Quonset, Happy Whatever You Celebrate.
[02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:06.920]   But make sure you check on the people that are alone in the world because I love you,
[02:45:06.920 --> 02:45:08.280]   they love you, we love you.
[02:45:08.280 --> 02:45:09.280]   Merry Christmas.
[02:45:09.280 --> 02:45:10.720]   And you know what else they say?
[02:45:10.720 --> 02:45:11.720]   Another twin's in the can.
[02:45:11.720 --> 02:45:12.720]   Roll the music.
[02:45:12.720 --> 02:45:13.720]   Do the twin.
[02:45:13.720 --> 02:45:14.720]   All right.
[02:45:14.720 --> 02:45:15.720]   Do the twin, baby.
[02:45:15.720 --> 02:45:16.720]   Do the twin.
[02:45:16.720 --> 02:45:17.720]   All right.
[02:45:17.720 --> 02:45:18.720]   Do the twin, baby.
[02:45:18.720 --> 02:45:19.720]   Do the twin.
[02:45:19.720 --> 02:45:20.720]   All right.
[02:45:20.720 --> 02:45:21.720]   Do the twin, baby.
[02:45:21.720 --> 02:45:22.720]   Do the twin.
[02:45:22.720 --> 02:45:23.720]   Do the twin.
[02:45:23.720 --> 02:45:24.720]   Do the twin.
