[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.980]   Time for Twit this week in Tech, the show where we get together with some of the most interesting
[00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.780]   people in the technology sector and talk about the weeks technology news. Normally we
[00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.860]   use tech journalists here, but I don't have a single journalist in the lot, which is actually
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:30.020]   going to be kind of fun. All of the people joining me today are founders, investors,
[00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.500]   and certainly acute observers of the tech scene starting over to my right here with Jonathan
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.460]   Abrams, who is in the news business, but as a founder of Nuzzle, the news aggregator.
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.020]   It's good to see you again, Jonathan.
[00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.580]   Yeah, technically not a journalist.
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.740]   Not a journalist, but doing stuff with news.
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:50.500]   Yeah. And Nuzzle is a really, I think, a wonderful place to go to get your news and newsletters
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.100]   and you're doing some really good things with it.
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.100]   Thank you.
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.100]   Nice to see you.
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.100]   Good to be here.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.100]   Wearing your Alan Turing shirt.
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.100]   Yep.
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.100]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.100]   Nice.
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.100]   Is there a reason for that? It just feels good.
[00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.260]   Well, we were, am I allowed to say we were earlier playing the Game of Geeks?
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.260]   Yes.
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.260]   I thought I should wear something in the game.
[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.260]   Oh, again.
[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.700]   And, oh, pale homage to a legend of computer science.
[00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.180]   I love it.
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.180]   It's nice.
[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.820]   It's a very cool shirt.
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.180]   Also to my left here, Mr. Jason Callicannis, who has in fact been on Twitter many times.
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.540]   He's a good to be home.
[00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.780]   Inside.com, which is a kind of a journalistic enterprise.
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.180]   Yeah. I mean, Peter and I are former journalists, but, you know, when you get paid so little,
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.780]   doing journalism for a decade or two, you just run to become investors.
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.660]   I can't add that.
[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.660]   Everybody's just jumping on.
[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.660]   You were really smart.
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.020]   Everybody's jumping off the ship.
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.020]   It's sinking.
[00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.460]   But no, inside's doing email newsletter, so it's back to the future.
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.140]   And now you're doing a text message newsletter, which is kind of...
[00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.620]   Well, I have an experiment.
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.700]   Jason's TXT list.
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.220]   So I tweeted it twice and like 800 people signed up.
[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.020]   So I'm just texting people my random thoughts.
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.980]   What's great about text is it's kind of like 100% of the messages get opened.
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:58.980]   Right.
[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.340]   So it's just interesting because you have to really think signal like am I really wasting
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.340]   somebody's time because you're going to be a dinner.
[00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.340]   They're going to get a text for me.
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.340]   You know, I'm like, I'm just going to keep that with reviews.
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.820]   I used to think that with Twitter, but now I don't worry about that so much.
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.820]   Yeah.
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.060]   I told people I'm going to really think about the tweet.
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.620]   So I just like, I told people about a company I invested in.
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.620]   I told people about a book I finished.
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.060]   It is just kind of like a personal Twitter in a way.
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.060]   Right.
[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.020]   Well, I have 150,000 people on my email list and then 800 on this.
[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.220]   So I think when something's really intimate or like it's sort of like a sniper shot, so
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.220]   it's just an experiment.
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.500]   I don't know that it's going to work or I'll keep doing it, but it's an experiment.
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.940]   And you mentioned Peter, Peter Rojas is here a long time at Engadget, founder and editor
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.300]   in chief, but now an investor himself made the jump to.
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.540]   He's a partner at the beta news ventures.
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.540]   Data works.
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.660]   Beta works though is a news because they bought dig, right?
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.660]   And they bought.
[00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.060]   So beta works originally studio and now we have a fund.
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.060]   Okay.
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.780]   And so it's the same parent company.
[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.260]   It's they sit side by side now.
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.260]   Side by side.
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.260]   Cool.
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.260]   Anyway, great to see you.
[00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.260]   Thanks.
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.740]   Do you miss writing about the latest phone or are you so happy to get off that?
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.700]   I will say that I still write a little bit, but it's nice to not have to have an opinion
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.700]   about everything.
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.700]   Yeah.
[00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.700]   Yeah.
[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.140]   Which I used to I was obligated to have a perspective or a thought about every single
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.780]   twist and turn in the news and now I don't have to.
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.100]   And it gets wearing because it's speeding up.
[00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.780]   I mean, there's a new five minutes.
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.700]   It feels like there's a new something.
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.180]   And remember Peter was also the founder of Gizmodo.
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.340]   So people don't realize this, but that's right.
[00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:33.580]   Which founded Gizmodo without it in gadget, then the team from the combined team from
[00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.460]   engaging Gizmodo formed the verge.
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.460]   Right.
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.460]   So of the top three, three of the five top news letters were technically started by
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:41.460]   the job.
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.860]   I can't claim any credit for the verge, but except that your team did it, but it did
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.860]   hire all those people.
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:46.860]   Yeah.
[00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.300]   And they were stolen and then left right away, right?
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.860]   No, they were there for a few years.
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:51.860]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:52.860]   Okay.
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:53.860]   Nice.
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.700]   Let's see, there's a lot to talk about.
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.340]   We're coming up on an election on Tuesday.
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.140]   I don't think we should get too political here today because I think people come to us
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.300]   too as a refuge to run away from all of that.
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.580]   But there's some tech around the elections.
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.460]   I mean, we haven't had a presidential election in four years.
[00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.180]   It gets every, it's like the Olympics.
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.700]   Every four years, tech marches on.
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.820]   This is definitely heavily influenced by Twitter, this particular presidential election.
[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:29.580]   Some people, some people will be watching BuzzFeed on Twitter for the election results.
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:35.300]   I suspect a great number of people will be watching online as opposed to the networks
[00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.700]   for election results.
[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.740]   And I think many people will have multiple screens, at least the real junkies.
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.740]   Yeah.
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.020]   I think one of the things that'll be really different is that it used to be, especially
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:51.140]   before social media, that if you wanted to hear rumors about exit polls and sort of those
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.780]   early projections, you couldn't really find any of that information.
[00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.140]   You had to really wait until the polls closed and the networks made their calls.
[00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.460]   The networks really gatekeepers.
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.460]   Yeah.
[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.940]   And I think now we're going to see throughout the day on Tuesday, early exit polling, people
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.460]   are going to start making calls.
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.060]   I don't think any of the big organizations are going to start to do it, but you'll see
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.260]   a lot of discussion on Twitter from people.
[00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.340]   I mean, you're already seeing somebody making projections about the early voting in Nevada,
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.340]   for example, right now.
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.340]   Right.
[00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.980]   And the heavy Latino turnout, could that be good for the Democrats?
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:25.220]   It's part of what's been happening in journalism, which is the rules that were maintained by
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:32.540]   the small handful of people who had the bully pulpit, the New York Times and CBS News.
[00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:34.460]   Those rules are out the window now.
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.540]   It's a now, it's a, you might say a race to the bottom.
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.700]   It's certainly a race to file.
[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.780]   And so things like holding off until the polls close.
[00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:43.780]   That's not going to happen.
[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:44.780]   That's not going to happen.
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.940]   It's not going to be a philosophical discussion at the networks.
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.820]   Nobody's even, you know, there's no, there's no moral.
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.900]   I think that the networks will still hold to it.
[00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.620]   I think when, for me, will they, because if they're getting scooped online, are they
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.020]   going to still hold their tongue?
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.220]   It's only a matter of time before they say, well, it's out there.
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:05.340]   We're going to say it in the same way that they name names now when they would not name
[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.580]   names of victims or.
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.220]   Or they say certain words that presidential candidates say they've never been sat on.
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.220]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.220]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.220]   It's changed quite a bit.
[00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:19.020]   The legacy of this is going to be that Trump really is the first social media candidate.
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:23.620]   If it were, if this was 20 years ago, could someone like Trump get the amount of airtime
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.300]   that he wanted would the.
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.940]   He did not need to buy ads.
[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:27.940]   Right.
[00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:32.300]   And he is able to control his message and really he is a savant, you know, putting aside
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.300]   politics.
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.780]   He is a savant at getting attention online.
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:41.460]   That then becomes undeniable and he forces the networks to then cover him.
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.180]   And so it's, it's pretty dark time for America.
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.580]   They did very, very well.
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.580]   Well, also.
[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.540]   And his reality show experience helped a lot.
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:49.540]   For sure.
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:50.540]   Right.
[00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.700]   And if you just think about the sort of facts, you know, we had this great tradition of journalist
[00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.220]   checking facts.
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:59.660]   And now it seems like through the power of video and social media that so many, the
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.940]   facts don't matter anymore.
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.460]   People can make a video on YouTube that seems incredibly convincing that the Clinton foundation
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.780]   stole all the money going to Haiti.
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:07.780]   Then another person can explain.
[00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:09.540]   It just becomes true by repetition.
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.540]   Exactly.
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.500]   And, and, and, and, and yet at the same time we have more fact checking sites and
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.940]   metaphor, Google's including fact checking and its search results and Google news.
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:23.340]   It's going to take decades and multiple election cycles for us to get used to this new norm
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.420]   of anybody can say anything at any time.
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:27.940]   And it's probably not true.
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.500]   And it's going to be harder and harder for people to figure it out.
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.660]   Well, it doesn't seem to matter.
[00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:35.740]   I think that there's going to be a lot of pressure on Facebook after this election.
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.980]   There's been a lot of fake news gets propagated through Facebook.
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:42.020]   There's a great story on BuzzFeed about these content farms in Macedonia, which are just
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:43.020]   pumping out fake news.
[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.020]   Wasn't that wild?
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.100]   There's most of this news is coming out of Macedonia?
[00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.100]   Yeah.
[00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:52.420]   And I think that, I think that if you're, if you're Facebook, you have to start to actually
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:57.660]   take a look at yourself and wonder what responsibility do we have to reason the fake news is going
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.460]   viral on Facebook is that people like it.
[00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:03.940]   Well, because it wouldn't be going viral on Facebook unless people were, you know, partisan
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:07.820]   people were seeing this crazy stuff and, and liking it and sort of sharing it.
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.380]   Or is it that it's so outlandish that you can't deny.
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.420]   You like it or click on it.
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.420]   There's a difference isn't there.
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.740]   There's some people who like it and some people who don't.
[00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.780]   I mean, we're getting a lot of complaints at Nuzzle from some of our users via email
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:25.180]   and Twitter that people are just fed up and tired of all the, the politics and election
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.460]   coverage.
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.700]   But the thing is, you know, Nuzzle, we don't have editors and we don't decide what people
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:30.700]   see.
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.860]   They're actually only seeing the top news shared by their friends.
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.100]   So on one hand, their friends are obviously tweeting a lot of this news.
[00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.620]   That's why it's in their Nuzzle feed.
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.180]   On the other hand, people are complaining to us that they're getting sick of seeing so
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.660]   much of it.
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:47.340]   But Facebook, by the way, decided to do the same thing originally doing some curation
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:52.220]   on their topics and probably wisely said, this is a, this is a recipe for disaster.
[00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.500]   Let's just let it happen.
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.260]   And then they at least have the out that you have.
[00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:56.260]   Well, that's what your friends are.
[00:10:56.260 --> 00:11:01.220]   Well, they went from having, you know, accusations of bias when they were using humans to now
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.300]   having now fake news accidentally.
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:08.380]   I think they're going to have to figure out what's the right balance here because no
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.380]   algorithm is perfectly neutral, right?
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.380]   I mean, they are, they're are implicit.
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.380]   Exactly.
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:19.380]   I mean, there are implicit decisions and outcomes that arise from the decisions that they make
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.020]   and how they tune the newsfeed.
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:27.060]   And I think that after this, I think that not just Facebook, but I think any channel
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:32.980]   that people use to find, to find, to get news, I think you're going to, is going to have
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:39.140]   to look at how do we, what kind of responsibilities platforms have to at least diminish the amount
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.860]   of dangerously fake information that's being put out there.
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.340]   And it's a hard question to answer because it's hard.
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:45.580]   Well, whose job is that?
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.100]   Is that Facebook's job?
[00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.100]   I'm not saying.
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.500]   I think Facebook would be wise just to see itself as a conduit.
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.500]   The man.
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.980]   And is it, is it the job of the media or of the social network platforms to decide what
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:55.980]   people want to see?
[00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.700]   Because I think is there some people who want to see ridiculous problems.
[00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:03.260]   But what Peter's saying is the algorithm is making a decision that is not unbiased decisions.
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.260]   Yes, I'm saying, I think no matter.
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.460]   The difference between, for instance, a like and a click.
[00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:11.100]   If Facebook was a completely unfiltered feed, so to speak, of just whoever you followed or
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.460]   liked, that'd be one thing.
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.460]   That's what Twitter is, right?
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.780]   Which was sort of what Twitter is, at least if you don't have the algorithmic feed, right?
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:20.940]   But with Facebook, there is an algorithm that does make decisions.
[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:24.020]   Yeah, they've already decided that they're going to program what you see.
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.020]   Yeah.
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.020]   So they've already made that decision.
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.460]   And if you look at Facebook, it's kind of interesting because they don't want to lose
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.100]   one user, right?
[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:35.660]   Even though Zuckerberg and Charles Samberg are absolutely against Trump, they, when they
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:41.980]   got accused of being biased towards the liberal side, they had all the conservatives in had
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:43.140]   Glenn back over.
[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:47.180]   They are absolutely interested in their share price and their share price only as they
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.180]   should be.
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.180]   That's their share responsibility.
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.180]   Yes.
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:57.420]   And then you have Twitter who's saying, Hey, a Jack is, you know, and social activists.
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.900]   He's a social justice warrior.
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:03.020]   He's banning conservatives from the platform, making decisions on what they say breaking
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.020]   the terms.
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.020]   Well, he did.
[00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.020]   He banned me.
[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:10.020]   But Milo, but what was the guy who just came up and the other day was like three or four
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.660]   of the right wing folks.
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:15.460]   You never see a liberal get banned or a Democrat, a Democratic person get banned.
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:19.380]   Now, without making any judgments about it, if you start deciding that you're going to
[00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.140]   police speech, I think you've lost already.
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:23.900]   You lost already as a platform.
[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:27.100]   And I think there's a big mistake on Twitter's part.
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:30.820]   But what I talked about before was that consumers don't even understand what trending topic
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.260]   means, right?
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.900]   They didn't understand if that was computers.
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.140]   They don't know what an algorithm is.
[00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:39.420]   And an algorithm typically is what the tech industry builds to screw people over and to
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.700]   trick them and then have somebody else to blame like a machine.
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.460]   I always just assume that algorithms are written by humans.
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.660]   Of the people, I'm assuming.
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:47.660]   Am I wrong?
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:49.700]   I'm looking at my trending topics on Facebook.
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.420]   This must be things that people are talking about.
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:56.780]   In fact, they even say 190,000 people are talking about that.
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.420]   6, 2,200 people are talking about this.
[00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:00.420]   8, 200.
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:01.420]   That's not real.
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.420]   Is that?
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.900]   Well, that's what people previously, they had people editing that by hearing.
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:05.900]   No, I understand.
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:06.900]   But is this purely numeric?
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.020]   If some people search people, listen, Google with trending searches, they took out the
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.660]   porn searches because it would be the top 20.
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.940]   So when you used to go to the Google lobby, they had a raw fee and had to have a little
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.940]   disclaimer there because you go to the raw fee and you would see--
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:18.940]   It's all porn.
[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.180]   Yeah, every third one would be something you did not want to share.
[00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:23.740]   Every fourth one was Yahoo, which was funny because people--
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:24.740]   Yeah, people were--
[00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:25.740]   People were typing--
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:26.740]   People were typing to Google.
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:27.740]   Yeah, Yahoo.
[00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:28.740]   So that's definitely mitigated.
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:34.940]   But the point is, as a large group of citizens, people are absolutely confused as to what
[00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:35.940]   all the stuff is.
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:39.620]   And then, media is not trusted at an all-time high.
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.900]   So media distrust is at an all-time high.
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.060]   And people don't know who to believe.
[00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:46.580]   And people believe that the New York Times is biased towards liberals.
[00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:50.420]   And then you have a bunch of trolling activist journalists out there like Breitbart in the
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.460]   mix who are biased and having a agenda.
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:57.780]   So we're never going back to the days where you had the paper of record or you could say,
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.980]   "I could trust the Tiffany network."
[00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:00.980]   Those days are gone.
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:01.980]   Those days are gone.
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:02.980]   It's all burned down.
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:03.980]   We've got to rebuild it up.
[00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.980]   Is that the solution?
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:06.980]   It has to be rebuilt.
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:07.980]   It has to be rebuilt.
[00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.580]   Or is it up to consumers just to go through this stuff and somehow filter it and figure
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.580]   it out?
[00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.340]   Well, I mean, there's new voices.
[00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:17.020]   There's the scam a lot of millennials are getting, I think, electric coverage from.
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.820]   But I think the traditional media--
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:23.460]   I mean, I hate to say something like this, but I think they have done a pretty bad job
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.340]   in some ways of the election coverage.
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:29.620]   I mean, there's been-- I mean, the Clinton email stuff, I mean, the amount of coverage
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.180]   on that versus other things.
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.660]   I mean, it is kind of crazy.
[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:33.660]   There's the false equivalency.
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.940]   I mean, I think in general, they've done a bad job.
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.900]   But I mean, the cable news networks are where you go to see what this plays.
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:42.900]   Well, the irony is the people who believe as you do are mad.
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:47.860]   The people who believe otherwise are just as mad saying there's too little coverage.
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:49.700]   It's being buried.
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.620]   Trump tweeted, Facebook and Twitter are sitting on all this stuff.
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.620]   They're burying it off.
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.580]   So in other words, nobody's happy.
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:00.820]   Everybody-- whether true or not, everybody mistrusts all the sources.
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:01.820]   So what do you do?
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.380]   Well, I would say that newspapers have generally done a better job than the cable--
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.460]   But nobody trusts them.
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.460]   So--
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.620]   Yeah, but it's interesting how the Washington Post is actually the coverage of the Washington
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:11.620]   Post is--
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.780]   Jeff Bezos has done a very good job, hasn't he?
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.780]   David Farenholt, I think, has been doing his coverage of the Trump Foundation.
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:19.460]   I mean, it's been excellent investigative journalism.
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:20.460]   And--
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.460]   Is that because of Bezos putting in money and encouraging them?
[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.460]   I think it's because of Bezos putting in money.
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.700]   And they don't have to worry about the profit margin at the end of the day.
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:26.700]   Yeah.
[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:27.700]   They just can't lose too much money.
[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:28.700]   So all of these--
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.700]   But that's not a--
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:30.700]   But it's the--
[00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:31.700]   It's not a viable way of--
[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:32.700]   It's dangerous--
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.700]   The patronage model is not a viable way to keep journalism.
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:35.700]   No, I actually think it is.
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.700]   I disagree.
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.700]   Is that how it's going to be?
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.700]   I think what's going to happen.
[00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:39.700]   It's going to be the Medicis funding journalism.
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.700]   Here's what's going to happen.
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.020]   I think that as well, these things crash.
[00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:44.380]   Like CNN is obviously crashes, election cycle.
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.380]   And nobody trusts them.
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:49.660]   But what will happen is consumers will realize, if I want to have high quality content, I
[00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:50.660]   need to pay for it.
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:53.500]   And you only need to have 5% of the audience agree to do that.
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:57.940]   And you just need to have these news organizations be rebooted in a smaller footprint.
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:58.940]   And that's what we're doing.
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.420]   And inside, that's what the scam's doing, which is let's just start over and let's have
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.420]   a small operation.
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.980]   It doesn't have to be wildly profitable.
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:07.620]   And let's try to rebuild trust into original reporting.
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:11.300]   And it could go back to the days where like front line, 60 minutes, a lot of these things
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.300]   are loss leaders.
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.300]   I do feel like--
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:14.300]   I do feel like there's a thirst.
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.300]   The first--
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:17.780]   Local newspapers were always a subsidized business.
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.620]   They made money from the classifieds and all these other things.
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:21.820]   They had local monopolies.
[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:27.020]   I mean, the traditional quality journalism never really was profitable in and of itself.
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:28.020]   Yeah.
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.980]   Well, it was something to separate the full page ads.
[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.180]   But that's how newspapers were created.
[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:35.180]   That's not the--
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.180]   Always been.
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:42.220]   But there-- so I think we're saying there's a thirst for a reliable trustworthy source.
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.220]   Yeah.
[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.220]   They're going to be built in the next 20 years.
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:47.580]   Well, the other issue is one is there's probably a thirst for reliable trustworthy source that
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.700]   believes as I do.
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.580]   So there's that filter bubble issue.
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:51.580]   People want the filter bubble.
[00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:52.580]   They do want to filter.
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:53.580]   Unfortunately.
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.580]   Yeah.
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.100]   I mean, people criticize Nuzzle for enforcing filter bubble.
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.660]   I point out that you can use Nuzzle to look at somebody else's feed who--
[00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.940]   You don't have to look at people who agree with you.
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.300]   You can use Nuzzle as a tool if you wanted to.
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:08.060]   It'd be one of the most efficient tools to see somebody else's perspective.
[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.060]   But that's not what--
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.060]   Almost universally what people say.
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.060]   That's not what people want.
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.060]   People say, I don't want to hear any more politics.
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.100]   What they really mean is I don't want to hear any more politics that's--
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.860]   Disagrees with my politics.
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.260]   They're completely content to hear about stuff that they agree with.
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.260]   So that you're right.
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:21.900]   Well, I think at this point, people are just a little--
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.900]   I mean, thankfully there's only a few more days.
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.100]   But I think even people now are just like--
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.300]   Make it and reached an excessive point of just all this.
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:33.920]   So I'm just wondering if there's a future-- we actually talk about this a lot with Jeff
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:39.700]   Jarvis on this week and Google and others-- shows if there's a future for some form
[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.860]   of journalism, investigative journalism.
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:44.020]   I think we all agree you need that, right?
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.860]   Everybody needs to speak truth to power.
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:48.580]   Somebody needs to cover the city council meetings.
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.980]   If you look at Mother Jones, they did a couple of really interesting investigative pieces
[00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:52.980]   recently.
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:53.980]   You look at Frontline.
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:54.980]   Are they subsidized?
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:55.980]   Well, Frontline is obviously an honor.
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.380]   Frontline is, but Mother Jones?
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.820]   I'm not sure if they've done patronage yet, but pro-people--
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.420]   I actually made a donation to Mother Jones for some reason.
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.620]   I remember why they did something down by a lawsuit.
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.620]   Right, but if you--
[00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:06.620]   But if you--
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:07.620]   A frivolous lawsuit.
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:08.620]   And I think after that, I read about that and they made a donation.
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.300]   But the thing is they did this incredible one on the prison system.
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:12.300]   It's one journalist.
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.500]   And what people forget is great journalism is typically done by a small group of people.
[00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.180]   So three journalists, four journalists getting paid 100k each.
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:19.660]   It's only 400,000.
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:23.140]   If you think about-- if 10,000 people want to support that, it's 40 bucks each.
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.140]   What about new media?
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:26.940]   What about podcasts, YouTube, places like that?
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:31.580]   Can those become a platform for the future of journalism?
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.140]   Or is it going to be in more traditional--
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.140]   Hasn't it already happened?
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.140]   Yeah.
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.140]   Somebody's saying--
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.140]   You let us up that hill.
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.980]   Somebody's saying I trust the young Turks.
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:40.980]   That's a podcast.
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:41.980]   Yeah.
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:42.980]   And they do original reporting.
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:45.980]   So one of the things is, commentation is very easy to do.
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.740]   It's easy to do what we do, which is comment.
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:48.740]   Right.
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.580]   And it's a lot harder to go out and do enterprise journalism.
[00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:52.580]   A lot more expensive.
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:53.580]   A lot more expensive.
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:54.580]   But you know what?
[00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.300]   Many hands makes for light work.
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:02.180]   If you have a million people reading a site and 5% decide to do patronage, and they pay
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:05.460]   10 bucks a year or 100 bucks a year, this could be a big number.
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:12.380]   And so I think that this crashing is going to have a great effect that new platforms
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:13.380]   will be built.
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.380]   All right.
[00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.380]   Let's talk about some other stuff in just a bit.
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:20.380]   We're going to put poor Peter Rojas back to work and talk about Mac and Tasha.
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.380]   Sorry, Peter.
[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.380]   I'm sorry, Peter.
[00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:24.380]   And a little bit.
[00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:25.700]   Great panel here, though.
[00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.940]   And I wanted to start with something a little bit philosophical in a timely.
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.260]   I think that was great, Jason Kellen.
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:37.260]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.260]   And I think that's a great thing.
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:47.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:52.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:53.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:02.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:14.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:17.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:20.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:28.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:31.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:34.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:42.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:50.260]   I think that's a great thing.
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:55.260]   It's all your fault.
[00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:58.260]   I blame you.
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:21:59.260]   Sure.
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:00.260]   I'll fix my car.
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.260]   Jason.
[00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.260]   Did you have any thought?
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.260]   Any idea?
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:09.260]   I mean, what social would mean in going forward on the Internet?
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:13.260]   I mean, it's in the same way that "friendster" was a frenzy when it took off, right?
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.260]   It's huge growth, instantaneous growth.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:17.260]   Yeah.
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.260]   It turned into something.
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.260]   It turned into something that was in their friends and their friends.
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:25.260]   It took a while before people started to notice, but even that happened pretty quick.
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:28.260]   We had no idea what it, I think, in the early days.
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.260]   It transformed the universe, the Internet.
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.260]   I was a beta user.
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:32.260]   Yeah.
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:33.260]   I was in the beta.
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:38.260]   I remember we were on call for help, and somebody tried to sign up and it would crash and crash.
[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:39.260]   Oh, yes.
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:47.260]   I remember being on tech TV, and they would put up "friendster" on the screen, and it was not loading.
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:52.260]   I mean, that was, I think, a symptom of the fact that we were so early and doing something
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:56.260]   that was new, because prior to "friendster," a lot of websites, "you went to a website,
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:57.260]   I went to a website, we saw the same thing."
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:58.260]   Yeah.
[00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:02.260]   And the way "friendster" worked was three different people went and saw three very different things,
[00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.260]   using the graph and all that kind of stuff.
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:05.260]   A lot of work.
[00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:08.260]   There wasn't a lot of technology that had already been built.
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.260]   Now, if you had an idea for some new social app, there's a lot of things you could get off the shelf,
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.260]   open source, and cloud and all this kind of stuff.
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.260]   So, it was pretty hard what we were doing at the time.
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:20.260]   You know, a lot of other companies learned from what we did right and wrong.
[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:22.260]   Yeah, my space photocopied it.
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:23.260]   Was it really?
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:24.260]   Pretty much a photocopy.
[00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:26.260]   Well, that's what I remember Jason writing on the--
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.260]   Social Science is what we used to call it.
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.260]   Social Science Web Logs Inc.
[00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.260]   There was a blog--
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.260]   There was a blog--
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.260]   It was a blog--
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.260]   It was a blog--
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.260]   Social Software Blogs.
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.260]   It was a JSON--
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.260]   This is before TechCrunch, this is before, you know, before Gocker and all this kind of stuff,
[00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:42.260]   and I remember it was one of the first sites that was covering this crazy stuff we were doing.
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.260]   Sure.
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.260]   You had all the patents, right?
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:45.260]   You sold them to Facebook?
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.260]   Well, I didn't personally sell them yet, so they--
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:48.260]   So the company--
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.260]   Think you bought them.
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:50.260]   No, they--
[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.260]   No.
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:56.260]   But the company that bought Friendster, in turn then sold the patents to Facebook for more than they paid to buy Friendster.
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.260]   So, yeah, Facebook now owns those patents.
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:23:59.260]   Interesting.
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:02.260]   There was only one company that did it before, you're six degrees.
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.260]   Had like a very light social network.
[00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:05.260]   I mean, consider that a social network.
[00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:08.260]   I think six degrees really, if you want to get into the weeds, is more--
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:10.260]   It was kind of like more like Plaxo.
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.260]   Plaxo, right.
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.260]   Or even Planet All that Amazon bought.
[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:15.260]   It was really not quite the same thing.
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.260]   But, I mean, there are people who said, "Oh, what about this?
[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:18.260]   What about that?"
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:20.260]   I mean, at one point, Classmates.com tried to go public.
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:23.260]   And they were like, "Oh, we were the first social network."
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:27.260]   And of course, Classmates.com was like really nothing like Friendster in my space Facebook.
[00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:28.260]   Which lists.
[00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:31.260]   But, you know, so you can get into different definitions.
[00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:35.260]   I mean, people will say AOL or BBS or whatever.
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.260]   Yeah.
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:41.260]   Well, I mean, Zuckerberg admitted that he copied Friendster.
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:45.260]   I mean, he was straight up, you know, designed it after your design.
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.260]   I didn't see that in the movie.
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:52.260]   That's because Jonathan was too stupid not to sue him in a $39 settlement like the Winklevi.
[00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:53.260]   You should have sued.
[00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:54.260]   It's too nice of a guy.
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.260]   You have big into Bitcoin right now.
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.260]   Our show today, bro--
[00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.260]   Winklevi.
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:02.260]   Okay, Purliff, Winklevoss.
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:04.260]   Oh, show today, brought to you by--
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:05.260]   I don't know any Bitcoin.
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:06.260]   You don't have any?
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.260]   None?
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:08.260]   The Winklevi have something they'll sell you.
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:09.260]   They will Winklevoss.
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.260]   They'll sell you plenty.
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.260]   They brought to you by Stamps.com.
[00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:18.260]   You know, in some countries, I think US postage is used as a currency.
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.260]   You could buy a sandwich with a stamp.
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:28.260]   Jason Calicades is holding up the fine Stamps.com USB scale, which you can get absolutely free
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:31.260]   today by going to Stamps.com.
[00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:36.260]   If you send mail for a living, US mail for a living, whether you're an Etsy seller or eBay
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:40.900]   or Amazon or maybe you just send out bills and brochures, you really need to know about
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:41.900]   Stamps.com.
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:46.180]   It's crazy to go to the post office where you can buy and print real US postage from your
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.260]   desk with your computer and printer.
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.260]   No postage meter needed.
[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:53.260]   You know what they charge for the ink for postage meters?
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:54.260]   It's Magic Ink.
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.260]   Ridiculous.
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:56.260]   Ridiculous.
[00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:57.260]   $5,000.
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:58.260]   Magic Ink.
[00:25:58.260 --> 00:25:59.260]   No, you don't need Magic Ink.
[00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:03.860]   In fact, the Postal Service loves Stamps.com.
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:07.100]   If you go to Stamps.com right now, you can see all the things you can do with Stamps.com.
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:12.300]   If you're selling on eBay, for instance, you get the Stamps.com scale.
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.340]   You could print out exactly the right postage.
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.060]   It'll even suggest the right postage.
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:19.780]   You could save money with media mail on this.
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:24.500]   If you're printing labels, it will get the address from the page, from the website.
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.900]   It'll get your address.
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.260]   It can use any PC address book.
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.660]   It'll fill out forms, certified mail, customs forms.
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:35.660]   All of this automatically, it saves you so much time.
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.060]   It makes you look more professional.
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:39.060]   You will love Stamps.com.
[00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.060]   It's very affordable.
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:42.300]   You'll end up saving money with Stamps.com.
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:45.500]   Just the time and hassle of going to the post office alone.
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:46.500]   Here's what you do.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.500]   Go to Stamps.com right now.
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.460]   Click on the microphone in the upper right-hand corner.

[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:04.540]   $85 in free postage and a month of Stamps.com.
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.860]   It's a good deal.
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:07.860]   Stamps.com.
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:08.860]   Click the microphone.
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:12.620]   Use the offer code TWIT before you do anything else.
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:19.260]   Just as we get closer to the holiday season, amateur hours, we call it at the postal service.
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.100]   If you're doing mailing for a living, you don't need to go to the post office anymore.
[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.100]   You need Stamps.com.
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.980]   By the way, they come and they pick it up.
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.100]   They have people to do that.
[00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.100]   I watched the Apple event.
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.580]   I was out of town last week.
[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:37.420]   I was really interested in the watch and the reaction, particularly from creative professionals
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:41.100]   who have been dying for an update to the Macintosh.
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.660]   I have a Mac Pro, the trashcan Mac, three years old.
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.820]   Three years old without one update.
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:52.980]   I can't think of any PC company in the world that has a product they're selling on their
[00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:57.940]   website that is unmodified from three years ago.
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:00.500]   That's crazy.
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:03.660]   One has to wonder, how committed is Apple to the Macintosh?
[00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:08.140]   Or us, Dettie you, on Simco wrote, I thought, kind of the definitive article on this.
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:09.380]   I don't know if you guys read it.
[00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.660]   It's probably not in the notes.
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:15.020]   I know you know Horace.
[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.980]   He's pretty astute on this kind of stuff.
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:17.980]   His article.
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:18.980]   You hear it is up on the screen.
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:19.980]   Yeah.
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.380]   His article, "Wherefore Aren't There Macintosh?"
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:29.380]   I think some interesting points that if you look at the ground, let me scroll down to the
[00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:32.020]   graph, the attention graph here.
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:34.420]   Percent of time spent.
[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:35.700]   The yellow is desktop.
[00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:39.220]   The green is mobile.
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:43.900]   You can see that desktop over the last few years has shrunk from 50% to one third and
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.340]   mobile is growing.
[00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:51.580]   It's clear to everybody that desktop is losing bit by bit attention.
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.900]   But obviously Apple is not going to stop selling desktops.
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:58.820]   There are a lot of reasons why you need to sell computers as opposed to iPhones and
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:28:59.820]   tablets.
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:06.060]   He points out the PC industry didn't have the same issue that Apple had.
[00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:10.820]   The PC didn't have to share its resource pool with an iPad and an iPhone.
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:13.180]   It didn't have to answer for its existence to a phone.
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:18.220]   PC makers and Microsoft aren't fighting with a usurper in their midst.
[00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:23.660]   They can see the challenge, in fact they tried to make mobile, but they needed to do it within
[00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.900]   the desktop computing environment.
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:31.420]   At Apple, he says Apple's immune system was suppressed.
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:34.740]   It allowed a disruptor to emerge from within the iPhone.
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:39.660]   It gave birth to its future, but it brings us to the question of what to do with the incumbent.
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:45.580]   The donor of the DNA and the resources, the parent that sacrificed for the child.
[00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.740]   As a result, Apple doesn't treat the Mac disparagingly.
[00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:50.020]   It deserves and gets respect.
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.020]   It's preserved but with limited responsibilities.
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:30:00.140]   Ultimately, the question for Apple is what is the purpose of the Mac going forward?
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:05.700]   He says it comes down to direct input devices and indirect input devices.
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:10.620]   The Mac is what the iPhone is, an indirect input device, keyboard, mouse, trackpad or
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:11.940]   what to find.
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:16.980]   The Mac, the OS is designed around it.
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:20.580]   I think a lot of people say the Mac should become a touch platform.
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:26.420]   He says Apple will never do this because essentially what's happening is they're going to ride
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:31.500]   this desktop computing and direct computing platform all the way down.
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:37.460]   The problem is that today you can't replace a PC, a desktop with an iPad.
[00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.300]   No, this thing is close.
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.940]   I use the iPad Pro but I really need to use Chrome natively.
[00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:47.620]   I can use this when I'm watching TV shows or playing a game or surfing the web, listening
[00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:51.740]   to podcasts, whatever but it's just not a replacement for doing serious work.
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:54.100]   So Apple can't kill the Mac yet.
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:31:00.340]   But there's a time when this replaces the Mac and talk.
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:04.020]   How much work is it to keep these product lines just competitive?
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:12.260]   It's almost like they're purposely disrespecting the users or purposely degrading them for some
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:13.260]   reason.
[00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:18.220]   It's reeks of incompetence to me or just some really bizarre strategy.
[00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:22.420]   I don't think they're purposely trying to disrespect their customers.
[00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.060]   They're just succeeding though.
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.500]   They may be doing that unintentionally.
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.300]   How many of those fanboys are upset right now though, Peter?
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:36.300]   Well, you know what?
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:37.300]   That's the best.
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:38.300]   We all know that smoke because they're saying they can't keep it in stock.
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.300]   That has nothing to do with the actual net sales.
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.380]   It's been backed up for four years.
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.380]   That is true.
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:46.100]   What would it take to get those people upset?
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.700]   Fanboys are so forgiving.
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:48.740]   Here's what I think.
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:53.580]   I have no history as an Apple defender.
[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:57.140]   I think that they're doing the projections and they're realizing that this is a business
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:03.380]   that's not going to grow anymore and that they're going to operate it for cash.
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:09.780]   If the Mac was a wholly owned, separate business that they just owned, they would be running
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:13.980]   that business for cash, trying to put as little as possible into it, and then take that cash
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.860]   and put it into other businesses that do have potential for growth.
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:21.420]   So, Zavaras says, the Mac is not obsolete, but it's a decreasing share of engagement.
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:26.460]   Alternate ways, the iPad and the iPhone of doing the jobs, it does well, are emerging,
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:27.460]   but they're not yet good enough.
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:31.020]   The children are still adolescent in making lots of stupid mistakes.
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:32.820]   There's still life in the parents.
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:36.580]   It makes sense that Apple's not going to invest heavily in a more abundant platform.
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:41.620]   They're going to keep it alive until the touch platform is good enough to take over, till
[00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:45.460]   the children can succeed the parents, and then we'll let the parents die in that.
[00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:46.460]   But the question I have is-
[00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.780]   But basically, the Mac is in a retirement.
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:52.140]   I mean, I think that eventually the iPad could be in a place where it is a good enough
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:57.180]   PC for maybe most people, but it's going to be hard to imagine it being something where
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:59.740]   if you're a developer or if you're doing-
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:00.740]   Why?
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:01.740]   I don't think so.
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:02.740]   Look at this.
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.740]   This is a keyboard-
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:04.740]   Not good for developers.
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:05.740]   It's not going to be good enough for developers.
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:06.740]   But here's the other thing I think is-
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.740]   The fact that you could only install apps is just such a handicap.
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:09.740]   Well, that's today.
[00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:10.740]   We don't know where it's-
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:11.740]   And that's forever.
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.100]   iOS, they will never open up.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.780]   This is their way to control it.
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:17.420]   The Mac OS is open.
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.580]   And that's a- consumers like it?
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:20.580]   Apple doesn't.
[00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:21.580]   Yeah.
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:26.780]   Really curious, if you think about how much growth there's going to be around VR and AR.
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:28.100]   And Apple's all in on AR.
[00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:29.100]   It's pretty clear.
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:30.260]   They've said over and over again.
[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:31.260]   They've said that.
[00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:39.340]   But you still need to have the GPUs on MacBook Pro is so anemic.
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:40.340]   Yeah.
[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:41.980]   No, it's not going to be on the Mac.
[00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:44.540]   But you still put it even for development now.
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:48.220]   The problem with your theory about the money though, or his theory about the money you're
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.900]   reinforcing with the theory of the money is they have more money than they could ever
[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:51.900]   have.
[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:52.900]   They have $200 billion of largest-
[00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.340]   Well, imagine they heal and cry if they killed the Mac.
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:56.340]   So they're going to keep the life.
[00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:57.340]   They're going to kill it.
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.340]   Why put more money into something that's-
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:33:59.340]   They're slowly killing it.
[00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:00.340]   They're torturing it to death.
[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:02.660]   I don't know why they're changing it as much as they have.
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:04.780]   I mean, like, I think there's a lot of people who have a MacBook Pro.
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:05.780]   Exactly.
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:06.780]   They're perfectly happy.
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.460]   And if they just came out with one that was exactly the same, that still had the USB ports.
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.220]   They could have a faster CPU.
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:14.620]   Everybody would upgrade and buy the new one with changing less of the ports.
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:15.620]   But they're not doing that.
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:16.620]   They're not even keeping it-
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:17.620]   Right.
[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.420]   I don't know why they're changing the ports.
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:20.420]   Look at the other side.
[00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:23.420]   But if they just came out with a-
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:24.420]   The dongles are high margin.
[00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:25.420]   You sell a dongle for $25.
[00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:26.420]   But they could probably cost about $1.
[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:30.820]   They could get a lot of people to buy a $2,000 new laptop if they just had faster CPAs.
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:31.820]   Who was it?
[00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:32.820]   Was it you, John?
[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:37.340]   Somebody was talking to me saying, "I just sat down at my old Mac laptop and I had nothing
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:38.700]   but dongles.
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:43.580]   You already have connected a lot of wires, a lot of stuff to your Mac.
[00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:47.620]   A dongle, you're already connecting things to these ports.
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:49.140]   Why not move to modern ports?
[00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:50.300]   You're still going to be connecting things.
[00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.940]   I use the USB ports on my-
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:54.460]   Yeah, so you're going to get a little adapter.
[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.460]   What we're seeing right now-
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.780]   They cut the price in half.
[00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:00.540]   That was kind of acknowledgement that they took a misstep, wasn't it, that they've cut
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:01.980]   the price of dongles in half.
[00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:08.860]   If you put, yes it is, if you put the person in charge of logistics, in charge of Apple-
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:10.140]   Which you did.
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:11.140]   Which they did.
[00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.140]   It's fine.
[00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:15.640]   You know, the ships and the trains, everything's going to run on time.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.380]   But the product is going to suffer.
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:23.420]   They need a product visionary in there to understand that getting rid of the phone jack
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:27.180]   and then forcing people to make a decision if they want to charge their phone or make
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:29.860]   a phone call is incompetence.
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:34.180]   And then to put, take the MagSafe connector, which Steve Jobs was like, "This is so important
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:36.540]   to MagSafe because your computer's not going to go flying across the room."
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:38.020]   Everybody said, "Oh my God, how will do you?"
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:39.540]   This MagSafe is so genius.
[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:43.860]   And to take that innovation that they're known for and throw it away and put USB-C and put
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:48.420]   it for USB-C and then take out another love feature, the HDMI that plugs right in, knowing
[00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:53.780]   that people who are in the video business and developers love that, it weeks of some
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:59.540]   level of incompetence that can only happen when you put somebody as boring and visionless
[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:04.540]   as Tim Cook in charge of a company with a legacy and a passionate user base like Apple.
[00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:05.540]   It's a disaster right now.
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:06.540]   You know who agrees with you?
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:08.140]   But this is actually my point.
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:14.780]   It's that Tim Cook is, he was COO, he was the guy whose job it was to ring as much efficiency
[00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:17.580]   out of that company as possible in their supply chain and that's the approach that he's
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:20.180]   taken to the Mac book, to the Mac line, which is exactly what they--
[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.180]   Which is exactly what they--
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.180]   --run it for cash, squeezy efficiencies.
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:23.180]   But there's no hard--
[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:24.180]   --but there's no hard net.
[00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:26.820]   Of course there's not a hard in there, but that's the strategy, which is--
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:27.820]   That's good business.
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:31.100]   --this is a business that is not going to go anywhere, so let's run it for cash and then
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:32.100]   put it in cash--
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:33.100]   You know who agrees with you, Jason?
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:34.100]   Who?
[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.100]   Steve Jobs.
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.100]   So, this is from the trying to the--
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:39.340]   It's good that they showed us because the technology crashed in the burn.
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.820]   With Robert X. Criincially, yeah.
[00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:42.820]   They used to call the--
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:43.820]   What's that?
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:44.820]   No, I was just--
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:45.820]   Why?
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:46.820]   Yeah.
[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:47.820]   Why?
[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.420]   Oh, very-- I actually thought a lot about that and I learned more about that with John
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:52.700]   Scully later on and I think I understand it now pretty well.
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:37:00.900]   What happens is, like with John Scully, John came from PepsiCo and they at most would
[00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.060]   change their product, you know, once every 10 years.
[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:06.500]   I mean, to them a new product was like a new size bottle, right?
[00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:12.020]   So if you were a product person, you couldn't change the course of that company very much.
[00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:15.940]   So who influenced the success of PepsiCo, the sales and marketing people?
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.980]   Therefore, they were the ones that got promoted and therefore they were the ones that ran
[00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:21.020]   the company.
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:27.900]   Well, for PepsiCo, that might have been okay, but it turns out the same thing can happen
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:34.300]   in technology companies that get monopolies like OIBM and Xerox.
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:41.260]   If you were a product person at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copy or a better computer,
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:42.260]   so what?
[00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:47.700]   When you have a monopoly market share, the company's not any more successful.
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:52.060]   So the people that can make the company more successful are sales and marketing people
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.380]   and they end up running the companies.
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:58.860]   And the product people get driven out of the decision making forums.
[00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:02.900]   I think Steve at this point was talking more about John Scully than he was about the Apple
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:04.340]   of 20 years from now.
[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:06.580]   But has that kind of what's happened?
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:07.740]   It's obvious what's happened.
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.540]   I mean, it's obvious.
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:12.940]   All the decisions that are being made today are being made in the schizophrenic way which
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:18.660]   shows that the visionary product teams are not being allowed to do what they want to do.
[00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:23.100]   And then somebody like Tim Cook is doing some operational thing to manage Wall Street, to
[00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.100]   manage the amount of money.
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:27.300]   They should just say, "F you Wall Street, if you don't like the stock, go screw yourselves.
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:31.020]   We're going to make products that are transcendent and innovative."
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:32.780]   And it's not going to be the most efficient process.
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:33.980]   We're not going to manage for cash.
[00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:38.660]   But you're talking as I am as a nostalgic Macintosh lover.
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:40.140]   Not as a...
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:44.220]   I mean, that's nice because we miss and love the Mac and we think the world of it.
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:45.220]   But it's not really very full.
[00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:48.020]   Most people who own an iPhone or iPad do not own a Mac.
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:50.020]   We know that to be true.
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:55.660]   But I think one of the challenges for Apple is that they've had a bunch of big successful
[00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:56.660]   franchises.
[00:38:56.660 --> 00:39:00.900]   They had the iPod, they had the iPhone, they had the iPad, which is arguably not a good
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:01.900]   double.
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.340]   It's definitely two big franchises, arguably maybe a third.
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:05.340]   Two and a half.
[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:08.700]   But they don't have an obvious next big franchise on the horizon.
[00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:10.140]   And so that is the problem.
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:11.220]   We thought it was going to be cars, right?
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:14.580]   But then they've really scaled back that initiative and doesn't look like it's going
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:15.580]   to be that.
[00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:16.580]   Pawnometric reality.
[00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:17.580]   The TV, they gave up on TV.
[00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:21.020]   But what they do with augmented reality is still really unclear.
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:24.500]   Well, and they've got some stiff competition from Google, which has a big investment in
[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.500]   Magic League, from Facebook with Oculus.
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:29.420]   Microsoft's maybe in HTC.
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.100]   Oh, that's everybody, right?
[00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:35.420]   Well, I mean, and the lines between VR and AR definitely become blurry and a lot of,
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:38.860]   you know, stuff that supplies to VR ends up being extensible to AR.
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:40.420]   The point is, is that Apple's only problem?
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:41.420]   They can't find a successor?
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:45.780]   I think that is really the ultimate challenge for them is that there is no obvious driver
[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:47.060]   of growth on the horizon.
[00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:53.540]   However, Peter, that while that's true, the inability to execute as you previously executed
[00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:58.620]   so consistently, where every phone, every laptop was an aha moment.
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:03.220]   Now the fan base that would literally give a standing ovation to anything Steve would
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.620]   hold up is complaining vocally.
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:06.620]   They're both cool.
[00:40:06.620 --> 00:40:11.700]   But what I'm saying to me is the big red flag and it happened at this MacBook announcement
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:12.700]   was the tipping point.
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.020]   But you and I aren't disagreeing really.
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:18.940]   I'm just saying that like Tim Cook made a very, I don't want to say cynical, but maybe a
[00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:20.940]   very coldly decision.
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:25.100]   Now, I don't necessarily agree with it, but I think that he made a decision that he thought
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:28.700]   was in the best interest of the company, which is essentially say, best interest of Wall
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:29.700]   Street.
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:30.700]   But they're kind of like two different problems.
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:34.340]   I mean, coming up with the next iPhone, who knows if there's anybody on the planet who
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.180]   knows what that is today.
[00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:41.220]   Coming up with new MacBooks that every MacBook fan would like, that seems like a lot easier
[00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:42.220]   to do.
[00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:43.220]   It's easier to do.
[00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:44.220]   But that was so hard.
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:49.140]   But I guess, but I'm saying if you run the numbers, it may be that the difference between
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:52.860]   it doesn't, it's ends up not being like necessarily like a meaningful number in terms of.
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:53.860]   From a business point of view.
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:41:00.660]   Yeah, but you know what Steve's Steve's definition was you paint the back of the fence that nobody
[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:03.620]   ever sees as good as you paint the front of the fence.
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:07.660]   And somehow Tim Cook didn't get the message that craftsmanship matters on all fronts.
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:11.540]   Well, when you see an entrepreneur who dresses up in a like a black turtleneck because they
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:14.700]   think that's the way to emulate Steve Jobs, it kind of seems like that's going on with
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:15.860]   the simplification now.
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:20.020]   So, you know, Apple famously had the mouse that only had one button and they took out
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:21.020]   the hard drives.
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.300]   There were all these kind of things that proved that they worked.
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.980]   Now it seems like let's take out the headphone jack.
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:27.420]   Let's let's take out the random.
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:28.660]   You know, let's take up MagSafe.
[00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:30.580]   It seems like now it's a money grant.
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:33.100]   It's an imitation of the correct simplifications.
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.660]   It's like putting on the turtleneck.
[00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:37.340]   It's like it's like imitating the wrong thing.
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:42.900]   Now what about Microsoft because at the same time as Apple's making these lackluster improvements,
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:46.940]   Microsoft stepping forward and saying we want you the creative professional to come over
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:47.940]   here.
[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:51.100]   Microsoft kicked Apple's, can I say that word?
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:52.100]   Yes.
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:56.620]   As, wildly this week, not only did they release the surface, was it studio?
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:57.620]   Yeah.
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:00.340]   Which to me, you look at it and you're like, I want one.
[00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:03.820]   I want one badly and I haven't used a Windows computer in a decade.
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:09.620]   And then as the side dish, they launched their Slack competitor in the same week.
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:15.100]   Yeah, this new team seems like these guys are firing on all cylinders.
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:17.860]   You think teams is a strong offering?
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:22.260]   Listen, the fact that they were able to put together something so quickly to challenge
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:23.780]   a nascent company like Slack.
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:26.060]   What did you think of Slack's full page?
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:27.060]   That was not a thousand.
[00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:28.060]   That's bad.
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:30.780]   Somebody's got to talk to, I'll talk to Stuart about that.
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:31.780]   That was silly too.
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:36.580]   But anyway, the point is, the situation is that when IBM came out with a PC, remember
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:37.580]   Apple?
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:39.340]   Welcome IBM seriously.
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:40.340]   That was a mistake too.
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:42.620]   Microsoft had the opportunity to buy Slack.
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:49.860]   They looked at it and there was a team that was very strongly opposed to buying Slack internally.
[00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:51.860]   They already bought Eammer.
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:52.860]   Well, they'd already hit Eammer.
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:53.860]   And Groove.
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:54.860]   Remember Groove?
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:55.860]   And Skype.
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:56.860]   They have a messaging platform with Skype.
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:57.860]   Remember Groove?
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:01.220]   I mean, they had the guy who invented Lotus Notes come to build another group thing at
[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:02.220]   Microsoft.
[00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:03.220]   They've done it a few times.
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:05.860]   It's a good sign for Microsoft that they didn't feel the need to buy it because what it said
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:09.100]   was, "The people internally here know what they're doing.
[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:10.780]   We've examined Slack.
[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:12.260]   We have our own take on it.
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:14.660]   We have an office franchise and Outlook.
[00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:18.220]   We made Outlook the number one email client across all these different platforms including
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:19.740]   it's the best one on iOS.
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:20.740]   That was an acquisition.
[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:21.740]   Right?
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:22.740]   A good one.
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:24.940]   But they are firing on all cylinders at Microsoft.
[00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:29.820]   I think that you give up the desktop, you know, that's where the power uses are.
[00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:32.060]   That's where the people who make the content in the world are.
[00:43:32.060 --> 00:43:37.860]   If they start losing Mac video editors and Mac artists to this new surface thing, that
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:38.860]   is horrible for Apple.
[00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:39.860]   Where do they go?
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:40.860]   They go to Windows.
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:41.860]   They go to Microsoft.
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:42.860]   Well, find out.
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:43.620]   I mean, it depends on how...
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.060]   This thing is drill worthy.
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:48.220]   Is it actually efficient and does it make you more productive?
[00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:49.220]   Right?
[00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:50.500]   Can you make better art with it?
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:51.500]   That's the question I have.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:52.780]   It's certainly drill worthy.
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:53.780]   Yeah.
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:54.780]   Yeah.
[00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:59.100]   I mean, I think from Microsoft, I would argue that it's less about stealing market share
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:07.100]   from Apple and more about grabbing a bigger share of the Windows PC market as it declines.
[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:08.100]   It makes a lot of sense.
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:09.100]   This is a dying market.
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.140]   It's a dying market and Microsoft can take a big slice of it.
[00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:12.140]   It's got a floor, though.
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.140]   It's got a floor.
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:14.140]   I do agree.
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:15.140]   No, absolutely it has a floor.
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:16.140]   We're all going to need...
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:17.140]   Somebody's going to need trucks.
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:18.140]   There will be a truck business.
[00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:19.140]   Yeah.
[00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:22.140]   I mean, this idea that like people are going to go to work and put on HoloLens and they're
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:24.020]   all going to be like looking at their desktop up here.
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:28.220]   I mean, I'm sure we'll do respect to Robert, he's a friend of ours, but like, that's 10
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:29.220]   years out.
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:33.700]   And the idea that you're going to just talk to your Amazon and be like, Alexa, write a
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:37.060]   couple of emails today to my investments to tell them that they're doing a great job
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:38.660]   and AI just magically does it.
[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:40.620]   That's 20 years out.
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:45.260]   Like we need a computer today to write, to create videos, to do spreadsheets, to do
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:46.500]   all the stuff that's important.
[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:47.500]   And making...
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:48.500]   I see these kids come out.
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.340]   They're doing their power points on their phone.
[00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:51.340]   And I'm like...
[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:52.340]   It's just painful.
[00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:53.340]   Come on.
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:54.340]   You look like an idiot.
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:55.340]   But the power point looks ridiculous.
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:56.340]   Isn't it possible...
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:58.140]   You're getting a phone call while you're doing a power point.
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:00.900]   Regardless of the device or the apps, I think it's about services now.
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:03.300]   And Apple and Microsoft are both trying to get in.
[00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.300]   And by the way, they're only trying to get into services.
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:06.780]   Both doing very well in service.
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:09.580]   So they want you to use them instead of Dropbox.
[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:11.780]   They want you to use all that kind of stuff.
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:15.980]   I mean, they want you to have your identity, your cloud, your storage, all that kind of
[00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:16.980]   stuff.
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:21.340]   I mean, clearly Microsoft, Apple, they want to own all that, whatever device it is.
[00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:22.340]   Yeah.
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:23.340]   Apple got that right.
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:24.740]   I mean, Apple's on a $25 billion run right now.
[00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:26.300]   They did $6 billion, I think.
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.020]   And this past quarter in services.
[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:29.020]   But you know what?
[00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:30.180]   The services are really clunky.
[00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:31.180]   Like if I asked everybody to listen in...
[00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:32.180]   It's a terrible product.
[00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:33.180]   Well, it's a terrible product.
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:37.620]   Like iCloud, i-Music, and then...
[00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.740]   So they have iCloud Music.
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:41.740]   What else can you give them?
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:42.820]   Serious service.
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:44.500]   Monthly money to them for...
[00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:47.900]   But anyway, what I think they should do is they should do an Amazon Prime from Apple.
[00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:48.900]   Oh, Apple Care.
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:49.900]   And Apple Care.
[00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:50.900]   And Apple stores.
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:51.900]   App Care is the big one.
[00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:52.900]   So they have three...
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:53.900]   They have 30% of every app sold.
[00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:54.900]   Right.
[00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:55.900]   But they have three things that you subscribe to from them.
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:46:00.180]   iCloud, services, what do they call...
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:01.180]   What's the thing with you?
[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:02.180]   Break your phone.
[00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:03.180]   They fix it.
[00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:04.180]   Apple Care.
[00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:05.180]   Apple Care, iCloud, and i-Music.
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:08.940]   If you put those three things together for $15, $20 a month, every...
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:10.740]   Like maybe a third of Apple users would do it.
[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:12.620]   They would have 250 million people subscribing.
[00:46:12.620 --> 00:46:15.460]   That's what they need to do because right now this is cognitive dissonance.
[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:16.460]   Should I buy iCloud or not?
[00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:18.340]   Should I buy music or not?
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:21.100]   They should do an Amazon, they would prime, which is like, you already have it.
[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:22.260]   It's in there already.
[00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:23.260]   And that would make them enough money.
[00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:25.420]   Amazon's got a good strategy, don't they, with a prime?
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:26.420]   70 million people.
[00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:27.420]   It's 70 million people.
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:30.540]   I think it's bigger than 70 million now.
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:31.540]   70.
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:33.020]   This is like 68 right now.
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:36.140]   They don't release the number actually, but somebody figured out a really cool thing.
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:37.940]   They called up all these...
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:42.060]   They did a bunch of phone dialing by state and said, "Have you ever shopped on Amazon?
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.060]   Do you have prime?"
[00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:45.740]   And they figured out statistically how prime membership has been going.
[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:48.220]   But think about 70 million people paying 100 a year.
[00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:50.500]   This is a big business.
[00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:54.660]   What they say is they make it financially irresponsible for you to not have a prime account.
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:58.180]   And you make a really good point by bundling everything in under that one umbrella.
[00:46:58.180 --> 00:46:59.180]   It's a simple decision.
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:01.700]   It's one decision and you keep getting benefits added to it.
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:02.700]   And it's sticky.
[00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:03.700]   Yeah, it's very sticky.
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:06.500]   And we're going to leave the ecosystem and have a terabyte of my photos up there.
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:09.020]   It's sticky in a different way that Apple makes things sticky.
[00:47:09.020 --> 00:47:10.020]   Apple locks you in.
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:11.020]   Yeah.
[00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:12.020]   They figured out how hard it went.
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:13.340]   Amazon incense you to stick around.
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:15.460]   They figured out hardware.
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:16.660]   Now they're figuring out services.
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:18.180]   They still socket software.
[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:19.900]   They're kind of like two-thirds of the way there.
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:26.100]   It would be that really incredible move would be to put music and buy Netflix or Hulu and
[00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:28.220]   buy one of those services and bundle it as well.
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:31.220]   So when you buy a phone or you buy an iPad, it just comes to that.
[00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:32.220]   But there...
[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:33.220]   I don't...
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:36.860]   We have to talk about when is Tim Cook getting out of that chair?
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:38.300]   Because he is killing this company.
[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:41.900]   I mean, I know they have a ton of money, but he has to get out.
[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:43.700]   Because Johnny I have phoned it in.
[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:44.700]   Bores not going to push him.
[00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:48.420]   He'd have to have like two really bad quarters more than that.
[00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:51.020]   They're selling less iPhones now than they ever did.
[00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:52.020]   But everybody had their own purchases.
[00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:53.900]   But the smartphone market is peaking.
[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:54.900]   So that's not just Apple.
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:55.900]   That's not his fault.
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:48:00.620]   There's tons of reasons of why you might defend him while the cash in the bank.
[00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:01.860]   You know, the iPhone franchise.
[00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:02.860]   But you know what?
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:06.020]   We're starting to see the actual fans turn on.
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:07.940]   But what do you think would drive?
[00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:10.500]   I'm not sure that the fans are a uniformly...
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:11.500]   A small group.
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:12.500]   A small group.
[00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:13.980]   I think there's a small vocal group.
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:19.540]   Those folks were cult members who are now leaving Scientology.
[00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:21.740]   They're leaving a cult.
[00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:23.860]   And I think Apple would say we don't need them.
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:24.860]   It's a small number of people.
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:25.860]   Yeah, let's see what happens.
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:26.860]   How important is this?
[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:27.860]   Lose your base.
[00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:28.860]   Is it your base?
[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:29.860]   Your base isn't...
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:30.860]   But the point is...
[00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:31.860]   But the point is, why is this?
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:32.860]   Because why is this?
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:33.860]   Because why is this?

[01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:06.860]   Because it is a real concern for them.
[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:08.860]   You know, maybe this is more
[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:12.860]   suiting for our Android show, but as long as I got you here, Peter, I'm going to ask you.
[01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:13.860]   Okay.
[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:15.860]   Because you use a Pixel.
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:17.860]   What the hell is wrong with Google?
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:21.860]   The messaging platform is insane.
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:30.860]   They have Hangouts, they have Messaging, they have Aloe, they also allow an Android, Microsoft
[01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:35.860]   Messenger to be your SMS Messenger, WhatsApp to be your SMS Messenger.
[01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:38.860]   Google does not in fact offer an SMS Messenger.
[01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:40.860]   They don't say this is the one.
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:44.860]   And now they have this RCS, this, what is it?
[01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:46.860]   RCS is not going to solve the problems, but.
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:52.860]   They bought a company, a jibe to create rich communications systems to replace SMS.
[01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:55.860]   They were hoping all the carriers would go along with it.
[01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:56.860]   Currently--
[01:08:56.860 --> 01:08:57.860]   It's five years too late.
[01:08:57.860 --> 01:09:02.860]   They were doing it, but AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, they said, "Well, we're not going to standardize
[01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:03.860]   our SMS platform.
[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:05.860]   We have to have value added."
[01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:11.860]   So you know that that was actually the one plan that Blackberry Winterskill called RIM had?
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:12.860]   It was the--
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:13.860]   They had two--
[01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:15.860]   It wasn't RCS, but it was--
[01:09:15.860 --> 01:09:16.860]   There were two different--
[01:09:16.860 --> 01:09:20.860]   There was a little bit of a tangent, but there were two co-CEOs, right?
[01:09:20.860 --> 01:09:24.860]   And so one of them wanted to like double down, take on the iPhone hardware.
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:28.860]   And the other said, "You know what, BBM is actually a sleeping giant at this company.
[01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:29.860]   It's got a ton of users.
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:33.860]   He had a plan where he was going to go to all the mobile carriers and say, "Replace SMS
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:36.860]   with our-- with BBM on the back end," which was already basically--
[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:38.860]   Would have been really, really easy, actually.
[01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:39.860]   And you can reduce the cost of--
[01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:40.860]   It's data.
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:41.860]   It's not SMS.
[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:47.860]   You can reduce the cost of delivering messages, and you can have a much richer experience, and you can still charge for it.
[01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:53.860]   And he got a bunch of carriers to actually basically sign onto it, and then the RIM board, which now--
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:56.860]   I think they changed the name to Blackberry afterwards, said, "No, we don't want to do that."
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:10:00.860]   And the guy quit, he quit the company the next day and sold all the stock.
[01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:01.860]   Rightly so.
[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:02.860]   He knew he got out.
[01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:03.860]   Why does an Apple open up iMessage?
[01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:06.860]   There has been a reason why that thing happened.
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:07.860]   Yeah, I don't buy it.
[01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:09.860]   I can't see why they would.
[01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:11.860]   You know, I don't think they need to.
[01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:14.860]   I don't think this is necessarily a compelling reason to do so, but--
[01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:15.860]   Consumers would like it.
[01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:17.860]   Consumers would really, really like it.
[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:20.860]   But we need RCS or something like it.
[01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:31.860]   We need a standard that's a cross-platform standard, Apple and Android, that goes across carriers, because otherwise people use WhatsApp, and then I have to convince you--
[01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:34.860]   But there's a whole roll of icons for messaging apps.
[01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:37.860]   But you know, if you're a messaging app, you like the silo.
[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:38.860]   It's terrible for the consumer, though.
[01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:39.860]   Well, of course it is.
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:45.860]   But what are the best things that being an iPhone and Mac user is having your iMessage, so you've done both seamlessly.
[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:46.860]   I mean, that's just a great experience.
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:49.860]   So don't ever talk to anybody on Android, because we're just green bubbles.
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:51.860]   Well, I live in San Francisco.
[01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:52.860]   It is crazy.
[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:53.860]   That's why.
[01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:55.860]   And you think Android didn't exist if you live in San Francisco.
[01:10:55.860 --> 01:11:01.860]   Yeah, but that's why I think Apple will never do messages for Android, because it's an amazing lock-in.
[01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:03.860]   I look at my son is in a frat, okay?
[01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:07.860]   There's one guy in his whole frat that has an Android phone.
[01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:13.860]   Everybody has iPhones, and one of the main reasons is because the messaging, they can do group messaging.
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:19.860]   And if you're not on an iPhone, you don't get invited to any of the parties, because you're not on the group message.
[01:11:19.860 --> 01:11:20.860]   You're a green bubble.
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:23.860]   My favorite thing to do is to change the title of the group messaging.
[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:25.860]   People don't know how you can do that now.
[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:29.860]   So we have one for the poker group, and then I just change it to like, film--
[01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:30.860]   Trump supporters.
[01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:34.860]   No, I'm just like, "Fill hell me, you've lost a Tesla last night."
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:36.860]   And then that's the new subject line for the group.
[01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:37.860]   That's--
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:38.860]   That's--
[01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:43.860]   But we had this battle like 15 years ago around instant messaging, right, where there was--
[01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:44.860]   Right.
[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:45.860]   --MSN, there was just a few--
[01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:46.860]   Yahoo, there was a dream--
[01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:47.860]   Trillion?
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:48.860]   Yeah.
[01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:49.860]   --which was the one that really--
[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:54.860]   Trillion solved it, because it was Trillion and then there was plugins for every game or pigeon, and then there was even an alliance.
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:56.860]   Microsoft and Yahoo were--
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:58.860]   Trillion had some sort of inter-op--
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:11:59.860]   Yahoo and Amazon inter-op.
[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:00.860]   --and ICQ.
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:03.860]   Yeah, they realized that the silo was good, and they didn't want it around.
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:04.860]   Exactly.
[01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:05.860]   But you know what?
[01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:07.860]   It actually ended up really hurting.
[01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:14.860]   If you look at the internet, sort of writ large, messaging should be a completely open platform just like email.
[01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:15.860]   Should we ever email?
[01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:16.860]   It's too email-federated.
[01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:17.860]   Email was in the same position.
[01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:19.860]   There was Gini MCI, CompuServe.
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:21.860]   They couldn't talk to each other.
[01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:25.860]   AOL, eventually they federated so you could send an email from any service to any service.
[01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:29.860]   And people forget, but SMS actually was carrier siloed in the US.
[01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:30.860]   That's right.
[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:33.860]   It kept it from taking off in the US, you took off in the rest of the world.
[01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:34.860]   Yeah.
[01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:35.860]   Because of the silos.
[01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:36.860]   You know, it goes even beyond that.
[01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:39.860]   I'm not going to think about this on the radio show.
[01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:43.860]   Blu-ray, HD DVD didn't take off until one or the other.
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:49.860]   HD DVD or Blu-ray won because consumers were going to invest in the platform if there was this inconsistency.
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:53.860]   You need to have a unified platform for consumer confidence, if nothing else.
[01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:59.860]   But the thing about how huge messaging apps are right now, if you're a Facebook messenger,
[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:00.860]   why would you interop?
[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:02.860]   Because you already have 700 million users.
[01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:05.860]   And what they do now on Android is they can be the SM.
[01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:07.860]   They put a lot of pressure on you when you first run it.
[01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:09.860]   They say, "Don't you want us to be your SMS platform?"
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:14.860]   And then if you say yes, which is kind of the tempting thing to do, now all my messages come in a messenger.
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:15.860]   I live in messenger.
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:17.860]   Facebook hasn't even interop what's happened.
[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:18.860]   Facebook messenger.
[01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:19.860]   That's only by the same company.
[01:13:19.860 --> 01:13:21.860]   They don't even interrupt their own product.
[01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:22.860]   They don't want to.
[01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:23.860]   Facebook's horrible.
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:28.860]   So every morning you have to check your email, you have to check your Slack, you have to check your iMessages,
[01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:33.860]   you have to check your email.
[01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:36.860]   You have to check your email.

[01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:46.860]   If you opt in to see the ads, then the site
[01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:51.860]   donates that money to you, the charity of your choice, or you if you want.
[01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:53.860]   I've seen a bunch of the stuff.
[01:25:53.860 --> 01:25:56.860]   I think the challenge is always about how do you integrate this into the mobile view.
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:57.860]   Yeah, mobile is everything.
[01:25:57.860 --> 01:25:58.860]   Which is really hard.
[01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:01.860]   Ironically, that's where you need that blocker the most.
[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:05.860]   Samsung's decided the best way to handle the galaxy.
[01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:09.860]   They say the good news is that returns have been good in the US.
[01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:13.860]   This is shut up, seeing it.
[01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:14.860]   This is not.
[01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:16.860]   Why auto start video?
[01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:17.860]   Why?
[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:18.860]   Desperate.
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:19.860]   It's got to be paid.
[01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:20.860]   That is a fine.
[01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:21.860]   That's thirsty.
[01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:22.860]   That.
[01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:23.860]   Launch it without sound.
[01:26:23.860 --> 01:26:24.860]   Same difference.
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:26.860]   Put some subs on that.
[01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:35.860]   Samsung has said that 85% of US owners of Note 7s have returned them, but that's still 15% in the wild.
[01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:42.860]   It's more worldwide, so they have started updates now that will keep your phone from charging past 60%.
[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:50.860]   You'll get a pop-up notification every time you charge, reboot, or turn off the screen saying you really should be turning this in.
[01:26:50.860 --> 01:26:52.860]   I think they're making it more attractive not to give it back.
[01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:53.860]   I know.
[01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:54.860]   I want to be an outlaw now.
[01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:55.860]   I'm the outlaw.
[01:26:55.860 --> 01:26:56.860]   I have a Note 7.
[01:26:56.860 --> 01:27:02.860]   If you've flown lately, this has got to be a brand's worst nightmare.
[01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:04.860]   Four or five times during the flight.
[01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:10.860]   At the beginning of the flight, when you're checking in, they say if you have a Samsung and they don't know what it is, Galaxy 7.
[01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:12.860]   I've seen it called Note.
[01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:16.860]   I was on two flights in both flights in a row.
[01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:18.860]   They said Galaxy Notebook 7.
[01:27:18.860 --> 01:27:19.860]   Yeah.
[01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:20.860]   They don't know what it is.
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:21.860]   They don't know what it is.
[01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:22.860]   If you have that, it's illegal.
[01:27:22.860 --> 01:27:23.860]   Give it to me now.
[01:27:23.860 --> 01:27:30.860]   They actually said, yeah, if you have one, please pull your, you know, whatever the thing and tell us so we can get it off.
[01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:31.860]   I can't believe it.
[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:32.860]   Black Mirror episode.
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:34.860]   I can't think of a worst brand nightmare.
[01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:35.860]   Right?
[01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:36.860]   I mean, that's got to, there's nothing worse than that.
[01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:37.860]   Mmm.
[01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:39.860]   Wasn't there a Toyota where the brakes didn't work?
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:41.860]   Yeah, but it didn't get announced on every flight.
[01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:42.860]   The time and all were there where they were.
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:43.860]   Yeah, but it didn't get enough.
[01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:44.860]   That was pretty bad.
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:49.860]   If you got on a flight and they said, if you're holding time and all, please ring your buzzer and let us know.
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:50.860]   Yes.
[01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:51.860]   It's the, no, it's bad.
[01:27:51.860 --> 01:27:52.860]   It's definitely bad.
[01:27:52.860 --> 01:27:53.860]   It's bad.
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:54.860]   It's definitely bad.
[01:27:54.860 --> 01:27:55.860]   It's definitely bad.
[01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:57.860]   And the thing about it is now with the washing machines they just recalled.
[01:27:57.860 --> 01:27:58.860]   Yeah.
[01:27:58.860 --> 01:27:59.860]   They have top loading washers.
[01:27:59.860 --> 01:28:04.700]   It turns out that somebody's jog got broken because the top, the machine popped open.
[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:06.220]   I have a Samsung washing machine.
[01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:07.220]   I stand behind it.
[01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:08.220]   I love it, but it's not.
[01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:09.220]   It's a front loader.
[01:28:09.220 --> 01:28:10.220]   So I don't want to.
[01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:11.220]   Don't stand behind it because your jog might get broken behind it.
[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:12.220]   I'll stand it.
[01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:13.220]   I'll stand it.
[01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:14.220]   Or maybe I'll stand it.
[01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:15.220]   Stand far away from it.
[01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:16.220]   Stand aside from it.
[01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:17.220]   You can stand aside from it.
[01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:18.220]   Yeah.
[01:28:18.220 --> 01:28:19.220]   I've had several fine Samsung products.
[01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:20.220]   I know it's a TV.
[01:28:20.220 --> 01:28:21.220]   None of them.
[01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:22.220]   This was their best phone ever, right?
[01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:23.220]   It was the great phone.
[01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:25.220]   Was it the best smartphone ever made up to that point?
[01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:26.220]   That's what people were saying.
[01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:31.220]   That was one of the best smartphones ever made up to the battery.
[01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:32.220]   Who made the battery?
[01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:33.220]   Is it a Samsung battery?
[01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:36.500]   No, if that's not the issue, the issue is it's too much battery for the size of the
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:37.500]   case.
[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:38.500]   That was the problem.
[01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:40.740]   In other words, they're jamming too much in that case.
[01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:41.740]   They went for it.
[01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:43.060]   They jumped the fence.
[01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:49.020]   The lithium ion was, I can't remember the word, it was coating the outside of the battery,
[01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:51.020]   short-circging and a short-circging battery.
[01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:52.740]   Imagine that was an electric vehicle.
[01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:53.740]   That would be bad.
[01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:54.740]   Just happened.
[01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:55.740]   What?
[01:28:55.740 --> 01:28:57.740]   Tesla, bad news.
[01:28:57.740 --> 01:28:58.740]   One singular Tesla?
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:28:59.740]   One.
[01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:00.740]   Okay, that's fine.
[01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:03.340]   I mean, you're riding though on three gallons of gasoline.
[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:06.460]   Yeah, no, I mean, just if you have like one offs and no big deal.
[01:29:06.460 --> 01:29:09.220]   There's a manufacturing defect, people expect that to happen at some point.
[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:12.820]   In fact, now that Tesla's working with Panasonic, I think those batteries are getting much, much
[01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:18.700]   cheaper and even better, too dead after a fiery crash, a fiery crash of a Tesla.
[01:29:18.700 --> 01:29:19.700]   Oh, after a fatal accident.
[01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:21.500]   Oh, well, of course, if you get a crash.
[01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:22.500]   Yeah, what do you expect?
[01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:23.500]   I mean, you get a gas.
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:25.860]   A tank of gas, you wouldn't make a news story about that.
[01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:29.020]   There's a thousand videos a week posted with a gas tank blowing up.
[01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:32.860]   New Zealand carriers will cut off access to the Note 7 starting November 18th.
[01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:34.820]   You would just won't even be able to use it.
[01:29:34.820 --> 01:29:37.580]   Well, how do they know?
[01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:38.580]   They know.
[01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:39.580]   They'll rebound.
[01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:40.580]   They'll rebound.
[01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:41.580]   They're going to check your phone calls.
[01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:42.580]   They'll rebound.
[01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:43.580]   Will they rebound?
[01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:44.580]   For sure.
[01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:45.580]   Samsung will rebound.
[01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:46.580]   For sure.
[01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:47.580]   100% will.
[01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:48.580]   We're ready for them to rebound.
[01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:49.580]   Listen, though, just take a charge, $3 or $4 billion.
[01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:50.580]   They take a charge.
[01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:52.540]   It gets to take off the balance sheet.
[01:29:52.540 --> 01:29:53.940]   Every group, they come back next year.
[01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:55.100]   But the brand damage that's...
[01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:56.100]   No, it'll be fine.
[01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:57.100]   It'll go away.
[01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:58.100]   It'll be fine.
[01:29:58.100 --> 01:29:59.100]   People have short memories.
[01:29:59.100 --> 01:30:00.100]   Yeah, I mean, if there's like...
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:01.100]   That was the...
[01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:02.100]   That was the...
[01:30:02.100 --> 01:30:03.100]   This is the nine.
[01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:05.180]   Standards have been lowered across the bar.
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:07.180]   It's good for Trump is good for America.
[01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:11.340]   Well, what's the place that makes burritos that are...
[01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:12.340]   Chipotle.
[01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:13.340]   Yeah, Chipotle.
[01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:14.340]   Like, they're filled with bacteria.
[01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:16.140]   I'm not going there.
[01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:17.140]   Did they...
[01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:18.140]   See?
[01:30:18.140 --> 01:30:22.020]   I still won't go to Jack in the box five years after E. Cola I break up.
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:23.020]   It was 20 years.
[01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:24.020]   20 years.
[01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:25.020]   Yeah.
[01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:27.020]   So, well, I'm just saying...
[01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:28.020]   Well, I just wanted to thank the studio...
[01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:30.020]   I just wanted to let the studio audience know.
[01:30:30.020 --> 01:30:31.020]   We're all going to Chipotle after the end.
[01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:32.020]   We got coupons.
[01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:34.700]   We got $3.00 in a set off.
[01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:35.700]   Let's take a break.
[01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:39.700]   I just want to check and make sure that either Chipotle or Jack in the box is an advertiser
[01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:40.700]   on today's show.
[01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:41.700]   Oh boy.
[01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:42.700]   If...
[01:30:42.700 --> 01:30:45.820]   Before we do that, if you have seen today's show, you probably have some idea of what
[01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:46.820]   we do here on Twitter.
[01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:48.340]   But we've made it a little easier for you.
[01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:49.500]   We've got a little...
[01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:50.500]   Little video introduction.
[01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:51.500]   Sizzle.
[01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:55.540]   Oh, a sizzle reel of all the great things that happened this week on Twitter.
[01:30:55.540 --> 01:30:56.540]   Previously.
[01:30:56.540 --> 01:30:57.540]   On Twitter.
[01:30:57.540 --> 01:30:58.540]   It's...
[01:30:58.540 --> 01:30:59.540]   Maybe you didn't notice.
[01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:01.300]   We've taken app caps to a whole new level.
[01:31:01.300 --> 01:31:03.820]   This staff takes this holiday very, very seriously.
[01:31:03.820 --> 01:31:06.060]   I've noticed this around businesses now.
[01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:07.820]   Everybody wears Halloween costumes.
[01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:12.100]   It's time for the Twitter Halloween fashion show.
[01:31:12.100 --> 01:31:13.620]   He's got dead fish in his pocket.
[01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:14.620]   Oh no!
[01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:15.620]   It's so...
[01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:16.620]   I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm
