[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.120]   as always with our panel it's so much fun to get friends together to talk about tech news. Old
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.920]   friends Clayton Morris here from Fox and Friends and tech journalist for years. Hi Clayton great to
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.560]   see you. We haven't seen you a long time. You had a baby since I saw you last. Yeah I had a baby
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:40.800]   had a food baby. What is that coming out of your ear? I tried tonight instead of wearing the giant
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.320]   cans which you know when you're doing when you're doing Twet it's three hours long. It's hot. It's
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.520]   sweeter your sweetness. So I put on the air pods tonight. Are they working? They work great?
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.640]   Yeah I'll have to start work great. So you're not using it for the mic. Just for the no no no. So I've
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.080]   got my my road my road podcaster mic but then I just just to hear just to hear the uh hear the crew
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:08.400]   there. So nice. Yeah. Also with the dean of Mac journalism, Philip Elmer Dewitt he is was he's
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.640]   also wearing him and he's and he's dressed for the occasion because he is in the the snowy north.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.400]   You're in New England. This is this is what we wear in western mass so that people don't know that
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.280]   we're using uh air pods. He's wearing his own. So I'm able to see you talking yourself as you're
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.440]   walking on the street. Elmer Fudd Hat. Yeah. Paul Allen was wearing his Elmer Fudd Hat. I don't
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.120]   know if you saw it on the Seahawks game yesterday. Paul Allen was one of the founders of uh Microsoft
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:46.800]   was caught on camera during the game wearing an Elmer Fudd Hat and sitting behind a Lenovo think
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.520]   pad. So I don't know how the NFL feels but I'm guessing the NFL doesn't mind if the owners don't
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.680]   use Surface Pro. How is that an Elmer Fudd Hat? This is not this is an earlier game. I can't find the
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.440]   the game from the last time. It's the ear flaps right? That's what yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well and all of
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.640]   the announcers whether it was on Fox or CBS they could never I think was it famously we're during
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.720]   one of the playoff game. All my kids right. They call him iPads. Yeah. Actually no last year during
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.360]   maybe it was during the Super Bowl or it was during one of the uh championship games.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:27.200]   The Surface is broke down remember right on the sidelines and that was like the first time that
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.040]   the announcers got it right. They said oh yes their surface like yourself was hoping they'd say iPads.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.680]   Right. That's the one time they nailed it. Here's a here's a picture from last night of uh of Paul
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.960]   Allen and he's still got his think pad and he uh I don't know what he was so concerned about
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.320]   because it looked like uh there we go. How'd I put my Elmer Fudd Hat on now too. There you go. So we're
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.560]   evaluated. They won't they won't mistake you for a deer uh with that on. I have to apologize. We
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.480]   wanted to have Cara Swisher on the phone um uh from recode. She's been really writing some
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.720]   interesting stuff about the transition about the tech execs going to meet Donald Trump in the
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.880]   Trump Tower and so forth. Some very I think a Serbik stuff uh and but we couldn't get her on
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:21.600]   because of the flooding in Northern California. Her cable internet is out. So she's trying to get
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.040]   she's on the phone with Comcast hoping she can get on the show. That is the biggest joke of the day
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:33.120]   because as we all know that's an hour two hours three hours that could be forever. So we'll reschedule
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.600]   get care on but we did before the show we talked to her uh via phone and you'll see why we aren't
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.440]   gonna have her on the show but I thought we just dropped this phone call in because I did thank her.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.840]   Yeah we might as well keep the hat on Phil. I did thank her for what she's been writing uh lately
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:52.320]   in recode and this is what she had to say. You have been doing your writing uh it's been so awesome Cara
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:59.120]   of late. Thank you. You've just thank you. You've you've you've you've freed of the chains of uh corporate
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.080]   which is ironic because you're worked for AOL but you've been freed of the chains. No I never I never
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:11.920]   worked for AOL. No who owns recode now? Fox uh box media. So Fox is not AOL. Fox Fox isn't saying
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:17.040]   anything. They're letting you do whatever you want. Well don't do everybody else. I just I think
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.520]   this particular no one ever really told me what to do. I think you're inspired. You're inspired.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.160]   Yeah that's what it is. Yeah that's different. Yeah yeah no one has ever won. Of course won't
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:32.160]   be what to do but um I think it's just a really important time and texting so ridiculously um
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:38.560]   silent about what's happening and it's irritating after all these years have to listen to them.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:44.640]   The amor on about their independence and innovation and how they disrupt everything and then they
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.360]   sit here quietly. Well things that are supposed to be near and dear to their core values are being
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:56.240]   attacked and not saying anything and trying to be practical and so on some level you get the
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.320]   sense that they happen to like the power and they happen to like the money and they happen to like
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:05.760]   their status and don't want to speak up for core values of what Silicon Valley represents.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:11.440]   So that's all. Do you like the tax books? Yeah they like the tax. They like everything else.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.240]   And so employees feel this way. I get calls from my most just a big company last week and
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:22.240]   you know we're pretty high ranking executive under one of the executives who went to the
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.680]   Trump meeting that took place with Trump and Tech leaders literally thanked me said we are
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.680]   very upset that they're not sticking up for what we think is important and this was someone
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.640]   not far from the top. Do you think they struggled? Do you think people like Tim Cook struggle
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.480]   with this because at the same time they feel some fiduciary responsibility as a CEO of publicly
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:48.080]   held companies? Sure but they could say that. The issue is that it doesn't matter they're not
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.640]   going to escape scrutiny if this guy decides to want to tweet about one of them. You know what I mean?
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:59.200]   Like what happened to the Boeing executive. So I think he didn't feel that way about the
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:05.120]   encryption. He certainly stood up for what I think was a really wrongly thing. So he seems to have
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:12.080]   a voice and they certainly stand up for the gay issue in Indiana. They stand up for a lot of things
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:17.280]   but in this case you know they feel I don't know why they can't just make normal statements of
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:22.480]   and it doesn't mean to be opposed. They don't have to be. They don't have to say I hate you.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:29.680]   They can engage like Tim has said to his staff. By the way Tim Cook is the only executive who
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:36.000]   went to that meeting who actually made a statement to his staff about it or in any way that could
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.440]   become public which was astonishing because as you know these people never stop wanting to talk
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:47.040]   or say things and suddenly they are rendered silent before and after the meeting and I found
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:52.560]   that fascinating because again as you know they never stop talking and never stop yammering your
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:58.720]   year off about their values. So you know I think yes sure he has fiduciary duties but it doesn't
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:05.600]   mean he can't say we think immigration is important. We think you know fair immigration is important.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:11.360]   We think diversity is important. We think a lot of things are important that you would set
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.640]   things about that disturb us. There's nothing wrong with that. So sorry I'll get up my soap off.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:22.000]   So Cara thank you and we'll get you on as soon as she's now traveling she's going to Germany and
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.720]   then DC so I don't know when we're going to get a background and we'll get around it again as soon
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.680]   as possible. Cara is always a welcome member of the panel and I don't know if she has an
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.560]   Elmer Fudd hat but if she does yours is authentic I have to say Philip that looks like it's an
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.800]   aviator hat actually. I got it for Christmas. Oh I have one of those two. I think every time
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.680]   we're on we end up doing some sort of a costume. It was the last time I was on. We were nude at
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:49.040]   some point. Yeah that actually made it to the best of. We played that last week the best of
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:56.960]   with you in the in the chewy mask. That dates it by the way because that was when that viral video
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.760]   was all the rage. Right. Those things don't have to have the shelf life of fish.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:12.000]   Anyway what were we talking about? Oh see yes so this is the day CES ends in Las Vegas
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.840]   and you asked the most important question Clayton. No I think Philip. Philip you asked the most
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.440]   important question. Yeah I think so yeah. How many of us went to CES?
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:30.800]   Zip. You heard crickets. Nothing. Is that because we're the lucky ones or is that because we're the
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:38.400]   left behind? I think the lucky one and I also you mentioned fear of missing out. I always get that
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:45.440]   for like five minutes and then when I see that everyone has to pack up right after Christmas or
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:50.160]   right after New Year and when you're just trying to get your life back in order and then have to go
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:58.160]   to Las Vegas and spend a week there and walk non-stop. It always feels like you know what's going on
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:04.320]   when you're you know less of what's going on when you're there then by the time you get back to your
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.280]   hotel room or when you're able to actually read about everything and then you go investigate.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:17.600]   When you're there it's just a it's just a mad house. I started reading some of the feeds from it and
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:25.840]   I got the same horrible feeling that I think I'm walking the floor. I would just leave after a day
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:34.080]   of that angry just at the waist and my favorite report from CES this year was let's get the byline
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:41.520]   right. Aaron Gloria Ryan writing for the Daily Beast dropped acid for the first time to go to
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:47.680]   her first CES. Oh my god. Oh and it's just great it's a great report because it's written
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:55.680]   you know on you know under the influence and she was still tripping when she rose.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:03.200]   It kicks in about you know as she's walking in and then you know the carpet freaks her out and the
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.520]   robots freak her out. It's really quite a story.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:14.160]   Yeah all the movies even all the you know all the booth people dressed up in different weird costumes
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:20.320]   inviting you over. The booth babes. Yeah. Oh that's crazy. I kind of...
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:25.760]   It's a Lincoln. I wish I'd yeah no we've I wish I had the guts to do this.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:31.840]   I don't even know that you need to drop acid. It is like kind of like a sensory overload anyway.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:39.200]   This is your first time there and she now did now was she micro dosing or was she doing the full
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:45.440]   it sounded from the from her hallucinations like the full thing. Yeah.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:51.040]   And but you know even these straight pictures that she took of the event
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:59.920]   looked absolutely psychedelic like the Polaroid Cube. Yeah with this tree house. Yeah almost like a
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:06.160]   crazy Michael. Crazy. Halloween movie or whatever his name is. And then the colors and
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:14.560]   she references Hunter Thompson who famously. Fair and low casted to report. Yeah. Yeah from Las Vegas.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:22.640]   Wow. Not that we're advocating illegal drug use but wow.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.560]   Wow.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:31.040]   Above my head a mono rail flew by like a dragon. Every breath felt like a laugh.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.840]   In my peripheral vision of a woman very blatantly held out her cell phone to take a photo of me.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.360]   She was only a few feet away. I turned to tell her to mine her own business. I'm no celebrity.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:44.400]   Just an amateur idiot drug doer getting some air. She wasn't a real woman. She was an ad for
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:49.520]   Polaroid. I laughed with relief. Ha ha ha. That's kind of...
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.520]   I need to go. Hunter S. Thompson S. Next year we should go.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:14:00.520]   Let's all take as an
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:00.560]   an ancosa. Fill it. Fill it. You sound like you. You sound like you like.
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.000]   You sound like you like. You have a whole section in here about the screens too and how they
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.720]   freaked her out. The LG, the Samsung booth, the Sony booth. Like and that was actually one of the
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.240]   bigger stories out of CES this year is all the screen technology. Right.
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:17.200]   Even like haptic feedback and some of the larger you know television sets and weird there and
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.400]   that was really what people were sort of racing to go and actually see was some of the like the
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.880]   haptic feedback television sets and things. But she was on acid looking at those things.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:31.200]   I can't imagine. She also had the gall nerve guts to publish her reporter's notes.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:41.200]   The carpet freaks me out. Wow. No, I wouldn't recommend that because CES is an acid trip all
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:46.800]   by itself. But actually to me, let's talk a little bit about it because we sitting from a
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:52.800]   distance probably have a better 30,000 foot view of CES than people who are there on the floor,
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:15:00.400]   exhausted, sick, tired, way too much on deadline, way too much giant shrimp and chocolate fountains.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:10.240]   We avoided the side shows as well. And those are always those always creep me out a little bit.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:15.360]   Those are PEPCOM and show stoppers as CES unveiled that seem to be de-regirre for journalists,
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:20.880]   mostly because they get free food and booze and always get over covered. All the products
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.040]   there get over covered because well, it's right there. You didn't have to go anywhere.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.600]   And there's always a happy fork, you know, something like that haptic fork that.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.600]   Oh yeah, tells you you've eaten too much. Yeah, that you see on every channel,
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.480]   everybody, because it was the first thing in the door at show stoppers. And so everybody got a
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:44.160]   story and then they went home. Honestly, I mean, because your producers are begging you for like,
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.000]   well, what are you going to be covering this week? And those early events take place early. You
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.680]   know, you get there on a Sunday, you have the press event on a Sunday evening that what it
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:56.160]   doesn't really officially kick off till Tuesday, right? So that the stuff that's unfolding on a
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:01.600]   Monday at show stoppers or the other one is you a PEPCOM or whatever, you're able to see all these
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:06.000]   in one room in one sort of ballroom. And they're right there. And it's easy for you to walk around
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.760]   with your producers and get ideas and gather ideas for your shows. And those, you're right,
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:13.280]   are the things that end up getting the most coverage. That's why those companies pay 10,
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:18.960]   15, $20,000 to be in those ballrooms. Because they know if you want to get on Fox,
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:23.040]   you've done that, right? How many times many years have you covered CES for Fox?
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:28.560]   I think maybe six or seven or something like that. Yeah, I would see you. We would,
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.120]   yeah, you and I, you would be walking around there doing live streaming.
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:38.400]   We had a booth a few for several years, we had a giant booth, which was crazy. And yet,
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:44.640]   I have to tell you, I do have FOMO this year, fear of missing out because this of the last
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.600]   three or four CES has seemed to be the most interesting. There was some really, I think, new
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:56.000]   stuff. Yeah. Like Amazon's Echo, Echo everywhere, Echo in everything.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.680]   I seem to be in the show today. Oh, yeah. Well, we had a live report this morning out of the
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.920]   Detroit auto show and it, you know, they obviously go back to back and that kicks off tomorrow,
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:13.120]   officially. But there's a lot of Amazon Echo built into some of the car technology.
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.760]   So you're now having that built into, but yeah, there was a ton, I think even Amazon was surprised
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:22.560]   at the number of Echo integrations at CES this year. They thought there might be 30 or 40.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:28.400]   I think ended up being maybe three times that amount of things and not all of them good. Not all
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.720]   of them have deep integration. So they don't, you know, and they don't have internet access in
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:37.680]   certain regards. So you, it's not as, it's not as robust an experience, I think as people would want.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:43.440]   This is a fast company, Mark Sullivan writing a list of some of the things.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:48.720]   The Lenovo smart assistant speaker, LG appliances, these are all Amazon voice services enabled.
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:53.440]   In other words, Echo built in Belkin's Wemo dimmer switch and CIPio command kit Wi-Fi
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.120]   light switch whirlpool appliances, Mattel's Aristotle. That's a baby monitor.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:05.280]   Co-way air mega smart air purifier. You tell the purifier to turn on and then ask it what the air
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:10.720]   quality is in the room. The Lynxis Vellop, which is a router you talk to night and gale smart
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:19.200]   sleep aid system. The let's see the Ford and Volkswagen's integrating into their car services.
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:24.560]   Enrichs, which is a car analytics company says it'll have Echo in its open car platform.
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:28.960]   Huawei putting Echo in its smartphone, even though it's an Android phone.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:40.400]   Dish, Jam Audio, Play-Fi, iHome, Monsters Soundstage Home Speaker. If it's a big monster beefy
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:46.320]   speaker with Amazon and that's going to sound crazy. The UBTEC Robotics links the LG Hub robot,
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:54.480]   the Samsung PowerBot VR 7000 and just on and on and on. Do you think Amazon charges for this or
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.920]   I would, it seems to me Jeff Bezos would be brilliant just to give this away.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:06.400]   I think it's a free API and it raises the question of has Amazon got the first mover advantage?
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:15.920]   Have they certainly stolen the lead over Apple who hasn't even marketed one of these home
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:22.480]   assistants, but they're also ahead of Google. I thought Ben Thompson had an interesting take on
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:29.840]   it. He said although the Google Home works better as far as he's concerned and because it
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:38.000]   has direct access to all that Google knows about the internet, ultimately it should overtake Amazon.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.960]   But he thinks that the advantage that Amazon has is the business model.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:55.120]   It's a platform. If you think of it that way, in the same way that Windows was,
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:02.000]   or Google is for the internet and his point about the Amazon, why he thinks Amazon will win
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:09.840]   because Google makes money by selling more ads. Apple, if they ever market one of these things,
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:16.560]   will make money by keeping people within the eco sphere. Amazon has another business model,
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:21.840]   which is they sell stuff through this. You can order your toilet paper and you can order your
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:27.120]   orange juice and that's where they get their juice as it were.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:33.280]   I'm fascinated by this because I think there's a couple of different layers to this. One is,
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:38.320]   though, I think Amazon to your point, Philip, that's the main place we all go to shop.
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.560]   So it's right there on the front page in a huge banner at the top. Everyone knows about it.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:48.000]   I'm so surprised whenever I do a story about it on one morning on the show on Fox and Friends,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.560]   I right before George Michael passed away, I was saying my favorite Christmas song,
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:57.120]   "Is Last Christmas" by Wham. I know it's cheesy, but I said, I want to try something here with
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:01.040]   our audience. I want to see how many Alexis across the country I can wake up.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:05.920]   Please, when you do this here, don't use the A word. This is my New Year's resolution. I'm not
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:13.360]   going to use the A word, the S word, the G word or the C word on the shows.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:19.040]   Brand new FCC for dirty words. So please use Echo instead of the A word.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:23.120]   Echo. Well, this is one problem. There's been a couple of reports in the past week when
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:27.360]   little girls were ordering girl cookies or whatever showing their house because so many
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:31.360]   news stations didn't know that the device is actually called the Echo. And so they kept putting
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:36.880]   in the A word instead of the C word. It's a huge problem. Right. So all these things
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:42.080]   were showing up at people's houses. But anyway, my point is that I did this test and it would just
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:46.800]   as a fun and our viewers sort of played along. You warned them, man. Yeah. Yeah, you wouldn't
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.600]   believe how popular this device is. And I just don't know the Google, where do you go to buy it?
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:57.440]   I think it's really sweet that just before George Michael passed away, you sent him a massive royalty
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:05.040]   check. Curse of courtesy of Amazon's Echo and Fox. I was saddened by this. I couldn't believe it.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:10.640]   I know. But anyway, my point is that where is Google? Where do you go to to really buy this?
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:16.400]   You go to Amazon. Oh, you mean, you mean, you mean, you have to go to Google store, right?
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:21.040]   No, no, you can get it at Target as well. If you go online and ask where you can order it,
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:26.000]   there are I think six different places. I bought them for my kids for Christmas.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.080]   Why did you buy the home, not the Echo? Because it felt like it had more upward
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:39.440]   movement. It could get smarter than the Echo. It's got more. I think in the long run.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:45.520]   I just trust Google to be more advanced in AI, to run the network stuff better,
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:52.560]   that they have a better sense of what's on the internet. I have been disappointed. If you ask it,
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:59.840]   like Julio LePorte is, they'll read the first sentence out of Wikipedia. And then you want to say,
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:03.840]   OK, read the rest of the entry and it can't do that. I don't know how to do that.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:10.880]   Yeah, both Echo and Google do that, which is weird. But Google has the big knowledge graph
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:15.760]   that they've cultivated over the years. Amazon's advantage is the Open API,
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:25.760]   6,000 tasks already and more, 7,000 every month, another couple of thousand. All of these installations.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:34.240]   And the thing is, it's also got a business model in a way that Google doesn't, really, right?
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:39.840]   Right. Right. That's the thing. You can sell through it and get revenue from the sales,
[00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.000]   whereas Google is continuing to do the thing. Let's just make the internet bigger and we'll
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.240]   get somehow get a piece of the advertising. It's sort of orthogonal to use.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.320]   Yeah, that's Google's kind of a way of doing it.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:56.560]   What about Google advertising? We saw these weird ads for the pixel during the holidays,
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:02.800]   which didn't make much sense and showed a bunch of people singing with a rectangular shaped phone
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:07.520]   image appearing over there. But nothing about Google Home, which to me, I mean, this was like,
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:13.840]   you know, to me, the Echo is a huge gift. So many kids, my little girl's four, my son is six,
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:18.480]   all of their friends. The only thing they wanted this year was the dot, the Echo dot.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.840]   Really? No, all of them. And when we would go to these Christmas parties,
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:26.720]   it would come back and say, Oh, you know, Janice has this and Emma has that and I want the Echo
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:32.720]   dot. That's what I want. I want. Well, I gave my mom two dots. She's 84. I gave her two dots for
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:37.920]   Christmas and birthday because they're cheap now, right? This is another thing Amazon finally got
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:42.480]   because the Echo was very expensive, but maybe they were artificially constraining it so that
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:48.400]   they could ramp up at a reasonable speed. In any event at 50 bucks, the Echo is inexpensive enough
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.560]   people might buy them. And what you really want, what Amazon wants, what you want is an Echo in
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:57.040]   every room. Pretty soon it gets the point where you really want to have your whole house listening
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:02.960]   to you, right? You have to have the the mothership in order for the dots to work. Is that how it goes?
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:07.680]   No, no, no, they just need the internet, but it just doesn't have a speaker. They slice the top
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:12.640]   off of a, of an Echo doesn't have the speaker. Just the Google speaker, by the way, is better,
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:18.480]   much better. But this is the point of the dot. Everybody now, thanks to computing, has powered
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:24.240]   speakers. So you just plug them into the dot and and the dot now has a better has as good
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:30.400]   as speaker system as you want or Bluetooth, right? Right. So kids with a little Bluetooth, you know,
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:35.920]   in this, you know, we're even one of these bad boys. The, the what is this one called the,
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:43.760]   I can't remember this one. What is that? That's the Amazon. Oh, the dash. Is that a dash? Yeah.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:51.680]   The tap. Tap. Tap. Dash. It's the tap. The itch. That's an Amazon Echo with a battery in it.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:55.440]   It's a battery powered speed. Right. You can take it out back for your barbecues and you just
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.480]   tap. You have to press the button though. And that's what a lot of the. I don't like that one
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:02.960]   as much who wants to tap anything. You just want to say well, and some of the ones that CES had to
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:10.640]   tap it twice to activate the Echo features at CES. So a lot of the Amazon integration at at CES
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:17.760]   is not as seamless by a long shot as it is on the actual Echo device. So you have to double tap
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:21.840]   certain buttons that was on the floor of CES. Who wants to do that? You don't even want to hit it
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:26.960]   once. And because you have to hit this one time, I don't even want to use it. Yeah, that's how lazy
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:34.320]   we are. It's really I feel like Amazon is both Bezos, particularly as both a genius, brilliant,
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:39.920]   with long term thinking, and the luckiest man in the world. Because I don't think Amazon Web Services,
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:43.600]   for instance, I think that was an afterthought. That was like, well, we got these servers lying
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:48.400]   around. Let's try this. And it turned out to be a massive business for Amazon. I feel like,
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:52.320]   because the fire phone, they thought he thought that was going to be the next big thing you could
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:58.640]   scan anything and order it. Flopola, right? But then it was brilliant. He was able to cut bait on
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:03.520]   that so fast. Yeah, well, that was the good news. But then he's I feel like he stumbled on the Echo.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:08.480]   I don't think that they understood initially the value of talking to your house because that's
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:13.840]   really what you're doing and having it do something for you. Was that an in house job? Or did they buy
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:22.240]   that? That was in house. It was the 42, the guys who they call them project 42, the special,
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:27.120]   this actually the story of the Echo is interesting because I think as I remember,
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:34.400]   Bezos first saw it and didn't want it. So that's stupid. Somebody's written up the story. Let me
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:38.400]   see if I can find that because that's a that's actually very interesting. But,
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.960]   Phillip, I think you bring up a great point too about why where was Apple? And I think this first
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:48.480]   mover advantage, I mean, with HomeKit, that's why before maybe I think it was right before the
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:54.400]   holiday, you saw Apple doing some press events quietly in different cities or maybe just in one
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:59.360]   or two cities about HomeKit in wanting to sort of remind everyone. I think it was maybe right
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:04.240]   before the holidays about HomeKit integration and all of the bells and whistles that HomeKit could
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:12.320]   provide. But boy, I have to say with this explosion of Echo powered items at CES, I think you're right.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.800]   I think this I don't know if it's first mover advantage. I don't know exactly what it is right
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:21.280]   now. But I think Apple is behind the eight ball on this. Not just Apple. I mean, Microsoft,
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:26.800]   Cortana, they're working as hard as they can. But Siri is a sad story.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:35.040]   Well, because Siri was there first. It was there first. And in theory, it should be as good as
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:41.760]   anything Google can do. It should be better than Amazon. I mean, Amazon to its credit discovered
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.880]   that what really mattered was that the machine understood what you said, heard what you said,
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:53.360]   and could parse it. And because it's got a it's plugged into the wall and it's got seven microphones
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:29:02.000]   or whatever it is. It's very good at that. And for Apple to get over the problem with Siri now,
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   which usually doesn't understand you and you usually want to throw it out the window,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.440]   they're going to have to make a standalone thing that plugs into the wall that has that kind of
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:18.480]   microphone capability. And Apple typically, they should have the advantage. They have all the,
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.600]   they build a whole stack. They've got designers. They should know how to do this.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:33.440]   But because they move so slowly, they get overtaken. I don't think we can write them off yet. I think
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:43.120]   the investment in Siri will eventually pay off. But it could be so late that it's hard to say.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:48.000]   Do you guys think that it's still so nascent? I mean, the idea that as you're to your point,
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.200]   I mean, Apple usually likes to sit back on these things except for the Apple watch,
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:55.120]   right? They were sort of first in the game in this. But they're sort of like to sit back and watch
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:59.680]   how this unfolds. And I think this, to my mind, it's still a pretty nascent. I have friends who
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.720]   come over. They say, "Oh, how do you like that thing? I've been seeing that." But they still don't own
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:07.520]   it. They still haven't made the plunge to go out and buy this device. And Apple has that power. They
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:13.360]   have the stores. They have all of that infrastructure. And plus Amazon, the Echo really only works really
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.680]   well in the United States. I mean, you don't have a global, it is not a global,
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:22.960]   reach. So Apple can come out of the translate. So there is an opportunity for Apple.
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:28.480]   You're absolutely right. Amazon doesn't say how many Echos they've sold. But even if it's
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:33.200]   millions, it's not Apple scale numbers. So there is an opportunity. Here's the, by the way,
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:38.640]   the article I was referring to. And I just want to side note, and then we'll go back.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:43.520]   But this is Joshua Bruce Dean from April of 2016. It was on Bloomberg. The real story of how
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:49.440]   Amazon built the Echo is. Lab 126, which was created to make the Kindle, made the Firephone.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:56.000]   When he killed the Firephone, Bezos saved the Echo as a side project. I was mistaken. I don't
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.920]   think Bezos didn't like the Echo. I think he did like it. But what he also liked was a different
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:06.320]   name. He wanted to call it the Amazon Flash. And it was going to be called the Flash up to a few
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:12.880]   weeks before it shipped. And employees convinced him to change the name to Echo, the original boxes,
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:20.160]   which had already been printed, had to be destroyed. So that's a little bit of
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:25.200]   dancing echo. Bloomberg. Bloomberg. I know. I know. This is kind of a wild.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.880]   This is in April. There was a different Bloomberg.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:37.360]   They were trying something else. I don't know. This looks like actually.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:41.600]   Yeah. He's wearing diapers. He's dripping. Yeah. And it looks like he's smoking,
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:47.920]   which I don't. He's a smoking baby. It's a very strange, but it's a great story. I mean,
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:53.120]   it's one of those stories where really good reporting because they don't talk about this stuff.
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:57.760]   They try not to talk about this stuff. In fact, he points out many of the people who created the
[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:03.040]   Echo don't aren't in Amazon anymore. That's how he was able to report it. Probably.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:07.680]   Probably that's who he got for a source, right? And when he wrote this, by the way,
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:14.960]   Echo had 600 or 500 skills. And he says, wow, it has more than 500 skills.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:19.920]   That was April. Well, have you have you explored these 7,000 skills?
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:24.720]   No, that's part of the problem. No, but the key one is you need to work really well.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:29.680]   And they do. Yeah. Yeah. Play music, right? Around the holidays, we used it ad nauseam, right?
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:35.280]   We just come home, making food, cookies, whatever, and just say, echo, play Christmas music,
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:40.320]   play holiday music. And my wife, using it constantly for countdown timers in the kitchen,
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.480]   set timer for 10 minutes. What's the forecast for tomorrow? Can we go skiing?
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:49.120]   Those three key areas, it was crushing. And then I would do Google Home. And I found that
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:53.280]   every time I would start playing a playlist or music, it would play one song and stop.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:56.400]   And that, for me, was like a deal breaker. It was crazy. Yeah.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:01.360]   Over and over again. But those, yeah, those 7,000, no, I haven't explored.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:10.480]   I loaded up a bunch of joke skills they call them. So the U-Mama jokes and guy walks into a bar.
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:19.440]   They're all pretty bad. I solved the Google plays one song problem. You have to step up and get a
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:26.960]   full paid version of Spotify. And then if you say, you know, play all of Amy Winehouse,
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:32.080]   it's got it. Well, that was the other thing Amazon did that was brilliant as Amazon on limited
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:38.720]   music. In fact, really smart. And I don't I wonder how this is going. It's only $4 a month if you
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:44.000]   only use it with one echo. And I realized that the market for that is students, young people,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.480]   people living in studio apartments, Carsten Bondi, my producer, people who if you if you if you only
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:56.000]   want music in one area, you hook up your dot to a good spec set of speakers. That's your stereo.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.880]   And for four bucks a month, you get Spotify size playlist. That's that's a that's a killer app
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:09.920]   itself. And this is one go ahead. I was just going to say who would have guessed that the killer
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:15.920]   app was really the kitchen timer? That's more than anything else. I think that was the that was
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:20.400]   the camel's nose under the tent because they got to give you one thing you'll use all the time
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:26.160]   regularly. And but that was now the echo is not just in the kitchen anymore. Is it? It's in the
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:31.280]   bedroom now and it's everywhere in my house. How does that work? I haven't I only have one in the
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:37.120]   kitchen. Do you find that because I find it so responsive that let's say you've got one near
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:41.440]   where the kids are sleeping and you want to know what the forecast is? Does it trip and work in the
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:47.440]   other room and wake up other people? So we had an we had an echo in the gym, which is right off the
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:53.200]   kitchen. And I hear them both respond and both set timers and both go off. But about a month
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:35:00.160]   ago, Amazon did the obvious. It knows which one's closer because of the array mic. And it just it
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:05.920]   now seamlessly picks the right one. It was this is what that tells you is that Amazon didn't have
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:10.720]   the problem because everybody had one. And as soon as it became a widespread problem, as people
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:17.760]   bought second echoes, they had to solve it and they did. So I think Jeff is quite brilliant in
[00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:22.560]   in this. And I would not count him out either. Of course, you can't count Apple or Microsoft
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:29.920]   or Google out. But this is a great battlefield. And I think CES showed it. Let's take a break. Come
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:36.080]   back. Talk more about CES and some of the things people saw. Well, we didn't see, but we have eyes
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:42.400]   and ears there. Actually, our own father, I said a priest down father, Robert Baliser down there.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:47.120]   He did some exorcisms and had a lot of fun. We'll talk about that in a second. Our show today.

[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:13.120]   cult." Also, there's another problem. I can't hear you. Let me put my headphones in.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:19.200]   We're in the cult. I couldn't hear Clayton either. Did he turn his mic on?
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:22.480]   Oh, I thought it was a failure of the Bluetooth. Can you hear me now?
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:27.760]   Yeah, we turned you down because of the ad. Also here, Philip Elmer DeWitt.
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:35.120]   By the way, I've been neglected to plug PED30, or PED3.0, as you prefer,
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:42.400]   his fabulous blog and news site. How's it going? It's going well.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:48.240]   It's going well. This week, I put up my first podcast. Oh, I'm so proud of you.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:53.760]   Yeah. You've joined the club. Everybody here has their own show now.
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:39:02.160]   I grabbed mine with sort of Newsy. Gene Munster, everybody's favorite
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:08.240]   cell site, Apple analyst, joined the other side. He started a venture capital fund.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:13.280]   What? Really? Wow. He's the guy who said Apple's going to do a TV for like five years.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:18.400]   TV show. Yeah. I got the first broadcast interview with Gene Munster and his new gig.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:26.640]   I got him to tell me the story about how he got set off on that Apple television rumor.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:35.120]   It turned out he was told by a TV manufacturer who had been working with Apple, probably LG,
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:40.800]   because Apple had just cut a big deal with LG. They told him that Apple was building this
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:47.040]   television set. He just ran with it. He started writing about it in 2000,
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:53.200]   she's nine, predicting every time he wrote about it. He said it's coming in two years,
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:40:00.320]   and he got all the way up to 2016. Then who was it? It was Carl Icahn.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:07.120]   wrote a memo to Tim Cook saying how great it would be when the Apple television came out this
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:13.680]   year with two models that sell 10 million in the first year. Apple felt obliged to tell the Wall
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:20.800]   Street Journal that they'd killed the project a year earlier. There was a project at some point.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:27.520]   Well, yeah, he says to his credit, there was something going on, but he says he just got it
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:31.920]   wrong. He kept pressing it. He was one of those guys who'd be on the Apple earnings call,
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:37.840]   and every time he would ask about the television, and it became an industry joke, and it didn't
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:43.840]   help his reputation. I don't think it helped him within Piper Jaffrey. He's off on his own with a
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:51.600]   couple of his old buds from Piper Jaffrey. They're going to be investing in AR, VR, AI, and robotics.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:57.840]   That's their gig. I'm glad you're doing a podcast. Clayton, let's plug yours while we're plugging
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:02.640]   away here. Sure. Well, thank you. Actually, I launched the podcast. I think back in May,
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:07.760]   the last time I was on, I launched it on Twitch. It's called the Investing in Real Estate Podcast,
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:12.160]   and it exploded. We think we just passed two and a half million downloads.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.360]   Wow. Good for you.
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:13.840]   Wow.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.520]   And you wouldn't believe how many Twitch listeners listened to our show and then have worked with
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:22.800]   our team and have become real estate investors or who got off the couch and finally took action.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:26.000]   It's been amazing. I would ask him, where'd you hear about it? It's a Twitch.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.760]   Heard you on Twitch. Good gig.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:33.600]   So, yeah. So, thanks so much. How often do you post a podcast, Kate Clayton?
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:38.480]   We publish it three times a week. Three times a week. So, on a Monday, I do sort of a 12-
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:42.720]   10-minute monologue episode about strategies and tactics for real estate investing.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:48.480]   On Wednesday, my wife, Natalie, and I host a show together where we talk about how to set up your,
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:52.720]   you know, safe on your taxes, how to structure your investing for your family, because that's
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:56.960]   where she and I work very closely on with the spreadsheets and making sure that we're saving,
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:01.680]   you know, boatload on taxes and how to set up your LLCs properly. So, that's the show on Wednesday.
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:06.080]   And then on Thursday, I have an expert, you know, somebody who owns 500 properties, 600 properties,
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:11.200]   who's, we can talk about multifamily investing. The whole show is dedicated just by and hold
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.320]   real estate. So, that's what the whole show is about. So, it's been--
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:17.840]   How did you get into-- How did you get into real estate? Why did you choose them?
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:22.400]   Years ago, years ago, I just-- I started rehabbing houses when I lived in Florida
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.560]   and went through the craft-- When you've done this for ages.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.920]   Or a publisher? Yeah, I went through a long time. And, you know, you realize,
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:33.040]   man, you look at the rockiness of the stock market, the ups and downs and the craziness of
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:37.440]   what's happening in the bond market in China and everything else, the one consistent thing is always
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:42.800]   buying real estate, buying it right and holding it for the purposes of high return cash flow.
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:47.680]   Like, that's-- To me, there's no greater investment. You know, more millionaires have been made in
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:52.320]   this country from real estate investing. All of the tax laws are written to benefit real estate
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.600]   investors in this country. Almost every member of Congress is a real estate investor.
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:43:00.480]   So, when you look at it that way, and if you own a business, if you-- A lot of your listeners
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:05.600]   are small business owners, what a way to offset your personal income by owning real estate. I mean,
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:11.760]   the depreciation you can claim, it's amazing. When you start to dive into it, you will never go back.
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.080]   I'm telling you. Wow, now you--
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:14.800]   Were you-- Were you sold me?
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.280]   Were you-- Where do I sign up?
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:21.840]   Were you riding it when the bubble burst in real estate? Were you--
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:26.560]   Yeah, I had-- Well, I mean, I-- Yeah, but you know, it's funny. It's like, if you talk to any,
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:30.400]   like, high-level real estate investor during that time who own hundreds of properties,
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:34.800]   they-- If they're-- For cash flow, they didn't see one dip in their rental income.
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:38.640]   What they did see was a drop in value, which is fine, but they're going to hold it for the rest
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:42.800]   of the life. So, if they lost $15,000, $20,000 in value, it didn't matter because they weren't
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:46.160]   selling it. The people who got really hurt, of course, during the bubble were the people with
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:51.360]   those five-year mortgages, the movie, the big short, of course, focused on. The people who were
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:54.640]   buying it for appreciation, they'd buy a house, and then three months later, try to flip it,
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:59.920]   like in California and Stockton, California or Florida. Those are the people that got burnt,
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:03.840]   the people that over-leveraged. But the people who are holding real estate for the purposes of cash
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:08.800]   flow with a tenant, those people did fine. So, that's what I focus on. I've certainly been
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.880]   through the foreclosure stuff in 2008, and I'll never go back to that again. Now, I know--
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:17.200]   Right. If interest-- Interest rates are starting to trend up. If they go up, does that affect it?
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:21.840]   Or do you like my new hat? You like that? I love it. Yeah. The Elmerfoot.
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:25.760]   Yeah. Interest rates, it's interesting. I mean, you look at what's going on. I mean,
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:30.640]   it goes up a little bit, but really that affects the broader home buying market if you're going to go
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:37.200]   out and for your own personal residence. And yes, if you're going to buy houses with a bank for the
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:41.520]   purposes of rental real estate, yes, it's going to affect it a little bit. But for the most part,
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:49.440]   we're still at historic lows for interest rates. And so, I don't see a big shift, I think, mostly in
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:54.880]   the primary personal home buying market, you will. But even though these interest rates went up a
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:58.880]   little bit, they're still at historic lows. Think about the early '80s. They were like 18,
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:04.720]   19, 20% interest rates. The real story is that millennials aren't buying any real estate.
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:09.360]   They're waiting until they have children, and they buy that four and five bedroom house. They're
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:13.840]   not buying those starter homes with three bedroom, one bath, two bedroom, one bath.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:17.040]   But you know what? People need to rent those. So those are the ones that I buy.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:22.400]   And builders aren't building them. So it's like one of the greatest times in our history right now
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:25.840]   for rental real estate. You know, I can tell you it's a bad time to buy consumer-
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:31.280]   investing consumer electronics. Very bad. What are you? Very bad time to do that.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.400]   I do this to you. I don't know what you've got in those things. You do this to me every time.
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:38.880]   What is that? You're always on that show. I don't know what this is.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:44.560]   I don't even know if I'm wearing it wrong. I think this is my football helmet from when
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:51.040]   I was they called me the rambling twit from just down the road a bit.
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:55.920]   Yeah. So see, yes.
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:05.920]   If this were flesh colored, I would look bald. Speaking of wearables, you got a wearable on.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:10.560]   And I thought that was one of the other big stories at CES with smart watches.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:14.800]   And I think isn't that a story? Isn't this a flop? Isn't this a dead category?
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:19.200]   I think that's where. Well, I think that's interesting. To me, that's like where Google is sort of
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:24.000]   dropping the ball in Android wear. And you saw like Garmin coming out with some interesting stuff
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.400]   this year at CES and some other companies where they're seeing some opportunities in the
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:32.240]   wearables market and Google dropping the ball with Android wear. I don't know. I don't know what
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:37.760]   Google was doing. They have announced Android wear too, right? They announced in fact, I think
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:42.800]   Cassio announced the first Android wear to watch. But I don't know what's different. And Moto
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:48.560]   has Motorola said we're not going to make a new 360 fit bit, even though Fitbit now has bought
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:57.200]   Pebble and is like the number one wearable. It's profit margin is pathetic. I don't think it's a
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:02.560]   very good market. This is the kind of thing that people say, but Apple's selling millions of these.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:08.800]   It's in fact, everybody seems to be thinking this is a huge product, but that's Apple can brute
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:14.560]   force anything at this point, whether it has lasting power is another question entirely.
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:18.480]   Don't you think Philip, they've brute forced this a little bit? They've kind of shoved it down the
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:26.320]   market. Yeah, I'm not sure I'd use that verb. It's true that people who have bought into the Apple
[00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:32.480]   ecosystem are much more likely to buy one of these than the ordinary citizens.
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:40.000]   I think they're going to do fine. They're making good money on it. They continue to put resources
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.920]   in it. I don't know that they I'm still on my first one. I did an upgrade to the second and I
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:52.720]   probably won't upgrade to the third until they until they put a communications chip in it.
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:48:00.720]   It's just fine the way it is. I think these earbuds are that's the wearables. Those are the wearables
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:07.760]   that are going to take off. And you know, I don't have to twice and now series gotten excited.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:15.920]   Not a felicitous use of lost my volume. Hold on.
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:22.720]   I'll make the point while Philip is fixing this. I'll make the point that yes, Apple has an
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:27.520]   opportunity, but Apple's history of late has been to fumble these opportunities one right after the
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:32.880]   other. This could be huge. In fact, I was very excited when I saw the earpods. This would make
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:36.640]   a great hearing aid. It's got microphones on it. There's so many things you could do with this.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:43.040]   It's so close to the ear it can measure blood oxygen because as far as it is in the ear,
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:47.120]   it's close enough to the I guess it's the tympanic membrane that it could actually monitor that
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:50.480]   kind of thing. It certainly could see heart rate. So there's a lot of things this could do that a
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:57.120]   watch can't do, but they've got to get the dopey double tap. They've got to get the voice interface
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:04.000]   right. And they'll get there. You know, the they firm wear. Yeah, they've only put they my
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.280]   suspicion is that they made it as simple as possible the first go around. And they've limited the
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:14.720]   functionality. I hate that word to, you know, you turn on and then there's the two taps.
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:20.880]   What is the thing? It's most obviously missing is a volume button. We've lost it's actually worse
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:25.920]   than the wired earphones in terms of the volume and the skip forward and all those great things.
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:32.880]   And you now you have to use your watch or your phone to do that. But that's I think it's just a
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:40.080]   software change. They can add those features once I think, I don't know. Yeah, I'm sure they
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:45.040]   I'm sure they probably could. And I'm sure they probably also learned a lot from that iPod shuffle.
[00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:51.360]   The one that had no buttons, right? And I bet they they probably took a lot of data away from
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:56.240]   what exactly were people using it? Because when you're trying to remember these gestures,
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:59.680]   you know, when you're out jogging, you're out doing these different things. And if you don't
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:04.160]   use them often, to me, it's like keyboard shortcuts. Unless you have like a little cheat sheet written
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:09.760]   down that you can remember is it up down, I swipe left, no way double tap left swipe up,
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:14.880]   tickle my earbud, you know, touch my nose. That's how I can skip a song. What if I want to go
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:19.840]   ahead 30 seconds? For instance, Marco Arman, who built Overcast, there's a bunch of features in
[00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:27.600]   his in his integration with the ear, the long the stringed earbuds, where you can do certain taps
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:33.760]   that will take you forward a certain bit or back. And I can never remember which way is which.
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:39.040]   So they might have some good data from the iPod shuffle experience that shows, you know what,
[00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:43.680]   people simply weren't using all these little bells and whistles. Let's give them the basics
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:49.040]   and we'll refine it over time to see if people really want that volume up or down. But I could
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:55.680]   certainly see that being the case. There was a parrot headset a few years ago, the larger sort
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:51:01.200]   of canned headset from parrot, where you would swipe your finger up. And I love that you could
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:05.520]   just with a swipe at your finger up turn the volume up. But I could never really remember
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:10.400]   where to hit it properly. And so you would really blast your ears out, or you accidentally turned
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:14.800]   off Bluetooth, you know, so it needs to be done right. Otherwise, you'll never use it again.
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:19.920]   If you try it once and it doesn't work for you. Well, talking about the bell, you quoted Chuck
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:27.600]   Von Roespach in your blog, Philip in PD 3, you know, he says, Apple, you know, by the way, Chuck,
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:35.680]   17 years at Apple, among other companies, he and I got into a regular back and forth over Apple.
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:43.040]   When I was extremely critical of Apple during the Gilomillo era on the radio here in the Bay Area,
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:49.840]   and he was an Apple employee listening, I think I was proven right. But now Chuck's kind of changed
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:55.360]   his tune as well. He says, Apple's problem right now is they're chopping the edge off the bell curve.
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:04.160]   He said, Apple is focusing on the fat belly, the fat middle of its product line. But as a result,
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:10.880]   it's hurting the smaller but highly influential groups, people who buy Mac Prose, for instance,
[00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.480]   Apple's relying on data too much. They're making business decisions
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:20.160]   that don't cater to a large enough group of people. Do you agree with him, Philip?
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:27.600]   Well, no, it's the opposite. He's there. They're so focused on the the middle of the bell curve,
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:34.000]   right, and chopping off the smaller people on the edges. And they and this last with the Mac
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:42.160]   Pro, without updating the Mac Pro and with the latest Mac Book Pro, they've angered an important
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:49.520]   tiny part of the bell curve. They've paid for it with a lot of angry Pro users.
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:58.400]   I thought the telling quote from it was, if you just look at the bottom line,
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:04.800]   if you just look at the numbers, it looks like everything's fine. And I think it's sort of what
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:10.400]   everybody feared about Tim Cook is that he's a guy who knows spreadsheets, he knows how to build
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:17.200]   a supply chain, but he's not a product guy. So he's likely to make that kind of mistake,
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:25.120]   not deliver, let the Pro users go because there's not that many of them and they don't make that
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:32.960]   much money from them. But Chuck's point is that this is an incredibly influential group.
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:38.960]   You don't want them angry. It's worth spending a little money to keep them happy and to keep them
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:45.200]   in the fold. And like I say, it's what we really worry about Tim Cook and that maybe they do need.
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:50.480]   I don't I'm not one of the ones who say they need to replace Tim Cook, but it seems like they need
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:57.840]   a product guy with enough influence within the organization that they get this stuff right on the
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:07.120]   edges. Well, Apple recording a recode Apple was absent from CES as he in a freed writing
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:11.920]   in a worse way than usual because Apple, although they haven't had a booth there in years,
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:17.600]   almost always dominated the conversation. They had new iPhones come out in that same time frame.
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:22.640]   That they often competed and won the news cycle during CES.
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:30.800]   I remember Alex Lindsey and I standing outside the hall at CES, one year talking about the impending
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:36.400]   iPad or whatever it was to be called. Yes. That was all anyone was talking about. Right. Was the
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:42.080]   iPad or potential iPad at CES. No one really cared what was happening. We saw some crappy tablets
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:49.760]   show up. Remember, yeah, Steve Ballmer got up on stage and showed that HP thing that never saw
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:54.640]   the late day. Right. It just is an attempt to kind of come out first with a we've got a tablet.
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:59.600]   But you're right. I mean, I don't I think and especially in the home kit area because that's what
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:04.160]   I'm always really interested in is how people are using technology in the home. And I thought
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:10.400]   they would just was crickets. Yeah. Other crickets in general. I mean, Amazon's aside,
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:15.840]   this has been a struggling section, this whole home automation section. But you're right. I think
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:20.400]   you're right, Philip, though, about the voices though, the people, the echo chamber, the people
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:27.280]   that are talking about Apple the most, the press, the tech reporters who host podcasts and so forth,
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:33.280]   where that's happening. I don't know how influential it is. Those are the people that buy Mac Pros,
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:38.320]   those are the developers that have podcasts that talk about not a lack of a Mac Pro update. And
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:42.800]   therefore, I think it drives that conversation to the average person though. If I were to ask
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:47.920]   again, my mom, she wouldn't even know what a Mac Pro is. Does she care yet she has an iPhone,
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:51.920]   she has an iPad and every night she's this sound play words with friends on her iPad.
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:59.280]   Ask her about a Mac Pro and she she wouldn't care less. Yeah, interesting. Certainly,
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:05.040]   that's what Apple's betting. But for the diehard Apple fans, and I include myself in that group,
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:08.400]   it's a little depressing to see them become an iPhone company.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:16.320]   And looking down the road, I mean, everybody's assuming that the self-driving car is going to
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:24.480]   be the next thing that might be as big as the smartphone. And Apple already found itself behind
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:28.960]   the curve enough that to lay off all the people that were actually building a car and then
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:36.880]   refocus the car effort on where they thought they could really add value and distinguish them.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:41.680]   So be fair, Google has done the same thing. And they've been working on autonomous vehicles
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:48.000]   longer than anybody. And even they this year decided to change the name to Waymo and to focus on
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   selling the technology to actual car manufacturers. I think that's probably why. That's a tough
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:58.880]   Tesla side. That's a very tough business to just get into. And then you have Nissan just
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:04.480]   announcing at the Detroit Auto Show overnight. And we've got to show it off on the show this
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:12.560]   morning, Nissan with their their their tele operating car, the autonomous being able to drive that car
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:17.680]   remotely. And some really neat innovations in the autopilot area. That's really nice.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:23.360]   So Nissan, yeah, so I don't know, maybe it's being better left to the car manufacturers who know
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:30.400]   what they're doing. I don't know. It's a high risk high reward business.
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:40.560]   But my sense is that that it is a platform game eventually. And that the the it's going to matter
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:48.000]   less who builds the physical car than what platform it runs. This is really interesting. So Nissan
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:54.880]   wants to have professional drivers in call centers driving you.
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:58:00.880]   Right. That seems like it doesn't seem like an interim solution.
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:09.920]   We've got our entire military sitting in what Nebraska or in Oklahoma flying drones over Afghanistan.
[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:16.640]   True. Yeah, it doesn't scale up real well, though. I mean, there are millions and millions of cars.
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:22.240]   There are probably hundreds of drones. The idea is that this technology in these Nissan's,
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:26.240]   though, would talk to other Nissan's. And so this is the first rollout of these cars that would be
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:32.480]   talking to each other as they're driving. So that's interesting. So it really it's a new standard.
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:38.640]   Also, it's not the idea is that this standard would be built into all cars. So we wouldn't have
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:44.720]   30 different styles of speaking to each other. We would have one universal standard to avoid
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:50.160]   accidents and to be able to have a remote fleet, I guess, that wouldn't be, you know, take human
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:55.520]   error completely out of the equation. Interesting. Well, everybody wants to be that standard.
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:59.920]   And that's I think that is the battle going forward because you can't have
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:08.240]   multiple standards on the highway or it makes it much more complicated. I would be very surprised
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:15.760]   if the standard that's adopted in the US is Nissan's. Right. You see that with Tesla, though, right?
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:20.560]   I mean, you know, like you got the Tesla plug, right, which so you know where you can park in
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:24.480]   your own garage or I can park, you know, I go to the mall, there's certain Tesla spots you can
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:30.320]   plug into, or there's the other one, the smaller, the smaller plug. So you've got these weird,
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:34.480]   you're like, is that a Tesla? It's hard to see. And then only Tesla's putting in those things and
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:40.000]   they have to get approval. And it's a kind of a, it's kind of a mess. I would be going to bet.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.440]   Go ahead. I was going to ask you driving a Tesla, right? Yeah.
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:46.880]   Does it got the impression claim is to are you driving a Tesla?
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:53.040]   Yes. Okay. Didn't want it wasn't sure if he should say tell the world. It's a secret.
[00:59:53.040 --> 01:00:00.640]   Yes. No one the bat. The bat moment. So I love my Tesla. And I haven't found any,
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:06.080]   but I don't drive it long distances. I haven't had any charging issues because I fill it up every
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:12.960]   night. I start with the standard. But your Tesla as an adapter doesn't mind does. I have the adapters
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:18.480]   to try to charge from anything. The real problem is that is just slow. You want to go to a super
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:24.480]   charger because it's fast. Exactly. Exactly. And so the, well, I drove an Nissan Leaf before. So,
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:30.400]   and, but in, when you flipped open the lid, you saw like multiple, you know, there was like,
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:34.160]   multiple charging. Wow. Different holes. You would open it up. There was the one,
[01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:38.560]   one with charge and it was like a bigger one. And, you know, it looked, you know, it was weird. And
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:41.920]   then of course you pull up to the different stations and you've got the charge point stations. You've
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:45.760]   got the Tesla station. You've got those different, that different infrastructure. And now Tesla is
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:52.080]   even rolling back by December 31st of 2016. So just a week ago, they are no longer, if your
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:56.640]   grandfather didn't purchasing the Tesla, you can access and plug into those super charged stations.
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.840]   But Elon was fielding these complaints from all these people who would just park and plug in and
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:06.560]   top off, even if they didn't need to, just because they were there, they'd pull up and they get that
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:12.800]   10 miles or so of charging to top off when someone could pull up and actually really needed to
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:16.720]   plug in. So now they're going to charge you for that instead of giving it away for free,
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:21.440]   which was an incentive with Tesla before. I think it was Calicanas who stimulated that. Jason,
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:28.480]   was pissed off because there were people sitting at superchargers all day. And he tweeted,
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:32.800]   Elon said, you got to solve this. Elon said, I'm getting on it. And like three days later announced
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:38.000]   that they were going to solve this by charging you for every minute that you sat at a supercharger,
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:44.880]   not not charging. So that shows you how a well run company can does listen to customers,
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:49.120]   even on Twitter and can respond very quickly. Right. He could look, he could look at the data
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:54.400]   until you know what you're right. You're right. He did. I think actually,
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:58.800]   self-driving cars may be a MacGuffin. I think we're way off with those. There's so many other
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:05.200]   issues, regulatory issues, acceptance issues from drivers. Admittedly, there's a lot of pressure
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:10.160]   going the other way from insurance companies and the fact that traffic fatalities are going
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:14.640]   up for the first time in years because people are playing words with friends while they're driving
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:21.920]   down the road. Pokemon go. Actually, Pokemon goes probably the worst. But I think augmented reality
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:26.720]   might actually be what Apple's really working on. We certainly have heard a couple of hints from Tim
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:32.720]   Cook about that. Yeah. I mean, he's been pretty open about it. Yeah. And that would be to me,
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:36.240]   another kind of technology that could change could change everything.
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:44.320]   Where do you see it on glasses or on the windshields of cars? I would see it on glasses.
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:51.040]   I would see it because you want it everywhere. And I think that the value of this is,
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:56.320]   first of all, and this is what Microsoft's investigating, a different UI. Microsoft's doing
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:00.960]   Windows holographic and they're very close to shipping that in just a few months. And of course,
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:05.760]   they already have a product, the HoloLens, which is in its infancy, but actually exists
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:09.760]   as being sold. I think Apple would be looking at that. But I think more importantly,
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:15.920]   seems to me, Apple's decided the computer is not where it wants to be. It wants to be in consumer
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:23.440]   electronics. I think Apple sees it as a product as important to you in five years as an iPhone,
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:28.800]   that you wouldn't go out of the house without wearing your augmented specs because it would tell
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:34.160]   you all sorts of stuff about the world around you, the people you're meeting. And that would
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:40.800]   become a huge flow of information that's unique to you. And I think that's going to be huge.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:45.280]   So my bet, if I were going to bet, is that that's what Apple is thinking. That's what Apple's
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:50.480]   working on. It's the next closest thing to creating a category like the iPhone.
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:56.720]   I think in healthcare too, I had lunch with a buddy of mine the other day who is intimately
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:00.800]   involved in some big different healthcare initiatives and companies. And one of the things,
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:05.760]   I mean, he's right there in the operating room on a regular basis, running all these tests and
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:11.760]   they're working on operations and surgeries. And I think augmented reality, I think that's where
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:18.480]   Google Glass really could have shined is having a surgeon working in a particular capacity and
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:24.640]   having somebody else guiding them in a way, but having that overlay over optically to be able to
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:31.280]   do things three dimensionally even in ways that a microscope can't, getting that three-dimensional
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:35.440]   view of a spinal column, for instance, or those sorts of things. So there's all sorts of
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:39.120]   applications, I think in enterprise and in healthcare. And that's where everyone wants to be because
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:43.840]   there's so much money in healthcare. Also, we saw that at CES too, didn't we? I mean, we saw
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:52.000]   these VR add-ons to baseball bats and things at CES this year, where from, I could imagine,
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.640]   like the Philadelphia Phillies who need all the hitting help they could get,
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:01.120]   overlaying in batting practice VR applications with the baseball bat and actually getting and
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:05.360]   being able to swing at different pitches without even having to have a pitcher, they are throwing
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:08.880]   the ball at them, but they're able to work on their speed and they're able to time it with the VR
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:14.320]   headset. And the latency, that was one of the big things that we saw at CES as well, getting rid
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:20.080]   of the latency with VR so that you're not throwing up, which was to put on VR headsets and throw up
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:27.040]   because of latency. So having that latency removed from that experience, whether it's VR,
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:32.080]   whether it's augmented reality, but I think you're seeing maybe more of practical applications in
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:36.000]   the enterprise space than you are even in the consumer space right now beyond gaming. I don't
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.840]   know. To me, Apple is not looking for vertical niche. They're looking for something they can sell
[01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:49.840]   100 million, 200 million, 500 million, a billion units of. And that is going to be something very
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:54.960]   general. I don't think you have to worry so much about latency with AR because you're looking at
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:06:01.760]   the real world and you're super imposing thought bubbles or whatever on it. So you don't have that
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:07.200]   nausea effect. You're seeing what you're would see otherwise. The only thing I see is a lot of
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:12.320]   people wouldn't want to wear glasses. And yet everybody wears sunglasses, right? I mean, that's
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:16.240]   that's hip. That's with it. That's cool. I think, I don't know. What do you think, Phil? You even
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:21.840]   watch an Apple longer than anybody. Yeah, I would take a slightly different tack. I think one of the
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:28.720]   problems with the watch is that it came out when people were when the when the market was moving
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:34.800]   the other way, people had had were wearing less watches and depending on their phones. So you're
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:41.680]   sort of asking the ship that was already headed one direction to turn and fall back in love with
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:46.800]   the thing on the wrist. The right the reason I'm so bullish on the one reason I'm so bullish on the
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:55.040]   ear pods, air pods, earbuds is we're actually becoming more dependent on things in our ears.
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:07:02.720]   We listen to books. We listen to podcasts. We spend more time with things in our ears.
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:08.560]   And it feels like they're riding a curve that's going in the right direction,
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:14.160]   if you pardon the mixed metaphor. So and considering all the things you can maybe
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:21.760]   eventually do with this thing, it's an important piece of real estate and there they seem to have
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:26.960]   the first mover advantage. There's certainly been a lot of other wireless things that you put in
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:33.520]   your ear. But the big step forward that they made was I think they're the first that you don't
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:40.880]   have a wire connecting the two ears. There are others. There are others. Yeah. I think Samsung
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:45.680]   may have one. It's very typical of Apple where there's there was a scattered market of very similar
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:50.960]   devices and Apple just went and coalesced it into something much better. The braggy headset,
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:57.360]   the braggy was a big kickstarter. No, a lot of people hate those. Do you know what they're priced
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:02.560]   at? They're yeah, they're expensive. Yeah, I think they're more. The brag is really 299 or 399.
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:10.720]   Right. This was unusual. Apple actually came under the market and 159 actually looks relatively
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:16.240]   cheap compared to the competition, which is for me another sign that Apple is going to be aggressive
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:22.960]   here. Anyway, I forgot what I was going to say. Samsung, I think it away somebody makes something
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:28.640]   very similar with a charging case. You put the two pieces in there. I don't think that that's so
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:34.160]   unusual. I know I don't for some reason I feel like Apple is going to struggle with these. I don't
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:38.880]   feel like these are going to be a big market for Apple. I might be wrong. I like mine a lot, by the
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:45.440]   way, obviously you guys do too. Yeah, although I'm the reason I wear this hat is I'm I think I'm the
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:53.120]   only person in Franklin County, Massachusetts that has these things and I'm not. I'm not sure they're
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:57.360]   I'm not sure they're socially acceptable yet. I don't know. I'm going to say what's that in your
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:02.880]   ear? It's it looks like a Bluetooth. You know, they'll figure out if these got a new Bluetooth
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:09.840]   headset. I never could wear a Bluetooth headset. I felt obnoxious. It's like
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:16.640]   so yeah, my wife thinks I like it. I think we will get in next year, we'll be talking about this
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:21.040]   and we'll go. Oh yeah, everybody's used to that now. No big. We'll see you. Let's go walk a little
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:26.480]   more five pairs by then. That's the other. Someone asked me. Someone asked me.
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:28.880]   The most expensive toy just because you keep losing them.
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:34.720]   Someone asked me. People be washing them. Yeah. What happens if you drop it in the snow and I
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:38.480]   say, Oh, that's no problem. I'll just call myself in the ring. Well, it turns out that doesn't work.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:43.600]   You can't call yourself. No, but Renee, as you know, did did do that. He was demonstrating he
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:49.280]   found it. He turned him up really loud and listened. Really? I'm the answer.
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:57.200]   When you take it off someone here. Yeah, it's not saying he figured out a way to get to play. I don't
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:02.400]   remember what it was. All right. Well, I also want to go ahead in the app store. We'll let you find
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:07.760]   them. Oh, there you go. Oh, good. You know, it's like find my earbud. Find my AirPods is an app in
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:11.040]   the app store. I don't know. Did Apple take it down yet? I don't know. They use like there's Apple.
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:15.520]   Apple took it down. They did take it down already. It's already taken. Oh, good.
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:21.440]   So I have a very, very expensive pair of real hearing aids and I mean much more expensive than
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:25.680]   this and maybe because they're so expensive, I haven't lost them, but they're the same size,
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:31.760]   same problem, same box, but I haven't lost them. So I think, you know, these are precious enough.
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:38.240]   You can make sure you don't lose them. They don't fall out. Well, when you wear your
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:45.920]   aviator hat in the old, they do fall out. I dropped them twice now. Oh, no. Oh, dear. And I had to go
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:54.720]   out with a sifter and a shovel. What? A metal detector? No, until I found my missing AirPods.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:58.320]   So it is actually a real problem. They should make another colors.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:02.800]   So what you're doing is you got to get the flap nice and tight on the ear.
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:07.680]   Then they won't fall out. Oops. I double tapped and Siri came up. There you go.
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:16.800]   It says, I'm not sure they're socially acceptable yet. That's my point. It says,
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:22.400]   I found something on the web call about call, fall out, Pip Boy. Siri fell out.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.760]   So I have surprised how many people know about these as I've walked around with them, whether
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:31.840]   at the gym or other places. Really, they recognize them. Are those the new Apple Air?
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:38.800]   And so there's like no advertising for marketing geniuses though. That's kind of what I know when
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:44.560]   I said they can brute force a product. Well, they really blew this Christmas. And I think it should
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:50.320]   be said that they promised them for the end of October. They didn't deliver them in October.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:54.880]   They didn't deliver them in December. They delivered them in small enough quantities
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:59.920]   just before Christmas that you had to order them that day.
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:05.840]   The first day I did. It maybe get them by Christmas. The timing was so weird that
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:11.120]   part of me thought, well, wait a minute, wait a minute. Did they do this on purpose because they
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:16.480]   knew they'd made their December numbers with iPhone sales and they didn't need the revenue
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:21.040]   from the AirPod. And they were going to push it into the second quarter where they really needed
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:26.720]   the sales. But I'm told by someone who's talked to people at Apple that no, they really did
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:33.920]   screw up and they couldn't get them. There was some problem with the sink. And this was a real,
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:41.760]   failure to deliver on. Look what happened. Tim Cook lost a considerable amount of his bonus this
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:49.120]   year because for 2016, because of Apple missing its sales targets. This is the first time since
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:55.360]   2009, Apple's missed its sales and profit goals. I made a graph to see how big a haircut they got
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:03.120]   and showed what their compensation was, would have been and what it actually ended up being
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:08.160]   by the way, nice choice of graphic on that blog. Thank you. I couldn't find a picture of Tim
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:13.200]   Cook getting their haircut. But if you get down to the bottom there, now click on 215 and 216
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:18.240]   to see how big a difference it made. Okay. Can you can you click on 216 on the top right there?
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:22.800]   Yeah, I could do it. Why don't I do it because I have the giant surface pro.
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:27.040]   And I can go. So not that much. It's 15%
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:34.800]   15% though. Hey, it's millions of dollars. Why is Tim so underpaid compared to these other people?
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:42.080]   Because he got a huge bonus that spread out over 10 years. By the way, this is fun. How did you set
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:46.000]   this up? I like it. Push the button. It's a little app called Interact.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:55.840]   Back and forth. Back and forth. Love this, by the way. And it's not news anymore. But this is the
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:14:01.200]   surface studio and I just love it. Except, yeah, what kind of stand do you have it on? No,
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:05.760]   this is it. This is the computer has its own. It's a and that one. The one you got there,
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:11.120]   that's the shepherd Smith one. That was for that's the $14,000 one, right? Yeah. No, it's
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:17.040]   it felt like it. I got to admit it was I think 2100 something like that. And that's the screen
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:21.600]   inside the Tesla too, which is cool. You can take it out. Same size. You just pop it right in.
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:26.640]   It's amazing. It's amazing. No, I love this in the pen and look, see, I can do stuff like this
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:32.560]   watch double click the pen and now I can draw circles. I can point up. I can point down. I can
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:38.000]   point around. Take that. How soon do we see these house? Yeah, as you say, how soon until we see
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:44.320]   these on NFL Broadcoast. We put a lot of work into getting a illustrator working on TV. It's
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:50.240]   non trivial. And so this is kind of like, wow, that was easy. That's the best way to do it.
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:53.280]   Hey, let's take a break. I want to ask you about your friend Campbell Brown and if Facebook
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:58.640]   approached you before they approached her, but that's coming up. Oh, Clayton's looking down.
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:02.160]   I think I got it. I think I know I just got a cuticle that needs trimming.
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:12.800]   Wow. I showed it. I love it. Clayton Morris lays down Fox and Friends. All right. And from
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:19.200]   PED 3.0, Philip Elmer. So you get when you wear a hat like this, do you drop the Philip?
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:23.600]   I'll get to the ballet.
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:32.960]   How? Elmer. Welcome. I showed today brought to you. I should take this off. The sponsors will
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:37.680]   just hate it. I should take this off. Our show today brought to you by Zip Recruiter. Now I'm
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:42.320]   serious. Now I'm wearing my business suit here because Zip Recruiter, this is for all you people
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:46.800]   in business, whether you're a sole proprietor or you're an HR, where they have to do the hiring.
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:53.680]   You have the most important job in any business because a company, Steve Jobs said this. He said
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:16:00.080]   the company is one of the greatest inventions of the last several centuries. The idea that you can
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:04.160]   get a bunch of people together, align them on a goal and create something that no individual
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:10.400]   could do by himself. It's amazing. So your company, it's made of people. It's made of people and a
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:15.840]   good employee, the right hire, boom, can send your company through the roof, the wrong hire,
[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:20.560]   as you probably already know, because who hasn't made a wrong hire in their time can bring it down.
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:25.120]   And that's why it's important that when the time comes, and it's hard because I know when you're
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:29.120]   when you're short staffed, that's the time you know, you don't want to spend a lot of time looking
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:34.800]   for the replacement, but Zip Recruiter makes it so easy. Zip Recruiter.com is what you use it to it.
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:41.120]   I love this. Now you're on the part of Zip Recruiter where you search for a job, Carsten,
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:47.120]   but you can also click that button that says post a job. This is awesome. You post once to Zip
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:55.200]   Recruiter. It now goes to more than 200 job boards. They've expanded it and Twitter and Facebook.
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:59.600]   So the idea is you want to get that job listing in front of the most number of people possible
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:03.200]   because the right person's there, but you don't know where are, which board are they on, where
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:09.680]   they you know, you don't know. So you get as broadcast as widely as possible. You can post jobs for any
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:15.040]   industry anywhere in the country, but here's the beauty of it. You're going to say, well, I don't
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:19.360]   want to post it that all those job boards. I'm going to get millions of emails. No, no, you don't
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:22.400]   get any emails. You don't get any phone calls. It all goes into Zip Recruiter's interface,
[01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:27.760]   which makes it very easy to screen them. You can even create questionnaires, multiple choice,
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:33.040]   essay questions, yes, no, whatever you want to screen them, eliminate the candidates that don't
[01:17:33.040 --> 01:17:40.320]   match and quickly find the right person fast, sometimes within a day or two. Zip Recruiter.
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:45.120]   It's a new year, a new start for your business, and a great year starts with making great hires.
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:49.360]   Look at the million plus companies. Some of the biggest companies in the world who use Zip Recruiter
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:54.480]   and our little company too. You post once, watch the candidates roll in, no more juggling emails,
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:18:00.080]   no more calls to office. ZipRecruiter.com. Try it free right now. ZipRecruiter.com/twit.
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:10.720]   Let me thank them for their support of this week in tech. Let me tell you, those Elmer
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:16.960]   Fudd hats, they don't come cheap. They do not come cheap. Fill up L150 bucks. What for the one
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:22.640]   you're wearing? Yeah, 150 bucks. Oh, but that's real leather in Northampton. Yeah, it's real leather.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:28.960]   Oh, you got it in Northampton. This one was about four bucks.
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:36.240]   You're left out. Yeah, all I have over here is a triple.
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:38.800]   Oh, that's nice. You could wear that. Cool.
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:41.520]   Does that multiply? Because that would be cool.
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:48.880]   No, that looks like a hair piece that I was wearing. Actually, a little fuzzy.
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:56.880]   Does it make a sound? It does, but I think the battery is dead. William Shatner gave you that
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:03.680]   triple. Well, we used it for a segment. We were interviewing the 50th. Oh, here we go.
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:08.960]   It's purring. This triple is having a little bit of a seizure, I think. But
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:14.960]   the triples make sounds. I don't think they did. Yeah, they would make a kooie. Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:23.840]   William Shatner gave you that triple. Well, we were using it for a segment. I interviewed him
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:30.640]   for the 50th anniversary of Star Trek in New York City and talk. Yeah, we had a great time.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:37.440]   He's just funny. He's very, very nice. Yeah. He's so down to earth and you can just roll with
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:44.720]   stuff. Yeah, we had a good time. We talked about his upcoming book and we talked a lot about Leonard
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:50.400]   Nimoy and that troubled relationship. I thought he was really open about that to me. He said,
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:56.080]   you know, as men, you know, it's hard. Sometimes you've got guy friends, you kind of go in in a
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:01.120]   phase where you're close and then you fall out of favor. You kind of screw things up.
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:04.720]   You kind of get back together. And he's like, but he was always that friend.
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:11.040]   That's neat. It was interesting. Good guy. Yeah. Wow, that's a great scoop.
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:16.560]   So Campbell Brown, you know, Campbell Brown, you must know Campbell Brown. Small opportunity.
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:21.440]   Yeah, I mean, in the TV world, but not not terribly closely, but I have a lot of,
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:24.960]   I've met her and have a lot of friends close to her. So yeah, so she's going to be heading up this
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:32.640]   Facebook operation. New York Times broke the story about leading this sort of news partnership
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:36.800]   team. Although I don't know how it really involves, she'll be, it seems like more of a public face,
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:42.800]   but trying to maybe obviously, obviously the big pushback and all the meetings that took place
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:48.560]   with Zuckerberg and a lot of friends who were in those meetings with him right after where
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:55.360]   there was a feeling that conservative news was not giving a place on in Facebook's news feed,
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:21:00.400]   that there was people on their editorial staff, maybe removing stories, all of that.
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:05.680]   So I think this is a push in that direction. She apparently, she's not going to be in charge of
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:11.440]   any content or have any editorial control at all, but she, she's going to work with connecting
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:15.600]   publishers to partners. You know, look, a lot of these publishers for crying out loud,
[01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:22.400]   the majority of their traffic comes from Facebook overwhelmingly. Nothing is even close to the
[01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:27.760]   traffic that Facebook provides for them in the news feed. And so their business is basically run
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:33.680]   on Facebook. And if some small tweak to the algorithm happens, it affects their bottom line.
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:39.920]   Facebook really is a publisher as much as they have said, denied that they really are. I think
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:43.280]   it's interesting that they didn't hire Campbell Brown in the same way that Yahoo hired Katie
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:48.480]   Kirk. She's not going to be doing news. Right. She's just kind of an evangelist, I guess,
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:54.000]   for the news product. Can I ask a question about it? Because the time that what you describe,
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.240]   the issue that the publishers are having where they basically hand it over to Facebook
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:07.120]   access to their subscribers. The real important thing for publishers is to have a direct contact
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:10.480]   with a subscriber and you have their email address and you can market to them.
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:17.200]   Facebook has inserted itself in there and they've actually lost a lot of power the publishers have.
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:22.960]   But the issue of the conservatives feeling like they weren't getting enough,
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:28.320]   their voice wasn't being expressed. In Facebook feels ironic. I know.
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:36.720]   Now it turns out that the election may have been tipped by the red bubble and the blue bubble
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:44.800]   not listening to each other. To the point where Mark Zuckerberg first laughed it off as a
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:49.600]   ridiculous that it might have happened and to come around to, oh, you know, we may have been,
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:56.560]   we may have some responsibility for the way the election turned out. Do you know where in those
[01:22:56.560 --> 01:23:02.880]   three events where Campbell Brown is going to fit in? It's hard to say. I mean, it seems like,
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:07.840]   I mean, yeah, I know what you're getting at. I don't know. I mean, because if she's not going to
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:13.040]   be in charge of content at all, she's not going to be in charge of editorial at all. And there has
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:18.400]   been this move recently, obviously, to remove fake news from the feed that all these fake news
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:23.520]   stories were getting voted up to the top of the news feed. So in an effort, I guess, to be the
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:28.800]   public face of that, she'll be the public damage control, I guess, when in six months,
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:33.040]   we have another Facebook story. Who are you going to see on all of the network newscasts
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:38.160]   answering this question for Facebook? Campbell Brown will be out in front on this saying no.
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:43.600]   In fact, it was the algorithm in some human curation of these stories in an effort to keep
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:46.240]   this stuff out of the mainstream media. It's really a PR job.
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:53.760]   Right. That's what it seems like. And helping bridge that gap. And by putting a conservative,
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:24:00.240]   she's a conservative, by putting a conservative voice in Facebook to bridge that gap, I think
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:05.440]   Zuckerberg takes this seriously. I think there was a lot of pushback from the conservative media
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:11.280]   when this all was unfolding back in the fall. But to your point, I mean, look what happened.
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:15.920]   I mean, an overwhelming response. And a lot of people believe that Donald Trump won the election
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:20.720]   because of Facebook, in large part, not only from his ads and the way that they were able to gather
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:26.640]   these smaller donations and drive the narrative on Facebook, showing up in these small towns
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:30.800]   and being able to get the message out about it. Facebook was one of the reasons that pushed him
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:36.080]   over the edge significantly. So, yeah, and I don't think it was fake news at all.
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:43.120]   I think it is probably the largest media provider in the world.
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:48.640]   I don't think it was fake news at all. I think it was really entirely new and strange frontier.
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:53.600]   We're already seeing in the past few weeks all these changes to their video algorithm.
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:57.360]   And you've been noticing the way in which videos are showing up differently now in the news feed,
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:00.400]   the way in which you can interact with videos in the news feed is different.
[01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:06.320]   I also think it's incumbent upon these publishers, though, to not whine in their own soup,
[01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:12.160]   because they have the opportunity to be doing and providing great content and then gathering up
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:16.800]   their own audience on their own, being able to gather email addresses and market directly to
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:22.720]   those people on their website by providing value. And now Facebook is enabling them to
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:27.840]   gather that information right with a new feature called leads that they just rolled out not too long
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:33.840]   ago. So, in the Facebook news, in the Facebook ads manager being able to use that feature called
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:39.440]   leads so you can gather leads directly. That was an answer to this exact issue from publishers.
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:45.200]   Being able to gather email addresses and market to people. So, Facebook's listening to publishers
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:55.200]   complaints. They've kicked me off. What? Well, I used to promote individual stories. You can
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:00.640]   spend nine bucks and a story that might get a few dozen viewers. They always ask me,
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:03.440]   would you like to promote that? You could just promote that. Just give us some money.
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:08.880]   So, I was doing it and I was spending hundreds of bucks a month doing it and then suddenly
[01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:15.360]   boom, I got a little with no explanation, got a thing saying that that had been turned off.
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:23.760]   I had violated some TOS and that's very confusing Facebook. You're just buying ads.
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:31.120]   And then they say, if you want to find out what's gone wrong, contact us and that doesn't work.
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:36.800]   I think what happened was talking about a confused company. I mean, that's crazy because they're
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:42.000]   always telling me I should be doing that. Right. I think someone complained and I suspect it was
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:54.240]   CNN because I was taking CNN video and excerpting 30 seconds and posting it and I guess that's a
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:59.120]   violation. And I'm not sure there's any way out of it. I think I'm permanently banned from spending
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:03.600]   money on their ad business. I'm going to tell you something. That's okay. That's okay.
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:10.640]   I was looking at how many subscribers I got through that and it was zero.
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:15.600]   Yeah, it didn't work. I think there's smart money spent on Facebook and there's dumb
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:20.080]   money spent on Facebook and when I was saying and I think you couldn't hear me Clayton. So,
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:24.480]   you put on the regular headphones. Can you hear me now? Now I can't hear you. So,
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:32.160]   there we go. Now you're working. So, what I was saying while you were and I apologize for
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:37.280]   interrupting you, but I'll say it now is I don't I have come to the conclusion that fake news had
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:40.880]   nothing to do with it one way or the other. I know that was a big issue and blah, blah, blah.
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:46.640]   Fake news is just a generally problem on the internet. There's a lot of conspiracy theories and
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:51.360]   nonsense on the internet. That's not particularly a problem of worse on Facebook than anywhere else.
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:58.000]   But I do think what Trump did very well was use Facebook ads very well and Facebook targeting
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.320]   very well brilliantly so much so that I've come to the opinion that the kind of thing you were doing
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:08.320]   Philip is the dumb money people spent on Facebook. I'm sure they're glad to accept that until you
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:14.720]   whatever, break some rule. But the smart money that's spent on Facebook is very savvy and that
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:18.960]   Jared Kushner and the San Antonio operation they had down there with Cambridge Analytica,
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:27.280]   they used it in a way such a canny way that it really establishes a whole new precedent for how
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:32.160]   Facebook can be used for advertising. And I apologize. I think I was saying something similar to that
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:37.040]   and maybe I had an audio issue here. But I was what I think the fake news thing is who cares?
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:42.800]   The real story was Donald Trump's leveraging of Facebook ads. That was the real story.
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:47.760]   Exactly. Maybe my audio dropped out. No, no, but maybe I'm agreeing with you and anyway,
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:51.760]   that's good. Good. Yeah, but like showing up to these events and being able to like target,
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:56.240]   micro target these areas and get that message out. I think the fake news thing is, you know,
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:29:01.520]   that was a small portion of this. And those who wanted to believe those stories were already
[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:06.560]   voting a certain way anyway. Exactly. Right. But being able to leverage those ads,
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:14.480]   micro targeting, there is no better. I mean, I do a lot with this. There is no better ad platform.
[01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:18.960]   And being able, like I said, giving the power of the publishers this idea of leads and being able
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:23.760]   to generate now in the ads manager leads and all of these things, being able to retarget. So,
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:29.120]   if someone watches 25% of a video that you publish, being able to run an ad to those people as a
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:34.080]   warm audience, being able to run that ads to people who watch 50% of one of your ads, videos,
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:41.520]   75% of one of your videos. So imagine rolling a campaign ad out and someone watches 75% of that
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:45.440]   video and it's five minutes long. Well, that tells you a lot about the type of person who
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:50.960]   sat through most of that video. Now, maybe run a separate ad to that person. And then I can
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:56.400]   dive a little bit more deeply. So there's power in local businesses. But I think for publishers
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:30:00.320]   too, just stop whining about it and actually realize how to leverage this platform.
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:04.880]   Ultimately, Facebook doesn't want you, they don't want you putting up clickbait-y things that drive
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:10.480]   you off of the platform and have a bad experience because it reflects poorly on them. They want
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:15.280]   you to spend as much time as possible inside of Facebook. So I think Zuckerberg is taking this
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:20.720]   seriously. He doesn't want any news publisher complaining about the way in which they're
[01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:24.560]   content is being perceived. If he has these meetings with them and he's taking it seriously. So I
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:29.920]   think this Campbell Brown thing is Zuckerberg realizing the power that he wields at this point.
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:34.160]   I'm not saying it's right or wrong. I'm just saying, I think he realizes he's the biggest publisher in
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:40.880]   the world. Of course, the other story is that how much Facebook and Google are going to eat the ad
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:49.040]   dollar going forward. I wonder why any advertiser savvy enough to use Google and Facebook and to
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:55.920]   really target their advertising and to shape their advertising for different sectors and different
[01:30:55.920 --> 01:31:02.560]   niches would want to use mass media advertising at all or even podcast advertising. These guys are
[01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:10.320]   going to swallow the earth with their advertising platform. I worry. How do you see that working out?
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:15.520]   Can you explain that? Well, I think it requires... The goodness is, don't tell anybody I said this,
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:20.320]   but advertisers and agencies aren't the swiftest people in the world and they're also not the
[01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:24.320]   early adopters. So there may be a little slow to adopt this. But I think what you're seeing is that
[01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:29.200]   somebody savvy enough, like Jared Kushner and Trump were, to really work Facebook,
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:37.280]   he spent a fraction of what Clinton spent and was able to be much more effective than broadcast
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:43.920]   media ads by being very smart with his Facebook ads. I think Google gives you some of the same
[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:49.360]   kind of targeting and probably works just as well. Both Google and Facebook, by the way,
[01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:55.600]   ad sales taken off. I think it's just a matter of time before you start to see them go up as
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:32:01.840]   other media broadcast media, particularly goes down. Those still be good news. Pepsi
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:06.960]   doesn't have any way to target its advertising, so they're still going to buy Super Bowl ads.
[01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:13.440]   I think increasingly as advertisers and agencies get smart, they're going to really demand this
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:18.880]   kind of very fine slicing of the audience. You're right. You're right. Absolutely. I think the
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:24.880]   riches are in the niches. That's why you're seeing the power of these podcasts. When I
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:30.720]   launched mine, I wanted to do very specific. It wasn't broad, very specific. And then that
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:35.840]   audience, even if it's smaller, is very specific. And then you know the advertisers that are willing
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:40.560]   to come on for that very specific niche. And that's the power of Facebook advertising. Look,
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:45.520]   if you're a small business for crying out loud, listening right now, and you've got a small ice
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:52.480]   cream shop or you're a chiropractor in a town, why are you not on Facebook leveraging that?
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:59.600]   In that one zip code or those two zip codes being able to run video ads, small, inexpensive,
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:05.360]   30, 42 minute video ads, just talking, not even ads necessarily, but running videos and then
[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:10.080]   boosting posts and then running ads later about your chiropractic practice and just talking about
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:13.840]   you know, shoveling right now. It's all the heavy snow. And here's how you can damage your back.
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:17.120]   Yeah, there you go. Exactly. Right. And then in that town, being able to
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:22.400]   retarget to those people in that specific town who watch those videos, offer them an incentive
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:26.800]   for a free consultation to come in. You can't do that on television. It's amazing.
[01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:29.520]   The one I do have to go ahead. I do have to go ahead.
[01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:36.800]   issue, Leo, with something you said, I do think fake news was a factor. I mean, I could list 20
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:41.280]   factors that tipped. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Very close election.
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:48.240]   It's very good. And I think probably the fact that he could tweet and then everybody in the media
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:55.280]   would then, you know, write about it was probably a bigger factor than whatever targeting they did
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:34:02.000]   in Facebook. I think Fox News played a huge role in this election, not Clayton. Oh, I've been turned
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:06.400]   off. Yeah, we I'm sorry, Philip, you can't be on the show anymore. Thank you for joining us. Goodbye.
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:09.520]   There we go. We got it.
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:20.880]   No, I'm obviously I'm kidding. I kid I'm a hitter. I you know, I agree. But look, there was a
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:26.160]   masterful media strategy all around and using and no one can deny that Trump's use of Twitter
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:34.800]   is absolutely masterful. And in effect, with the help of fake news and a lot of other things,
[01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:39.440]   I think mainstream media was was sidelined in this election. And
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:45.440]   you know, it worked. It worked. Somebody said, yeah, but he didn't get the popular, you know,
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:48.880]   it doesn't matter. He got the right votes. He got the votes that all he needed was enough votes
[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:52.000]   to get elected. He got the votes. And I don't think I don't even
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:56.640]   think it was badly matter. They were all out here. I do think
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:35:03.840]   even the Russian hacking probably wasn't as big a factor as the use of Facebook, to be honest
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:08.080]   with you. But yeah, I think the FBI may have been the biggest factor. But
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:14.000]   Comey might Comey certainly didn't hurt. That didn't hurt. Yeah. Yeah. Here's the most interesting.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.600]   I don't want to get in this conversation. We go this conversation too much. I'm not it's it's
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:24.560]   long over. I do I do speaking politics. I'll find this very intriguing and talk about a conspiracy
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:31.520]   theory. But TechCrunch pointed this out. There the Facebook rejiggering of its stock plan
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:39.920]   has which was ostensibly to allow Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan to donate a lot to charity
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:45.520]   had the side effect. And TechCrunch, John Constein doing a great job on TechCrunch,
[01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:50.800]   examined the SEC documents, turns out Zuck can continue to
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:36:00.080]   run Facebook while serving in government. And the most interesting story I've heard and the one that
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:07.600]   it probably is, you know, spec highly speculative is that Mark Zuckerberg's ultimate ambition is
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:11.840]   to become president of the United States. Yeah, I heard that story this week. I don't know. I mean,
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:16.720]   from his comments during the speech, it seemed I don't know. You read his comments and it seemed
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:22.720]   like a pretty big stretch. But well, he'd be smart to be cagey at this point. Right.
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:29.600]   You know, can we see a Mark Zuckerberg, you know, presidential run in 2020? I don't know.
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:35.520]   You know, again, we live in an age of television. We live in an age of speeches and energy and
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:41.600]   we're not, you know, as Mike Douglas is Michael Douglas, his character in the American president
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:47.680]   talked about that if there were cameras around when FDR was there, you know, would this country
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:52.400]   elect someone in a wheelchair? And the problem is Mark Zuckerberg is not a dynamic speaker.
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:57.200]   You know, he's not he's not great on the stage to. I bet he's working on that.
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:37:01.520]   Bet you anything. He went out. He's going out this his plan this year in 2017 is to talk to people
[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:07.200]   in 50 states. That is that that is totally the kind of thing a president, a candidate for president
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:14.320]   would say in, you know, four years before the run. The fact that he embraced religion
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:19.440]   is exactly the kind of thing you need to do if you're going to run for president this country.
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:23.440]   And you appoint a conservative voice to be your public face.
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:27.920]   All right. It's a conspiracy. Who's part of the Campbell Brown? First of all, he doesn't need to
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:32.880]   travel anywhere. He could literally stay in his house and never leave. He's got Facebook.
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:40.320]   He can get his message out there. Precisely. Precisely. All right. Let's take it. I know it's
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:43.920]   no, you know, there's no merit in it at all. But I just love this. I love the idea.
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:49.600]   Would you vote for him? Like, I like Alec Baldwin for 220. No, I wouldn't vote for Alec Baldwin.
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:52.720]   He's a hothead. Would you vote for Zuckerberg? He's a technocrat.
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:38:02.640]   No. I think I don't know. I if he can't be emperor of the world,
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:06.160]   maybe it's a stepping stone. Think of the presidency as a stepping stone.
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:11.600]   Look at these guys like Mark Zuckerberg. He's already present. I mean, he's already
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:17.200]   wields that power. Why would he want to stoop to the level of the the office of the American president?
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:22.320]   Not to mention the pay cut, right? Right. The pay cut. But it's so people think that it's
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:25.840]   no, I know why he would want to do it though. I think he I do think that Mark,
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:32.240]   whatever you think about him, cares about a lot of things. And I think Mark would
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:35.200]   wants to change the world. I really think Mark wants to change the world.
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:38.160]   But my point is look at somebody like Elon, look at somebody like Mark Zuckerberg,
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:42.640]   they can wield more power and change more things. I mean, to Steve Jobs point,
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:48.640]   by being outside of the government and being able to affect change on a global scale in ways that
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:53.360]   in ways that being the American presidency is constitutionally limited, it's really limited
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:58.320]   office. No, in fact, in fact, Obama said he really it's the power to persuade more than anything else.
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:02.800]   Right. That's what yeah, historians and constitutional scholars would talk about.
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:05.600]   The office of the presidency is the power to persuade and that's really it.
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:13.440]   Let's take a break and we will come back with more Philip Elmer to wit from ped 3.0.com. Actually,
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:17.440]   I shouldn't say 3.0 because that would add a dot. So it's pd 3o.com.
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:24.880]   And I bought a bunch of other domains. I bought apple 30 dot co apple 30 dot net.
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:31.760]   I tried to buy apple 30 dot com, but it was owned by someone in Iran who was willing to sell it to
[01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:36.480]   me, but there's no way to send money to Iran sitting there. You see?
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:39.600]   These sanctions hurt even the little people.
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:47.600]   Also from Fox and friends are good friend Clayton Morris, tech guru, tech writer,
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:53.200]   podcaster and journalist. Actually, I do want to talk about a big anniversary. Tomorrow
[01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:57.920]   is a massive anniversary. We'll talk about that in a second. Stamps.com are sponsored today.
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:06.160]   Now there's one thing that the US government does very well every weekday and Saturdays too.
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:10.960]   A uniformed employee of the federal government comes to your door. Did you know that?
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:14.160]   Sometimes they stop on the street and delivers you mail.
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:19.760]   Mail is still huge, but one thing that they haven't really worked out too well,
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:25.680]   the lines at the post office. So I want to show you how you can use the power of the post office,
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:33.200]   but not go to the post office. Stamps.com is amazing. It lets you buy and print real US
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:38.720]   postage without a postage meter, without a trip to the post office ever. You just go to Stamps.com
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:44.160]   and you can print it with your printer and your computer. More than that, with this USB scale,

[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:52.880]   the various ways you can mail it says, "Hey, this might be a lot cheaper if you want media mail,"
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:57.920]   that kind of thing. They even fill out forms. Stamps.com will fill out forms for you. Customs

[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:29.040]   You'll be doing me a favor. We're going to take a break, come back with more of Phillip Elmer
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:33.760]   Dewitt, Clayton Morris. But first, this was a big week for us. It was a little quiet around the
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:39.680]   studio because the whole gang went down to CES for our CES coverage. Take a look at what you might
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:47.520]   have missed previously on TWIT. I've waited all my life to meet this man in person. To me,
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:56.160]   this is a human being. That's it. Of all the people I've ever met, Dickey Dee is one of them.
[01:42:56.160 --> 01:43:02.800]   TWIT Live Specials. It's loud. There's a lot of energy and I'm on top of an RV with a Jacuzzi
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:08.160]   and a helicopter. I'm Father Robert Ballasare, the Digital Jesuit, and here's the best of CES.
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:17.520]   Security now. The first story is the Internet of Caddling Things. A man was found dead. The
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:26.640]   suspect in his home had an Amazon Echo. Amazon received a warrant requesting any information
[01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:34.240]   that the Echo might have picked up and that Amazon had on their servers. TWIT. Say hello to the NSA.
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:40.560]   They're listening. It's very easy to pair to your phone. Bosses AirPods. Bosses my name. I tell
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:44.400]   Siri to call me boss. So that's why they call him boss. Sometimes when you're around a therapist,
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:49.440]   you worry that everything you say is somehow horribly revealing. We're not on all the time.
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:53.120]   So you're not thinking, oh, clearly he has 30 issues because he made his phone call on boss.
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:44:01.200]   You're not saying that. No. No. I know you're saying that. It's okay. Great week up ahead,
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:07.680]   Meghan Moroni. What'll you be covering on TNT this week? Thanks, Leo. Here is a look at just a
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:14.080]   few of the stories we'll be watching in the week ahead. CES has come and gone, but the product
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:19.440]   announcements have not. HTC sent out invites for an event this week prominently featuring the letter
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:26.000]   U, which has some rumor mongers saying the company will release its flagship HTC Ocean Note as the
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:33.520]   HTC U Ultra. Also on January 12, Nintendo will finally unveil the Switch, a hybrid console for
[01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:38.240]   your living room or for you to bring with you to a cocktail party. If you attend cocktail parties
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:42.400]   where you don't feel like a total weirdo playing the Legend of Zelda breath of the wild on your
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:48.320]   portable Nintendo, we will learn about the game, including pricing, games and availability at a
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:54.080]   Nintendo press conference this week. In search news this week on January 10, Google will start
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:58.880]   punishing sites that try to annoy us with pop ups. According to the official Google Webmaster
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:06.080]   central blog pages that use intrusive interstitials may not rank as highly in search. And finally,
[01:45:06.080 --> 01:45:12.000]   this week is the North American Auto Show in Detroit where we expect to see VW's new autonomous
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:19.520]   electric concept car and Google Waymo's self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivan. Jason Howell and I will
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:24.240]   cover all of this in a whole lot more all week on Tech News today, each and every weekday at 4
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:30.720]   PM Pacific. That's a look at the week ahead. Back to you Leo. Thank you Megan. Now we continue
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:37.840]   with this week in tech, Clayton Morris, Philip Elmer DeWitt. How about this story? Tomorrow,
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:50.800]   January 9th, 10 years ago, Steve Jobs announces a widescreen iPod, an internet communicator
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:57.680]   and a phone. All three in one. You were you must have you both must have been at that event, right?
[01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:04.080]   I was in New York. Were you there, Clayton? No, I wasn't. What? I wasn't. I missed it. I know.
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:12.480]   So sad. It is one of the great moments in tech history, right? And we all knew that he was going
[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:18.960]   to announce an iPhone. We didn't know the name and he still kind of fooled us. I got to find that
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:25.120]   video and see if I can find the video because it's I changed jobs after he did it. I left Time
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:32.400]   Magazine and went to San Francisco to cover Apple. Did you? Daily basis. You saw something big happening.
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:39.200]   Well, finally, yeah, it had been a long time. I used to be the tech editor and there would be
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:46.640]   guys in San Francisco pitching Apple stories at the at the end of the Gil Emilio era. And I just
[01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:53.760]   didn't see it. I didn't see Apple. That was a bad time. Yeah. Here you go. Steve Jobs. In 2001.
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:47:01.200]   We introduced the first iPod. Maybe I'll jump ahead a little bit. And it didn't just. I was
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:05.840]   sitting right about there. It didn't just change the way we all listened to a Scott Bourne. It changed
[01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:14.720]   the entire music industry. Merlin Mann, Alex Lindsay. We're all sitting there. Today. We're introducing
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:22.880]   three revolutionary products of this class. I get chills still, don't you? Don't you? The first one.
[01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:28.800]   One. Is a wide screen iPod with touch controls.
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:37.680]   Now, you know, you're you're in the press. So you're trying not to applaud, but it's hard not to get
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:43.040]   excited. Did you know where you're going with this? Well, we we suspected an iPhone. I did not know
[01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:48.320]   where he was going with this. Yeah, because you're thinking yourself. Okay, wait a second. Yeah,
[01:47:48.320 --> 01:47:52.000]   you're going to what's happening here. This misdirection is this kind of brilliant showman.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:56.640]   Brilliant. Is a revolutionary moment. That's the thing we were waiting for. We thought,
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:00.320]   oh, he's got three things. You never knew this Steve, right?
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:05.680]   It's time to do this. And the third.
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:10.400]   Is a breakthrough internet communications device.
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:17.520]   Okay, great, great. Three things. Tell me about number two. Yeah, yeah. Three things.
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:24.800]   A wide screen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:37.680]   internet communications device. An iPod. A phone. And an internet communicator. An iPod.
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:44.160]   A phone. Yeah, we're getting it. Are you getting it? Yes.
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:52.320]   These are not three separate devices. This is one device.
[01:48:52.320 --> 01:49:02.960]   And we are calling it iPhone. No one even knew what they were going to call it. Today.
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:11.200]   Today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone. And here it is.
[01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:17.360]   And of course, a little joke there. It's an iPod with a dial on it. No.
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:22.000]   That's also, you know, like that takes some guts. Actually, here it is, but we're going to
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:29.760]   leave it there for now. Oh, it's in his pocket. That is that is amazing stagecraft.
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:35.680]   Did you see the leaked Verge stuff? This would the images and video. Yeah, from on the Verge with
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:39.920]   the click wheel iPhone prototype that they built and what it looked like with the software.
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:47.440]   So, but that's where you see Steve Jobs right saying, oh, that's no, we're not doing that.
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:57.360]   I have to say, he's missed. He really is missed. And even as exciting as that moment was, and
[01:49:57.360 --> 01:50:03.360]   we were all just, you know, what champing at the bit to get to hear about this new phone,
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:08.160]   even then we had no idea how important this product was going to be.
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:14.560]   Right. And the three things he named, one of them, it's actually not a very good phone.
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:21.840]   But the internet communicator part of it turned out to be the breakthrough. That's what really
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:28.560]   took off. Yeah, right. I mean, you pick the wrong thing to put in the name, obviously.
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:35.840]   Who cares about the phone nowadays? But at the time, it was replacing cell phones, right?
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:42.720]   And it was one of those things improving the phone component of the iPhone took years
[01:50:42.720 --> 01:50:48.640]   to nail down. Well, and you've got to read the amazing stories by the engineers.
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:56.080]   We now know we're sitting in that audience taking a shot every time the demo, one item in the demo
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:01.280]   worked there part of the demo work to go, Oh, thank God, because apparently, first of all,
[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:06.720]   that thing in his pocket, there were only two of them. They didn't work very well. And they had
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:13.360]   the second one in case the first one just died. And jobs had to follow a very narrow path in the
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:20.000]   demo. One's one mistake. The thing would crash. Yeah, it was like, he had to follow that golden path
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:26.000]   and he didn't. The whole thing was done. The whole demo was done. But again, a testament to this man's
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:31.120]   incredible ability. I mean, all of this, he knows all of this. This could go very wrong.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:37.760]   And yet, man, he had such mastery of the room. I mean, pretty amazing. We did is fascinating to
[01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:44.880]   learn later how how difficult this is the click wheel prototype that came for Sonny Dixon, who is
[01:51:44.880 --> 01:51:53.520]   well known Apple leaker. I think this is kind of funny. And he also says there's a patent from
[01:51:53.520 --> 01:52:03.840]   2006 that shows his, you know, some Apple, some Apple employee obviously had this video leaked it.
[01:52:03.840 --> 01:52:10.240]   Right. Be able to scroll through the scroll wheel and go through new new messages and phone and
[01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:17.520]   it's interesting. The acorn logo there. I don't know what's I don't know. Acorn was the inspiration
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:22.960]   for arm. Remember, that was the acorn computer that arm was created for with in conjunction with
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:28.880]   Apple Apple was one of the owners of one. Really interesting. I'm glad they didn't do this, aren't
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:35.840]   you? Yeah. I'm sad. I didn't get to see that live, but to be able to watch that so many times.
[01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:40.800]   And I did get to see the the iPad. Yeah, that was the last one I saw.
[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:45.200]   We're streaming live, right? You know,
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:52.720]   help a help a brother out here, Clayton. I'm sitting in the auditorium. You guys,
[01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:57.760]   CNN, everybody's got cameras. They're going like this. I'm a little podcaster. I got a laptop. I
[01:52:57.760 --> 01:53:03.520]   thought, I'll just turn it around. I got a camera and the thing. I'll just stream it. Right.
[01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:09.200]   Nobody said by the way, this is all speculation. Nobody ever said anything then has ever said
[01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:13.520]   anything since. And in my opinion, I shouldn't bring this up because as soon as Apple opens a
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:18.400]   spaceship campus and has their first event in that spaceship campus, I'm going to be on my knees
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:23.920]   begging for an invitation to that. Or you'll be flying over with a new drone that you've built.
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:31.440]   Yeah. Well, and I am and also very grateful that I saw Steve Jobs at his peak at his finest.
[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:35.360]   And I think that iPhone is clearly that announcement is clearly amazing. 10 years ago,
[01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:42.320]   I missed to beat their Leo. They kicked you. They don't invite you. You don't know the story.
[01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:46.640]   Everybody watches Twitter. So no, I've never that was the last time I got invited to an Apple
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:51.200]   event was that iPad event. And I've always had the hypothesis because first of all, I'm in the
[01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:57.600]   Apple official Apple video sitting here with my chin on my lap. I'm streaming it. So busted.
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:54:02.240]   And I do think Steve gave me the stink eye at one point. I'm not I can't not absolutely
[01:54:02.240 --> 01:54:08.000]   certain. But I think he looked at me and went and then looked and went on. So I was like right
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:13.520]   there. So but and then I never got invited again. So that's my thesis. And so we all know that
[01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:18.160]   there is a blacklist for sure. And many people have been on that blacklist. But even Gizmodo gets
[01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:23.120]   to go to Apple events again. They're the ones who were blocked. You should try right and not
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:28.640]   to Steve darling. I'll get in. I just have to ask. I don't think that I'm really on the blacklist.
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:33.520]   I think I just, you know, I just have to ask. You fell off the list. I fell off the list.
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:37.840]   There's a big difference. Yeah, it's not like you stole an iPhone and published stories about
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:44.320]   it. That's what Gizmodo did. They're invited. Christina Warren is on their list.
[01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:52.320]   Apple did have a good good holiday season. 44% of all device activations according to, you know,
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:57.840]   people who monitor this thing, not Apple. Yeah, although although that was down from 49% the year
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:06.000]   before. So it wasn't quite the same thing is gaining on Apple every year. And they this the
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:12.400]   in the graph you're showing there the year before Samsung was at 19% and Apple was at 49.
[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:17.840]   Okay. This is from Flurry. Flurry monitors this kind of thing. And I think because their
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:25.680]   analytics are actually called from apps, they're pretty accurate. They're actually called, if you
[01:55:25.680 --> 01:55:31.280]   sign up for Flurry, they get to look at every receipt that gets emailed to you. That's what it
[01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:36.000]   is. It's like slice. That's right. There's another company that does the apps. Is it Adobe? Somebody
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:42.400]   else does apps. Right. Flurry is monitoring your shipments. Yeah. Yeah. I'd like to see how much
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:48.160]   of those holiday sales in general from Apple were Apple Watch. I saw a lot of people at the local
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:54.160]   Apple store gathered around using their Christmas money afterwards buying Apple watches. Be curious
[01:55:54.160 --> 01:55:58.000]   to see how much, wish we knew those numbers, but we don't get to see those numbers. Tim says it was
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:03.920]   the what the best three days ever for Apple Watch, huge growth. And I think they dropped the price
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:08.800]   a hundred bucks on the series one. And I think that might have helped at 259. That's at that point,
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:13.120]   maybe it's something people would consider if they've been waiting to get one. He said,
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:18.800]   the AirPods are a runaway success. We're making them as fast as we can. That we know.
[01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:27.200]   Yeah. I know. I tweeted this. Apple tells CNBC nothing new. Yeah. Right.
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:32.240]   We know you're making them as fast as you can. The question is, how fast can you make them?
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:36.560]   In fact, we have heard rumors from the supply chain that Apple's actually going to cut
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:42.640]   iPhone production by as much as 10%. This is CNET from CES 2017. Oh, Lord.
[01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:46.880]   Here are the stories that we don't even see where this news is coming from. I don't even see
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:54.080]   the video that's playing. Thank you, CNET. Knock it off. That 10% cut was another story that I
[01:56:54.080 --> 01:57:01.520]   thought just got played completely wrong. Last year, the same people, the Nikkei Asian Review,
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:09.200]   reported that Apple was going to cut production by 30%. And that turned out to be right. And it
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:15.200]   presades to a terrible second quarter. And the beginning of that year that
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:21.520]   cost Tim Cook 15% of his bonus. But this year, it fell 10%, which is a lot less than 30%.
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:28.480]   So it was actually it was a good news for Apple, but it got played as bad news because that's
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:34.080]   what people click on. There's ways to interpret it also. Maybe they made enough.
[01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:44.560]   So every after the December quarter is the big quarter, they always reduce their
[01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:49.120]   orders after the December quarter. And they might have to forget, they crank them out so fast that
[01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:54.400]   there's not been a supply problem. So maybe that's it. And people forget that what Tim Cook
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:58:01.360]   prides himself on. He has this weird sort of idiosyncrasy, steeped in spreadsheets and what
[01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:10.000]   stores have what items left on shelves. And he's obsessed with the idea that not having an excess
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:14.480]   of supply in a back room somewhere that doesn't need to be there. Is there a possible where we can
[01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:20.880]   get to that zero mark? We don't have just in time. Just in time zero. Can I get into that nice little
[01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:26.640]   gray area between having too much and not enough? And will people be happier? Will we hear griping
[01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:31.360]   about it? You see that every time one of these new products is rolling out Apple TV starts to
[01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:37.120]   dry up on store shelves. So he, you know, under Steve Jobs rain, Tim Cook was very much in control
[01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:42.160]   of making sure that as those things were drying up, the new products were starting to to proliferate.
[01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:47.920]   Huge app sales too, right? For the app store recorded, how much was the app store?
[01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:52.320]   Sales are 44 billion or no, I can't be right.
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:59.600]   28 billion. 28 billion dollars. Is that right? Yeah. In the app store,
[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:07.680]   Apple collected a third of that, which is eight and a half billion dollars in 2016. That's a growth
[01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:16.160]   of 40% all Mario run. Probably. Probably. To download it on five devices, you had to pay five
[01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:22.880]   times. Oh, the record day was January 1st of this year. It's a funny day. Yeah. Well, I want to hear
[01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:29.280]   your theory, but 240 million dollars in purchases. That's the largest single day sales in an app
[01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:34.640]   store history quarter of a billion dollars. What's the story? Why are people buying them
[01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:39.280]   New Year's Day? Everything's closed. Oh, that's all you can do. Right.
[01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:44.000]   Gotta play that Pokemon. I guess a lot of people got iPhones for Christmas.
[01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:49.760]   Right. Right. It's a Sunday. It would be the. You'd think it would be the day after Christmas
[01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:56.400]   that all the apps would get bought. It's a bit of a mystery. They didn't report what
[01:59:56.400 --> 02:00:01.760]   happened in all the days around January 1st. That happened to be the peak.
[02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:09.520]   I'm very excited about another announcement at CES. We've been waiting for Samsung
[02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:14.400]   to confirm the Chromebook Pro. We'd seen leaks of it and the Chromebook Plus.
[02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:19.760]   What is interesting is that it's not merely a Samsung product. Apparently,
[02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:25.760]   made in partnership directly with Google, which would answer the question where what's
[02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:30.480]   going to replace Google's Chromebook Pixel. It might be this much less expensive than
[02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:35.680]   Chromebook Pixel, but still expensive for Chromebook starting at $450. I immediately ordered the
[02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:42.000]   Plus, which is the ARM version. That will be available first at Best Buy and supposedly in
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:48.880]   about a month. I will get it. They sell so many of these into schools. They're really eating apples
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:54.640]   lunch. Not just Apple, Microsoft. Although they're completely replacing Windows machines.
[02:00:54.640 --> 02:01:03.360]   What's interesting is this is, I think this is going to be a killer product. It folds over,
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:09.920]   becomes a tablet, has a pen, a Samsung's famous for their pens, but because this will support,
[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:15.840]   and you can see it right here at the Play Store, this means this will be a both an Android tablet
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:22.160]   and a Chromebook. I think that's coming out of software. That's very interesting.
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:27.040]   What we'll see from Apple in 10.3 for the iPad,
[02:01:27.040 --> 02:01:35.280]   big move. We need to see some big updates for iPad, I think, and whether or not we'll see that
[02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:41.280]   in the spring, maybe Apple shifts to the spring timetable for talking about iPad
[02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:48.320]   and relegates the fall to iPhone. I think it comes down to software, as it does with this Chromebook.
[02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:54.880]   Where are those really killer apps that make you want to stay on an iPad or a Chromebook with a
[02:01:54.880 --> 02:02:01.840]   pencil? These enterprise level apps, these pro level apps that I'd love to see on the iPad Pro.
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:08.880]   I mean, that's my main computer now. I run my whole company on this little guy.
[02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:15.520]   That's Apple's hope, I believe, is that they really want the iPad to eventually take over for
[02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:19.280]   the MacBook and the Macintosh and become its primary computer.
[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:26.160]   It's the reason why Pro-users, Pro-Mac, use your things that Tim Cook doesn't understand,
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:33.040]   doesn't know what the Pro-users need. Yeah, this Surface Studio is exactly what Pro-users
[02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:39.280]   were hoping. Apple would do something as innovative as this. Incidentally, sales on this are tiny,
[02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:45.600]   30,000, apparently, according to some sources. Nothing like Apple Mac sales, and yet,
[02:02:45.600 --> 02:02:53.520]   even at CES this week, all these interesting, innovative, unique PC, form factors,
[02:02:54.640 --> 02:03:02.480]   much faster laptops, much more better battery life, no touch bar, nobody in the world is
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:07.200]   making a touch bar about Apple. I think for good reason, that thing is a... What do you do? Do you
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:11.600]   like your touch bar, Philip? Do you have one? I don't have one. I don't get one. I'm using my
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:21.440]   MacBook Air. I like my ports. I also like my touch, and I guess that's one of the reasons I think
[02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:29.200]   iOS is ultimately going to eclipse MacBook. Yeah, the touch bar. I use it once in a while. I more
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:34.160]   use it for touch ID than anything. Yeah, the fingerprint's great. I love the fingerprint.
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:41.120]   But by the way, I don't know if you've experienced this yet, but I am now making more typos because
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:47.360]   I accidentally hit the touch bar all the time, and Siri pops up, or my Spotlight pops up,
[02:03:47.360 --> 02:03:52.400]   and I'm trying to do something here and get out of my way, and this has become an anti-productivity
[02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:58.240]   tool. I'm not happy with it. Do you use it when you're writing to the right words show up in
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:04:04.880]   advance, so you do not have to type in? Philip, you're a touch typist. You don't look at the keyboard?
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:12.880]   And then to glance up and do the autocorrect or to pick those, it's an extra level. It's an
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:16.880]   extra step. I mean, I do like there are certain apps, third party apps, I think, are taking advantage
[02:04:16.880 --> 02:04:23.520]   of it. I love air mail. I use air mail on my iPad. I use air mail on my iPhone. That's my go-to
[02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:28.560]   mail application now, mostly. And they updated for touch bar support, and there's some cool
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:34.240]   bells and whistles inside of that app. So when you're living in an app for a while, and you can
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:39.920]   then customize and experience the touch bar inside of that app, that's when I think it becomes compelling.
[02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:44.000]   Like, for instance, you're living inside a Photoshop, and you're going to be doing certain things
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:49.200]   inside a Photoshop for a long time. That's when I think it becomes compelling. To me, I forget
[02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:53.680]   about it because I'm jumping between apps so often. And it takes on a new skin every time I'm
[02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:58.480]   jumping between apps. And I'm just right, it's unpredictable. And I don't remember where things
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:02.240]   are. And now there's a whole new layout every time. It comes back to what I was talking about before
[02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:09.200]   memory of keyboard shortcuts or gestures on earbuds. You got to get used to these things.
[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:14.240]   And I'm just not used to it. No. I would love to see some sales numbers to know whether they're
[02:05:14.240 --> 02:05:21.920]   selling more of the MacBook Pro without the strip than they sell with the strip. We won't get the
[02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:26.560]  ... Well, unfortunately, if you want the high-end MacBook Pro, you got to get the touch bar.
[02:05:26.560 --> 02:05:31.680]   I tell people, get the one, if you can live with the one without it, it's absolutely better. But
[02:05:31.680 --> 02:05:38.080]   if you want the faster processor, battery life's still an issue, it's unpredictable. That's the worst.
[02:05:38.080 --> 02:05:42.000]   Right? If it were short, I could live with it, but it's not. It's long and short. It's all over the place.
[02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:49.680]   Are you reacting to the Consumer Reports? No, I have one. I've been using it. I bought it right
[02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:56.800]   away and I hate it. I would be so much happier with a modern MacBook Pro on the old design. And
[02:05:56.800 --> 02:06:00.480]   frankly, the same thing with the Mac Pro. I'd have been much happier with the cheese grater
[02:06:00.480 --> 02:06:04.320]   on the old design. I'd have been much more useful. I could upgrade it. I could put more drives in it.
[02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:10.800]   Apple, I think Apple's, in terms of Macintosh, I don't think Apple's doing a very good job.
[02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:16.880]   No invitation for you, Leo. You see? I blew it every time. Let me talk about my mattress,
[02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:20.560]   and we'll wrap this thing up here. Our show today brought to you by Casper,
[02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:27.600]   a credible retailer of online mattresses, premium mattresses at a price, rock bottom price. Why?
[02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:32.080]   They don't have showrooms. They don't need showrooms. Your house is the showroom. So you can't
[02:06:32.080 --> 02:06:36.080]   really tell if you're going to like a mattress by going to the mattress store and lying there in
[02:06:36.080 --> 02:06:40.880]   broad daylight with a salesperson looking at you. You got shoes on. Oh, yeah, this is nice.
[02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:45.840]   Honey, what do you think? Oh, yeah, I guess it's okay. I'm tapping to me every day.
[02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:52.560]   Every time I buy a mattress, you get it home and go, "Yeah, not with the Casper. I love my
[02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:59.440]   Casper." But if you didn't, if after any time in the first 100 days, you said, "You call them up,
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:03.760]   they send a courier. They take it away. They refund you every penny. They want you to try the
[02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:08.160]   mattress in your house the way you should try a mattress. Casper's are made of supportive memory
[02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:15.040]   phones for a phone. They're not made out of phones. For a sleep surface, memory foam with just the
[02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:20.000]   right sink, just the right bounce, it's breathable design. It keeps cool, regulates your temperature,
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:28.160]   never is hot, smells sweet, it's comfortable, and you buy it risk-free at a great price. I don't know
[02:07:28.160 --> 02:07:33.120]   what I could do to convince you. You've got to try this. We got one for our guest room. I bought one
[02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:40.000]   for my son in college because it was affordable. It comes in a compact box. He's on the third floor.
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:44.400]   He'd easily get it up there, open it up. I told him he's a senior. He's had it for a couple of years.
[02:07:44.400 --> 02:07:48.880]   I said, "Just leave it. The next guy will really appreciate the Casper mattress. We'll get you one
[02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:55.440]   for the new place. Casper, it's awesome. Get a Casper mattress today and save $50 on the mattress

[02:08:01.600 --> 02:08:07.040]   We have a Casper. I just bought my mom and dad a Casper for Christmas. They're wanting a new
[02:08:07.040 --> 02:08:12.400]   king-size bed. They've been living in a queen bed forever. I got a little picture of a mattress.
[02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:17.520]   My mom said, "What's this?" "That's so cute." Pick the one you want. I want a Casper. I got our
[02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:22.400]   king size. They do the frame as well. We did the frame. Did the mattress. They have a foundation.
[02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:27.840]   Just ordered it should be there this week. That's nice. Unsolicited testimonial.

[02:08:43.600 --> 02:08:48.640]   you would have ever do this on Fox and Friends. Those guys across the street, CNN, wanted to show
[02:08:48.640 --> 02:08:55.040]   what hacking looked like. They picked a screenshot from Fallout 4.
[02:08:55.040 --> 02:09:02.320]   That's embarrassing. It only took a minute or two for Reddit to figure out,
[02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:06.400]   "That's not hacking. That's a mini game inside Fallout 4."
[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:13.440]   I feel bad. I'm sure you're sympathetic. This is hard. I'm sympathetic because here's what it is.
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:18.240]   Oftentimes, think about the producers. The poor producers are 23 years old, 22 years old.
[02:09:18.240 --> 02:09:24.800]   They're there one in the morning. They're not making any money. They do a Google image search or
[02:09:24.800 --> 02:09:30.800]   something for hacking. They end up pulling up an image from Fallout 4. That's what they use on the
[02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:35.440]   show. Look, yes, there should be extra layers and hoops and hurdles to jump through on this.
[02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:42.800]   I'm sympathetic. The amount of mistakes I make in a four-hour show. These kinds of things are
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:51.760]   bound to happen. I'm just teasing them. Part of the problem is that you're trying to
[02:09:51.760 --> 02:09:58.560]   illustrate abstract concepts in a visual medium. It is the hardest thing in the world.
[02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:05.040]   How do you illustrate? How do you do a visual of hacking? Well, you've got characters on a screen.
[02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:11.440]   They all try to come over with these creative ways to show things in television because you're
[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:14.640]   right. It's a visual medium. You're getting your kids ready for school. You're making pancakes.
[02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:18.880]   You're looking up on the TV and you're trying to illustrate something. I remember years ago,
[02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:24.800]   TV anchor had--this was actually brilliant, but had one of those forklift-style bucket
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:30.080]   raising devices you would stand in to go up and fix whatever telephone.
[02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:35.280]   Oh, that was funny. I saw that. To illustrate the amount of snowfall inside,
[02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:39.120]   yeah, this is how high the snowfall has been this year. It actually was really smart.
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:45.040]   Here's an idea. You can--they held a measuring tape down. Look, you've got to come up.
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:51.040]   Whatever it takes. Whatever it takes.
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:58.320]   Samsung actually is--it's interesting. These are just the season the stems have
[02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:04.640]   followed the bottom of the show. Samsung forecasted a record fourth quarter profit the best in
[02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:12.240]   three years, even despite the Note 7 debacle. It did very well. We are going to find out in a
[02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:17.280]   week or two what happened with the Note 7, by the way. They're going to release the results of its
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:25.200]   investigation. I'll be very interested to see what that is. Probably fueled by the sale of
[02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:29.680]   washing machines. Yeah, it's a big company. Mobile isn't the only thing there.
[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:37.840]   But I'd love to know what's going on with the gear. What are they going to do with
[02:11:37.840 --> 02:11:42.400]   Android Wear and the gear watches? I want to see a Note 8. Maybe they don't call it the Note,
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:48.320]   but they got to release it. The Note 7 was a great phone, all little hiccup.
[02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:54.160]   But it was a really nice phone. I would like to be using it today. I really would.
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:12:03.360]   Russia requires Apple and Google to remove LinkedIn from App Stores. Now, ostensibly,
[02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:10.320]   this is because there's a Russian law requiring that networking services store data on Russian
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:16.400]   citizens in Russia, which doesn't seem unreasonable. It also seems like it makes it easier for them
[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:23.840]   to spy on their citizens in any event. It's something in China. Yeah, with their databases in China
[02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:28.160]   that they have state control over. We know exactly what you're up to, how many children you have,
[02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:34.080]   what websites you run. LinkedIn is now owned by Microsoft and they said they were disappointed.
[02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:39.440]   We didn't talk about the Russian hacking story because I hate to say it, but the
[02:12:39.440 --> 02:12:48.880]   joint agency report, the jar report on Russian hacking, was such a mishmash of useless information
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:54.880]   that I don't think we can say anything with intelligence. This is Kevin Pulsen's really
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:59.280]   great article. We're going to get Kevin on very soon to talk about it. Kevin is a hacker,
[02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:02.080]   so he knows what he's talking about. He's running for the Daily Beast. Now, how the US
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:08.640]   hobbled its hacking case against Russia and enabled truthers. The truth is, according to Kevin,
[02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:16.320]   there is useful information about Russian hacking that might confirm the intelligence agency's
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:23.840]   report, but none of that made it into the joint report, the jar. In fact, the stuff in the jar
[02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:28.560]   was worse than useless. It was actually dangerous. They offered, for instance, according to Kevin
[02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:40.720]   in the report, hundreds of IP addresses that were... Let me find that part of the piece here,
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:49.440]   that were tied to dangerous Russian hacking groups. The problem is that of the... What was it? 800...
[02:13:49.440 --> 02:13:57.200]   There it is. The 876 addresses that they offered, 40% were Tor exit nodes, which anybody could use.
[02:13:57.200 --> 02:14:01.920]   They aren't tied to anybody, and they aren't particularly located in Russia. And worse,
[02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:11.600]   a number of them were Yahoo email servers. And we know what happened there because a Vermont
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:16.800]   utility got this 876 internet IP addresses, did what the Department of Homeland Security said it
[02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:22.560]   should do, which was to scan all of its computers for access to any of these internet addresses.
[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:28.160]   Oh my God, they found a laptop that had accessed one of these addresses. It got in the news that
[02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:33.920]   the Vermont utility had been hacked by the Russians. The laptop had accessed Yahoo email.
[02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:38.960]   Right. There was no sign that it had been hacked. No sign that it had been hacked.
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:47.280]   Right. Just... I think they did themselves... I can only think that the intelligence agencies
[02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:53.440]   offered this really... There's two ways you can go with this. I'm going to go with a way that
[02:14:53.440 --> 02:15:00.560]   they didn't want to reveal operational security and methods, but they should never have released
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:06.000]   a report that was so clearly made up. The other way you were going is that it's propaganda from
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:10.960]   the intelligence agencies. And that they're just... That this is bullshit. I'm sorry.
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:16.080]   I think that your first take on this is probably more the case. I hope so.
[02:15:16.080 --> 02:15:21.840]   Because we saw on Friday, President-elect Trump and President Obama both having two-hour meetings
[02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:28.720]   with the senior intelligence officials on Friday and leaving those meetings, President-elect Trump
[02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:36.960]   was, I think, his comments about it and in meetings subsequent, taking it quite seriously.
[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:40.080]   Good. Because he's poo-pooed this all along.
[02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:45.440]   Right. But clearly he was presented with evidence that satisfied him.
[02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:49.280]   So what he was not able to say publicly, which was all of the stuff that didn't make
[02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:53.920]   into this report is the classified stuff. We had former CIA operatives on our show
[02:15:53.920 --> 02:15:58.000]   who said as much as well. And that's what was handed to President Obama as well. So this public
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.960]   stuff you're right is this mishmash. Should not have released it.
[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:06.080]   And if anything paints a picture of the ability of third party hackers that had nothing to do
[02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:10.560]   with the Russian government in any capacity, it seems like it emboldened them more or it made
[02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:13.680]   the case for them more than it did the Russian government itself.
[02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:21.520]   They pointed to an old publicly available PHP malware. We're actually going to, on security now,
[02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:28.800]   on Tuesday, Steve Gibson found it so fascinating that he wants to delve into this PHP malware.
[02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:36.080]   But even the malware that this joint agency's report came up with was out of date. There's much
[02:16:36.080 --> 02:16:40.800]   more recent malware available, widely available. Anybody wants to buy it, you can just Google it
[02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:48.400]   and you can download it and use it against your friends. So I'm actually very disappointed because
[02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:54.720]   I think this is just more very confusing and bad information. I recommend people check out
[02:16:54.720 --> 02:17:01.120]   Kevin Paulson's article. If anybody knows this stuff, it's Kevin. And I think he makes a good,
[02:17:01.120 --> 02:17:03.680]   much better case than the jar report made.
[02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:12.000]   Yeah, it was embarrassing. Yeah, I don't get it. So I'm going to, we'll kind of defer discussion
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:16.080]   of that Russian hacking until we have some know something better or more useful to say.
[02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:22.720]   Let's see. I think anything else you guys wanted to talk about?
[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:29.600]   I think we covered the highlights. There's certainly a lot more.
[02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:35.680]   Those are the big stories out of CES. I know you want to watch the Golden Globes. Go ahead.
[02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:40.800]   Go ahead. It's OK. No, no, no, no. I had football on right in my office.
[02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:44.320]   You're going to see Packers crush the Giants. That's all I cared about.
[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:48.240]   Oh, you're a Packers fan. No, no, no. I'm an Eagles fan. But that's what I thought.
[02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:52.480]   And he's done the run for. Anytime the Giants lose. Exactly. By the way, you can have Chip Kelly back now.
[02:17:52.480 --> 02:17:58.880]   Yeah, thanks. We're done with him. No, thanks. I'm glad you guys had an exact experience.
[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:07.120]   So we did. Oh, my God. Oh, OK, we won't talk football. Philip, anything else you want to mention?
[02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:13.440]   You do in such a great job on ped30.com of covering the if people want to keep up on Apple News.
[02:18:13.440 --> 02:18:18.240]   And I've been doing that lately for Mac Break Wheelie. I always go to ped30 to see what the big
[02:18:18.240 --> 02:18:23.440]   stories are. And your stuff is great. So keep up the good work. I will be listening to the new show
[02:18:23.440 --> 02:18:27.520]   and see what Gene Munster has to say about his new enterprise.
[02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:36.320]   I'm my volume seems to be off. Can you hear me, Leo? Yeah, I hear you. I was just saying nice things.
[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:42.080]   OK, you know what? Nobody should use these crappy air pods anymore on the show.
[02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:46.640]   It was my microphone. Oh, OK.
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:52.880]   You know, the the only thing I was going to add, you had a link to a lot of rumors about the
[02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:57.760]   next iPhone, the iPhone. Do you really want to say anything? What can we say?
[02:18:57.760 --> 02:19:04.800]   Yeah, I ignore most of it because I don't really care about the OLEDs and the so forth. But
[02:19:04.800 --> 02:19:12.160]   I think the wireless charging, if it works and if they do it right, could be a real deal breaker.
[02:19:12.160 --> 02:19:21.280]   The company that's been talking the most about it, whose name I forget, they've got patents for
[02:19:21.280 --> 02:19:28.240]   contact charging three to five feet away and 18 feet away. And we'll have to see what part of
[02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:33.760]   that surface is in the next iPhone, if that's if they're going to actually do it. But the idea
[02:19:33.760 --> 02:19:40.720]   that you could walk into a room and your iPhone starts charging immediately is quite appealing.
[02:19:40.720 --> 02:19:45.440]   And I think could could change the game. It would if they could make something like that. I
[02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:53.280]   skeptical, it's such a thing can work. And it won't also power my my pacemaker at the same time.
[02:19:53.280 --> 02:19:56.960]   You really don't want to create a room that no one can enter if they have any medical devices
[02:19:56.960 --> 02:20:02.240]   because that would be a problem. Well, we'll have to see. Why is my hip buzzing?
[02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:07.840]   Did not have to live in a cord-free environment would be fantastic. I mean, think about the future
[02:20:07.840 --> 02:20:13.360]   of the iPad in that environment. If that's your main computing device, if your iPhone is your
[02:20:13.360 --> 02:20:18.720]   main, you wouldn't have to ever worry about these stinking cords again and plug into anything,
[02:20:18.720 --> 02:20:21.920]   looking for them, forgetting them on a vacation. Well, I guess you would.
[02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:28.160]   We on the in the Android world have had wireless charging and many devices for a long time,
[02:20:28.160 --> 02:20:32.000]   all the Samsung devices, for instance, although you have to have contact.
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:36.080]   Yeah, but that's not a big chart. You just put it on a stand and it's just keeping it in your
[02:20:36.080 --> 02:20:39.280]   pocket and never worrying about it. That's not going to work. That can't work.
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:44.400]   You think that's actually going to happen? You can't get enough energy through the air to charge.
[02:20:44.400 --> 02:20:48.720]   Didn't Tesla do it on? You can. 15 years ago. Really?
[02:20:48.720 --> 02:20:56.960]   I talked to a guy who's in the business. He's working on this very thing. It is a technology
[02:20:56.960 --> 02:21:03.840]   that they're working on. There's some people who claim that the physics isn't right and that it's
[02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:11.680]   impossible. But there's a company making them. So an Apple making them in such a way that you can buy
[02:21:11.680 --> 02:21:19.120]   it? Not yet. No. What they say is that they're waiting for FCC approval. They've got approval
[02:21:19.120 --> 02:21:24.960]   for the contact because it's going to go through the air. The FCC has to rule on whether it's safe
[02:21:24.960 --> 02:21:35.600]   for three to five feet or 18 feet. Yeah, Tesla. Over 100 years ago, with his large Tesla tower
[02:21:35.600 --> 02:21:44.000]   using wireless transfer of energy. He was run out of town because the power companies were like,
[02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:52.480]   nope, we want to be able to control this. The Tesla's tower. In 1904, to draw millions of
[02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:57.120]   ults of electricity through the air and then feed it out to cities. Wireless.
[02:21:57.120 --> 02:22:01.520]   I mean, I know you beam was the company that was pushing this and they've been kind of debunked.
[02:22:01.520 --> 02:22:12.560]   I think Energis is the one I've been following. I will Energis. Okay.
[02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:23.680]   Okay. We'll watch with interest. Okay. Anything you want to say to watch out for
[02:22:23.680 --> 02:22:30.400]   Clayton Morris in the weeks and days to come? To watch out for anything you're
[02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:34.800]   excited about? Watch for your podcast. Oh, sure. Yeah. If you
[02:22:34.800 --> 02:22:41.120]   morris.com. Yeah. If you go to or morrisinvest.com, we've got the podcast. But by the way, I just
[02:22:41.120 --> 02:22:45.440]   launched you and I were talking before the show about our YouTube channel, tried to really do a
[02:22:45.440 --> 02:22:51.600]   big push in October, launched the YouTube channel as well. So we're trying to push out really just
[02:22:51.600 --> 02:22:56.960]   Morris and more my last name, Morris, invest on YouTube, where we go in a very nitchy
[02:22:56.960 --> 02:23:03.040]   pieces about how to invest in real estate and walk you through all of those different things,
[02:23:03.040 --> 02:23:08.480]   whether it's crazy. Oh, there he is. There's there's I know that guy playing Morris.
[02:23:10.160 --> 02:23:13.920]   That's a lot of work. We do these. I know I'm constantly doing
[02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:19.120]   other do we publish these three times a week also. So they range now. But you only work on Fox and
[02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:22.560]   Friends on the weekends, right? So you just got five days a week. You're not doing anything.
[02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:26.960]   Well, no, now I'm doing like five days a week. So I'm doing Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,
[02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:32.560]   Wednesday. Yeah. So glad to hear that. That's great. Congratulations. I think you should take
[02:23:32.560 --> 02:23:37.840]   Megan Kelly's old show too late. That's already been snacked up. I'll leave in that nine o'clock
[02:23:37.840 --> 02:23:43.120]   hour away. They just hey, it's great to have you both on always a pleasure.
[02:23:43.120 --> 02:23:49.440]   And by the way, speaking of YouTube, you can watch us live on YouTube now, youtube.com/twit.
[02:23:49.440 --> 02:23:53.440]   We also have our twit bits there and links to all of our show channels. So any of the shows
[02:23:53.440 --> 02:24:00.880]   you want to watch, you can watch on YouTube as well as a twit.tv or, you know, subscribe and
[02:24:00.880 --> 02:24:05.760]   you'll get every show automatically pushed to your device and you won't miss an episode. I like
[02:24:05.760 --> 02:24:09.040]   it when you watch live though, because then you can be in the chat room. That's about 3 p.m.
[02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:16.160]   Pacific six p.m. Eastern 2300 UTC every Sunday afternoon. And thank God football is almost over.
[02:24:16.160 --> 02:24:22.800]   We don't have to fight the NFL for your attention going forward. Thanks for joining me.
[02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:27.760]   Welcome, and we yeah, Golden Glads. Now it's drunks on the Golden Globes. Cara Swisher,
[02:24:27.760 --> 02:24:32.080]   I'm sorry we couldn't get her on. I guess I gather she didn't get her in and back.
[02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:37.760]   Comcast didn't act that quickly. What a surprise. But we will reschedule her and have her on a
[02:24:37.760 --> 02:24:42.000]   show coming up in the weeks to come. Thanks for being here. We'll see you next time. Another
[02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:53.920]   twit is in the can.
