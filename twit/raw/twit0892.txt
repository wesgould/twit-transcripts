[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.000]   This week at Tech the Show we cover the weeks.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.560]   Tech News.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.880]   I am really happy to have this group here.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.680]   It's kind of the OG Twit panel.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.920]   Let's start with Alan Malvantano who left a PC perspective.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.920]   He was a regular on the this week in computer hardware show and the PC Per.com to go to
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.120]   Intel and as now and we couldn't ever really get him when he was at Intel.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.120]   Just once.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.120]   You got me once.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.120]   You got you once.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.840]   And now he's left Intel actually gone to a spin off of Intel.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.840]   Their NAND department got spun off into something called Soladime.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.320]   He is an SSD technologist.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.200]   Always my hero when it comes to solid state drives.
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.200]   Hello Alan.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.680]   I help when I can.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.920]   I appreciate it.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:31.160]   Alan also when he was in the Navy worked in nuclear submarines and intelligence.
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.880]   So if you have any questions about skiffs.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.880]   There we go.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.120]   The floodgates are open either SCIF or SKIF either way he can answer them.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.120]   Skips or skiffs.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.440]   It's great to have you Alan.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.440]   Wonderful to have you.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.440]   Good to see you.
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.280]   Look at your room there.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.600]   You can also all the chocchis.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.600]   There's always.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.600]   Oh I love that.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.600]   All sorts of memorabilia.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.680]   I'm going to have to look deep into your.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.080]   I'm competing with your set.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.080]   I know it's wild.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.080]   Gotta do something.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.800]   Hey look who else is here all the way from the Vatican.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.600]   It's father Robert Ballisare and the Vatican.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.600]   Digital Jesuit.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.960]   Yeah they're still here.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.280]   Look at how nice his background is.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.280]   It's clean.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.840]   You know it's beautiful.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.280]   What's that rig over your right shoulder there though.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.400]   What is that?
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.400]   This one.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.400]   They're like a lighting.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.400]   Lighting rig there.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.400]   You're right shoulder.
[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.400]   Several actually.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   I mean I learned from my time at Twitter.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.880]   I learned how to build a basic stage.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.120]   I learned how to do things and with get with depth and color.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.280]   So this is a super basic set that cost about $50 to set up and it's great for all my Zoom
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.280]   calls.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:48.840]   And you are atop the Society of Jesus dorms at the Vatican City am I correct?
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.040]   Indeed and actually right now this is what's outside.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.560]   So that window covers this view.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.440]   That's what you're seeing.
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.440]   That's what I'm seeing.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.480]   So when I open up this curtain this black curtain that's what sounds like.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.480]   Well open it up.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.680]   Forget the black curtain.
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.320]   If I do all the lights flood right back.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.320]   Oh yeah.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.320]   It's very beautiful.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.920]   So that's that St. Peter's and it's lit like beautifully lit.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.920]   It's lit.
[00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.120]   People don't realize St. Peter's is nice during the day.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.280]   It is gorgeous at night.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.640]   You have to come at night.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.320]   That's when it lights up.
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.760]   Also with this long time no see our dear friend former host of Mac break weekly.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.520]   Now creator liaison at YouTube Renee Richie God bless you.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.600]   I thought we would never get to have you on.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.600]   YouTube is related.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.600]   I am so excited.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.920]   I mean I can do podcasts like this because it's mostly me.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.120]   This has very little to do with YouTube and most of the do with me.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.880]   So this is way easier.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.120]   I won't make you talk about YouTube.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.520]   I won't make father Robert talk about the Pope.
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.760]   I won't make Alan talk about submarines and it's just the deal we make.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.760]   It's just the deal.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.760]   We'll just switch off with each other.
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.320]   We'll talk about the submarines.
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.440]   And now I have a video of the Pope on a submarine.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.440]   So I mean that kind of covers everything.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.440]   Is a video on YouTube?
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.440]   It can.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.440]   It's on YouTube.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.440]   We got the one.
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.440]   That's amazing.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:16.600]   Actually the Pope came to mind this week of course of the passing of Queen Elizabeth.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.760]   You know I was wondering why not everybody feels sad about this but I did and I was wondering
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.160]   why and it reminded me a little bit about the Pope.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.760]   It's nice to have world leaders who can be leaders without being politicians.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:37.280]   And I think that Queen Elizabeth II gave such solace and sucker to her people because
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.080]   she could stand above the fray and just be a kind, caring person.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.600]   And I think there's a lot to be said for that.
[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.760]   And the Pope is, I mean the Pope's a little more political.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:52.640]   He gets a little bit more involved in the day-to-day operations because he's more than just a titular
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.640]   head of state.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:07:00.640]   But he also I think for Catholics all over the world is a moral figure and somebody who
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.080]   gives them solace.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.080]   And I think that's important.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.760]   I'm really due.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.760]   So anyway.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.160]   Yeah no it's something unique.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.160]   I mean I get it.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.560]   I understand the people who have either issues with the monarchy or with the Queen herself
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.960]   or the family politics and the dynamics there.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.960]   I get all that.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.400]   I don't want to minimize that.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.720]   But there is something about a person, be it the Queen or Pope Francis, about a person
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.680]   who is just very dedicated to duty.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.920]   We actually don't get that a lot.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.920]   No.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.040]   We always feel this compromise in our leaders.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.360]   So when you have a leader that genuinely is trying to do their best even when they mess
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.600]   up, it comes off as something special.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.600]   That's a good way to put it.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.600]   So I get why people miss.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.600]   My duty is very, people who, and of course this is also September 11th, the 20, hard
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:56.680]   believe, 21st anniversary of the horrific attacks on New York City and the Pentagon.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.760]   I feel the same way.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.720]   That's actually, I can tie it in.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:07.760]   I remember going a few years ago to ground zero, the memorial there is very beautiful,
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:13.000]   but then going into the museum and I burst into tears because at the entrance to the
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.640]   museum there's a fire truck that's half melted.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.680]   That's the FDNY.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:24.360]   And I realized what I admire about these first responders is duty, their sense of duty, that
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:29.560]   they run into a place where people are running away from.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.600]   They run into the fire.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.800]   They ran into the fire.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:42.520]   And it's that same sense of duty that transcends even their survival instinct that is so moving.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.520]   And so yeah, it is.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.960]   It all ties together.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.400]   I would observe a minute of silence, but you just skip through it so I won't.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.640]   But it's too easy to find.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.360]   I've been to that museum.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:58.040]   They have tissue button, like really nice pedestal style tissue boxes about every 20
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.240]   feet and for good reason.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:06.680]   I bald my eyes and I don't consider myself a crier, but it is very, it's a difficult
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.200]   museum, but I think an important one.
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.040]   But you know what's strange, Leo?
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:18.520]   When you think about it, we there are adults now adults, not, not kids, not children, adults
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.840]   who were born after that.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.720]   They never knew the United States before 9/11 and how much it changed because of what happened
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.720]   that day.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.920]   I mean, we are a dramatically different nation, both in culture and in tenor than we were
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.200]   pre 9/11.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.720]   Some good and some bad.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.960]   Well, that's the other thing is I'm watching for the first time ever, the accession ceremony
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:48.400]   was broadcast yesterday of the new king and you know, the privy council gathers and they
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:53.120]   say, is it okay if we use the old seals until you destroy them?
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.720]   And he's going to hit them with a hammer when they get the new seals.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.640]   And this for me, the sense of history was also interesting.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:04.480]   And they're talking about people who weren't alive.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:10.320]   95% of the world wasn't alive when Queen Elizabeth became queen.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.400]   So and we've never known another queen.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:21.200]   So you know, to hear God save the king for the first time, to see those E2R insignia on
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.400]   their money on their post office boxes everywhere removed and replaced with whatever sigil he
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:29.480]   decides to use, all of this to me is history.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.440]   I mean, I think like Henry VIII, it's history and we're getting to watch it.
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:40.840]   And so yeah, I think for a lot of a whole generation of kids, 9/11's history, for those
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.160]   of us who remember it, it's searing history.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.200]   Probably none of you remember JFK getting shot, but I do.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.680]   And again, same thing, you know exactly where you were.
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.200]   You remember every detail.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.520]   It's not why we have the rituals though.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:58.800]   We have the traditions, both religious and just in terms of society when you have the
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.640]   succession or the accession and they go through all those things.
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.520]   The change is very hard for us, but seeing those traditions, being able to think of them.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.800]   Like even if you've never seen them before, you know they've been passed down through
[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:14.000]   history and it provides like this whole wave of stability so that the change feels less
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   scary.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.120]   It just gives you a grounding in this.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.120]   We are part of a much longer, much older, much stapler process.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:30.760]   And I like that because the stock and trade for all of us as technologists is move, move,
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.000]   change, change every second.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.800]   And so it's nice to have some roots and grounding.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.360]   It's really interesting though, because like one of the things that concerned is too much
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.040]   of a word, but we've been doing a lot of nostalgia and technology lately.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.000]   Like for the last three to four years, five years, we've been going back to these retro
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.520]   designs and we've been rebuilding a lot of things.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.960]   And that usually means that we're concerned about the future and we're trying, like marketing
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:58.560]   people are trying to give us that same solid foundation saying, no, it's not scary.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.120]   These are the same, whether it's the same phone or tablet or computer designs you're
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.120]   used to.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.840]   When we're optimistic, it's all like rockets and fins and chrome and like going off into
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.840]   the future.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:12.760]   But right now we're in this whole era of very much clinging to the past again.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.240]   You're in Canada, so a Commonwealth country, you're going to have to change your money
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.280]   too, aren't you?
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.760]   I found out that the Queen was actually like 24 or 25 separate legal entities, like the
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.400]   Queen of Canada, the separate legal entity, than the Queen of all the other places and
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.840]   that we include some Canadian cousins in the royal family that they don't and they have
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.440]   some British cousins in the royal family that we don't include.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.560]   It was so deep.
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.560]   Yeah.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:37.560]   Of course.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.560]   It's hysterical.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.320]   So one thing that did change, normally the British people, and I imagine the Canadians
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:48.360]   too, but the British people would learn about the Queen's passing on BBC, right?
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:54.440]   In fact, there's a whole protocol that the BBC goes dark and then they play God Save
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.960]   the Queen.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.840]   They interrupt all programming.
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:05.160]   They put the logo up on channel one, two and four, and then they all have the same message.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.160]   It didn't happen this time.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.640]   It broke on Twitter.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.240]   It broke on Twitter.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:19.400]   In fact, the first tweet came from the royal family Twitter account two minutes before
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.200]   the BBC had its tweet.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.680]   And I think that's, unfortunately, this page is not showing the tweet, but I think that's
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.320]   kind of remarkable.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.320]   Disintermediation.
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:37.800]   But what I want to point out is that the royal family embraced it and they said, "We better,
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:42.320]   you know, instead of waiting for the beeb, we're going to tweet this.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.120]   It shows you Twitter is still important."
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.560]   Well, yeah, maybe.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.560]   I don't know.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.120]   It shows you the Twitter is still important, doesn't it?
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:55.240]   That story is amazing, but the not so amazing addition to that is the fact that Twitter
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.120]   did its regular thing.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:03.200]   And in the hours before her death, there were so many fake announcements of her death.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:08.560]   You know, we expect that from Twitter, but it's sort of like when it happens to a major
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:13.640]   figure like the Queen, you almost kind of want to say, "What's wrong with you?
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.880]   Just stop.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.920]   We know she's on her deathbed.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:23.240]   Could you just let us, let this unfold as it's supposed to rather than trying to get
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:29.040]   garner the attention of the death of a cornerstone of an entire nation?"
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:36.960]   But Leo, we had a similar thing that happens here where there's an official channel of how
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:42.720]   we announce who gets picked for the next father general or who gets picked for the next pope.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.000]   And we've been having problems with this, with people inside of the assemblies tweeting
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.320]   out before the official call goes out.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:55.520]   So it's hitting all parts of society and all sorts of ancient nations, ancient cultures
[00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:59.920]   where you now have to deal with the fact that the data is going to leak before you're ready
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.360]   to leak it.
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.600]   And it's kind of interesting to see the royal family was forward looking.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.000]   Yeah, they jumped on it.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.800]   You just schooled me because I saw a tweet this morning that I believed that it was supposedly
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:20.520]   Donald Trump's message on truth social, saying she had secretly knighted him.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.520]   And you know what?
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.800]   I felt like this.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.920]   I felt for a hook line and sinker and there's still people on Twitter falling for it.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.920]   So it just shows you.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:34.000]   Yeah, this is a medium that is lightning quick that the royal family could beat the BBC by
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.560]   two minutes.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:39.440]   But it's also lightning quick with equally lightning quick with this information.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:44.880]   In fact, what is what is the old Ben Franklin saying that the lie speeds around the world
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.000]   while a truth is putting on its pants or something?
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.720]   I don't I can't remember.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.320]   That's got to be wrong.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.520]   When you get the idea.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.520]   No, that's right.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.120]   And why travels around the world while the truth is still putting on his pants?
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.120]   Oh, OK.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.040]   I thought it made up.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.680]   But you know, no, I believe Donald Trump got knighted in.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.680]   Maybe it is.
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:04.680]   So it shows you what I know.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:09.240]   Well, as Abraham Lincoln once famously said, you can't believe everything you see on the
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.240]   internet.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:17.600]   So I think we kind of have this really interesting dichotomy of yes, that's the fastest best way
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.080]   to learn something.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.080]   It's also very prone to disinformation.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.080]   And it's easy to not.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.080]   Citation needed.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:29.720]   I mean, I consider myself sophisticated and I fell for it completely.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.360]   So there you go.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.600]   It's hard not to.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.600]   It's hard.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.760]   Especially because I want a good fake.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.760]   It's because I wanted to believe it.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:41.680]   Well, yeah, a good fake will take something that could be true and stretch it a little
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.680]   bit.
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:43.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.680]   And that's what that tweet did.
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:48.200]   And in fact, that the only reason why people were started to doubt it was because and you
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.320]   picked up on this, it was so short and so concise.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.720]   People were saying that can't be true.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.080]   He never wrote a thing that's too coherent.
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.080]   No.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:59.960]   Well, and also as many people pointed out on Twitter, if that's true, then he's ineligible
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.440]   to run for president 2024.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.200]   And so that would be a very self-defeating tweet.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:11.360]   Yeah, Twitter, Twitter taken the taken the headline away from the BBC.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:13.960]   On the one hand, I'm not surprised at the same.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:18.040]   On the other hand, it's like, well, there's a tradition dashed, you know?
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:22.240]   Do you think it's bad to broadcast things like the accession?
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.960]   Did any of you watch the accession ceremony?
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.160]   It was actually quite fascinating.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.160]   I did.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.880]   I've never seen one before.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.880]   No one has.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:30.880]   No one has.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.480]   No, unless you're on the privy council and you'll never see one again, probably.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.480]   Well, maybe you will.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.480]   I don't know.
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.640]   It depends how long Charles makes it.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:41.000]   So one of the things that as I mentioned, they has to say, yeah, you can keep using the
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.440]   old seals until we get some new ones.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:49.400]   I then the, by the way, the announcer told us and by the way, he will have to destroy the
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:54.760]   old ones personally with a hammer so that they aren't misused because they're used for
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.600]   official documents and so forth.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.320]   And then they ask a bunch of questions.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.880]   He has to say, for instance, promise that he is not going to be mean to the church of
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.240]   Scotland, among other things, and signs, signs.
[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:11.040]   By the way, all fountain pens I was noticing, but I was trying to figure out who's fountain
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.040]   pens.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.920]   King, now King Charles had his own fountain pen that he pulled out of a pocket unscrewed.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:21.280]   But the other ones looked like those disposable pilot pen fountain pens.
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.760]   And I hope that's not what they were using, but they were all.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.560]   It has to be at least a month.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.560]   Blunk.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.560]   I mean, come on.
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.560]   They were not roller ball.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.560]   Yeah, they were not really.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.800]   Maybe he doesn't use a Swiss.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:41.480]   He must, although I, Sammable, Samm had told me that they're replacing the very famous
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.640]   royal limousines that were land rovers.
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:48.400]   And you see them all the time now, they're replacing them with Audi A8s.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.960]   And I thought, wow, you couldn't do that.
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:51.960]   That's a mess.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:52.960]   You couldn't do that.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.640]   And you replaced the beast with something made in Germany.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.320]   Well, the bottom birds are your German.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.320]   Oh, that's right.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.720]   The winds are from Germany.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.560]   Never mind.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.560]   You see it's that's how it starts.
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.560]   That's it.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.560]   You should.
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.920]   But they'd have to up armor the Audi A8s, right?
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.360]   I mean, oh, yeah, they have a special really way.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.840]   They have a special armored A8.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:15.200]   Shouldn't they be like a rolls or a Bentley?
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.200]   Right.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.680]   Just something with a beefier.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.680]   You could armor a Bentley.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.680]   It's a strange move.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.560]   Or an Aston Martin.
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.560]   An Aston.
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:25.560]   Yeah, James Bond must have several heated borel.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.560]   There you go.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.280]   All right.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:36.920]   I just, I thought we should start talking about 9/11 and QE2.
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:41.800]   By the way, we have the same ceremony here when Pope passes, they destroy his ring with
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.800]   a hammer.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:43.800]   Do they really?
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:45.800]   Because the hammer, they do.
[00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:49.680]   Well, I imagine that there's a certain amount of overlap between the papacy and monarchy.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.640]   I mean, it is a kind of monarchy.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:57.720]   In fact, you have even your accession ceremonies are even more elaborate and more ceremonial.
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.880]   The Cardinals have to come in.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.040]   There's a conclave and they have to vote.
[00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.520]   And I've, and I watched a movie.
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.680]   Who is a shoes of the fishermen?
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.240]   I don't remember where they showed the vote.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:13.360]   They stitched the votes together with threads.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.200]   And then that's when they burned them.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:19.880]   And then, and if they don't have a agreement, it's white, is it white smoke or black smoke,
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.600]   if they don't have agreement, I don't remember.
[00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.160]   It's black smoke, if they don't, and it's white smoke, if they do.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:30.480]   And actually, so right there, you can actually see is a smokestack middle towards the back.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.480]   That's the smokestack.
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:32.480]   Wow.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:38.960]   The the Apsolic Palace and Saint Peter's there's actually a little green stock that you can see and that's where the sport. I see it
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:43.820]   Wow there's a little stove and they throw that it's it's it is a
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.620]   Absolute medieval ceremony, but so is this the session
[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:52.000]   The other thing I liked and I'm gonna start adopting this when they ask for the king, you know
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.620]   Say alright with your permission we'll keep using those old seals
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:59.380]   Right King and he says approved and that's all I ask to say approved
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.380]   And
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:06.140]   Only negative and I have to say this is Charles had a script
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:09.380]   Memorize your lines Charles if you're gonna be king
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:15.700]   You can't be reading the script you just memorize the lines. It's not hard probably still emotional Leo
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.900]   Maybe that's it. I'll have to you right. Yes his mom has passed
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:26.660]   My mom is close to the same age and in and not in great shape and I kind of I that was for me and part of this emotion
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.620]   I was feeling yeah, that kind of
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:34.940]   A kinship because I know this is coming soon for me too. So there's the day they can be kings or whatever
[00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.940]   But they all have families yeah
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.100]   approved
[00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:45.140]   So some there was some tweets floating around about like I don't know there's some video of him asking some
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:49.820]   Okay, I'll just shoot to move some stuff. I disagree with this or give it. I'm such a part a go there
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:56.340]   Give so he's sitting down to sign some stuff and he has his own pen and but there are
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:03.620]   These basically quill pens with jars of ink on the table and they're in his way
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:07.500]   Let me see if I could find the tweet because yeah people are giving a really hard time somebody's
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.320]   Pulled a little clip of him basically going
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.500]   Get these out of here. I don't need them. Yeah, sure and
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:20.100]   Like did I expect him to like pick them up and carry them across the room like
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:25.140]   Signing something absolutely appropriate. I don't think it was it wasn't mean
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.620]   There's a guy there has become a British man from a Monty Python
[00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:36.860]   Disapproved I don't approve of these pens get them out of here. Oh, man
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.340]   He wasn't that money Python with that accent. I know
[00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:43.420]   What's with these things and what's all this with each pain
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:46.380]   Governor all great
[00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:54.660]   Stick Van Dyke sorry sorry as all Americans. Don't do Welsh. Don't do well. I don't know how to do Welsh
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:59.860]   I love I love the Welsh actors like Richard Burton, but I don't know how to do their accent. It's too perfect
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:04.700]   All right, let's talk about tech
[00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:11.140]   All right, some people would prefer we stayed with Elizabeth and the Pope, but I think we have to talk about Apple
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:17.140]   Yeah, that there was just a little bit of tech news this it's it's American royalty boys and girls
[00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:20.580]   Actually, it is kind of did you see that?
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:26.260]   Johnny so at all things do you yeah this the afternoon of the Apple event?
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:34.420]   Cara swisher gets on stage what a coup Tim Cook Johnny I've and Steve Jobs widow
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:38.820]   luring to talk about Steve and
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:45.020]   With it to announce and I think this is American royalty the Steve Jobs archive
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:51.420]   I think it was Cara's last right like this was her mic. Yeah farewell. Yeah, hello, but farewell
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.420]   Yeah, yeah
[00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:58.940]   Yes, decode it's not D anymore code code code code. Yeah, it's no longer the Wall Street Journal
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:05.140]   Recode decode code conference. They have a lot confused a lot. So this idea of the Steve Jobs archive
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:11.140]   I guess is to have a bunch of Steve videos, which of course they're all on YouTube, but
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:15.500]   The commencement address at Stanford being the best known
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:23.260]   Some voiceovers some oral history interviews and stuff and it seems to be growing which is which is cool
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:28.340]   And then it looks like they're also putting together some fellowships
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:32.580]   They say we are building programs fellowships and collections
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:34.180]   and
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:38.460]   partnerships that reflect Steve's values and carry his sense of possibility
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:41.020]   forward so
[00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:43.020]   This is our royalty, isn't it?
[00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:44.540]   the
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.540]   the startup founder
[00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:53.220]   Things that happen you ask a lot. Maybe loosely the businessman the businessman is our our oiled. Yeah
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:56.900]   But when they wait when Tim Cook took over for Steve
[00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.980]   It was very much like they had to break the seals and he had you know
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:05.220]   He had to go through a whole anoint anointing's. I mean not exactly a
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:11.260]   Getting crowned but he had to kind of be you know, okay. We've got a guy. He's gonna take over
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.940]   You know him well
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:21.900]   There's something about a fast growing startup or a reinvigorated company that brings back its founder that it
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:26.020]   Cannot become the company it needs to be until the founder is gone
[00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:29.180]   Because as long as the founder is still around and kicking
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:34.620]   There's always gonna be this well was this what the company was supposed to be was this the regional direction?
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:40.420]   Is this where they're supposed to be going once the founder's gone an organization has the freedom to sort of say okay?
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:44.940]   We know what we were what do we want to be and I think when they brought in Cook
[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:48.620]   That's what they actually did they sat that and they said Steve Jobs did a lot of good things
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:53.700]   These are the things he didn't do great. These are the things that we should be doing and these are the things that we want to
[00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.100]   Continue doing from his his tenure
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:02.260]   But the apple that we have now is very different from the apple we had when jobs was still around
[00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:09.620]   I've seen a number of articles though suggesting that apple is the new church that apple stores of the new cathedrals
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:15.140]   Here's Ben Pars article from ink from some time ago the church of apple is a religion
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:23.420]   Because we made it one no company has the power apple has over consumers and journalists fair
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:32.660]   Got some got some attention. I'm sure yeah
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:39.500]   It does sometimes feel like those are religious battles when you say I'm an iPhone user and I'm an Android user
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:46.300]   I'm a blue bubble. I'm a green bubble. We like that Liam. Like we love that like Coke versus Pepsi Nintendo versus Xbox
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:51.580]   Yeah, and they could go like and we had this with Rockefeller's and what they think with it like just businesses going back
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:54.520]   For for a century. I think you know
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:27:00.540]   Padre is right like we we anoint business people as our de facto royalty. Yeah
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:04.580]   I think it just happens to be the age of the technocrat right now
[00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:09.420]   Cook might have been looking at their day because wasn't there some story about
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:15.860]   What was it a reporter asked him? Hey my grandmother can't oh Lord? This is also at the code conference
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.900]   Yeah, I think it was at the end after the interview
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:23.460]   He's taking questions and he gets asked about this blue bubble
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.860]   green bubble thing
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.860]   yeah, and
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:33.500]   He's he's let me see if I can find this maybe his response could have been a little bit better
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:36.020]   It wasn't his how I would say yeah
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:39.060]   It wasn't exactly diplomatic
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:46.900]   So a journalist asked great given our current culture of regulation yes the journalist asked cook how Apple could improve
[00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:50.060]   communication between the iPhone and Android users
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:56.460]   Cook said he didn't feel Apple users were asking quote asking that we put a lot of energy into that I
[00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:00.140]   Wish this video of this somewhere after the reporter said well
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:05.980]   I can't send certain videos to my mom because she has an Android Tim joked well by your mom and iPhone
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:07.780]   Yeah
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:11.780]   That isn't the end that is not a first answer was the first answer was fine
[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:13.860]   And the second answer could be yes
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:18.180]   You can there's a variety of ways and mediums through which you can exchange full resolution video in any device
[00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:24.220]   But that's not how that went yeah, and I think it annoys a lot of holding it wrong. Yeah exactly
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:33.780]   It's about as helpful as every time I mentioned something that I don't like about what windows is doing and I always get 30 different
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:39.620]   Comments saying just buy a Mac and like no make windows better. Yeah. Yeah windows
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.500]   Are you saying there's are you saying love it or leave it right?
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.260]   They're saying that I guess
[00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:49.580]   Yeah, anyway Apple did announce and I'm not actually I'd be very curious what you all think
[00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.500]   Because when I do these Apple events as we did
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.980]   Andy and I co and I did the you know we have the stream going on
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:01.700]   We know the stream is an infomercial so I consider it kind of our job to
[00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.140]   provide context
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.420]   critique
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.420]   Approval if it merits
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:11.580]   But there is a reality distortion field Apple is so good at marketing
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:14.380]   It just makes you want
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:21.780]   Everything what did you want Leo? I bought it. I bought it all about all three video. Oh, yeah, of course I did get
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:25.180]   so
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:30.220]   I'm I it's embarrassing. Did you get the ultra watch didn't you you got the you got you?
[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:37.100]   I got I got the one not only did I get the ultra watch the watch for extreme athletes who can dive a hundred meters
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:41.300]   Then climb Mount Kilimanjaro and then bicycle the reason I have watch yeah
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:48.500]   I got the I got the what not only did I get that I got the band that you can stretch to fit over your wetsuit when you're diving
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.500]   Yes
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:55.580]   Just in case just in case that happened someday. I take up scuba look
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:30:02.000]   I'm not going to watch my entice you to do those things see so that's the I got I got that too
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.780]   It's good. I got that too because Georgia dives and I know she's gonna try to steal it anyway
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:10.540]   So I figured it might as well be useful for her when she does take I have I'm not certified
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:13.180]   But I have scuba dives a few times I did it on the Great Barrier Reef
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:19.700]   Which was a experience of a lifetime and so maybe but actually at my age. I think it's be death-defying act
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:23.060]   I don't think it's aspirational. Yeah, it's an aspirational watch
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:28.380]   But it's kind of cool and I think there is a certain coolness to wearing this giant honkin
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:35.740]   Titanium beast on your wrist. It's the same reason people drive four by fours in downtown San Francisco. It's you know, yes
[00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:39.780]   You look good doing it now that might be a different thing
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:48.220]   No, no actually here's a question
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:52.860]   I mean I get what you say about the apple distortion field they are exceptionally good at
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:56.060]   Convincing people that they know what you need
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:59.540]   Which is a skill that they've had for the last 20 years
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:02.140]   But I don't think they're the best at it anymore
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:08.660]   I mean if you if you're gonna make the argument that apple was sort of become the new religion the counter religion is Tesla and
[00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:13.380]   Elon Musk has now the most rabid fans it used to be apple, but I
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:18.980]   Don't know it feels like it's shifting over he's now the person that people worship
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:24.300]   Is it their lord of the memes is it they're more rabid because he's under attack so they need to be more on the defense?
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:32.740]   I mean even when he's not under attack. They're out there shilling for him. Yeah, yeah completely. You know, I mean
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:37.940]   I own two of those cars, and I still can't figure that out
[00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:44.140]   I just don't get it. It's it's just like too far like I see people going, you know
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:49.340]   And I mean I've had issues with them also, and it's like if there's even a flip side to that where
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:55.700]   When you have issues with it and you bring them up then all those rapid crazy fans try to like apologize
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:59.420]   You're a hater. You're a hater. Oh, yeah, like suddenly I'm a hater like I own two of them
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:05.980]   Are you kidding me like clearly? I'm not a hater just I can't have it when Leo and Lisa had issues with their ex
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:08.420]   With the their Tesla X
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:12.420]   They got so much hate if it is it was in the chat room. It was on Twitter
[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:17.540]   It's like oh, you're just trying to hate on Elon. I was like no I have a legitimate problem with something that I've bought oh
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:21.540]   And I get but I must say I get even more hate now
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:28.420]   When I comment on Elon and his really ridiculous attempt to purchase Twitter and now attempt to get out of it
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:34.140]   Which we will talk about later if I say anything that's not positive I get more hate than that and then ever
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:42.020]   So yeah, I think when you're when your guy there was a it's sports when your team is under attack you step up to defend
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:47.020]   There was a brief break when all those people went to crypto and NFTs, but now they're all bad
[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:51.300]   That didn't work out. So my block bot
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.900]   It it actually it's like a little zen of a venn diagram
[00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:59.980]   If you are crypto you're fine if you're Elon Musk you're fine if you're conservative voice you're fine
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:04.100]   But if you're all three of those it's an auto block and just it just kicks you right out
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:08.940]   And they identify themselves. So it's like it's very easy. Yeah, do you use it?
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.420]   Do you have a regular expression parser that looks at their
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:15.100]   Profiles it. Yeah, okay, that's interesting looks at profile
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:21.580]   It does content analysis from from what they've actually posted it looks at who they're following and who's following them
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:27.460]   Wow, and like things you're not joking. You actually have code that's doing this correct Wow
[00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:30.700]   24/7 why
[00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:38.960]   Because my Twitter feed is so much more useful when just all the low quality comments and and all the spam accounts
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.700]   Get xed out. I don't ever see any of that stuff
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:45.260]   Is it is it what is it written in?
[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:50.380]   Python so the main the main part is written in Python. Yeah
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:54.020]   Wow, right and then I use a Amazon
[00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:59.500]   Context tool their their service to do the context analysis. Oh, no kidding
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:04.140]   Well, this is pretty sophisticated and then it uses does Twitter have an API for follow and unfollow
[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:07.020]   Or you have to be manual do
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:12.780]   No, so you I can't just use the pure API because I hit the limit really fast Wow
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:16.860]   So I actually use a scraper for most of the context stuff
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:21.620]   And then I only hit the API for the actual functions of mute block did a report
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:27.640]   Did this really step up when you set up the Vatican Minecraft server and you got a lot of attention for that was that when it
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:32.800]   Started getting problematic. No, believe it or not. I had to build this thing when I was at Twitter
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:39.120]   That's so it came over from Twitter. Oh, the hate that we were getting like when we got swatted
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:44.160]   That's why I started writing this and it was just a little tweak here and there to get to what I have now Wow
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:47.160]   I gotta get to work. I
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:51.420]   Thought you were feuding with the dream SMP, but no it's way
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.760]   Wow, yeah, that's wild so
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:35:01.680]   Let's we'll go through the the various products. Let's start with the iPhone 14 14 plus
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:04.480]   14 pro
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.800]   14 pro max
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:14.000]   As usual I would say with Apple these are incremental improvements over the previous years
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.240]   Phones, right is there anything to go Wow. This is so much better. You have to get it Renee
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.720]   I mean so I think it's been true for years
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:28.640]   And I think Apple has known this for years that very few people upgrade year over year
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.640]   Like if you run an annual upgrade program and it just continues your subscription
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:35.920]   That's a big exception and they're always gonna be people who are just they have like a ton of money
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.720]   And they really like phones and they're gonna buy the new phone every year
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:43.400]   But for the vast majority of people they're on between two three four even five years cycles
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:50.200]   And they know that so the goal is just to over three to four years to provide enough value that if you're going from like this
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:55.720]   Year probably an iPhone 8 or an iPhone 10 maybe even an iPhone 10 s that it's a significant upgrade for you
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:36:01.800]   I think like Twitter and YouTube are obsessed with only ever talking about how it compares to the last year
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:07.200]   And that has always only been like maybe five to ten percent of the buying populace through Griele and
[00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:15.120]   You can recuse yourself if you're not an iPhone user no no I mean I'm an iPhone user
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:22.320]   The kind of the takeaway I took it from just I mean I watch their thing because of course who doesn't when they do it I
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:28.520]   Mean I think the satellite thing is cool. Yeah, I'm never gonna use it right, but you don't even
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:32.960]   It's cool. No is the craze needs it for his excursions with his new
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:40.560]   But I mean it's it's cool to me because like I mean
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:46.720]   I spent a lot of years on submarines and it was kind of like there was the satellite phone that they had just in case and
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:51.960]   It was like you had to go up and like ask to use it if there would you have to be on the surface to do it
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.120]   You'd have to of course yeah
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:57.440]   Yeah, well they there were some way to sort of hook the antenna up to one of the masks
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:02.720]   So you could sort of get away with stick it out poking poking something out of the water actually marine and Ellen you know
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:07.680]   Yeah, can I ask a question so on satellite? I mean on submarines
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:15.160]   There's got to be some sort of policy about signal intelligence of of chrome and orange cell phones that can ping right?
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.280]   I mean you can't have yes. Yeah, and that is true
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:24.960]   But the thing is you wouldn't be to use the iPhone thing like if somebody has an iPhone 14 on a submarine
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:30.520]   Like you literally have to be like fully surface and then the person would have to get out of the submarine right on deck right?
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:35.480]   Because you're in a big Faraday cage really yeah, basically it's that's not gonna work inside
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.160]   Yeah, but if the alarm goes off wouldn't Sean Connery hear you
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:44.280]   One thing one thing
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:54.240]   But that is true that you know there is a big signal intelligence thing right
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:58.680]   You know technology did advance like even while I was on the submarine which was
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:04.000]   Over almost two decades ago now man, that's dating totally talk about dating ourselves from earlier
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:08.720]   but you know they advanced to the point where there was like a
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:16.680]   Satellite like a like a gyro stabilized a little mini dish built into top of one of the masks that they could pop up and sort of do
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.160]   a
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:23.840]   Directional communication, but that's only because it was a directional thing and so that you wouldn't be able to sort of triangulate
[00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:27.200]   You know where that communication was coming from and they would only do it very rarely
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.880]   You know and they wouldn't do it while the submarine what was called alert
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:34.040]   Which is there's some window of time out of when the submarines out
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:40.040]   Which is where they're the one that can be called to launch the missiles if they have to and so in that window
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:45.960]   There's literally nothing happens. They're just they're a ghost basically for several weeks, right?
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:51.240]   Yeah, I don't see some marine crews doing what you're seeing from troops in Ukraine and Russia where they're
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:56.800]   Instagramming themselves in front of landmarks. That's that's probably not gonna fly with the with subcommand
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:05.200]   Right and honestly even if the technology was possible even if you made you know the iPhone 21 can now do it from inside the whole of a submarine or
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:12.040]   The crew has enough discipline to where they're they're not doing that because they know it's you know
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:17.340]   Everybody's life is on the line when you start exactly you know somebody's live working summeriness
[00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:20.960]   Every day. Yeah, why why why by the missile on the submarine?
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:31.260]   It's actually fascinating war has changed even in this technology era one of the things people were wondering is why did the Russians immediately take out
[00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:33.480]   Internet and cell service in Ukraine
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:38.720]   I mean that's you know if you're gonna attack a country the first thing you could want to do if you can besides
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:42.520]   destroying their transportation network is destroy their communications network and
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:48.240]   What that was so that was so crazy wasn't it like right at the beginning when all the Ukraine stuff started going on
[00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:54.880]   There was less Ukrainian girl just like did a tiktok or an instability or something about how to start up the armored vehicle
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:56.880]   That was just abandoned by the Russians
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:04.400]   Tractors like pulling aircraft carriers that they just put like take it over like
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:11.440]   So the the thinking is according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:17.400]   That they don't want to because a we can it's a great way to spy on people
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:24.560]   Because if we if we can eavesdrop on the phone calls the emails get the geolocation data from the cell towers, that's useful
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:31.160]   Plus they're using it because it's you know, they're in Ukraine. So the Russian forces need to use it
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.440]   And if they ever
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:38.440]   Win in Ukraine, of course, they don't want to destroy infrastructure infrastructure although that seems to be out the window
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:45.160]   Yeah, it's I mean, yeah when you see people instagramming from the war zone
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:48.080]   It's just yeah crazy
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:52.800]   well communication really interesting because when it was a huge lack in the Russian army
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:59.920]   I mean way more than any intel group ever thought that they didn't come they they went into a hostile country
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:04.680]   Without their own complete communications infrastructure, right? That's a herd of that
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:08.480]   That's just something you would never expect a major world power to do and yet they did it
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.040]   Yep
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:15.080]   And then on and then on top of that they had you know presumably they already had this tech from before but they would roll in their GPS
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.520]   jamming equipment
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:20.640]   Jam GPS for the entire region, but then they would all get lost themselves
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:29.880]   It's a bad idea because the locals know how to get around you're the ones who need the GPS, right?
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:33.640]   It's really interesting too because you know a few decades ago
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:41.400]   Cable news was changed forever by the OJ Simpson trial and by the Gulf War and now social media is being changed forever by the Amber Heard trial
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:44.960]   and by the Ukraine war and it just seems like there's always these locusts of
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:51.560]   Coverage where it shifts to a completely new medium and then everything gets rapidly repackaged around those mediums
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:59.920]   Well, and that's why I thought it was really even the transition from Queen Elizabeth to King Charles was interesting because even an ancient
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:08.240]   Tradition like this is highly influenced they put it on Twitter before they put it up on the palace gates
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:14.760]   I mean, that's to me it is it's fascinating how we've the world has changed and like the frog in the in the pot
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:21.240]   We just it's happening without us knowing it's just kind of gradually do you imagine the Vatican would change?
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:25.040]   Probably not right. This is somewhere where tradition is so
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:32.000]   Much a part of it. They're not they're gonna still stitch together the votes and put them in a stove and burn them
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.080]   No, they'll they'll keep doing that but you do see change and I'm if your producer could
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:47.160]   Call it up. There's a great side-by-side showing the the night that Benedict became pope and the night that Francis became pope
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:52.280]   And on the night that Benedict came became pope you had a few a lot of people in front of St. Peter's holding candles
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:56.720]   The night that Francis became pope everyone was holding a phone
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.760]   You saw nothing but a few screens and it's like yeah, you know
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:05.000]   Even if the traditions stay the same the way that people are consuming it or remembering it is changing
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.120]   And that was the clearest sign for me like yeah, you know
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:12.200]   You have to you have to do this if you're not thinking about optics over social media
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:17.640]   That means you're not thinking about optics period, you know what you're right when I was at the Motley crew concert
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:22.760]   When Tommy Lee said bring up the lights everybody just brought out their smartphones and turn on the flashlight
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:26.120]   Yeah, I don't your absolute the whole world is changing
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:32.780]   You I've told this story before but I love it the Soviet Union was monitoring
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:37.600]   That's just how long ago was monitoring the coming and going of
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:41.960]   people at the Pentagon and they noticed that
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:49.400]   Every day around noon a lot of high-ranking officers would disappear into this building
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:59.120]   You know where I'm going with this, right? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, it was a hot dog stand in the center of the Pentagon and
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:05.720]   It almost got nuked because they thought well that it was said the Soviet Union at least tuned this clear missile
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:12.480]   pointed at it at all times and this was from satellite not from cell phones obviously but
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:18.920]   Okay at the hot dog stand at the hot dog stand. I mean I hate to say that we'll fight back
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:24.040]   Yeah, I hate to say this but if you hit the hot dog stand the rest of the Pentagon's it just crumbles. Yeah
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.280]   Yeah, yeah, I mean moves on their stomach
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:33.960]   You know I went there I went there in 2009 and the hot dog stand was gone. Yeah, they took it out
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:36.360]   Not the Russians the Pentagon
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:48.120]   It shuttered in 2006 I'm sorry to say probably not because of any threat from the Soviet Union or the Russians
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:55.080]   But still more a well-defended hot dog stand. Yeah, you know, I'd say they called it cafe ground zero
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:57.360]   You
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:05.960]   Know China has China has a story like that from Pokemon go they had to forbid their personnel from playing Pokemon go because
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:10.360]   They you could see patterns of people walking around these dark
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:17.760]   Like on the map areas and they figured out. Oh, these are guards trying to get their kilometers in while they're doing their guard duty
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:21.880]   Wow, like oh, yeah, so that's a that's a Chinese government facility fantastic
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:26.840]   I want to take a little break cuz you know, we've been talking a lot and that's got to get a commercial in
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:33.120]   But I do want to come back and talk about this iPhone both Ben Thompson and Jason Snell have actually made some really interesting points
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:38.880]   About this new iPhone. We'll get to that in just a little bit. So great to see you again Renee Richie
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:46.280]   Now creative liaison at YouTube, but still you still doing the channel right you still do stuff. Yep
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:47.880]   Do you want video a week?
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.880]   Because that's all you have time for now
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.440]   Yes, I used to do like three to four videos a week now
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:57.200]   I'm doing one a week, but I just put up this week's video and it's all about the outrage over e-sims which we could talk about
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:02.040]   Oh, yes, that's actually talk about the courage port now. It's the courage tray
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.800]   Yes, definitely talk about that
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:10.920]   Do you is this your advice to creators to don't don't bring yourself out doing trying to do too many videos a week?
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:16.400]   I mean so the truth is like you want to get to a point and I'm just repeating something that Todd Bobre
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:22.720]   Who's a director of discovery YouTube really really nice guys that you want to get to a point where you're increasing the value of your video
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:28.640]   So it's not the quantity that you're making but the quality that you're making and that those videos attract enough audience enough views
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:32.520]   That you don't have to like continually run on a hamster. We like it. Mark has Bradley
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:38.960]   Yeah, he doesn't put out so many videos, but he caught focuses on the quality of it. Mark rober went one a month Mark rober
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:41.800]   Yeah, and his stuff is so good. He's the NASA
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:47.160]   scientist who makes the glitter bombs and we finally found out what he did at Apple
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:52.080]   Oh, what did he do it up? He was on the AR project. You're kidding
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:56.600]   No, yeah, he was working on the other reality headset not not anymore
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:00.320]   No, because I his YouTube channel hit thing out grew
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:04.960]   With what Apple was comfortable with well, that just shows you you can do one a month
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:10.680]   And you don't have to you don't have to work at Apple anymore. That's yeah pretty pretty darn and then you hold you host
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:12.920]   Jimmy was it not Jimmy Fallon Jimmy
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:17.560]   Kim will me Jim Kim will yeah, you host Jimmy Kimmel. Yeah, yeah
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:28.040]   Nice Alan Malvin tonneau no longer at Intel, but still mr. SSD now for the spin-off solid. I'm
[00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:33.280]   Mostly drives or memory or it's NAND right I
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:39.620]   Mean when I was at Intel it dealt a little bit more with memory right I would deal with the obtained stuff as well
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:44.640]   Which we can talk about it a little bit. That's the late lamenting to obtain. Yeah, yeah
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:48.640]   But now it's it's just the NAND slash SSD
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:55.080]   Technologies be it for a solid dime or for SK high-nix like we're all you know, we're all together now on
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:57.640]   data center and
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:01.920]   client sides you think anything basically anything SSD spinning hard drives are
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:07.600]   are gonna be aimed at the same garbage dump as VHS tapes and
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:16.440]   Cassettes I don't know. I mean cost per gig is still it's amazing. Isn't it? Yeah, the cost per gig still winning on the hard drive
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:22.920]   Side if you just need a bunch of mass storage perfect for my nast I wouldn't want to put an SSD in my nast although you can I
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:29.400]   Mean you can but it was just not cost effective right now right right right don't let me forget to ask you about
[00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:37.400]   Optane before the show's over because I do want to but not right now also father Robert ballast air the digital Jesuit and
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:39.960]   You know, it's great to see you
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:45.640]   Again how much longer before you come home, please come back great
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:52.480]   Come back every every time I meet with father general. I always ask the question
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:56.400]   I said so, you know, it's been one year. It's been two years. It's now been five years
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:02.160]   Maybe next year is a good time for me to go back to the States and he always has the same answer. He says
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:05.160]   You should learn more Italian
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.160]   I
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:12.920]   Maybe you're going to New Jersey. It's possible
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:19.600]   Mashed potato in the discord actually he found the photo from us. So that's 2005 versus 2013
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:23.860]   Let me so in 2005 you blow up version of this year. Let's see
[00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:29.960]   It's it's oh look at I see Leo. I see Leo holding all that's me recording it. Yes
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:35.240]   Look it look at all the it's not it's the camera phones
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:38.160]   I have to say you can't go anywhere anymore
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:44.160]   Everybody's recording all the time all the time. I love the person holding up the iPad though
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:49.400]   The tablet to take a picture. Yes. I want to see the next time. I want to see what it is. That's interesting. Yeah
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:54.560]   Look at all the camera phones. Wow Leo the next time. It's all going to be Google glass, right?
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:58.720]   You know, yeah, you'll be wearing your Apple AR headset
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:03.440]   My my snap goggles, whatever they call those things. Yeah
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:07.760]   They'll just place your retina's what something that is an amazing picture
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:12.360]   That's incredible. It's true. I mean every concert I go to now. I have to kind of like
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:19.240]   Get the phones down like watch the phone down kids. What's your phone down? There's a guy playing here
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:26.360]   The the worst ones and I see I see less of this now than I used to but it used to be everybody would do a selfie like they turn around
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:31.360]   Turn their back to the singer and take a picture so that hey, you know where I am
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:36.440]   That's right there where you can't see over them any yeah
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:42.040]   I I know I'm an old man shat at the clouds
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:45.840]   Our show today brought to you by Melissa
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:52.680]   Did you know if you're in business that poor quality data can cost you big time?
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:59.240]   I'm talking your address list your customers supplier list your contact information on average
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:03.640]   Big organizations and small lose 15 million dollars
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:11.800]   Because of poor quality data and of course the longer it stays in your system the worse it gets the mortal cost you to ensure your business is successful
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:19.080]   Your customer information has to be accurate. That's why you go to Melissa. They are the address experts

[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:28.240]   It's it's not just sending a bill or a catalog to the wrong address
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:30.960]   It's calling somebody by the wrong name
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:38.960]   And you know you've got a customer service line and somebody calls in and you call them by the wrong name or say oh you live in Idaho
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:45.440]   No, I live in Florida. You're just making a customer. That's already upset more upset more frustrated
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:54.520]   And there's another reason why you want good quality data authentication verification you may have compliance requirements around those
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:59.040]   Very important things and you certainly want to for security

[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:44.320]   I'm sure in the early days it was probably zip plus four
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:48.060]   They now this new app Melissa ID has coverage of over
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:53.600]   6,000 identification documents across 200 countries and jurisdictions

[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:14.040]   That means there's almost certainly they've got a record that's correct
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:19.760]   They can replace your bad data with you could score and target customers with detailed demographic and
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:26.280]   Thermographic data depends you can complete customer records you can add missing names addresses phone numbers email addresses
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:29.880]   And of course they treat your data like the gold that it is

[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:43.640]   Dear listener dear viewer when you use that address so make sure you do Melissa calm slash
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:46.480]   Twit
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:51.080]   Okay, so I you know the satellite things interesting. I don't know how we're gonna test it
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:59.120]   But I think if you know it's a it's a great thing to have T mobile announced something similar with Starlink the week before knowing
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:03.960]   Apple was probably was about to announce this we now know that Apple will be partnering with global star
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:11.280]   Partnering's even more really because they say they'll pay for 95% of the costs associated with additional launches
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:17.560]   That global starts gonna have to make to put satellites up to do this service. So Apple's getting in the satellite business in
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:24.080]   Effect too many people are getting into the satellite business. There's a great amount of space
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:28.760]   I agree around the planet. We talked about this with Rod pile today on the radio show
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:36.040]   Everybody's launched in satellites in fact so much so that in the next Elon Musk Starlink launch is
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:39.480]   There's another satellite company piggybacking on that
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:43.720]   And the things is all overlapping right? It's like we got
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:48.320]   Four different companies doing the same thing and of course each of them has to have their own satellite
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:55.040]   This is so much of a problem the FCC announced this week that they were trying to establish a rule requiring
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:58.840]   People to get their old satellites out of the sky
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:06.000]   They say we want to make it so you have five years to either deorbit it or launch it in the space or something
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.440]   Because they're gonna just jam the place up
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:18.200]   Which is a good idea, but it's a non-starter because they place the onus on the country yeah responsible for that
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:23.800]   The make not the company yeah, so unless every country starts putting down a huge bond
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:26.640]   For every satellite a company launches in the space
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:31.240]   They're gonna get to a point where a company has gone out of business and now they're stuck with a ten billion dollar bill
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:35.360]   To deorbit a bunch of satellites. I I I know space is big
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:41.200]   We know that even it's big Lee orbital space is big Lee big, but
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:44.740]   If we seems like everybody and their brothers will be thousands
[00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:47.640]   There's a wrong way to make a Dyson sphere people can we just have a
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:50.840]   This is not what they meant crazy
[00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:56.280]   But you know we'll see ads in a year from Apple from somebody who was on a mountain
[00:56:56.500 --> 00:57:02.280]   Broke their toe and they couldn't get help and they got satellite help. It's gonna be me to be honest with you
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:11.040]   Okay, I mean you watch I mean I think I would want that and I think the crash detections interesting both the watch and the phone
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:12.960]   have
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:14.960]   more accelerometers
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:17.600]   better accelerometers and and also
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:25.100]   Some sort of impact detection thing right what they algorithms. Yeah in case you come to a sudden our boreal stop
[00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:27.100]   I
[00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:35.440]   Swing reference there. I got it. Yeah has a higher G-rated sensor coupled with the new algorithms. Yes, right?
[00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:40.840]   Yeah, but what do they say they say I missed it, but it is some huge amount of G's like
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:43.740]   256 200
[00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:51.140]   Is that a look if you get a crash watch if your watch experiences 256 G's you're dead
[00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:53.140]   It's no
[00:57:53.140 --> 00:58:02.620]   Pressure because it registers the airbag going off by a change in the battery pressure it does that's part of it right?
[00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:07.420]   Yeah, yeah, so what they're obviously doing is using machine learning
[00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:12.580]   They showed a bunch of crashes and they use machine learning. Well, what is it like?
[00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:19.900]   What is it? What is the change in the environment when you hit something really really hard and let's put some of them stable coin crashes?
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:23.900]   Where's that makes make them and then it will call emergency services?
[00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:28.780]   I know it's good for the ads in fact Apple even started the event with a big ad
[00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:31.380]   for this stuff I
[00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:36.620]   Like how the phone is in pristine condition while the car is out just being destroyed around it
[00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:40.860]   What am one of my family members shall not be her name named got no crash
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:45.900]   She was fine the only problem is her phone flying out the window
[00:58:45.900 --> 00:58:56.780]   So yeah, I think shall not be named, but we'll give you enough demographic data to make it. Yeah, I think you well
[00:58:56.780 --> 00:58:58.780]   She doesn't have a phone. Let's put it that way
[00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:01.860]   256 G's holy kamole
[00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:06.500]   All right, so this is I mean this is clearly Apple
[00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:11.980]   Doubling down on what Tim Cook has always said which is that our next big business is gonna be health
[00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:17.860]   It's gonna be protecting you and I think safety. This is health and safety is a very nice place for them to be in
[00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:20.220]   You know, they're already kind of owning the privacy space
[00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:27.020]   Whether it's marketing only or for real. They clearly own it now. They're gonna own this health and safety space
[00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:31.820]   I think that's you're gonna it's they're gonna get the point where people are gonna feel like Apple's taking care of them
[00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:37.200]   And it's non contentious like it's not something that people are gonna yell our scream or complain about is like they might
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:42.760]   other areas of business they we had seen a rumor that they were gonna have a temperature sensors
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:49.120]   But what we didn't know is how much they were gonna focus that on women, which again brilliant
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:51.920]   very smart
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:58.080]   Although marketing move is definitely smart. What do they call it retroactive ovulation?
[00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:02.040]   That sounds very sci-fi
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:05.600]   It's a
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:11.280]   Cycle tracking via temperature changes. Yeah, but they won't tell you retroactive ovulation
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:14.640]   Yeah, like an Elon Musk thing it sounds like
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:17.040]   The space
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:22.040]   Changes happen like like after or more about population cycle or they don't know your exact
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:28.020]   Temperature, but they know how it's going up or down. It's all it's a relative trends. Yeah relative temperature
[01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:31.020]   We knew that in fact I have an aura ring that does the same thing
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:35.840]   But I think it's very smart of them to focus on women's health
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.480]   For this thing
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:45.920]   Because neither Fitbit nor Samsung nor the aura talk at all about cycle tracking Apple that was the number one bullet point
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:49.480]   They spent a lot of time talking about that and then this
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:57.600]   This thing about retroactive ovulation. I think they're trying to say we can't tell you ahead of time
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:02.480]   But we can tell you after words or I don't know
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.880]   I'll have to let this was big. Yeah, this was big at CES about three years ago
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:14.280]   There was a company I think called compar that was selling devices that would do this they would actually do all the
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:16.720]   specifically ovulation tracking
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:24.320]   And actually I think Apple bought them didn't they? Ah, well, there you go. I might have been here. They got the tech. Yeah
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:30.800]   Good on you Apple, I guess is all I can say I
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:36.320]   It's so it's more than just period tracking. I mean it gives you
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:43.000]   Period predictions a retroactive notification about your ovulation date, which
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.360]   You know that people want to know about their ovulation date
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:52.640]   Either when they want to get pregnant or don't want to get pregnant. That's of course when you're most fertile
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:02:00.200]   Unfortunately knowing about it after the fact seems less useful, but I guess that's the best they can oh, yeah, I was pregnant. Oh, okay
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:02.200]   Yeah, whoops
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:04.200]   steps and again
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:09.320]   Probably one of the reasons Fitbit which is owned by Google Samsung and
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:13.320]   Aura are having trouble doing this is privacy
[01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:17.640]   We already know the period many period tracking apps are you know?
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:24.360]   Discloses information to third-party data very leaky very leaky. It's not a good word to use when you're talking about this so
[01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:30.800]   Plus this takes a lot of though. This takes a lot of the pressure off Shee Hawke and Star Trek in Lord of the Rings right because people can that's right
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:33.520]   I'm sorry finish that
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:41.000]   I was just gonna say because people are so busy complaining about that Apple actually focusing on features for women is gonna give them a whole
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:48.400]   Oh, you're here to lose their fragile little minds over. Oh good. Thank goodness. Yeah, I wasn't sure where you're going with that one
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:56.240]   All right, so those are these are all good features and I think that there is a lot to be said for Apple
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:01.160]   Generating this goodwill with its users, right? We're here to protect you. We're here to protect your privacy
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.800]   We're here to help you with be more healthy
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:06.040]   It's a good story
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:07.680]   both mark
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.200]   go ahead
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:12.320]   On a whole I mean of all the majors
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:14.520]   Even though I'm not an Apple fan
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:20.080]   I would trust Apple with my personal data more than I would trust Samsung Microsoft or any of the big ones. Yeah
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:23.840]   Both Ben Thompson and Jason Snell did point out that
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:30.360]   The modern day Apple is much more interested in our poo. We've talked about this before the average revenue per user
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:33.360]   In selling services and in fact
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:37.200]   Interestingly in the US the iPhone prices did not go up
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:44.880]   And I think they're charging less for the watch ultra than the comparable Garmin by a couple hundred bucks
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:48.360]   So Apple is either very sensitive to pricing or
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:55.200]   Understands that it's more important that they get these devices in people's hands. So that's been true make money on services
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:02.120]   That's been true since China mobile China mobile like they got Verizon and they got China mobile a few years after that and that was the last big
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:07.160]   Market for them to expand into you know absent there being one day Apple stores on Mars
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.560]   And I think that's the moment
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:14.320]   And I think we talked about that a Mac break for years that they went from building up the iPhone to using the iPhone as a platform
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:18.640]   To build up not just services but ancillary products like AirPods and Apple watch
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:24.380]   Yep, all of the Apple TV like all of those things are built airplay all those things are built on top of iPhone and now they have
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:30.040]   Expanded services from iCloud all the way through the stack all of it again built on on iPhone
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:36.040]   So it's it's an it's an amazing platform play where once you get to a point where you can't have that many more customers
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:39.360]   Almost everybody who has an iPhone can afford an iPhone or wants an iPhone
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:44.280]   You know has that iPhone you got to start getting more money from the same customers
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:48.560]   And that's a whole shift in business model. Well, they know how to do it. That's pretty clear. I
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:53.680]   Think we should let Renee talk about e-simps for a few minutes. So
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:57.400]   I the number of people the Apple didn't say this is courage
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:01.960]   But I think this is courage a number of people pointed this out one thing to take away a headphone jack
[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:07.640]   But to take away the sim tray means you're taking away any possibility of using a sim, right?
[01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:13.760]   There's no no more yeah, like so physical here's the context of here's the context of why I bring it up is that
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:19.520]   Me like I would imagine many of the other folks that might have a set of phones within the family
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:24.360]   And then they're like the main technology person. So the main phone account is probably in their name
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:30.040]   Right and they probably do the whole phone hand me down thing whenever they do the next
[01:05:30.040 --> 01:05:35.320]   Yes, we do that right in fact the hack happens now. I remember vividly
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:38.240]   I'm at the head of the table
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:45.000]   Then there's Lisa then there's your son Michael then his your ex husband Mike and I remember I bring out the sim tray
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:51.080]   Poker I remove the sim from my phone give it to Lisa put it in the new musical sim chairs
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.320]   It goes all right down poke poke poke
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:57.680]   So now what happens I think you have to call the company which is no
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:02.200]   It's no, it's blue you can Bluetooth sim transfer like it what where iPhones at least yeah
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:06.960]   You just they they Bluetooth parents transfer the sim data. That's super cool, but wait, but
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:12.760]   On your iPhone like how does that does it trade them? Does it swap them?
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:15.880]   What happens I think it can transfer from one to the other one to the other
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.400]   Yeah, right?
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:24.520]   So in the past you would get a sim you would have a sim and just put it in the new phone that would automatically make it your phone now
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:28.120]   So I'm gonna get my new phone on Friday
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:33.180]   What do I do Renee? I'll have my old father the setup buddy. So like set up buddy
[01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:37.240]   Which already is like 3,000 steps on it. There'll be a step to set up the sim
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:42.960]   This is us only first like there's still sim cards everywhere, but the US the US is the only one going
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:46.240]   e sim only so during the setup process
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:51.600]   It'll it'll pop up that screen for you and it can also you don't need Wi-Fi anymore to set it up because that would be problematic
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:54.780]   If you didn't have a sim card, so it can also just
[01:06:54.780 --> 01:07:01.440]   Join the like the forget what the term is for it, but it can go online and connect to your sim yet
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:05.080]   I don't think it's point of point Bluetooth. I think it's um I have to look up Scott
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:11.360]   But it occurred in that because I mean we already have a problem with people stealing sims imagine if it were Bluetooth
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:15.440]   For some hijacking that would could conceivably occur
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:20.440]   I mean that's a non-starter for me because I I actually buy your cards. Yeah, yeah
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:27.080]   Any country I go to I buy a sim card there and I put it into my phone so there is no more a transverse
[01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:28.040]   on
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:32.440]   Yeah, he's or you can have a sims and only two is active at any given time
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:38.120]   Which is probably more than enough now the verge did say the lot so that headphone jack was was user hostile
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:43.400]   It was stupid and user hostile. They didn't go quite so far with this the one thing that's interesting though
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:46.000]   Is that like the headphone jack HTC guard of headphone jacks?
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.760]   Years before apple did but nobody really cared and Motorola had an e-sim only phone two or three years ago
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:57.080]   Nobody cared it's that when apple does it every other carrier now every other phone company now has cover to do the same thing
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:01.000]   And that's what we tend to see the entire Samsung will make an ad making fun of them and then a year later
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.560]   They'll do the same thing meanwhile everyone else will just you know quietly move over
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:07.280]   So right this is okay
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:15.120]   So this is apples list of wireless carriers that support e-sim carrier activation and they're actually quite a few countries
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:17.400]   Not Italy. I'm sorry
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:25.480]   Robert and then there are quite a few companies within the u.s. That support it and then this is the e-sim quick transfer that you were talking about
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:28.380]   Renee and that's a subset of those in fact
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:32.940]   It's not a far fewer carriers in the u.s. MvN. O's, especially you're gonna have issues
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:39.700]   Yeah, AT&T, C-Spire T-Mobile U.S. Cellular and Verizon only in the u.s. We'll support that
[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:43.520]   Yeah, I mean I I can be really annoying for nerds several times a week
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:48.280]   Yeah, I'm not going through a sim swap process. Well the good news is put in the car
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:54.060]   You can't Robert get that iPhone in Italy. You can only get it in the u.s. Not even in Canada. Can you get the e-sim?
[01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:56.060]   Yeah, no ours have some cards you
[01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:59.940]   So everyone else has e-sim and regular sim you have both right you have a tray, right?
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:05.460]   Yeah, that's what you need is the tray so I understand when you take the tray out it occupies a lot of real estate and
[01:09:05.460 --> 01:09:09.980]   It it's another hole in the case which makes it harder to seal the case up
[01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:15.780]   I think it makes sense also like it's not that main free so this is like one of those things where we talked about different user groups different
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:21.700]   constituencies all with different priorities and where you start weighing those things so there's gonna be a lot of nerds like myself included to
[01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:26.760]   Super salty about this because like we have 18 phones and we move that sim card around all the time
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:33.180]   But most people don't most people have a phone for four to five years and also people with accessibility issues having to get a sim tool and
[01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:38.740]   Swap the thing even people who are just like poor iron coordination those night those nano sims like they fall out
[01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:43.620]   They drop they try to put it in the right way like it's if you ever watch someone in your family try to do without grabbing it
[01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:47.340]   From them and doing it yourself you have more patience and Padre I think at that point
[01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:52.620]   But it does solve problems, but it does create all sorts of other problems
[01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:58.580]   What about the contention that it makes it easy it makes it more friction-free to change carriers
[01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:03.340]   I'm on T-Mobile, but I want to go to Verizon is it is it easy to do that?
[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:10.420]   It's differently annoying like in both cases they have to get so I was telling a story like you have to go and get a sim card
[01:10:10.420 --> 01:10:11.420]   And sometimes they won't give it to you
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:14.300]   It's something they charge you for it sometimes they mail it to you you don't get it
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:19.780]   Yeah, sometimes you get it and like it doesn't work for like SMS for some reason at all your sim card is faulty
[01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:24.380]   And you've got to go have your son card change also problems when we went to 5g
[01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:30.700]   I got a notice from both my carriers T mobile and Verizon or you got need to get a new 5g sim
[01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:35.020]   So my existing sim didn't support whatever it is also intolerant
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:40.060]   It's borderline intolerable that it's been going on this long because for everything else that we have all we do is log in
[01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:45.340]   You don't need a separate chip for your email or your messaging service or your like your website
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:47.340]   Like we're not pushing a bunch of little cards around
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:52.900]   But we've had this archaic process for so long with these and it really should be something is like I log out of a titty
[01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:53.900]   I log into T-Mobile
[01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:55.060]   We're not there yet
[01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:56.660]   Eastam's got us a step closer
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:58.300]   But the more and they hate it
[01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:01.420]   But the more that we can dumb-pipify them the faster the better the sooner
[01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:06.940]   I'm all for pushing pushing forward the future and when Apple does something see take away the headphone jack
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:11.300]   Push forward the wrong future, but when you do something like this to push push for the future
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:18.940]   I'm and think of all the paper clips that I have 18 ports on my phone changes. Yeah, you would I don't want to double
[01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:21.260]   I don't have double USB-C to my account. I
[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:29.420]   Don't want my log you want a burner to all you want a burner. Yeah, and then it's it's I am very paranoid about that
[01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:32.060]   I want that disconnect I want to be able to swap
[01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:36.580]   Asims I want the carry not to know which services I'm using that's that's the whole thing
[01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:40.300]   That's how I build up my mobile presence. So they're tying you have to pay for it
[01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:42.580]   So they tie it to you through your payments
[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:50.860]   Well, or you go out and here's some cash here's some Lyra give me a sim no exactly
[01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:57.860]   Oh, there's there's nothing that ties these sims to me. Oh, I dump them. They're gone forever. You're good. Wow. Oh, we should we sorry
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:11:59.860]   We should check with the skiff on that we should get a rule
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:07.340]   I've always thought it really has really upset, but maybe not I don't know maybe Alan has something to say about it
[01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:14.740]   I mean, I mean that is good offset, but honestly like I mean I've been I've walked around Padres digs over there
[01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:19.500]   You know in Italy on vacation and yeah, I can attest to yes
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:25.300]   You could probably just go on to any given street corner and find some person that will just sell sims for cash
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:27.140]   It's different. They work for the community
[01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:32.460]   People work for the company. It's just yeah, that's just kind of that's how it works over there, right?
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:35.060]   It's super cheap over here. Yeah, right?
[01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:41.540]   I pay five euros a month and it's unlimited data and voice. So this is kind of an I get that for 500
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:46.660]   This is analogous to getting rid of cash
[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:53.300]   This is the same argument in some ways. I mean cash or dongle like USB dongles for software
[01:12:53.300 --> 01:13:00.220]   Yeah, I don't you just get rid of USB dongles for software. That's a terrible to get rid of floppy disk get rid of cassettes
[01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:01.460]   Get rid of all
[01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:08.860]   I don't think I have problem. I don't think I have any software that still uses a USB dongle. No, that's I think I think I got that
[01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:14.280]   The vision resolve was using it for the high end up until like a year or two. That's right. Yeah, that's right
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:16.340]   Terrible. Yeah
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:20.980]   Okay, so there are problems with getting rid of the sim tray
[01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:26.180]   But here in the first world unlike Canada we're gonna
[01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:35.300]   Okay, yeah, no, but it is early like what's interesting to me is like how like Samsung was really early to 5g arguably before anybody could really use 5g
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:41.940]   Google's really early to RCS Apple was really early now to getting rid of the sim card and like is that annoying or does that?
[01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:45.580]   Force adoption to come even earlier and there's probably arguments to be made both ways
[01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:49.460]   But it is always gonna hurt nerds like nerds are we are incredibly vocal
[01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:54.540]   But we are not a very large percentage and we are always gonna be hurt first hardest and most by these changes
[01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:59.140]   So this is this is the contents of your video that you just put on YouTube
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:04.980]   Yeah, is to talk about this and you are surprising me by coming down in favor of keeping the sim card
[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:07.780]   So
[01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:14.740]   Over the long arc of history. I think it should go away like I think a lot of these things are like can be way friendlier for mainstream people
[01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:21.060]   I'm happy that Apple offers both internationally. I don't I don't know that you need it to get rid of both in the US
[01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:27.380]   But when a company like Apple does it it does in arguably push those technologies through faster like when they got rid of the floppy drive
[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:31.380]   You know it did push us BC adoption adoption and when they got rid of hard drives
[01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:37.220]   It did push you know passing the baton nicely to my co-host it did push SSD adoption, you know, so
[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:39.580]   It's painful
[01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:43.500]   But it's painful to those of us who are grew up with the technology that we're losing life is
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:49.820]   Pain lives around life is pain technology makes it worse. That's it right there in a nutshell
[01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:54.260]   We're gonna take a little break Alan Malvin Tano mr. Submariner
[01:14:54.260 --> 01:15:00.500]   Mr. Robert father Robert mr. You know God's business

[01:19:57.580 --> 01:20:04.740]   Let me thank them so much for their support of this week in tech and now
[01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:07.980]   It's time to go to
[01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:10.500]   dynamic island
[01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:18.500]   I actually I have to be honest
[01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:20.860]   You know the whole punch of the notch
[01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:28.380]   I hate the notch on my Mac book because I use a program that doesn't know about the notch apples programs
[01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:33.740]   Do but my emacs doesn't so there's this gap at the top of the page when I go full screen
[01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:35.380]   I just drives me nuts
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:41.220]   But you know you're gonna have a camera you want a thin screen you want no bezels you're gonna have a something
[01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:49.540]   The new iPhone pros have a seven notch a cutout to actually there's one that's kind of laws and shapes and one that's a
[01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:53.180]   Little top, but you will never see those two because of
[01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:58.700]   Dynamic Island and I I want to give I think this is actually pretty impressive
[01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:05.020]   I want to give Apple credit for taking lemons and making lemonade out of it. They said they they
[01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:07.260]   Leaned into
[01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:12.860]   What is unfortunately something you have to do a cutout on the screen and I think they've made it better
[01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:18.060]   I'm I'm pretty impressed with the dynamic island. What do you kind of mission is a mate like so like the name?
[01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:22.180]   Whatever like I'm sure they went this just doesn't names that came up with that
[01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:25.860]   Yeah, there's no name that would have made me super happy with that and they probably didn't want another situation
[01:21:25.860 --> 01:21:30.100]   We're like Matthew parents Reno called it a notch and it sticks for five years or something
[01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:33.740]   And you know you thought that thingy on the top, you know the little yeah
[01:21:33.740 --> 01:21:36.940]   They were called a pill and it sounded like drugs and Apple had hated every time they heard it
[01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:38.940]   Like so they had to get ahead of that right away
[01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:43.980]   We found out that they trademarked it very clever they trademark it in Jamaica
[01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:46.580]   yes, cuz
[01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:51.220]   You can't see what trademarks are in effect in Jamaica without going to the office
[01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:53.460]   But you know Mark Kerman is moving to Jamaica
[01:21:53.460 --> 01:21:59.460]   But the the animations Leo these are the most playful interesting
[01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:06.400]   Amusing like well that you haven't seen able animations. I've seen you haven't seen a person have you no neither of
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:11.140]   I but well no, I've seen like just dean and mark has his video. Yeah videos a lot of the
[01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:11.740]   Yeah, it looks good
[01:22:11.740 --> 01:22:16.940]   But the like if you go frame by frame to do some of those it is like it this is classic Apple
[01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:20.980]   This is like what I what we haven't seen from them in a while because some of the stuff has been a little
[01:22:20.980 --> 01:22:25.140]   Janky over the last couple years. Yeah, this is really nice. Yeah, I
[01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:30.980]   You know any an Akos reaction is this is the first, you know
[01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:37.740]   User interface affordance in a long time that really makes a lot of sense and by the way
[01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:43.700]   No one knew it was it was not true. I didn't see any rumors about it. Did you?
[01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:46.580]   No one knew that they were gonna do this
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:50.540]   Can I be honest with you Leo now that I'm out and I can be based about this kind of stuff
[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:53.900]   Yeah, most most of the leaks are wrong like they don't really know what's happening
[01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:59.020]   They get like little bits of fragmentary information weeks and months after it was at all relevant anymore
[01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:02.340]   And it's just like if you go back and look like there was this huge scandal
[01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:03.740]   I barely like I look I saw it
[01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:07.660]   But I tried to stay away from it where they were yelling at each other and accusing each other of deleting their tweets to hide
[01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:13.580]   Bad calls and so I was like ah no like I'm glad that we live in an era now where Apple is like here
[01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:19.260]   It is like it's fun go play with it and like you can follow the rumors if you want, but they're not gonna be exact
[01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:22.260]   Okay, thank you. I agree. I for a long time
[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:23.500]   I actually banned rumors
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:27.500]   But the problem one Mac break weekly was as we got closer and closer in Apple event
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:32.260]   There was less to talk about less and less so we finally I had a cave and start doing rumors
[01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:34.340]   So the idea is this pill
[01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:42.380]   And by the way, there's a API so that developers of apps can use it as well will respond to
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:47.740]   The conditions so it'll show you what's going on. It's basically a permanent widget
[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:52.020]   But it changes in size and shape depending on what you're doing. I think that's brilliant
[01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:54.740]   Robert are you excited? Do you like it?
[01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:58.300]   You hate it. It's a dynamic island
[01:23:58.300 --> 01:24:03.540]   I love the island
[01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:05.540]   It's beautiful
[01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:10.340]   I mean, okay look in it looks okay. It's fine. I mean, yes
[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:18.140]   It's gonna take getting used to and yes, I don't it's it's not revolutionary, but I don't understand why people are getting
[01:24:18.140 --> 01:24:23.920]   Upset, I mean I've seen Twitter threats where people were saying this is destroying the iPhone as well. I'm thinking
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:26.220]   What why?
[01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:32.900]   You see before you've seen the not I think it makes the iPhone a little friendly plastic pal you want to be with because
[01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:34.980]   it's changing in
[01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:42.580]   Response to what you're doing and giving you just you know the information you want. I think potentially this is super cool
[01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:47.300]   We've never seen a widget like this and it sure does solve the problem of well
[01:24:47.300 --> 01:24:49.300]   What do we do with this big fat hole on our screen?
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:54.820]   By the way, it's iPhone Pro only they didn't put it in the notches still on the old iPhone
[01:24:54.820 --> 01:25:00.740]   Did they need like because that that camera focuses now correct? Yes, that's the camera that yes
[01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:06.100]   So is it is it that they had to lower it from the top edge because of that like is that mechanism that goes?
[01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:14.980]   Well, it's just like they only they only gained like not that many lines worth of pixels above it
[01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:17.140]   So it's like why did you really need to shift it down?
[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:22.180]   So I would imagine there maybe there's got to be some guts in there on the inside that that's it interesting question
[01:25:22.180 --> 01:25:24.660]   They decided
[01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:30.700]   You know, it's a laws engine a pill and they decided to show the activation lights for your microphone in the case
[01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:34.620]   of the camera on the screen, but it looks like it's part of this larger
[01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:38.420]   Black area, but the screen is blackened really
[01:25:38.420 --> 01:25:42.420]   So they're hiding the fact that there's two holes. I don't know
[01:25:42.420 --> 01:25:45.700]   We'll see when we get them whether you ever notice that there's two holes
[01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:48.300]   We'll see how responsive it is
[01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:54.740]   You can see on the current ones in a certain light like you can see the entire mechanism. I'm sure that's the case
[01:25:54.740 --> 01:26:00.660]   Yeah, I think you can even in these videos from Apple you can see the camera lens in the in the
[01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:05.360]   Notch or the whole I mean within a day. They'll be a teardown and we'll know exactly what's behind that right?
[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:11.900]   Yeah, it's yeah, maybe a ten assemblies up there and they wanted to get more space to have our interference with the iPhone
[01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:15.140]   Nothing still have the notch it also has the old a 15 chip
[01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:19.820]   Is the initiation it's just it's just the old green right it's marketing
[01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:26.260]   Isn't it using the old models the products. Oh is it maybe that's it maybe they couldn't cut a hole in it. I don't know
[01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:29.300]   It certainly is differentiation
[01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:34.720]   All right, well, I was excited about the dynamic island, but I guess I'm not
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:37.980]   No, no, it's great. What did you get? What did you order? So?
[01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:46.660]   Apple's ordering process at 5 a.m. Pacific time on Friday was the worst. It's been an old in a few years
[01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:49.580]   I got up at 5
[01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:52.100]   Mostly, you know, normally I wouldn't care
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:54.820]   I go to the store and get it in October in November
[01:26:54.820 --> 01:27:00.100]   But because I want to be able to talk about it early on on the radio show and on a podcast
[01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:02.820]   I usually like to get it as soon as I can
[01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:06.980]   So I had pre-saved the order one for Lisa one for me
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:12.060]   5 a.m. Store still closed took about six minutes. I'm really sleepy
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:15.420]   I did not want to get up out lying in bed looking at my phone on the side
[01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:22.500]   Finally comes alive 506. I think you know Apple's intent was it just it says you've got a pre-order
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:26.300]   So I hit that all you have to do is confirm it and go and it
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:32.100]   Did weird stuff it didn't seem like it went through I looked at my orders
[01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:37.780]   I didn't show it then I tried my phone and that really didn't go through the whole thing collapsed I
[01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:40.020]   Just gave up
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:44.780]   You should have done what I did Leo that is forget that you were on West Coast time go during the East Coast time
[01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:49.940]   Instead should be three hours late and then not gonna phone until October is that what you you're not gonna get to like to yeah
[01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:53.500]   Oh, I was used to being eight o'clock and I forgot that I was on West Coast time
[01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:56.500]   So I went away to clock and it'd been up for three hours like oh October 15th
[01:27:56.500 --> 01:28:00.340]   So this is just the pent up pandemic demand
[01:28:00.340 --> 01:28:06.340]   Oh, so people won it no, but they wanted something new I understand it's hard to design a site for peak use
[01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:12.580]   I understand that but this happens every year you gotta this got to be a way can't you get like
[01:28:12.580 --> 01:28:15.380]   Cloudflare somebody
[01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:19.100]   Yeah to back up your cart. I don't know I just see anyway
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:22.980]   I I went back to sleep got up in the round around eight in the morning
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:29.780]   Check to see if that first order went through it had they finally started show up so good. All right. I got Lisa's phone
[01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:32.380]   She got 512 black
[01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:36.340]   I'm looking around. I don't want to get in October. I want to get sooner
[01:28:36.340 --> 01:28:39.460]   So I found out I finally
[01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:44.740]   Messing with the configurator if I get 256 gigs in gold
[01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:48.140]   Which apparently wow fairly no
[01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:50.500]   Okay
[01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:55.820]   I'm going more storage. Oh, maybe that's it. That's right. Yeah. Yeah anyway
[01:28:55.820 --> 01:29:02.100]   That was what I wanted was 256 because that's I haven't used you know anywhere near that on my 12
[01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:05.100]   So I got 256 in gold and I could pick it up
[01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:11.260]   I have to drive to Marin and pick it up at the Apple Store Marin 3 330 on Friday, but at least I'll have it
[01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:18.100]   So it was not a good it was honestly not a good experience and I wonder how much that hurts Apple
[01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:20.100]   I guess anybody who gets up at 5 a.m
[01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:27.420]   It's midnight GMT. I realized oh, that's why they're doing it's midnight GMT anybody who gets up midnight
[01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:35.060]   UTC or whatever is serious enough that even if it's a problem, they're not gonna stop yeah, right
[01:29:35.060 --> 01:29:37.140]   They're gonna not gonna go buy a pixel because of it right
[01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:41.980]   I buy that too. So that's why that's why the fall is fun. I every year
[01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:49.540]   I buy the Nexus or pixel and the iPhone its fall is very expensive very expensive. Yeah, and then the AirPods and the Pixel Buds Pro
[01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:55.600]   I'm not the AirPods the Pixel watch and I didn't want to buy those and I got the ultra watch because
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:30:01.460]   Because I'm a I'm an adventurer. I can't help it. I'm going up kill a manjaro and
[01:30:01.460 --> 01:30:07.480]   I will and Sundar was wearing the pixel watch during code conference - just teasing was he oh I'm actually
[01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:09.480]   Get that but I'll never wear it. Yeah
[01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:12.760]   Too risky oh
[01:30:12.760 --> 01:30:19.840]   My goodness, I just you know what Leo I thank you for the admission the honesty is
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:25.800]   Hurts to be a sheep. Oh this it really hurts. It really you're gonna get it. You're just you're not you're an enthusiast
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:30.400]   You're technology enthusiast you're interested in you and wonderful Leo. We live in an age of wonders
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:32.400]   You know what the real test will be
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:37.360]   When I retire and I don't have to review it or anything will I get it? I bet I won't I took a
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:41.280]   I I didn't buy one last year. I'm still on the 12
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:45.720]   So I buy every second year Apple watches for a while now
[01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:50.280]   But the thing that always makes me smile is when somebody retires from like an apple or a google or a Facebook
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:55.040]   They go so hard the other directions. They're like I am never going on like never mind an alpha
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:57.400]   I'm never going on a beta again. I'm never going on a first release
[01:30:57.400 --> 01:31:02.960]   I am gonna only buy rev to hardware from now on and then they like they don't know how to buy or set up anything because it's always been
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:08.680]   Provisioned by the company and they have no idea how like 80 a t or t mobile works or and then they buy like the cheapest thing
[01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:10.680]   They can to keep it for four years. It's amazing
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:14.160]   Now that now that we've really wrapped this up
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:20.000]   I feel like an idiot because there isn't that much new in the phone. I should probably be sick for spurring our economy
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.480]   But you can try out the SOS feature. I mean that does sound kind of cool
[01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:29.160]   Right 48 megapixels. No, I can't try out the
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:34.960]   picture because then emergency services will come to me and I will say no
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:40.520]   Doctor on Twitter. It's just testing it. We send the helicopter back. I don't need
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:44.080]   And then they'll bill you we're gonna yeah, exactly
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:46.920]   Compression's chest compressions exactly
[01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:56.320]   I got the AirPods pro to just to see is it twice as good in the noise cancellation actually most I'm interested in the
[01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:00.360]   LC3 codec my hearing is way worse than the first one
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:04.320]   So I don't even know like is it really or is this my hearing worse? I just can't hear a thing
[01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:07.000]   Yep
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:13.440]   No colors even though the AirPods max have colors the AirPods Pro still don't oh, yeah, that's true
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:17.280]   Yeah, I'll dip them. I'll make them gold like my own phone. Yeah
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:24.080]   You could do like arts and crafts with like some markers. Yeah, by the way the ultra is 800 dollar watch you want colors
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:26.760]   No, you get any color you want as long as it's titanium
[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:35.240]   Blop gray, but well if you're gonna get titanium. Why would you paint it? Well, I guess you're right. Yeah, can they end guys titanium?
[01:32:35.240 --> 01:32:40.920]   I don't think I don't know if you know, it's uh, I don't think so. It's the same thing as the as you like getting
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:48.200]   Painted carbon fiber. Why would you do that right? You want to see it? Yeah? Yeah, actually I think I think I think
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:50.200]   I think for watch
[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:53.840]   I like a wrap or I'm sure
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:02.120]   IOS 16 is rapidly. Oh, oh wrap it. That's good. Yeah, that's good. Do you wrap your cars Alan?
[01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:04.160]   No
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:06.240]   You seem like the type that will now I
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:12.240]   I will occasionally plasti dip out some chrome or something. Yeah, exactly that
[01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:19.200]   It seems like you might be the kind of guy that does it. I know why I see you driving a challenger around that's been dipped
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:24.400]   Is Matt black no man? We talked about this earlier. I'm driving a Tesla. That's right
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:26.000]   two of them
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:32.640]   Cool, Marquez doesn't eat Marquez Matt black his Tesla. Yeah, I'm sure he does. That's a that's a wrap on his I think right
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:36.800]   He gets the paint protection film or yeah, whatever. I feel like I
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:41.880]   Know I'm gonna get on there and I'm gonna be in a grocery store parking lot somebody's gonna run a carton to me
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:43.880]   And it's gonna peel it's gonna have like a weird
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:49.240]   Plastic peel thing does that you see I'm a fan of like the Star Wars used technology look
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:50.680]   That's why I like people complain about there
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:54.800]   I just let the stuff get beaten up and it's great. It looks like the money in Falcon. I can not be happier
[01:33:54.800 --> 01:34:01.280]   Yeah, so so Leo you're half right like I probably would be a person that does some sort of like, you know
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:06.800]   I like I want to do the paint protection film thing on the car not necessarily a rapid change of color or go that crazy
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:12.120]   But but then inevitably I get the car it gets a few of the early, you know
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:18.600]   Dinged up whatever happens to the front of it just from you know highway or rock chip or something and I'm like, oh great
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:23.040]   Now it's not perfect. Well now I why bother with the you know doing the yeah
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:31.600]   Protection I want a car that I could ding up and not feel bad about yeah. I'm always happy with us all run you get that first day 10 parsecs
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:33.040]   Yeah
[01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:41.920]   Monday tomorrow iOS 16 comes out, you know notable mostly in my opinion because it will be the first implementation of past keys
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:48.580]   So this is the new passwordless future now pointless to have past keys until a website supports
[01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:52.860]   It but I guess it's one of those chicken and egg things now that the iPhone has past keys
[01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:58.340]   Maybe we'll see some websites. Do you think this year? We'll see some past key to enable websites
[01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:01.140]   Yeah, for sure
[01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:08.020]   Because I mean it's a little bit of a save to it takes a big company doing it to get it to catch on right like we know
[01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:12.500]   Poor Steve Gibson's been trying to do his squirrel thing. Yeah squirrel would have been better, but you know
[01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:16.020]   So Google says they're going to put it in
[01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:20.380]   Testing in beta versions at the later this year
[01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:25.100]   Microsoft says they're going to do it next year. So those are the big three
[01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:27.900]   Apples a little ahead of the bunch though
[01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:30.220]   Yeah
[01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:32.220]   Well, I hope I hope I I
[01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:37.420]   It'll be it'll be like the first time I used an Apple watch to buy something the first time I get to use
[01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:40.540]   Pascis that will be coming to your iOS
[01:35:40.540 --> 01:35:43.140]   16
[01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:45.140]   Apple was fast to implement it actually
[01:35:46.740 --> 01:35:48.740]   And
[01:35:48.740 --> 01:35:50.780]   Then all that is and stuff comes in there too
[01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:55.380]   So if you wanted to convert your physical sim into an easy like if you wanted to add more hurt
[01:35:55.380 --> 01:36:00.380]   Necessarily
[01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:06.340]   So you mean if you have a phone that still has sims because you have iOS 16 you can make it an easy
[01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:11.820]   Something right yeah, like this is this is literally what I'm trying to figure out for that whole phone hand me down thing
[01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:17.340]   Right do I need to take the older phone that's doesn't you know do I need to convert that sim to the e-sim?
[01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:21.200]   And then swap that with the iPhone 14 when you so the
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:27.900]   Unless you sit next to the person you're giving it to you're probably gonna just deactivate it and let it be up to them
[01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:29.900]   Right or no
[01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:33.500]   Mike no, we're gonna be running security as the update
[01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:41.500]   We're gonna have a couple of verification issues like what Jason Howell did a few years back when he was swapping out of Android device
[01:36:41.820 --> 01:36:47.980]   And he his authentication was his Google voice number, but his Google voice number was tied to his Google account
[01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:50.180]   Right so he couldn't authenticate his good
[01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:56.620]   You know if you're if you're tying together your your passkey and your e-sim and all of your other information at some point
[01:36:56.620 --> 01:36:59.820]   I'm thinking you're gonna lock yourself out of a verification step
[01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:04.580]   Yeah, so just be careful happens that I'm on the plane all the time like some account goes all your locations different
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:07.180]   We're sending you as SMS and please don't send me SMS
[01:37:07.180 --> 01:37:13.740]   Also on a plane and then you can't get into anything actually Rod pile about widgets video Rod was a what's that widgets?
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:15.740]   Oh, you like the new widgets?
[01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:20.380]   I can't I don't know if you can see him, but there's widgets on the lock screen and yeah the new look and everything
[01:37:20.380 --> 01:37:22.060]   I think it's not it's fun
[01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:25.820]   It'd be nice if your little Nemo were on a dynamic island
[01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:31.740]   It would oh they would have so much fun. They would be flipping and jumping over and then Dory would forget who they were
[01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:37.140]   These just new my phone says get ready for your new iPhone. I don't even know how they knew that
[01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:40.940]   Get ready for your no. Oh, it's because it's tied to your account. Oh, yeah, that's right
[01:37:40.940 --> 01:37:47.980]   No, I wait when your new phone comes. It's just gonna. It's automatically gonna have your account it right they they pre-set all that no
[01:37:47.980 --> 01:37:54.820]   Will it never has in the past. I don't believe so you got a log in you got to remember your password
[01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:57.420]   Amazon does that but I don't think apples Amazon Amazon
[01:37:57.420 --> 01:38:04.420]   Yeah, Amazon's actually very good at that although I am kind of freaked out about that sometimes because if my if a new device gets intercepted in transit
[01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:06.700]   It's you can really set up with more of you gift it
[01:38:06.700 --> 01:38:11.820]   It's been inconvenient for people who've been gifting them. I gave my mom the new Kindle Oasis
[01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:16.360]   Yeah, and there's a little checkbox which I never saw before but I was
[01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:22.980]   Curious that says do not attach my account you check that box and you can send it as a gift and it's not it's got no account
[01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:28.100]   But then I had a thought oh, this is gonna be fun. I'm gonna have to call my 90 year old mom and explain that
[01:38:28.100 --> 01:38:31.700]   Log in to Amazon and her Kindle but beautiful
[01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:38.140]   It opens up and it says now open the Kindle app on your old Kindle or your iPhone and it did and it just all
[01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:43.940]   I'll transfer it over it was it was the easiest thing was awesome. So yeah, Amazon does a good job of that. That was impressive. Yeah
[01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:47.460]   All right
[01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:52.340]   Google is gonna have an event October 6 so you're getting the pixel 7
[01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:58.980]   The pixel watch the pixel buds you're doing the the whole I've done that every year since the
[01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:02.420]   Nexus the first one Nexus 1 really I
[01:39:02.420 --> 01:39:07.620]   Didn't know this you couldn't admit it when you were a break weekly you couldn't know I did oh, okay
[01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:11.540]   I always talked about it. Oh, I didn't know that good for you. Yeah, I always have a pixel
[01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:14.020]   I don't know if I want to get the new one. I'm very happy with the pixel 6
[01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:17.660]   What do you what is gonna what is gonna change for this thing?
[01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:21.860]   It's be better minus with it. That's what the story is of every phone that
[01:39:22.700 --> 01:39:29.260]   Like it like honestly I like it because like every pixel so far has been almost a repudiation of the previous general pixel
[01:39:29.260 --> 01:39:30.740]   It's a different
[01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:36.180]   And and to me that makes it harder because you're almost starting from scratch every year and this year looks like they're gonna
[01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:39.840]   Like use the pixel 6 as a foundation and just accelerate forward on the 7
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:43.100]   That's the strategy Apple's been using and Samsung's been using for years
[01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:49.620]   I think it's really smart because it's like an efficient use of everybody's time and it ends up giving you a really stable solid product
[01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:54.660]   That's gonna be great. I am the pixel watch actually looks pretty. It's round. It's it looks pretty
[01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:58.100]   But we'll see now that I have a four pound watch on this arm
[01:39:58.100 --> 01:40:00.840]   I don't know if I want enough to watch on the other arm
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:03.100]   Can I like Wonder Woman bracers?
[01:40:03.100 --> 01:40:08.680]   Can I take the pixel watch up to kill a manjar with me or is it just gonna go?
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:12.820]   You go ahead leave me here
[01:40:12.820 --> 01:40:16.780]   They're also
[01:40:17.220 --> 01:40:20.500]   Gonna do this at 7 in the morning our time
[01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:26.360]   So I'm making Jason how I'll get up to do this one 10 a.m. Eastern and they're doing it out of the Google super
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:34.140]   Or in Manhattan. Yeah, or Brooklyn happy birthday by the way Jason how our producer host of all about Android and Tech News weekly
[01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:36.340]   Man about town
[01:40:36.340 --> 01:40:39.980]   Is it's 50 years old today?
[01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:46.300]   76 years young is such he looks it doesn't look a day day over he says he's 47
[01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:51.460]   It's actually as a northern star. I am surprised. I thought he was younger than that to be honest with you
[01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:55.220]   So you look great Jason happy birthday. It's nice of you to work
[01:40:55.220 --> 01:40:59.660]   While you're celebrating your birthday. I appreciate that
[01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:04.300]   So Jason is younger than I am I believe oh really
[01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:07.460]   Yeah, I'm pretty sure okay by a couple years, right?
[01:41:07.460 --> 01:41:13.000]   Google's gonna do a live event - they're gonna stream it
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:19.140]   But there'll be an in-person event in Brooklyn Apple did that they went to the Steve Jobs Theater did not observe a lot of masks in
[01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:24.860]   Evidence in fact, I'm pretty sure the only masks worn were by Micah Sergeant and Jason Snell. I
[01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:27.520]   Think I guilted them into it
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:33.460]   So I guess COVID's over Google and Apple are saying it's over
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:43.340]   I mean they're probably doing testing before the thing right, you know, yeah, they require you just some day before you
[01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:45.840]   Apple did the day before you go
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:48.140]   right, but
[01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:53.780]   Apple really it was it was an honor system because you could just send them a picture of your plastic stick
[01:41:53.780 --> 01:42:02.820]   So I don't know about you, but I have at least a dozen negative sticks just hanging around waiting
[01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:09.120]   Ready ready to go just in case just in case I took a little magic marker and darkened the
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:13.520]   Test launch so you it's very clear. I'm not
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:15.980]   sick I
[01:42:15.980 --> 01:42:20.860]   Have to do these transatlantic flights where there is no testing requirement not anymore
[01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:24.840]   No masking required until you're sitting in a tube for 14 hours. Well
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:29.740]   Canada still has mass requirement I'm both my flights this week
[01:42:29.740 --> 01:42:31.600]   I had to wear well, I didn't I would have worn it anyway
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:36.840]   But everyone had to wear a mask and even give out masks because a lot of people aren't aware of that especially when you're coming from America to Canada
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:38.840]   It's like what are you doing on your mask?
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:40.840]   You're still very strict
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:47.740]   They got rid of the like the COVID app that you still have to fill out on pond reentry and they used to have like testing
[01:42:47.740 --> 01:42:50.900]   That was so that never worked properly
[01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:56.840]   Seriously, we've we've had so many different changes in the paperwork that we had the fill-in coming back and forth across the pond and
[01:42:57.620 --> 01:43:01.860]   Sometimes it was just like wait a minute. I didn't I just fill this out for the country. I just left
[01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:05.620]   So it's of that part. I do I do like it's much better. I
[01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:14.220]   Perfectly happy to wear a mask, but since no one else is I just you know, I'm still wearing mine. Yeah, I still wear mine
[01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:18.780]   Yeah, we were we were at around the studio Benito's wearing one now, right? Yeah, I
[01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:23.440]   Took mine off so I could speak but I'll put it on again before I leave the studio. I
[01:43:24.140 --> 01:43:27.820]   Just you know, it's it's not hard. It's better to air on the side of caution
[01:43:27.820 --> 01:43:32.940]   I just I think it's interesting Apple also asked its employees to come back to work on Tuesday
[01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:34.540]   and
[01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:39.980]   Much to the was that good timing like yeah, I think we're having a huge event. Yeah wait till the next day
[01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:49.300]   And Apple the way Apple's gonna do it is you will have to work on campus three days a week
[01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:57.340]   Tuesday Thursday and a day to be named later your your boss can name the third day and if your boss says anything about Wednesday
[01:43:57.340 --> 01:43:59.740]   He's a dick
[01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:10.980]   Yeah, right. I mean, that's not yeah, it's gotta be Wednesday. You're there on Tuesday and Thursday make it Wednesday boss
[01:44:10.980 --> 01:44:17.380]   All right, we're gonna take another break talk Twitter when we get back
[01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:23.820]   Maybe I shouldn't tell people that no, we're not gonna talk Twitter. We'll talk about scary clowns when we come back
[01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:26.220]   That's better than Twitter
[01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:29.340]   and Alan Malvontano is here submariner and
[01:44:29.340 --> 01:44:32.300]   What was your highest security?
[01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:35.260]   clearance
[01:44:35.260 --> 01:44:40.700]   TSCI what's that mean you can you can look at a Wow SC document
[01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:47.660]   The special compartmented information. Yeah, so it's so yeah, usually there's there's not usually just
[01:44:47.660 --> 01:44:52.300]   like a regular top secret like usually the things that are top secret are
[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:58.580]   Compartmented that's the idea right? Yeah, okay. Here's this here's this a group all these things are top secret
[01:44:58.580 --> 01:45:05.260]   But they're all categorized in various things and so like you don't just need to know it's need to know it's it's a love
[01:45:05.260 --> 01:45:10.180]   It's a form of need to know right it's it's there's no such thing as really just oh you just get to look at everything
[01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:15.180]   No, it's like okay. You're working on this project you get this particular SCI grade, you know
[01:45:15.420 --> 01:45:19.580]   Thing where you're allowed to go and look at that stuff just that pertains to what you're doing I
[01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:21.860]   Suck the Apple design lab similar
[01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:28.020]   Lower higher. I mean it I would imagine it's probably I mean it's it's any it's any sort of hey
[01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:30.900]   You're trying to keep various things secret and you know
[01:45:30.900 --> 01:45:36.700]   There's really no such thing as just everybody gets to look at everything right like that applies a lot of places. Yes
[01:45:36.700 --> 01:45:37.860]   Yeah
[01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:39.860]   Even here
[01:45:41.220 --> 01:45:47.380]   Yeah, there there are lower ones that are like more general right right T s
[01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:50.340]   SCI is the top right that's the yeah
[01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:56.220]   That's the top I remember seeing John Brennan the former CIA director saying there's TSSSCI documents
[01:45:56.220 --> 01:46:00.620]   I couldn't see even as director of CIA because it's need to know that makes sense
[01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:03.940]   Anyway
[01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:07.300]   Everything that we say here Alan, Malvatano is allowed to know
[01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:09.940]   What are the what were the aliens? What were they rated?
[01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:12.900]   That need to know was that
[01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:19.740]   Did you take a box of documents home with you? That's all I care other flying stars on your garage
[01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:26.820]   And we have a single noted by the Queen I just want to know oh, yeah, yeah, of course
[01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:31.300]   Oh
[01:46:31.300 --> 01:46:36.340]   Yes, the Queen of Mars father Robert Balissaire
[01:46:36.340 --> 01:46:39.060]   digital Jesuit
[01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:41.380]   our man in the Vatican I
[01:46:41.380 --> 01:46:47.300]   Also have an SCI clearance, but it's just information that no one cares about does it I bet the Vatican has
[01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:49.780]   some sort of
[01:46:49.780 --> 01:46:53.020]   top secret thing right designation yes or
[01:46:53.020 --> 01:47:02.540]   No, he can't talk about it if he knew he wouldn't I mean there's one about 40 feet away that way what what is it?
[01:47:02.540 --> 01:47:04.540]   Are our archives oh?
[01:47:04.540 --> 01:47:07.700]   Nobody's allowed in
[01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:15.500]   No, just the certain parts yes, then no, so there's stuff yes in the Jesuit archives
[01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:22.340]   That even you couldn't go in and say hey can I borrow that I want to take that home
[01:47:22.340 --> 01:47:27.660]   That's correct. That is correct. It's quite too fragile. Well that would I'm sure that too. Yes
[01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:29.900]   Yeah, a lot of the documents are fragile, but also
[01:47:29.900 --> 01:47:34.260]   There are certain levels we don't call it declassification
[01:47:34.580 --> 01:47:40.820]   But there's information that the church has to decide you can make this available this available this available
[01:47:40.820 --> 01:47:44.020]   And it generally falls a regular schedule
[01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:49.300]   But as a result it means there's information there that we the public cannot see is there it's not
[01:47:49.300 --> 01:47:54.020]   Fairies you've never told us about like are you hiding a date is there a week or something?
[01:47:54.020 --> 01:47:59.580]   Secretly holding on to the eighth day
[01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:04.460]   That's right. That's right. Yeah on the eighth day. You know that you had a party
[01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:13.100]   The Bible nobody knows some of it. So let me this is a weird question and again you can
[01:48:13.100 --> 01:48:15.980]   laugh at me is some of it not
[01:48:15.980 --> 01:48:18.820]   Available public because it's evil
[01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:23.100]   No
[01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:29.380]   There's not like some no witchcraft manual that they feel no it's not we know it's BS
[01:48:29.380 --> 01:48:32.540]   But we wouldn't want to destroy that in the doctor's strange movie Leo
[01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:36.500]   That's what I thought but I was just wanted to make sure that the Jesuits didn't have a copy
[01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:40.660]   There's no witchcraft manuals, but there would be
[01:48:40.660 --> 01:48:44.940]   Information about
[01:48:44.940 --> 01:48:51.820]   Investigations on stuff like that. Oh interesting. Oh, yeah way way back. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's the thing
[01:48:51.820 --> 01:48:58.460]   I mean that's actually the back of thousand years right there's ancient to historians occasionally say cannot can we look at this stuff? Oh
[01:48:59.380 --> 01:49:03.900]   Absolutely. Yeah, that's that's why we built the archives. There's actually places where you can go in and you can
[01:49:03.900 --> 01:49:11.540]   Run rummage through the stacks but you have to ask I'm looking for something specific and then the people in the archives can actually find
[01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:14.780]   What you're looking for and they'll bring it out to you. I love that. I think that's great
[01:49:14.780 --> 01:49:20.980]   Yeah, but it is that CI so you can only look at it in there you have to be in there and they
[01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:23.700]   Take it out of the secret compartment
[01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:26.980]   in the Vatican a skiff is
[01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:30.860]   Shielded right from even electro magnetic
[01:49:30.860 --> 01:49:38.180]   Espionage yes gifts will usually have like chicken wire in the walls Wow literally
[01:49:38.180 --> 01:49:43.740]   And not only that but if it's if it's like a building that had like a drop ceiling or you know the little panels
[01:49:43.740 --> 01:49:49.660]   You can remove in the ceiling. Yeah like sealed. There's literally the wall continues. Yeah, like it's you know
[01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:55.580]   There's no it's all it's solid. Yeah. Yeah, there's no crawling around
[01:49:56.660 --> 01:50:02.380]   Movies were fake. Yeah, so does it is it tempest is that what they call it the tempest certified stuff?
[01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:05.540]   That's the tempest was the technology to let you
[01:50:05.540 --> 01:50:11.060]   Listen through walls or read like read screens through walls and stuff like that. Oh
[01:50:11.060 --> 01:50:14.260]   That was like a project wasn't it? Yeah
[01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:18.460]   Temps and hands yeah, and hands. Yeah
[01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:25.860]   That's what I want that's what CSI promised me zoom enhance that's the next I've license plate from the space
[01:50:25.860 --> 01:50:29.300]   No, it's every mission impossible like Tom Cruise would be in the ceiling and now I know that's impossible
[01:50:29.300 --> 01:50:37.140]   It's been lied to you guys have you guys messed with some of the topaz labs tools though. They're pretty amazing
[01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:44.500]   Some of that stuff is surprisingly good. Yeah, it's not to the sci-fi level yet, but yeah, holy crap
[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:46.580]   It's like where did it where did that do you tell come well?
[01:50:46.580 --> 01:50:48.580]   You've seen now with these artificial intelligence
[01:50:48.580 --> 01:50:55.300]   Painting programs like dolly can do dolly to as added out painting where they take the effect
[01:50:55.300 --> 01:50:59.940]   If you go to the alley to website you can see this the girl yeah, early ring and they say well
[01:50:59.940 --> 01:51:01.940]   What what are the rest of the room look like?
[01:51:01.940 --> 01:51:06.180]   And they Leo we don't
[01:51:06.180 --> 01:51:09.860]   We don't even know if Alex Lindsey is real anymore. He might have programmed himself like long ago
[01:51:09.860 --> 01:51:14.340]   Like we might be having a vtuber Alex Lindsey for the last year. Yeah longer ago. He did that. Yeah
[01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:21.700]   It wasn't it wasn't too long ago. We were all amazed by the content aware filter or content aware. I know I know I know on photoshop
[01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:24.900]   Right and then they added it to a year. Totally that blue mind
[01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:28.340]   But don't you want to live in a world of wonders like where
[01:51:28.340 --> 01:51:32.020]   Like the next iPhone thing that we what we really want is
[01:51:32.020 --> 01:51:36.740]   How did they do that? How can they do that? That's why I think people are so interested in a
[01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:41.460]   The pixel eraser was like that like take a picture of the beat just paint people out of existence and then they actually disappear
[01:51:41.460 --> 01:51:45.140]   It's it's for yeah, it's for and for a year they actually disappeared like Thanos
[01:51:45.140 --> 01:51:51.300]   For yeah for for years they talked about it. They only put it in the phone a couple of years after they announced yeah
[01:51:51.300 --> 01:51:52.420]   Yeah
[01:51:52.420 --> 01:51:58.900]   Our show today brought to you by colide. I like this sponsor because I like the idea of treating users
[01:51:58.900 --> 01:52:07.140]   Like partners not enemies, you know if you're you know if you're in uh trying to achieve security in your company
[01:52:07.140 --> 01:52:11.060]   Uh, you can't like you know you want to have
[01:52:11.060 --> 01:52:13.940]   Keep the bad guys out and the good guys in
[01:52:13.940 --> 01:52:18.180]   Whether for a third party audit or your own compliance standards
[01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:23.780]   In the past the conventional wisdom is to basically treat each device like fortnocks, right?
[01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:26.340]   You glue up the usb ports
[01:52:26.340 --> 01:52:31.060]   Yet you make sure people don't bring their own phones their own laptops into the enterprise
[01:52:31.060 --> 01:52:35.140]   You use old school device management tools mdm's to force
[01:52:35.140 --> 01:52:39.540]   You know basically employees to give up their freedom
[01:52:39.540 --> 01:52:42.580]   To give up their performance
[01:52:42.580 --> 01:52:46.020]   To give up their privacy. The problem is what happens then
[01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:50.740]   Employees aren't stupid. They start using their own laptops or their own phones
[01:52:50.740 --> 01:52:53.700]   And now you've got a world of hurt colide
[01:52:53.700 --> 01:53:01.220]   Is a different idea. It's an end point security solution that uses the most powerful untapped resource and it
[01:53:01.220 --> 01:53:04.900]   Your end users. They're not the enemy
[01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:11.860]   They're your allies. How does it work? Well, you got to use slack if you're a company that uses slack like ours does many do
[01:53:12.580 --> 01:53:16.420]   Instead of you know forcing changes on users locking them down
[01:53:16.420 --> 01:53:19.700]   Collide sends them dms on slack security
[01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:23.300]   Recommendations and the client agent is always looking for things
[01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:28.980]   You know your passwords are in the clear in a download folder for instance or you know, you're left your private key
[01:53:28.980 --> 01:53:31.780]   You know out unlocked and available
[01:53:31.780 --> 01:53:38.020]   So collide finds that and it will automatically then notify your team about the insecurity
[01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:44.100]   Explain why it's a problem and even better give them step-by-step instructions on how to solve the problem. They are
[01:53:44.100 --> 01:53:46.900]   Now enlisted as allies
[01:53:46.900 --> 01:53:53.300]   They know how to solve it. They know why they're solving it and suddenly it's not an adversarial relationship
[01:53:53.300 --> 01:53:56.820]   By reaching out to employees via friendly slack dm
[01:53:56.820 --> 01:54:03.060]   Educating about company policies. Collide can help you build a culture in which everyone contributes to security
[01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:06.340]   Because everyone understands how and why to do it
[01:54:07.540 --> 01:54:12.020]   You can also justify it very nicely for it admins collide provides a single dashboard
[01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:17.140]   That lets you monitor the security of your entire fleet whether they're running on Mac windows or Linux
[01:54:17.140 --> 01:54:18.740]   Yeah, it works in all three
[01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:25.940]   You can see at a glance which employees for instance have their discs encrypted or their their updates on their operating system or their or their browser
[01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:30.900]   Which password manager is installed as any password manager install it makes it easy
[01:54:30.900 --> 01:54:35.220]   To prove compliance to your auditors to your customers in leadership
[01:54:36.100 --> 01:54:38.100]   So that's collide kolid
[01:54:38.100 --> 01:54:44.100]   User centered cross platform endpoint security for teams that slack
[01:54:44.100 --> 01:54:51.380]   You can meet your compliance goals by putting users first. It's true. It works kolid
[01:54:51.380 --> 01:54:53.780]   Collide.com/trit to find out how
[01:54:53.780 --> 01:55:00.740]   Follow the link to hook you up with a goody bag including a t-shirt just for activating a free trial actually the t-shirts are really nice
[01:55:00.740 --> 01:55:05.300]   Uh, I have a bunch of collide stuff with the stickers on my laptop kol
[01:55:05.940 --> 01:55:14.420]   IDE kolid.com/trit we thank collide so much for supporting this week in tech
[01:55:14.420 --> 01:55:20.020]   So twitter is still in the news
[01:55:20.020 --> 01:55:28.500]   Let's just give you a quick rundown of course remember peters that co the former much the former security
[01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:33.780]   Director did you know much had you run into them at def con or black hat father robert
[01:55:34.820 --> 01:55:36.820]   Everyone knows much. Yeah
[01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:39.380]   Well known he worked for the dod
[01:55:39.380 --> 01:55:41.860]   He worked for google
[01:55:41.860 --> 01:55:46.500]   He was a very you know when that when twitter hired him. I was impressed they hired him in the
[01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:48.100]   uh
[01:55:48.100 --> 01:55:51.140]   aftermath of that horror, you know, we're remember that
[01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:55.860]   Barack Obama and eelon musk and everybody were tweeting
[01:55:55.860 --> 01:56:01.300]   Hey, I really I really appreciate what you've done for me. So just send me some bitcoin. I'll send it back doubled. Okay
[01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:07.700]   Remember that and I mean it was horrific. It was obviously somebody had access to a
[01:56:07.700 --> 01:56:17.540]   Privileged account within twitter that let you tweet on anybody's behalf because the same tweet went out on dozens of high profile accounts
[01:56:17.540 --> 01:56:22.740]   So that immediately showed the twitter had a problem. They hired much to come in and fix it
[01:56:22.740 --> 01:56:27.540]   And then they fired much after eelon's offer
[01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:30.180]   In january, I think they got rid of much
[01:56:31.060 --> 01:56:33.060]   Uh, they didn't say why they fired him although later
[01:56:33.060 --> 01:56:38.580]   Puraag agro wall the current CEO of twitter said we fired him because he was no good
[01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:42.900]   I know he was a lazy slob and he said all sorts of mad things about him
[01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:47.140]   Uh now they're saying in the so so of course eelon musk
[01:56:47.140 --> 01:56:49.780]   Has subpoenaed much
[01:56:49.780 --> 01:56:51.780]   He says this is evidence
[01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:57.940]   That you know twitter cares not about the bots and and hear this whistle blower is telling us that
[01:56:58.980 --> 01:57:03.060]   Meanwhile twitter saying look much never told never flagged spam
[01:57:03.060 --> 01:57:07.780]   He never he never we hired him to fix the things that he's complaining about
[01:57:07.780 --> 01:57:13.700]   How could he complain about it? This is what he was brought into fix that ain't our fault
[01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:16.900]   and finally the latest is
[01:57:16.900 --> 01:57:23.140]   The payout the said apparently twitter paid much seven million dollars
[01:57:23.140 --> 01:57:27.380]   Now eelon says oh, oh you did did you?
[01:57:28.100 --> 01:57:29.060]   Oh
[01:57:29.060 --> 01:57:33.700]   Well then that means i'm out of the deal because that's what we call an ma e a material
[01:57:33.700 --> 01:57:36.500]   Adverse event
[01:57:36.500 --> 01:57:42.100]   And that lets me off the hook with eelon's been trying to he keeps trying to find a way to get out of this
[01:57:42.100 --> 01:57:44.260]   Clearly does not want to spend 44 billion
[01:57:44.260 --> 01:57:48.900]   Uh, and I think he's honestly I think at this point he's just grasping at any straw he can
[01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:52.580]   so, um
[01:57:52.580 --> 01:57:56.340]   Do you think you could sell him twit instead like I think you noticed the difference
[01:57:57.140 --> 01:58:02.740]   44 billion that's all would take eelon actually you know what good retirement leo i'll give him a deal
[01:58:02.740 --> 01:58:05.140]   43 your shorter
[01:58:05.140 --> 01:58:08.020]   Exactly. Well your name is shorter so yeah, yeah
[01:58:08.020 --> 01:58:10.500]   Fewer letters
[01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:13.540]   You can do anything you want you could chase the spammers out
[01:58:13.540 --> 01:58:17.940]   You can you know what you can bring donald trump in and give him a show whatever you want
[01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:20.340]   43 billion that's it
[01:58:20.340 --> 01:58:25.940]   You know we've got eelon's communications back into early may where he was already looking for a way out of the deal
[01:58:26.740 --> 01:58:28.740]   He had he said a letter to his
[01:58:28.740 --> 01:58:31.140]   Idiot he said a letter to his banker
[01:58:31.140 --> 01:58:36.100]   Yeah before the pouton speech back way back in what was that may
[01:58:36.100 --> 01:58:40.660]   Uh, he said maybe we should slow down this acquisition
[01:58:40.660 --> 01:58:46.420]   Uh in case we're heading to world war three. Oh, yeah, sure. That's what's yeah
[01:58:46.420 --> 01:58:49.140]   Yeah, you wouldn't want to buy twitter if we're headed to world war three
[01:58:51.860 --> 01:59:00.100]   He had immediate immediate buyers remorse and this predates all of his complaints about bots or spam or mudge
[01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:06.900]   So it's I mean anyone who's observing this objectively knows. Oh, this was a man who regretted what he did
[01:59:06.900 --> 01:59:12.100]   Who regretted that he had everybody sign the contracts for the deals squirm is looking for a way to get out
[01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:14.180]   He's squirming
[01:59:14.180 --> 01:59:17.220]   Which is that's his right he can do that but by the same token
[01:59:17.620 --> 01:59:21.620]   This is the conversation we had earlier about the the musk super fans
[01:59:21.620 --> 01:59:26.420]   They make it so difficult to have an intelligent civil conversation
[01:59:26.420 --> 01:59:30.740]   About his his responsibilities. I mean you signed a contract
[01:59:30.740 --> 01:59:34.100]   Without actually going and doing your due diligence
[01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:38.900]   You should not be rewarded for that people should not think that you are a smart businessman for doing that
[01:59:38.900 --> 01:59:41.220]   And yeah, you should have to pay the penalty for that
[01:59:41.220 --> 01:59:44.180]   So the the trial is next month
[01:59:45.540 --> 01:59:48.500]   Uh, we we've been covering it. I'm kind of less and less
[01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:53.700]   Motivated to talk about it. It's pretty clear at this point. What happened?
[01:59:53.700 --> 01:59:58.420]   Um, you learn I think do you think at any point he genuinely wanted to buy twitter
[01:59:58.420 --> 02:00:02.260]   Or was her five minutes. I yeah for five. It was very brief
[02:00:02.260 --> 02:00:07.380]   I I think when he was getting all the accolades about how he was gonna free twitter
[02:00:07.380 --> 02:00:10.420]   Yeah, he thought it was a great idea and then someone actually said hey
[02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:13.860]   You know, you liked way overpaid for that thing, right? Yeah
[02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:19.220]   And then he started actually doing the numbers and realizing I will never ever make this back
[02:00:19.220 --> 02:00:22.980]   Yeah, there's not a chance that twitter will ever make this in revenue
[02:00:22.980 --> 02:00:27.220]   All right
[02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:30.580]   Yep, this all seems to be of a piece elizabeth homes
[02:00:30.580 --> 02:00:35.380]   also squirming as you may remember she found guilty
[02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:39.700]   Of uh defrauding investors with the tharino's
[02:00:39.700 --> 02:00:42.740]   scam
[02:00:43.940 --> 02:00:48.100]   Now the first day asked the judge. Oh, just throw it out the judge said no
[02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:50.900]   No, I don't think so
[02:00:50.900 --> 02:00:52.900]   Uh, we're getting close to sentencing's coming up
[02:00:52.900 --> 02:00:55.060]   Now
[02:00:55.060 --> 02:01:00.580]   Now she says uh, there's newly discovered evidence that the former
[02:01:00.580 --> 02:01:02.980]   uh
[02:01:02.980 --> 02:01:04.500]   the former um
[02:01:04.500 --> 02:01:06.500]   lab director at tharino's
[02:01:06.500 --> 02:01:11.540]   Regrets his testimony he testified against her at the court adam rosen dorf
[02:01:12.020 --> 02:01:14.020]   Regrets regrets his testimony
[02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:20.020]   Um, he testified for several days in the in the trial. You may remember if you've been following this
[02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:26.980]   Emphasized the pressure tharino's employees were under to demonstrate the faulty technology actually worked even though it didn't
[02:01:26.980 --> 02:01:32.340]   On the witness stand he said I felt that it was a question on my integrity as a physician
[02:01:32.340 --> 02:01:36.580]   Not to remain there and to continue to bolster results. I essentially didn't have faith in
[02:01:36.580 --> 02:01:38.900]   etc, etc
[02:01:38.900 --> 02:01:41.460]   Now her attorneys are claiming that rosen dorf
[02:01:42.420 --> 02:01:43.460]   called
[02:01:43.460 --> 02:01:46.900]   Elizabeth Holmes on august 8th left a voicemail
[02:01:46.900 --> 02:01:52.980]   In a desperate bid say the lawyers to communicate he felt he had done something wrong
[02:01:52.980 --> 02:01:59.300]   Apparently in connection with miz homes trial. So they're saying you see you see judge
[02:01:59.300 --> 02:02:05.700]   He regretted it now you should too. They want a retrial under rule 33
[02:02:05.700 --> 02:02:08.260]   Um
[02:02:08.260 --> 02:02:10.980]   We'll see I think this is just more squirming
[02:02:10.980 --> 02:02:18.020]   I don't think any amount of regret or retrials is going to negate the fraud. No that occurred
[02:02:18.020 --> 02:02:24.900]   Exactly and the statements that this employee made don't touch on the fraud. He basically said he felt that they weren't
[02:02:24.900 --> 02:02:27.620]   Interested in solving the problems
[02:02:27.620 --> 02:02:32.340]   That's not the fraud the fraud is that they were selling a product they knew that did not work
[02:02:33.140 --> 02:02:41.300]   So his statements don't affect that at all they might affect the degree to which someone will would say that they were continuing and perpetuating the fraud
[02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:45.620]   But that's not what she was convicted on her boyfriend sunny bawani also convicted
[02:02:45.620 --> 02:02:49.860]   He's not squirming as hard apparently sentencing for Elizabeth Holmes
[02:02:49.860 --> 02:02:54.820]   Uh, which was scheduled for later this month. It was delayed till october 17th
[02:02:54.820 --> 02:02:59.940]   Uh because they want to see how it goes with elan and twitter. I guess I don't know october 17
[02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:03.860]   Same day as the elan trial begins
[02:03:03.860 --> 02:03:06.980]   Uh
[02:03:06.980 --> 02:03:10.660]   I mean she could get 20 years. I don't like doubt she will
[02:03:10.660 --> 02:03:18.260]   Well, I mean she defrauded a lot of very rich people. Yeah, and yeah, that's good point out of a lot of money
[02:03:18.260 --> 02:03:25.460]   Money exactly a lot of money. Yeah, very if you're gonna cheat people make sure that they're poor and they don't have any legal recourse
[02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:29.620]   Right. You don't cheat billion cheat poor. Don't get you only cheat poor. Yeah, yeah
[02:03:30.260 --> 02:03:31.780]   Uh
[02:03:31.780 --> 02:03:33.780]   So a lot of a lot of
[02:03:33.780 --> 02:03:37.220]   Cryptocurrency news
[02:03:37.220 --> 02:03:41.380]   I think a lot of cryptocurrency experts would very much like it
[02:03:41.380 --> 02:03:46.340]   If the sec would finally decide is this a security
[02:03:46.340 --> 02:03:49.380]   Uh, are there gonna be regulations?
[02:03:49.380 --> 02:03:52.980]   The latest is the treasury is about to recommend
[02:03:52.980 --> 02:03:56.500]   issuing a digital dollar
[02:03:57.620 --> 02:04:01.940]   But only if it's in the national interest. Well, that's good. You wouldn't want to do it if it's not
[02:04:01.940 --> 02:04:04.900]   Have you ever seen the youtube channel coffee zilla leo? No
[02:04:04.900 --> 02:04:09.300]   He's great. Oh, he breaks down. Yeah, he breaks down crypto
[02:04:09.300 --> 02:04:11.620]   schemes and
[02:04:11.620 --> 02:04:13.380]   suits and
[02:04:13.380 --> 02:04:14.420]   I just
[02:04:14.420 --> 02:04:18.580]   All the time it is it is incredibly entertaining to watch and maddening at the same time
[02:04:18.580 --> 02:04:22.340]   Mm-hmm. Uh, it's pretty non-stop, isn't it?
[02:04:22.340 --> 02:04:25.380]   Yes
[02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:31.780]   Mm. I mean, it's it's kind of the same thing as the whole sim card thing we're talking about all right like wouldn't it be nice if
[02:04:31.780 --> 02:04:34.180]   You just didn't have to deal with
[02:04:34.180 --> 02:04:40.820]   Physical money anymore, although we kind of already don't I feel like yeah, I'm not sure what a digital dollar means
[02:04:40.820 --> 02:04:43.140]   Um
[02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:48.100]   Are they would I think they mean blockchain secured ledger wise as opposed to right?
[02:04:48.100 --> 02:04:49.940]   Some sort of stable
[02:04:49.940 --> 02:04:57.540]   Coin yeah, like I mean, I mean today the fact that your money is in the bank is just a number and then their database versus yeah an actual
[02:04:57.540 --> 02:05:04.260]   No, so really they're saying decentralized ledger more than a digital. I think that's I think that's what they're mean by
[02:05:04.260 --> 02:05:07.460]   Like a digital dollar. Okay in that context. Yeah
[02:05:07.460 --> 02:05:10.660]   Um, yeah, that's and that's interesting
[02:05:10.660 --> 02:05:14.980]   It the but I mean that that doesn't really replace the cryptocurrency
[02:05:14.980 --> 02:05:17.780]   Function as a speculative financial tool
[02:05:18.340 --> 02:05:22.660]   That's that's the power of crypto. That's why people get so enamored because since it's not
[02:05:22.660 --> 02:05:27.780]   Really tied to traditional banking it can go as high or as low as people are willing to make it
[02:05:27.780 --> 02:05:34.740]   It is a digital junk bond. So issuing a digital dollar doesn't really fix that problem or that that
[02:05:34.740 --> 02:05:37.540]   Advantage if that's how you're looking at it
[02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:43.940]   So yeah, that's just it's just it's just a different form of a dollar in that kind of what you what are they trying to fix
[02:05:44.500 --> 02:05:47.940]   Like if they're trying to fix getting more like getting more money from us
[02:05:47.940 --> 02:05:52.580]   Then maybe there it's a solution that they really want because they've managed to do that over the last five that is amazingly well
[02:05:52.580 --> 02:05:54.660]   So this comes over this from my money
[02:05:54.660 --> 02:05:57.700]   This comes out of president biden's executive order last march
[02:05:57.700 --> 02:06:03.780]   That said give give me some crypto recommendations. They this went to multiple departments
[02:06:03.780 --> 02:06:09.620]   Uh, the treasury is this is the treasury's document is not out yet, but they expected to say
[02:06:09.620 --> 02:06:11.780]   uh
[02:06:11.780 --> 02:06:15.860]   Yeah, digital dollar would work if it's in the national interest
[02:06:15.860 --> 02:06:19.460]   It's like that's like that's that's a non recommendation
[02:06:19.460 --> 02:06:28.180]   This fixes one specific thing that people wanted to use crypto for and that was the ability to transfer amount around finances file
[02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:35.940]   Resources very quickly and without regulation the digital dollar gives them the ability to do that without having to use a super speculative tool
[02:06:36.340 --> 02:06:41.620]   Where I might buy x amount of bitcoin and by the time i've transferred it it has risen or dropped 20
[02:06:41.620 --> 02:06:46.820]   Percent in value a digital dollar because it is backed by the fed is more like a stablecoin
[02:06:46.820 --> 02:06:53.620]   So it it's going to maintain its value. It's pegged to the dollar. So it's just a non physical dollar
[02:06:53.620 --> 02:07:01.540]   Which means you can count on all the traditional banking systems being able to calculate exactly how much it's going to cost to move it from point a to point b
[02:07:01.540 --> 02:07:03.460]   but again
[02:07:03.460 --> 02:07:05.700]   that does not
[02:07:05.700 --> 02:07:07.460]   fulfill any of the
[02:07:07.460 --> 02:07:08.820]   financial
[02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:10.340]   speculative tool
[02:07:10.340 --> 02:07:14.420]   Features of cryptocurrency and wouldn't it be regulated at that point as well?
[02:07:14.420 --> 02:07:21.540]   Absolutely, and it should be I think it should be regulated as a security. I mean there have been there have been attempts
[02:07:21.540 --> 02:07:25.220]   Uh to do a dollar tied crypto
[02:07:25.220 --> 02:07:29.460]   For that same, you know first part of what pager i was just saying there right like
[02:07:29.460 --> 02:07:31.860]   Somebody wants a thing that's not going to
[02:07:32.260 --> 02:07:38.980]   Drestically rise or fall, you know within the next five minutes before you go and actually use that that currency for something
[02:07:38.980 --> 02:07:42.020]   You wanted to do, you know that would have been akin to using
[02:07:42.020 --> 02:07:47.300]   A us dollar for it right? I mean there is literally I think all tether like you as a dt is the
[02:07:47.300 --> 02:07:52.500]   Yep, correct. You know is the code for it right and the intent there was for it to be a dollar tied thing
[02:07:52.500 --> 02:07:55.860]   But then there's this constant you just borajed with well
[02:07:55.860 --> 02:07:59.780]   We don't it's not actually tied to the dollar and there's all this sort of
[02:08:00.660 --> 02:08:05.220]   Banana we're going on yeah. Yeah, it becomes speculative even when it wasn't
[02:08:05.220 --> 02:08:11.300]   Supposed to be speculative so I stable yeah, right so so it might it might actually be handy
[02:08:11.300 --> 02:08:15.940]   If you had you know the government behind the dollar said okay fine
[02:08:15.940 --> 02:08:21.060]   What's what's the spell with all that speculation piece of if somebody wants a cryptocurrency?
[02:08:21.060 --> 02:08:27.860]   That is actually tied to the dollar the us government would be the people to do that right because the idea really is we can
[02:08:28.180 --> 02:08:33.060]   Yeah, we could do this and maybe their hope is and that would get rid of all the others maybe like
[02:08:33.060 --> 02:08:36.260]   I don't know it would get rid of the stable coins
[02:08:36.260 --> 02:08:41.300]   So so the stable coins which the other cryptos used that peg themselves to the dollar
[02:08:41.300 --> 02:08:47.220]   Would become redundant if the us was actually creating a digital currency. Yeah, correct. Yes, it would be the dollar
[02:08:47.220 --> 02:08:52.260]   Yeah, and uh government banks all over the world have been looking at the idea of issuing
[02:08:52.260 --> 02:08:57.700]   Digital coins stable coins. They always would be tied some sort of stable currency
[02:08:57.860 --> 02:09:03.620]   Yeah, I mean it does make sense right. I mean in in the context of you know if I've nastful recommendations and that was one of them
[02:09:03.620 --> 02:09:06.660]   I mean I can see so but for a normal person like me
[02:09:06.660 --> 02:09:09.940]   Does this change anything? I mean
[02:09:09.940 --> 02:09:13.540]   There'd be there'd be a few less
[02:09:13.540 --> 02:09:20.420]   Things that you thought would have been a stable coin that you might have but I don't think about I spend zero time
[02:09:20.420 --> 02:09:23.220]   Right thinking about stable going yeah
[02:09:23.220 --> 02:09:25.700]   Right
[02:09:27.140 --> 02:09:29.140]   Petaluma boulevard down main street
[02:09:29.140 --> 02:09:32.580]   Uh, would I be jingling some?
[02:09:32.580 --> 02:09:40.180]   Digital coin in my pocket. No because it's digital digital wallet. I pay for everything with my watch and phone. I haven't it's just a dollar
[02:09:40.180 --> 02:09:45.860]   It's just a dollar. That's already your digital dollar. It's already digital. Isn't it? That's what that's what's confusing to me
[02:09:45.860 --> 02:09:51.860]   Yeah, it's just there would be a distributed ledger. Is that the idea watch coffee zilla leo? You'll really enjoy it
[02:09:53.380 --> 02:09:57.460]   By the way, if you search if you search on google for ethereum merge
[02:09:57.460 --> 02:10:01.460]   Oh, yeah, that's a thing google has now put a countdown up
[02:10:01.460 --> 02:10:04.420]   Three days two hours 37 minutes
[02:10:04.420 --> 02:10:06.260]   Yep
[02:10:06.260 --> 02:10:14.420]   We're counting down to the ethereum merge. This is ethereum attempting to move from proof of work to proof of stake a much
[02:10:14.420 --> 02:10:16.500]   lower
[02:10:16.500 --> 02:10:18.980]   use of energy to do its
[02:10:18.980 --> 02:10:21.220]   calculations
[02:10:21.220 --> 02:10:28.260]   Oh and by much lower like i'm not sure if 99 or since it's yeah, it's like a ridiculous fraction
[02:10:28.260 --> 02:10:33.540]   Yeah of yeah as far as I could tell i'm no expert on this. It's the way a proof of
[02:10:33.540 --> 02:10:35.780]   work is
[02:10:35.780 --> 02:10:42.820]   operates now is is it all the miners get to get a chance to try to solve this problem the first one who who does
[02:10:42.820 --> 02:10:48.260]   Gets the fee for the towards action gets the reward. So that's why mine is what's going on
[02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:53.860]   That's why miners mine miners all those other calculations are wasted energy. Yeah, that's the problem miners
[02:10:53.860 --> 02:10:56.900]   You know, I think sometimes we think miners are mining for coin
[02:10:56.900 --> 02:10:59.860]   They're not mining to create new coin. I mean some might be
[02:10:59.860 --> 02:11:03.700]   Mostly miners when I guess maybe they're doing that too
[02:11:03.700 --> 02:11:06.180]   But mostly what they're trying to do is is is
[02:11:06.180 --> 02:11:14.020]   Is put transactions into the into the ledger into the blockchain and and the winning miner gets to do that and make some money
[02:11:14.020 --> 02:11:18.180]   So that's what the whole mining thing is yeah, but all the other calculations wasted
[02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:21.220]   So proof of stake roughly works the same way except
[02:11:21.220 --> 02:11:24.500]   Instead of saying here's the problem. Anybody work on it
[02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:29.460]   They choose one person to work on it that person and they have some sort of lottery system
[02:11:29.460 --> 02:11:33.380]   I guess to choose it that person solves the problem makes the money
[02:11:33.380 --> 02:11:39.940]   It considerably reduces the energy distributed among the stakeholders versus among the workers
[02:11:39.940 --> 02:11:45.940]   Perfect just to put it simply right does it solve any of the other problems of cryptocurrency
[02:11:47.140 --> 02:11:54.260]   It actually adds a problem. Yeah, because proof of stake is actually easier to
[02:11:54.260 --> 02:11:56.740]   fake
[02:11:56.740 --> 02:11:58.740]   than proof of work
[02:11:58.740 --> 02:12:05.620]   Uh, so there was already an attack on a very uh, I can't remember what was the name of the the the the crypto that that blockchains are already gone
[02:12:05.620 --> 02:12:06.900]   um
[02:12:06.900 --> 02:12:08.900]   Someone borrowed
[02:12:08.900 --> 02:12:12.100]   Enough of the cryptocurrency to have 50
[02:12:12.740 --> 02:12:19.060]   51 percent attack. Yeah, right and and then they basically rewrote the ledger to say well, it's all coming to me
[02:12:19.060 --> 02:12:21.060]   All mine now, baby. Yeah, right
[02:12:21.060 --> 02:12:28.660]   So that's I mean that's that that only happened because that particular cryptocurrency was super young and there wasn't there wasn't that much stake
[02:12:28.660 --> 02:12:32.580]   Uh, and you're not going to see that in high volume cryptocurrencies
[02:12:32.580 --> 02:12:38.180]   But that is a possibility that if if you're not looking for people who are trying to abuse the system
[02:12:38.180 --> 02:12:41.940]   It is significantly easier to get that 50 plus one
[02:12:42.740 --> 02:12:44.740]   Does it slow down
[02:12:44.740 --> 02:12:47.700]   the transactions
[02:12:47.700 --> 02:12:52.100]   You only have one miner working on at a time no no because the the difficulty
[02:12:52.100 --> 02:13:00.660]   Goes to basically zero. Ah like the yeah, so if yeah, so that's one thing it would help because the speed of transactions has really gone up
[02:13:00.660 --> 02:13:06.740]   Oh, yeah, you could you could literally compute the next block on the chain for for either on a smartphone. Okay. Oh good
[02:13:07.380 --> 02:13:13.060]   So proof of stake speeds up transactions does it reduce gas fees because that's the other problem
[02:13:13.060 --> 02:13:19.700]   Uh the cost of of putting these transactions in the ledger can be so wise to as to make it
[02:13:19.700 --> 02:13:24.100]   pointless the gas the gas fees are based on throttling like
[02:13:24.100 --> 02:13:26.900]   Because there can only be so much in a block
[02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:32.420]   Right and so you're trying to if the if they're you're trying to add too much data to the chain
[02:13:33.300 --> 02:13:38.020]   Per unit time right because each block is basically roughly a per unit time
[02:13:38.020 --> 02:13:40.980]   Right the ether blockchain tries to run at a constant
[02:13:40.980 --> 02:13:46.740]   You know a fixed right right and it tries to regulate itself right now it regulates itself by adjusting the difficulty
[02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:51.140]   Right in the future. It doesn't need to do that. It just does it by other means but for now
[02:13:51.140 --> 02:13:54.020]   It's just well just make it harder or easier to figure out the next block
[02:13:54.020 --> 02:13:57.300]   Right the next answer the next solution to the next block right
[02:13:57.300 --> 02:13:58.740]   um
[02:13:58.740 --> 02:14:02.100]   But the gas fees would still have to exist for the sake of regulating
[02:14:02.980 --> 02:14:08.580]   Just the data rate on the chain right um so it doesn't it's still gonna be a thing
[02:14:08.580 --> 02:14:10.660]   it doesn't it doesn't change the
[02:14:10.660 --> 02:14:13.380]   Problem right and gas fees. There's a theoretical limit
[02:14:13.380 --> 02:14:21.060]   Yeah, uh gas fees get burned and there's gonna be fewer block rewards now since there's not going to be mining
[02:14:21.060 --> 02:14:28.420]   Right, which actually means that the you know the amount of ether that exists is going to decrease over time
[02:14:28.420 --> 02:14:31.060]   eventually
[02:14:31.060 --> 02:14:36.660]   Oh interesting. Okay. Yeah, there will be fewer. So instead of making more is that inflationary?
[02:14:36.660 --> 02:14:38.740]   Does that not make it inflationary?
[02:14:38.740 --> 02:14:43.860]   I mean, I don't know to what degree it depends on how much gas fees get piled up and everything else right that you know
[02:14:43.860 --> 02:14:46.660]   Works as a thing to to make either uh be
[02:14:46.660 --> 02:14:49.220]   Go away right go into the ether
[02:14:49.220 --> 02:14:53.700]   So this is this is this is this is on the most i was mostly like a good idea
[02:14:53.700 --> 02:14:59.540]   Uh, but there are things that could go wrong and there are plenty of people who make money as bitcoin miners
[02:14:59.700 --> 02:15:01.700]   who think this is a terrible idea
[02:15:01.700 --> 02:15:06.020]   And they have I mean you're gonna they're gonna have those people that have yeah
[02:15:06.020 --> 02:15:11.140]   There's gonna be people that have invested insane amounts of money into hardware and they want to keep you know using that investment
[02:15:11.140 --> 02:15:13.380]   It's good for those of us who are trying to buy gpu's
[02:15:13.380 --> 02:15:15.700]   but uh
[02:15:15.700 --> 02:15:17.700]   But so so they're ether
[02:15:17.700 --> 02:15:19.700]   Eth will almost certainly fork
[02:15:19.700 --> 02:15:20.660]   um
[02:15:20.660 --> 02:15:22.500]   They have been you know just like nasa
[02:15:22.500 --> 02:15:28.020]   Uh tests before they launch a rocket they've been doing tests of the merge
[02:15:28.580 --> 02:15:34.900]   The 13th and final shadow fork executed today. I don't know what i'm saying with no apparent issues actually
[02:15:34.900 --> 02:15:37.220]   That was september 9th
[02:15:37.220 --> 02:15:39.220]   So the the forks
[02:15:39.220 --> 02:15:44.180]   The forks have worked so there is but I mean there's it could be a disaster, but it looks like
[02:15:44.180 --> 02:15:47.300]   All all signs point to a positive
[02:15:47.300 --> 02:15:52.740]   Change the merge saying it's like the good place and we're all forked
[02:15:52.740 --> 02:15:55.620]   Or all forked we may be forked
[02:15:55.620 --> 02:15:57.620]   uh
[02:15:57.620 --> 02:16:02.980]   The ethereum mainnet's 13th shadow fork went live earlier on the ninth without a hitch
[02:16:02.980 --> 02:16:10.180]   So it looks like everything's gonna be good. It'll be fine. It'll be fine
[02:16:10.180 --> 02:16:12.580]   Possibly go wrong
[02:16:12.580 --> 02:16:16.500]   All right. Meanwhile the value of ether
[02:16:16.500 --> 02:16:18.500]   Eth has been going up
[02:16:18.500 --> 02:16:24.420]   Over the last a few weeks. I think people see this is a puzzle wrong because pudry won't let me see the books that tell us
[02:16:24.420 --> 02:16:26.900]   Right now
[02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:28.900]   It's been it's been four archives
[02:16:28.900 --> 02:16:34.740]   Yeah, we've we've got all the predictions. We know exactly what's gonna happen and low they fork the eth
[02:16:34.740 --> 02:16:40.900]   Yes. All right next week. We are going to get some uh financial experts on
[02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:47.460]   Uh to talk about uh the merge and what happened. I feel like we're gonna tell us how bad we are
[02:16:47.460 --> 02:16:50.660]   Disgusting how bad we did. I'm sure
[02:16:50.660 --> 02:16:53.220]   Yeah
[02:16:53.700 --> 02:16:59.860]   This is like the ela must conversation if you don't show enough uh loyalty to crypto currency
[02:16:59.860 --> 02:17:02.660]   You certainly are going to be an outcast
[02:17:02.660 --> 02:17:06.180]   But all right leo, what do you want to know about this octane stuff?
[02:17:06.180 --> 02:17:08.660]   Optane
[02:17:08.660 --> 02:17:13.700]   Let's get it over with so intel. I remember boy. I was excited when intel announced
[02:17:13.700 --> 02:17:19.140]   Uh, what would they call it not crossfit cross cross point cross point?
[02:17:19.140 --> 02:17:20.740]   Uh
[02:17:20.740 --> 02:17:22.100]   Crossfit crossfit
[02:17:22.100 --> 02:17:27.060]   The newest ram cross point which was a 3d
[02:17:27.060 --> 02:17:36.500]   Uh technology for making memory and everybody I mean, I mean we're doing that now on nand anyway anyway, okay
[02:17:36.500 --> 02:17:40.980]   Right. I mean there's literally hundreds of layers in nand now so nand is very much 3d
[02:17:40.980 --> 02:17:42.420]   Oh
[02:17:42.420 --> 02:17:46.740]   So I was all excited. I mean when do when did they announce this five five or six years ago?
[02:17:46.740 --> 02:17:49.380]   and uh 2015
[02:17:49.380 --> 02:17:51.780]   Uh, and they branded it octane
[02:17:52.740 --> 02:18:01.540]   And the promise of it was what faster cheaper. What were they what was the hope for for 3d cross so cheaper than ram
[02:18:01.540 --> 02:18:08.340]   Right. That was the idea cheaper there. Basically it sat in between ram and solid state
[02:18:08.340 --> 02:18:15.300]   Rec traditional solid state storage and that's how intel has been selling octane, which is is it ram? Is it solid state? Yes
[02:18:15.300 --> 02:18:21.620]   Yeah, they've been selling while they were selling both types of devices. Yes, there was there was uh, there was a dim
[02:18:21.700 --> 02:18:28.820]   Form factor that was sort of sit alongside the ram in a server and you can make a very large memory pool where the the d ram is actually like a
[02:18:28.820 --> 02:18:34.020]   Caching layer on top of the octane dims which were you know, sort of the
[02:18:34.020 --> 02:18:41.540]   Memory pool if you would right but slower than what d ram was obviously because there's you know, there's always a catch right?
[02:18:41.540 --> 02:18:43.300]   You can't get something for nothing
[02:18:43.300 --> 02:18:49.620]   Uh, so that was one you know one solution and then the other solution was you take the same chips or basically the same chips
[02:18:49.700 --> 02:18:52.020]   And you stick them behind a SSD controller
[02:18:52.020 --> 02:18:57.140]   Uh and connect it to PCI even now you drive now you have a regular drive, right?
[02:18:57.140 --> 02:18:59.540]   So they were covering you know both
[02:18:59.540 --> 02:19:04.180]   both types of uh forms there, right? Um, but
[02:19:04.180 --> 02:19:06.900]   There was just
[02:19:06.900 --> 02:19:13.460]   Someday there's going to be like a harvard business school study or some kind of like somebody's yet some points going to have to put something together
[02:19:13.460 --> 02:19:15.540]   That's just sort of covers
[02:19:15.540 --> 02:19:19.620]   Here's all of the things that were against it. This is my question. Is it a
[02:19:19.620 --> 02:19:24.020]   Market problem or a technology problem that killed octane?
[02:19:24.020 --> 02:19:30.740]   It was kind of a little bit of everything. Oh in my opinion at least right you had you had just sort of the fundamentals, right?
[02:19:30.740 --> 02:19:33.860]   You had this thing that was so much faster
[02:19:33.860 --> 02:19:42.900]   Than what was there traditionally as far as the s's fast as regular s's d's. It's like doubling the speed
[02:19:43.460 --> 02:19:49.700]   Oh way faster than double even more. Um, oh yeah, the latency when when when the octane devices came out
[02:19:49.700 --> 02:19:56.260]   The latency was roughly like the read latency was like one tenth of a regular s's d. Wow, right? But
[02:19:56.260 --> 02:19:59.140]   You know
[02:19:59.140 --> 02:20:02.260]   Speaking as far as like, well, how does that impact the whole system?
[02:20:02.260 --> 02:20:07.380]   Right if you make a thing that just goes 10 times as fast suddenly the bottleneck shifts anywhere else
[02:20:08.180 --> 02:20:12.420]   I owe bottleneck. Yeah, well, it's it's everything other than the I owe, right?
[02:20:12.420 --> 02:20:15.620]   Like it's you know, if you if you can make the I owe one tenth the
[02:20:15.620 --> 02:20:22.420]   The speed or one tenth of time to complete then all of a sudden if there was any other bottleneck or any other inefficiency
[02:20:22.420 --> 02:20:28.340]   With the be it with the kernel, you know the software the application
[02:20:28.340 --> 02:20:31.700]   Trying to access the thing right sort of it sort of
[02:20:32.660 --> 02:20:38.660]   Shifted the burden everywhere else all of the sudden and it was a matter of well, how fast can you possibly make?
[02:20:38.660 --> 02:20:46.340]   And s's d like a pcie s's d that plugs into the system and there is sort of like a glass ceiling there where like it's like, well
[02:20:46.340 --> 02:20:52.100]   You know the controller can only go so fast just to negotiate to communicate on the pc I bus
[02:20:52.100 --> 02:21:00.260]   Takes a few microseconds, right? So if you have a thing that could that that can operate in 10 or fewer microseconds
[02:21:01.220 --> 02:21:05.140]   And the pcie just speaking pcie express
[02:21:05.140 --> 02:21:08.980]   Consumes say I don't know a third or half of that
[02:21:08.980 --> 02:21:14.660]   Right like you know what was previously a very small fraction of a regular
[02:21:14.660 --> 02:21:20.340]   Traditional s's d response time was now very significant right?
[02:21:20.340 --> 02:21:26.260]   Um, and so when you combined all that stuff together just you know, that's just that's just only speaking to the point of
[02:21:26.260 --> 02:21:30.020]   How much faster can you know was the user experience?
[02:21:30.740 --> 02:21:34.420]   For it in the s's d form factor right so it took
[02:21:34.420 --> 02:21:42.100]   Literally years for everything else to sort of progress and for other other pieces of the puzzle there to to become faster
[02:21:42.100 --> 02:21:48.100]   Around those devices in order for the system to shine more and more, you know because of those devices
[02:21:48.100 --> 02:21:51.460]   Right, so it was just a head of its time. Why not keep it around?
[02:21:51.460 --> 02:21:54.580]   Till there was there was an there was so much more
[02:21:55.140 --> 02:22:00.740]   There was so much more just working against it really the whole time right and and there was also
[02:22:00.740 --> 02:22:03.460]   It was the price was high
[02:22:03.460 --> 02:22:07.700]   Right, uh, you know to did it did it. Yeah, but if it's two and a half times faster
[02:22:07.700 --> 02:22:10.420]   I don't care if it's twice as expensive
[02:22:10.420 --> 02:22:15.300]   Right, right and and granted there were still people you know right near the end
[02:22:15.300 --> 02:22:19.700]   There was the last the last s's d that intel made that had obtained in it
[02:22:19.700 --> 02:22:25.380]   The right traditional s's d wise was a p5800x. This is just a fire breathing
[02:22:25.380 --> 02:22:28.500]   s'sd right the thing was just super fast
[02:22:28.500 --> 02:22:29.860]   um
[02:22:29.860 --> 02:22:34.980]   For the first time they had shifted to a like previously the controllers were even a bottleneck
[02:22:34.980 --> 02:22:38.820]   Because in order to take most advantage of the low latencies
[02:22:38.820 --> 02:22:43.460]   They sort of had to kneecap themselves on what was the highest throughput you could get from the device
[02:22:43.460 --> 02:22:48.180]   Right, so the earlier obtained devices couldn't even saturate gen three pci express
[02:22:48.660 --> 02:22:53.220]   Right, you have a bus that should go nearly four gig per second, but the devices were only going two
[02:22:53.220 --> 02:22:56.580]   Right, so if you and actually leo, I think you had like a 900 p
[02:22:56.580 --> 02:23:01.860]   At one point. Yeah, right that drive would only do 2.2 or 2.4 gig per second
[02:23:01.860 --> 02:23:06.660]   Basically, it was bottlenecked by its own controller. Wow throughput wise, right?
[02:23:06.660 --> 02:23:09.460]   The latencies were amazing but pure throughput
[02:23:09.460 --> 02:23:14.580]   You know there was sort of this ceiling there and so that p5800x when it came out
[02:23:15.140 --> 02:23:19.540]   Was amazing because they finally did a controller where it could just go full speed of the bus
[02:23:19.540 --> 02:23:24.260]   It just didn't care there was no longer an Achilles heel as far as oh, it's it's fast here
[02:23:24.260 --> 02:23:29.540]   But it's not fast here like that thing just annihilated everything however. It was expensive
[02:23:29.540 --> 02:23:32.740]   um, yeah, but boy, it seems like that's
[02:23:32.740 --> 02:23:36.660]   It feels like they killed something before it really had a chance to
[02:23:36.660 --> 02:23:43.220]   Live up to its potential. I guess but like you're talking what seven eight years
[02:23:43.940 --> 02:23:49.380]   Yeah, so like so will we eventually have memory that's as fast as this?
[02:23:49.380 --> 02:23:53.380]   Kind of I mean, I don't think
[02:23:53.380 --> 02:23:57.220]   I don't know how long it will take for somebody else to do a
[02:23:57.220 --> 02:24:03.380]   Crosspoint style media, right? So as far as you know, will we see another media
[02:24:03.380 --> 02:24:09.140]   Come out that this fast that was as fast as uh, obtain media wise. I don't know
[02:24:09.140 --> 02:24:11.460]   Uh, might take a few years if it does
[02:24:11.940 --> 02:24:16.500]   Who knows there but there are some there are some aspects of the storage community
[02:24:16.500 --> 02:24:19.060]   and industry that
[02:24:19.060 --> 02:24:21.380]   The the mere presence of
[02:24:21.380 --> 02:24:26.980]   Obtain as a technology helps to drive and one of the big ones is cxl right computer express link
[02:24:26.980 --> 02:24:30.660]   Which was sort of the industry trying to solve
[02:24:30.660 --> 02:24:34.660]   You know the issue of hey if you have really fast media
[02:24:34.660 --> 02:24:39.700]   That sits at a different tier from d ram. How do you connect it to the system?
[02:24:39.700 --> 02:24:44.980]   How do you integrate it with the operating system? How do you take advantage of it in a more, you know appropriate way?
[02:24:44.980 --> 02:24:51.380]   Um, the funny thing about this is if cxl just appeared out of nowhere say seven years ago
[02:24:51.380 --> 02:24:54.580]   Intel would probably would probably have not announced
[02:24:54.580 --> 02:24:57.860]   You know stopping crosspoint right it probably
[02:24:57.860 --> 02:25:00.820]   Probably would have been profitable because there was just this easy
[02:25:00.820 --> 02:25:04.100]   Here's this better way to connect it to the system and take full advantage of it, right?
[02:25:04.100 --> 02:25:06.500]   But that wasn't there is this big chicken and the egg
[02:25:06.500 --> 02:25:08.660]   Uh, dilemma
[02:25:08.660 --> 02:25:10.660]   What about something like um
[02:25:10.660 --> 02:25:15.380]   Apples doing with the or or the xbox with unified memory. Um
[02:25:15.380 --> 02:25:18.740]   Then you don't have to worry about the bus so much right?
[02:25:18.740 --> 02:25:22.500]   What if we don't worry about
[02:25:22.500 --> 02:25:29.700]   Yes, but you still have to worry about the the the performance capabilities of the different tiers in other words
[02:25:29.700 --> 02:25:34.980]   Like how are you attaching right even if you have a different a different sort of art texture kind of a bus
[02:25:34.980 --> 02:25:39.780]   It's an internal to the die. Yeah, there's still there's still a physical thing to be solved. Yeah, right?
[02:25:39.780 --> 02:25:42.420]   Um, I feel bad
[02:25:42.420 --> 02:25:49.540]   I guess the question everybody or certainly I had was is this a failure on intel to capitalize on what was a good technology?
[02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:57.380]   Or was this not such a great technology or it sounds like it was a good technology. It was it was maybe too good
[02:25:57.380 --> 02:26:01.300]   It the technology the technology was great. It died too young
[02:26:01.860 --> 02:26:06.980]   Too good. It was expensive. It was expensive to make. Yeah, I would imagine I didn't even know the actual numbers
[02:26:06.980 --> 02:26:09.380]   I never so that's part of the problem about that
[02:26:09.380 --> 02:26:12.020]   But it could not have been cheap to make it right?
[02:26:12.020 --> 02:26:18.580]   I mean, I so before I even started working for intel. I wrote the article of pc perspective of how I did all the the deep dive on
[02:26:18.580 --> 02:26:22.500]   Uh, you know, isscc filings and things from years prior where
[02:26:22.500 --> 02:26:26.820]   Basically, I figured out that hey, this stuff is actually just phase change memory
[02:26:27.700 --> 02:26:33.300]   Right, even though intel when it first launched would soar up and down that it wasn't they didn't want to say it was for
[02:26:33.300 --> 02:26:35.460]   I still don't know what the reason was
[02:26:35.460 --> 02:26:38.340]   But you know the technology
[02:26:38.340 --> 02:26:48.020]   itself was amazing and I would even say like, you know, I mean phase change memory for for decades was like the flying car of pc storage
[02:26:48.020 --> 02:26:56.660]   Yeah, right. Remember that like it was always, you know, I mean, I'm sure I'm sure leo you mentioned the term phase change memory on several of the
[02:26:56.980 --> 02:27:01.780]   first round of screen savers. Yeah, along with a thing fusion, you know energy and
[02:27:01.780 --> 02:27:05.220]   Sure. Yeah and flying cars
[02:27:05.220 --> 02:27:08.980]   Computing yeah and flying cars. Yeah, right exactly and so
[02:27:08.980 --> 02:27:12.660]   Yeah, um, so I mean it actually came to be
[02:27:12.660 --> 02:27:18.260]   It probably wasn't cheap to make because again, you're trying to I mean you're literally making a thing
[02:27:18.260 --> 02:27:22.340]   That can make a little tiny, you know microscopic pull
[02:27:22.340 --> 02:27:25.140]   of metal alloy
[02:27:25.380 --> 02:27:26.900]   molten
[02:27:26.900 --> 02:27:32.980]   And resolitify that's why isn't it? Yeah, right? That's just why even to think about it now. Yeah, that's ridiculous
[02:27:32.980 --> 02:27:35.780]   That it's happening inside of a chip to store a bit, right?
[02:27:35.780 --> 02:27:40.180]   Right, right? I mean it's you know, it's crazy enough to think that you're quantum tunneling electrons into a nan cell
[02:27:40.180 --> 02:27:48.100]   To store bits but actually melting like 600 degrees Celsius metal. It's kind of magic what's going on in there anyway, isn't it?
[02:27:48.100 --> 02:27:50.740]   I mean you just said sure yeah tunneling. I mean my god
[02:27:51.380 --> 02:27:54.500]   It's yeah, so you know the technology was great
[02:27:54.500 --> 02:27:57.700]   It's just that there were there was an awful lot of stuff working against it
[02:27:57.700 --> 02:28:01.940]   You know there were always speeds like that with other technologies again or
[02:28:01.940 --> 02:28:08.340]   I mean, I hope so as an enthusiast. I want things to go faster. Yeah, right? Um, however
[02:28:08.340 --> 02:28:10.740]   Uh, so like the obtained
[02:28:10.740 --> 02:28:18.340]   uh, PCI SSD latencies were roughly in the 10 ish microsecond, you know per transaction
[02:28:19.060 --> 02:28:24.420]   Time frame, right and when it came out ssd's were running at about a hundred ninety to a hundred my amazing
[02:28:24.420 --> 02:28:32.660]   Yeah, right but now modern day ssd's are actually getting down to like the 50s and the 40s microseconds for much lower cost
[02:28:32.660 --> 02:28:37.300]   Yeah for a much lower cost, right and you're and you're getting to the point where
[02:28:37.300 --> 02:28:44.260]   Uh, you know, obtain was well into the diminishing returns, right? It's like when if you got to 40 or 50
[02:28:44.820 --> 02:28:50.020]   If you go all the way down to 10 you're really splitting hairs on actually seeing much more of a benefit
[02:28:50.020 --> 02:28:51.940]   Right in that system, right?
[02:28:51.940 --> 02:28:52.980]   So
[02:28:52.980 --> 02:28:58.100]   You know, it's kind of like the nand things are are getting to the point where it's it's close enough
[02:28:58.100 --> 02:29:03.780]   Right and intel hasn't enough. They're saying now pakasas. You're saying we're not giving up on obtain
[02:29:03.780 --> 02:29:07.460]   Right we're doing s there's still I mean
[02:29:07.460 --> 02:29:12.260]   No, his his phrasing was there winding down the op winding it down. Yeah
[02:29:12.820 --> 02:29:16.900]   Yeah, and my doesn't mean that's away from it last year. Oh, yeah, my crown walked away from it
[02:29:16.900 --> 02:29:21.140]   They switched up. Well, that's part of the problem. My crown was the co-developer of this if my crown doesn't make them
[02:29:21.140 --> 02:29:24.100]   What is intel gonna do right?
[02:29:24.100 --> 02:29:28.420]   Right, but you still have my connection. We're just instead. We're gonna do CXL instead
[02:29:28.420 --> 02:29:32.020]   Right intel still has another like the next server
[02:29:32.020 --> 02:29:37.140]   Cp to launch which is supposed to have support for the next generation of their dem form factor
[02:29:37.380 --> 02:29:42.980]   Optane, I don't know if they're are they gonna like yank the feature out from under the next is he on to come out
[02:29:42.980 --> 02:29:50.660]   I would guess probably not since like I think all the work would have been done. Yeah, again. I didn't work in that maybe get it while you can
[02:29:50.660 --> 02:29:55.540]   Sounds like I mean, well, no, I mean, it's it's like it's gonna be the lectures issue. Yeah
[02:29:55.540 --> 02:30:02.260]   Well, maybe maybe there are I know there are people who are willing to spend for that kind of speed like
[02:30:02.260 --> 02:30:06.260]   Speed is right more than the gold
[02:30:06.980 --> 02:30:13.380]   It's just the question was were there enough people willing to spend that right right to justify
[02:30:13.380 --> 02:30:15.620]   Intel continuing to try to make it right
[02:30:15.620 --> 02:30:20.820]   So thank you. I've been wanting to ask this for some time and I pretty I don't trust me
[02:30:20.820 --> 02:30:26.260]   It it pains me that that's the way it went right because I mean as just as a pure enthusiast
[02:30:26.260 --> 02:30:33.140]   I mean heck the whole thing that got me into the industry so as a tech journalist was that I just wanted the newest fastest
[02:30:33.780 --> 02:30:38.740]   Storage thing right um, you know, I mean if you got I if you got the things to go back
[02:30:38.740 --> 02:30:43.460]   You got obtained there's no reason, you know, uh, good good san in our chairman says my desktop
[02:30:43.460 --> 02:30:46.100]   Has a 16 gig obtained memory?
[02:30:46.100 --> 02:30:48.500]   Be happy right there's nothing to
[02:30:48.500 --> 02:30:54.420]   That too. Yeah, is like a cashing tier. Yeah, it was great for that too. Yeah. Yeah, it was great for all sorts of things
[02:30:54.420 --> 02:30:56.900]   It's just that it's just that there wasn't enough
[02:30:56.900 --> 02:31:03.460]   Volume at that at that bleeding edge right even even the cashing argument is a hard one to make because
[02:31:03.460 --> 02:31:07.300]   Most people are fine just with one regular SSD and their system and they just they're like well
[02:31:07.300 --> 02:31:13.700]   Why do I need to have this other extra complication? Isn't that funny right? They've got computers. I've gotten so fast
[02:31:13.700 --> 02:31:20.500]   We don't maybe we don't really need to get them that much faster. That's wild. What a wild harder tasks. Yeah
[02:31:20.500 --> 02:31:22.260]   Yeah, I mean, yes
[02:31:22.260 --> 02:31:24.340]   There is still a subset of tasks that even
[02:31:24.340 --> 02:31:28.100]   Years from now and obtain SSD will probably do better
[02:31:28.340 --> 02:31:34.660]   And the biggest one that comes to mind is if you have a bunch of heavy writing going on while you're trying to do
[02:31:34.660 --> 02:31:38.180]   Like the system be responsive in reading at the same time
[02:31:38.180 --> 02:31:41.700]   Something like actually a network operations center might need
[02:31:41.700 --> 02:31:45.140]   For instance, uh like trans
[02:31:45.140 --> 02:31:49.940]   Yeah, maybe even power users like your olympics user you're doing a curl compile and a few other things in the background
[02:31:49.940 --> 02:31:53.860]   And you want your foreground things to also be speedy. Yeah, right of course
[02:31:54.340 --> 02:31:58.100]   But again, it really isn't to the bleeding edge power user territory there
[02:31:58.100 --> 02:32:01.940]   Right, you really got to be pushing the system pretty hard to see those advantages
[02:32:01.940 --> 02:32:07.700]   Alum alvin title ladies gentlemen. I miss having this guy on uh on our regular shows
[02:32:07.700 --> 02:32:14.180]   Such important and interesting information. I appreciate it. Maybe it felt like an old twitch episode. It did
[02:32:14.180 --> 02:32:16.980]   It's back baby twitch is back. Yeah
[02:32:16.980 --> 02:32:19.860]   Thank you all and I appreciate it
[02:32:19.860 --> 02:32:24.020]   Hey, let's take one final break some silly stuff to wrap it up coming up in just a second
[02:32:24.020 --> 02:32:26.020]   Guess who this show is brought to you by?
[02:32:26.020 --> 02:32:28.660]   worldwide technology and intel
[02:32:28.660 --> 02:32:35.220]   How about that? I did not plan this wwt is that the frontier of innovation
[02:32:35.220 --> 02:32:42.180]   I'm really impressed with wwt. We went out right before covet to st. luis to visit to see the advanced
[02:32:42.180 --> 02:32:44.980]   Technology center that is an amazing
[02:32:44.980 --> 02:32:46.660]   thing
[02:32:46.660 --> 02:32:49.060]   The attc is a research and testing lab
[02:32:49.060 --> 02:32:51.300]   Probably the last
[02:32:51.300 --> 02:32:57.300]   Great research and testing lab in the world that brings together technologies from all the leading oem's more than half a billion
[02:32:57.300 --> 02:33:01.140]   Worth of equipment invest in the lab. Yes, there's octane there in fact
[02:33:01.140 --> 02:33:10.580]   The attc offers hundreds of on-demand and schedulable labs featuring solutions that include technologies like intel zon scalable processors intel
[02:33:11.460 --> 02:33:14.500]   persistent memory obtain ssd's and others
[02:33:14.500 --> 02:33:19.060]   Representing the latest and multi-cloud architecture and security networking
[02:33:19.060 --> 02:33:25.300]   primary and secondary storage data analytics and ai dev ops and so much more in fact, I vividly remember
[02:33:25.300 --> 02:33:29.940]   The octane units sitting in the rack they looked so cool
[02:33:29.940 --> 02:33:36.980]   So so cool wwt's engineers. I talked to them the engineers that work in the labs
[02:33:36.980 --> 02:33:40.980]   They use the advanced technology center to spin up proofs of concepts
[02:33:41.380 --> 02:33:46.740]   To learn about technologies to integrate technologies so that when they deliver to you as a customer
[02:33:46.740 --> 02:33:52.420]   You they are giving you the best solutions. They really help you get exactly what you need
[02:33:52.420 --> 02:33:56.820]   They also use the labs to cut evaluation time down from months to weeks
[02:33:56.820 --> 02:34:04.420]   But here's the great thing you can use the attc too you can test out products and solutions before you go to market
[02:34:04.420 --> 02:34:08.420]   You can access technical articles in in expert insights
[02:34:09.140 --> 02:34:14.900]   illustration videos white papers hands-on labs and other tools that help you stay up to date with the latest
[02:34:14.900 --> 02:34:16.580]   technology
[02:34:16.580 --> 02:34:19.620]   The attc is not just a physical lab space at wwt
[02:34:19.620 --> 02:34:24.580]   It's virtualized. You can access it anytime anywhere in the world
[02:34:24.580 --> 02:34:28.900]   All you have to be as a member of the attc platform and it's free to join
[02:34:28.900 --> 02:34:34.900]   While exploring the attc platform, make sure to check out the great events wwt puts on
[02:34:34.980 --> 02:34:41.540]   We actually did an event out there with so much fun communities too that are all working towards the same goal
[02:34:41.540 --> 02:34:46.020]   Of learning about the latest technology trends and how to integrate them into business
[02:34:46.020 --> 02:34:54.900]   Because the thing that wwt really stands for and I really appreciate is they understand that technology is there to serve your business
[02:34:54.900 --> 02:34:59.700]   Strategy and so it's strategy first, but they're the ones that can integrate
[02:34:59.700 --> 02:35:04.660]   You'll learn everything you need at the advanced technology center at wwt
[02:35:05.060 --> 02:35:11.940]   Whatever your business needs wwt can deliver scalable tried and tested tailored solutions
[02:35:11.940 --> 02:35:17.940]   wwt brings strategy and execution together to make a new world happen learn more about wwt

[02:35:24.260 --> 02:35:31.460]   Slash to it. This is a must for anybody who uses enterprise technologies create an account on the gatc platform cost you nothing
[02:35:31.460 --> 02:35:33.780]   wwt.com
[02:35:34.100 --> 02:35:39.140]   Slash to it. We had a fun week this week on twit. We've made a little mini movie for you
[02:35:39.140 --> 02:35:41.380]   Benito's
[02:35:41.380 --> 02:35:44.660]   Was fire up the projector. I don't know what whatever is you do
[02:35:44.660 --> 02:35:47.700]   everybody clapped
[02:35:47.700 --> 02:35:52.500]   My hands are still sore from that concert every other song. This it put your hands together
[02:35:52.500 --> 02:35:55.940]   Thank you very much previously on twit
[02:35:55.940 --> 02:35:59.940]   Coming up next on hands and windows. We're going to take a look at nearby share
[02:36:00.100 --> 02:36:08.420]   Which is a great but underused feature in windows 10 and 11 that allows you to share files between computers but also website URLs and photos
[02:36:08.420 --> 02:36:14.340]   This week in enterprise tech today. We have microsoft's steve katehe's senior director
[02:36:14.340 --> 02:36:20.260]   Of azure space we decided that microsoft didn't need to build it in large its own satellite
[02:36:20.260 --> 02:36:27.700]   But rather partner with others who do and bring our unique strengths and our capabilities
[02:36:28.180 --> 02:36:33.700]   And bring them together with these different space companies to do new and innovative projects
[02:36:33.700 --> 02:36:39.220]   Twit news. We're calling it the dynamic island
[02:36:39.220 --> 02:36:41.220]   I'm going to space to be highly
[02:36:41.220 --> 02:36:46.500]   It's a very page one of the movie. So now look at this. You're receiving alert the dynamic island. Oh wow
[02:36:46.500 --> 02:36:51.380]   I like that this works. That is so clever things like confirming your
[02:36:51.380 --> 02:36:55.780]   Stuck with it. You may as well lean into a twig. It's a lean into it exactly
[02:36:55.780 --> 02:37:00.660]   That was a lot of fun doing that
[02:37:00.660 --> 02:37:05.460]   Apple event I have to say and we're gonna be is that are they playing some motley crew there? I don't know it feels like
[02:37:05.460 --> 02:37:09.140]   Uh, I'm looking forward to october 6th the google event
[02:37:09.140 --> 02:37:14.980]   We'll be covering that live Jason howl will be there ron richards. I might pop in
[02:37:14.980 --> 02:37:17.940]   over my morning coffee
[02:37:17.940 --> 02:37:20.980]   Should be very interesting october 6 7 a.m.
[02:37:20.980 --> 02:37:24.660]   Pacific time
[02:37:24.660 --> 02:37:27.060]   Happy birthday a tari
[02:37:27.060 --> 02:37:28.900]   2600
[02:37:28.900 --> 02:37:31.940]   September 11th, 1977
[02:37:31.940 --> 02:37:34.980]   45 as old as Jason howl
[02:37:34.980 --> 02:37:40.900]   It was about to happen at the same exact day. I don't know Jason is it the it is I think
[02:37:40.900 --> 02:37:47.540]   The Atari video this to me the reason i'm excited is this was what got me into computing really
[02:37:48.340 --> 02:37:52.180]   I spent a lot of quarters chucky cheese pizza time theater
[02:37:52.180 --> 02:37:55.300]   playing battle zone on the big old Atari
[02:37:55.300 --> 02:38:01.300]   Arcade machine I thought I find just put some of those quarters towards buying one of these
[02:38:01.300 --> 02:38:05.940]   I could play it at home. Of course I got it home and realized these games are crap
[02:38:05.940 --> 02:38:10.820]   A little bit on the crowd side, but it was still cool. Yeah
[02:38:10.820 --> 02:38:14.900]   That's when I bought the Atari 400 then replaced it later with the 800
[02:38:15.540 --> 02:38:20.180]   Well, the rest is history is it was I got it one year after you got into radio
[02:38:20.180 --> 02:38:22.980]   I got the Atari 2600
[02:38:22.980 --> 02:38:28.020]   so happy I mean it was it it was a
[02:38:28.020 --> 02:38:31.860]   A monumental moment for geeks
[02:38:31.860 --> 02:38:35.940]   Yes, the quality was terrible, but you could play it at home
[02:38:35.940 --> 02:38:38.100]   You could play it anytime you wanted
[02:38:38.100 --> 02:38:42.820]   And you could buy cartridges and change the game on like you could like you could you can do that in your game
[02:38:42.900 --> 02:38:44.900]   Better than pong and then you know
[02:38:44.900 --> 02:38:47.220]   Yeah, it was it was about as good as pong
[02:38:47.220 --> 02:38:53.380]   By the way, I have an Atari 2600 kind of in honor of this, but it's the size of a dime
[02:38:53.380 --> 02:39:00.180]   It's right. It's but you know what you see it actually plays some games. It's got a little pack you win
[02:39:00.180 --> 02:39:06.820]   Well, you're playing with that the last two and I was on your play. Yeah. Yeah. I can't remember who recommended it was 20
[02:39:06.820 --> 02:39:10.820]   It's 25 bucks on amazon. It has a joystick just like the Atari joystick
[02:39:11.140 --> 02:39:16.820]   It's even it doesn't have cartridges, but it has a big reset button has the switches game select game reset
[02:39:16.820 --> 02:39:21.620]   So that's kind of cool. Listen one of my memories that is not was little
[02:39:21.620 --> 02:39:28.660]   One of my memories from when I was little was uh like like our our neighbor or somebody was over and like
[02:39:28.660 --> 02:39:32.660]   She rolled over the score on space invaders. Oh wow
[02:39:32.660 --> 02:39:37.940]   That was that was like you're getting you're getting the other people in the apartment to come and see
[02:39:38.900 --> 02:39:43.460]   Like she just rolled over the door. Yeah. Yeah, it was like yeah, it was like such a huge deal
[02:39:43.460 --> 02:39:46.340]   Space behaviors is a great game actually that was a great game
[02:39:46.340 --> 02:39:51.860]   So this little mini one has breakout tempest centipede combat pong
[02:39:51.860 --> 02:39:56.580]   Warlords missile command millipede asteroids and pac-man. I mean
[02:39:56.580 --> 02:39:59.220]   25 bucks is it just the
[02:39:59.220 --> 02:40:02.980]   More. Yeah, it's actually be good. Yeah. I mean look man
[02:40:02.980 --> 02:40:08.740]   There's not a lot of processing power in this but uh, I mean this has the same. I'm sure probably more
[02:40:08.820 --> 02:40:14.420]   Processing power than the original 2600 45 years ago. So it's somebody
[02:40:14.420 --> 02:40:18.580]   Somebody in the past few years went back and fixed
[02:40:18.580 --> 02:40:20.340]   ET
[02:40:20.340 --> 02:40:24.020]   Yes, the et game was notorious for being horrible and somebody like you fix it
[02:40:24.020 --> 02:40:28.980]   Somebody in patch was just patches to add fixed the really bad parts
[02:40:28.980 --> 02:40:32.340]   I mean it's still probably not a great game, but like they fixed the annoying
[02:40:32.340 --> 02:40:35.860]   Bad parts of the code like the actual I mean the
[02:40:36.420 --> 02:40:41.140]   The game was programmed as if they they sent someone to watch the movie and describe
[02:40:41.140 --> 02:40:43.700]   To them what the movie was about
[02:40:43.700 --> 02:40:48.660]   There's no connection between the game and the movie. They never released it in fact. They buried all the cartridges
[02:40:48.660 --> 02:40:56.900]   In a landfill. I have an ET cartridge here actually somebody who listened or brought me one. Yeah, I had two
[02:40:56.900 --> 02:40:59.780]   And I gave one
[02:40:59.780 --> 02:41:04.500]   To one of our contributors a guy who did a show for us was talking about it. I said well, would you like my
[02:41:05.300 --> 02:41:07.780]   Coffee? You play it on your 2600
[02:41:07.780 --> 02:41:11.620]   Wow
[02:41:11.620 --> 02:41:15.700]   Ocean shipping rates have plunged 60 percent this year
[02:41:15.700 --> 02:41:18.180]   So if you've been thinking about bringing over a container
[02:41:18.180 --> 02:41:22.980]   Maybe on your way home put some of those vatican library books in there
[02:41:22.980 --> 02:41:24.420]   Cost you
[02:41:24.420 --> 02:41:31.220]   Cost you a lot of it. Is that is that drop partially artificial because they were so high the year prior? Yeah
[02:41:31.220 --> 02:41:33.860]   Probably very yeah, right? Very
[02:41:34.500 --> 02:41:37.140]   So I didn't know this but the Wall Street Journal says
[02:41:37.140 --> 02:41:41.540]   It costs to ship a 40-foot container from china to the west coast
[02:41:41.540 --> 02:41:44.900]   about $5,400 a box down from
[02:41:44.900 --> 02:41:47.700]   $9,000
[02:41:47.700 --> 02:41:49.700]   in january
[02:41:49.700 --> 02:41:55.300]   Yeah, because everything spiked when you know you had uh, you had a big container ship sideways in a canal and
[02:41:55.300 --> 02:42:00.420]   Picked it walking up. Picked it more than $20,000 at one point. So here's the graph
[02:42:01.220 --> 02:42:06.740]   February 2020 we're still not down to that point. Yeah, it was if February 2020
[02:42:06.740 --> 02:42:12.500]   It was 1400 bucks imagine that no wonder we had so many, you know, chocchis
[02:42:12.500 --> 02:42:18.820]   Chocchis for that was nothing when all the way up to 20,000 that was the peak in
[02:42:18.820 --> 02:42:25.940]   Late last year october september last year better year ago. I'll explain some of the prices being high on stuff
[02:42:25.940 --> 02:42:29.060]   Yeah, there's a there's a source of inflation right there
[02:42:29.700 --> 02:42:34.500]   Yeah, so it's come down, but it's still not at the level pre pandemic levels
[02:42:34.500 --> 02:42:38.180]   Pre pandemic was 1400 bucks. Wow
[02:42:38.180 --> 02:42:40.180]   Wow
[02:42:40.180 --> 02:42:45.140]   Walmart charted its own ships because it got so expensive was cheaper to get a ship
[02:42:45.140 --> 02:42:50.420]   That it was to get a container and said forget that we're gonna do it
[02:42:50.420 --> 02:42:58.180]   Ourselves so I don't know if this will help inflation or help keep costs down, but that was an interesting story instagram find
[02:42:58.900 --> 02:43:00.900]   400 million dollars
[02:43:00.900 --> 02:43:06.500]   Uh because they gave up kids data. This is the ireland
[02:43:06.500 --> 02:43:09.940]   privacy regulator data privacy regulator
[02:43:09.940 --> 02:43:12.580]   Four to two million dollars against instagram
[02:43:12.580 --> 02:43:16.980]   Due to their handling of children's data. Do you think it'll it'll get any better? No
[02:43:16.980 --> 02:43:20.180]   No, they're gonna appeal that of course. Yeah
[02:43:20.180 --> 02:43:23.860]   Doesn't instagram have something where you're supposed to be sold
[02:43:24.420 --> 02:43:32.420]   To be you know, so the investigation focused on users between the age of 13 and 17 and the us kappa says under 13
[02:43:32.420 --> 02:43:35.220]   So this was kids that were legal in the us
[02:43:35.220 --> 02:43:42.740]   Investigation focused on child users between the age of 13 and 17 who are allowed to operate business accounts
[02:43:42.740 --> 02:43:46.340]   Well
[02:43:46.340 --> 02:43:52.180]   So fancy what's wrong with that which facilitate the publication the users phone number and or email address
[02:43:53.460 --> 02:43:55.620]   You know, these are kids who wanted to be influencers
[02:43:55.620 --> 02:44:02.180]   I think this is great if a 13 year old says I want to start my business on facebook for crying out loud
[02:44:02.180 --> 02:44:09.300]   Let them that's not a privacy money for their containers. Yeah, how they how they gonna pay for their containers
[02:44:09.300 --> 02:44:13.060]   There is a new searches and I don't know how many of you
[02:44:13.060 --> 02:44:20.340]   When you're doing a search instead of searching google search reddit or you add site reddit.com to your search
[02:44:20.340 --> 02:44:22.020]   Oh, I do. Yeah
[02:44:22.020 --> 02:44:24.020]   It depends on what I don't use google
[02:44:24.020 --> 02:44:27.540]   Grettity is Bing especially if you're searching for products use Bing
[02:44:27.540 --> 02:44:31.060]   It's wrong. It doesn't actually use and it actually works
[02:44:31.060 --> 02:44:34.740]   There is a goodness. I've been using Bing for years. That's it's
[02:44:34.740 --> 02:44:40.580]   Bing is pretty bad for some of the searches I try to do usually for certain kind of technology things like I
[02:44:40.580 --> 02:44:42.580]   Google
[02:44:42.580 --> 02:44:47.460]   I the top of the page on google is often now wasted with knowledge graphs and
[02:44:48.260 --> 02:44:52.660]   Videos from youtube sure love youtube not nothing wrong. I just youtube. Yeah, I was about to say
[02:44:52.660 --> 02:45:00.740]   Reddit so this is a new search engine luria l o o r i a dot com that uh actually
[02:45:00.740 --> 02:45:04.660]   Scrapes reddit to find the favorite products in
[02:45:04.660 --> 02:45:08.740]   Many of the reddit groups. So I just thought I passed that along to you
[02:45:08.740 --> 02:45:16.580]   Most discussed products on cycling or e-bikes or earbuds or headphones sometimes it's a little, uh, you know
[02:45:17.540 --> 02:45:22.500]   Depends on the on the subreddit some subreddits are infested with spammers
[02:45:22.500 --> 02:45:25.540]   and companies frankly trying to
[02:45:25.540 --> 02:45:33.540]   Improve just toxicity. Yeah or toxicity. So but hey, I think an interesting idea for search engine l o r i a
[02:45:33.540 --> 02:45:35.780]   actually uh
[02:45:35.780 --> 02:45:42.100]   There was a thing just the other day that was one of those really hard to search for kind of things
[02:45:42.100 --> 02:45:46.740]   And it wasn't until I added reddit in yeah, and even then I had to build go a little deep on it
[02:45:46.820 --> 02:45:48.420]   Oh, yeah, it was work. Yeah
[02:45:48.420 --> 02:45:53.780]   Well, I had this one del laptop that like it was an it build laptop because it was a work laptop
[02:45:53.780 --> 02:45:59.940]   So it didn't come with some of the regular software that would come preloaded on the del thing like mainly control panels for like sound
[02:45:59.940 --> 02:46:09.220]   And there was this real tech based something something that was adding this horrible echo into like usb connected audio devices
[02:46:09.220 --> 02:46:15.860]   So like my headset was just if it was a weird reverb whenever I was like using the headset and i'm like what the heck is going on here?
[02:46:16.100 --> 02:46:18.420]   And I could not crack that problem
[02:46:18.420 --> 02:46:23.540]   And I mean i'm reasonably savvy on computer stuff and still could not figure out what the heck was going on there
[02:46:23.540 --> 02:46:27.860]   And it wasn't until was at the bottom of some obscure reddit thread where somebody was like, oh, yeah
[02:46:27.860 --> 02:46:33.940]   You gotta install this control panel from the microsoft store for this, you know, sound max something something control
[02:46:33.940 --> 02:46:40.340]   Isn't that awesome? That's why I love it. I use reddit. Yeah, it's not just for memes anymore. It's not just for memes. Yeah
[02:46:40.340 --> 02:46:43.860]   Do you remember when serious
[02:46:44.660 --> 02:46:45.860]   So
[02:46:45.860 --> 02:46:48.100]   You may think hey if a plane breaks
[02:46:48.100 --> 02:46:50.340]   In the sky
[02:46:50.340 --> 02:46:53.140]   Why doesn't it have a parachute you have the passage have parachute?
[02:46:53.140 --> 02:46:58.420]   Why does the plane have parachute you ever think that maybe after one too many spliffs in a couple of balls?
[02:46:58.420 --> 02:47:00.980]   That's a thing for sessness sessness off parachutes. Yeah
[02:47:00.980 --> 02:47:08.020]   Small planes can have parachutes the serious airframe parachute system or caps has been used for the first time
[02:47:08.020 --> 02:47:12.340]   This is the serious vision jet a single engine private jet
[02:47:13.940 --> 02:47:19.460]   They had problems they deployed the parachute the pilot a boy and a woman walked away
[02:47:19.460 --> 02:47:25.620]   Safe and sound because the parachute brought them in for safe landing
[02:47:25.620 --> 02:47:29.300]   Yeah, the first deployment of the airframe shoot in operation
[02:47:29.300 --> 02:47:31.140]   Wow
[02:47:31.140 --> 02:47:33.140]   I'm surprised it's it's been this long
[02:47:33.140 --> 02:47:40.660]   Right, you know because it's been around for a while. I'm surprised. This is the first like, you know deploy actual like live deployment that for
[02:47:41.220 --> 02:47:46.020]   Well, they've done I've seen deployments on sessness on like the old turbo prop sessness
[02:47:46.020 --> 02:47:50.180]   Yeah, this is a jet though. It might be the first small jet. Yeah, maybe that's okay. Yeah, maybe that's it
[02:47:50.180 --> 02:47:55.060]   Yeah, so I guess you had a big a big lever there. You can pull it and you just float to the ground
[02:47:55.060 --> 02:48:01.220]   That's hysterical. This is a simulator. This is not not real
[02:48:01.220 --> 02:48:03.380]   Just
[02:48:03.380 --> 02:48:08.260]   I mean the one thing though is once you pull that shoot you don't have any control over where you're floating in
[02:48:08.420 --> 02:48:13.460]   Now you're just you're gonna land where we land your newtons hands. No miracle on the Hudson for you, buddy
[02:48:13.460 --> 02:48:16.740]   You're gonna yeah, I like that you're in newtons hands now
[02:48:16.740 --> 02:48:20.260]   That's that's hysterical
[02:48:20.260 --> 02:48:22.420]   Uh, let's see
[02:48:22.420 --> 02:48:24.580]   Some new linux malware out there
[02:48:24.580 --> 02:48:27.460]   Sounds like a nation state. This is a big one
[02:48:27.460 --> 02:48:31.620]   Um, I don't usually mention. I was worried about that. It's real. It's real nasty
[02:48:31.620 --> 02:48:35.300]   Uh shikatega shikatega shikatega
[02:48:36.100 --> 02:48:38.820]   Um, very stealthy
[02:48:38.820 --> 02:48:43.220]   Uh, according to the atnt alien labs
[02:48:43.220 --> 02:48:50.180]   The researchers who discovered it the malware delivered through a multi stage infection chain using polymorphic encoding
[02:48:50.180 --> 02:48:54.740]   It uses legitimate cloud services to host command and control servers
[02:48:54.740 --> 02:48:57.460]   So it's very difficult to detect
[02:48:57.460 --> 02:49:03.460]   Uh, and it can infect not only uh linux machines, but iot devices
[02:49:04.020 --> 02:49:11.380]   Uh, based on linux of the cloud provider thing aspect was it was the big thing that popped out of me as a possible defense
[02:49:11.380 --> 02:49:15.620]   Right because right but you but you have to figure out where
[02:49:15.620 --> 02:49:21.780]   Where is it reaching out to which cloud service provider which addresses right and sometimes even that's obfuscated
[02:49:21.780 --> 02:49:26.820]   And not readily obvious and even if you have remembered the code that disassembled
[02:49:26.820 --> 02:49:30.340]   The dropper the dropper is only 370 bytes
[02:49:30.980 --> 02:49:34.980]   Mega bytes or kilobytes, it's three and seven bytes. Yeah, it's smaller than one
[02:49:34.980 --> 02:49:40.260]   The polymorphic encoder is crazy because basically every time it runs it rewrites its code
[02:49:40.260 --> 02:49:45.620]   The underlying algorithm stays the same, but if you're looking for the code to detect the threat
[02:49:45.620 --> 02:49:51.300]   It'll change every single time it runs. It makes it hard to do a signature based virus detection. Is that the idea?
[02:49:51.300 --> 02:49:53.300]   Well and and it stays in memory
[02:49:53.300 --> 02:49:55.300]   There's another important aspect of it
[02:49:55.300 --> 02:49:59.940]   It doesn't if it never if no piece of it ever touches the disc then a lot of the any virus type
[02:50:00.580 --> 02:50:05.460]   You know scanning tools on on regular endpoint systems just aren't gonna turn I gonna see it
[02:50:05.460 --> 02:50:09.940]   And it's very very flexible. Yeah, it's it's
[02:50:09.940 --> 02:50:13.220]   They included a metasploit module called metal
[02:50:13.220 --> 02:50:21.220]   Which allows me to take over any connected devices. So USB cameras USB microphones. I can remote execute code. Oh lord
[02:50:21.220 --> 02:50:26.580]   That's not good. It also put a crypto miner on there. Just in case you didn't want to make some money
[02:50:26.580 --> 02:50:27.860]   Exactly. Why not?
[02:50:27.860 --> 02:50:32.580]   The good news here is that I think it's it's a tech vector
[02:50:32.580 --> 02:50:36.740]   It wasn't like one or two different cve's or something basically there. It's two of them
[02:50:36.740 --> 02:50:42.340]   It's two of them, but it's issues that like there are patches out. So it's a matter of like correct
[02:50:42.340 --> 02:50:48.660]   Obviously, and I think we talked about this last time I was on Leo make sure all of your things are updated patch your thing
[02:50:48.660 --> 02:50:56.180]   Patch your thing the problem is of course iot devices which often are not patchable and they will have the problem are raspberry pies
[02:50:56.740 --> 02:50:59.940]   That haven't been updated for 15 years or whatever. Yes
[02:50:59.940 --> 02:51:05.620]   I've got a couple of years that I I mean I have to force myself to remember you got to update your Linux
[02:51:05.620 --> 02:51:08.820]   Go ahead and run the update. Why not? It takes a couple minutes. Right?
[02:51:08.820 --> 02:51:12.900]   One of the cve's has been in the links kernel for 12 years pwn kit
[02:51:12.900 --> 02:51:15.540]   It was discovered last year
[02:51:15.540 --> 02:51:18.900]   And it has been patched in most in a modern Linux you're patched
[02:51:18.900 --> 02:51:24.740]   But iot maybe not so much. Yeah, the other came to light in April of this of last year
[02:51:25.620 --> 02:51:28.820]   Both have been patched, but this is yeah, it sounds like a nation state
[02:51:28.820 --> 02:51:35.940]   But of course that crypto the manero miner is a little weird nation state. That's yeah unless that's misdirection kitty thing. Yeah
[02:51:35.940 --> 02:51:39.060]   It's what it means pretty cleverly written
[02:51:39.060 --> 02:51:46.500]   Uh, okay. I think we have literally done all the stories. I got nothing left
[02:51:46.500 --> 02:51:53.300]   Uh, so I get let Jason go have some birthday cake. I think and let you all go have some dinner rene
[02:51:53.460 --> 02:52:00.180]   I miss you. I think you're doing God's work over there youtube as creator liaison. They are so lucky
[02:52:00.180 --> 02:52:03.140]   To have rene richy there
[02:52:03.140 --> 02:52:09.860]   To kind of go like the tim gun you go in there you do a rene talk and say let me tell you something as a youtuber

[02:54:05.460 --> 02:54:12.980]   Uh, the club twit is really a great place to get together in our discord. I i'm become a huge
[02:54:12.980 --> 02:54:15.540]   fan of discord club twit
[02:54:15.540 --> 02:54:18.020]   Uh, is the place
[02:54:18.020 --> 02:54:23.860]   To be if you ask me we talk about not only the shows but all sorts of other things going on including
[02:54:23.860 --> 02:54:25.300]   coding
[02:54:25.300 --> 02:54:32.820]   And ham radio and books and comics. We've got a stacy's book club coming up. We've got other events planned in there
[02:54:32.820 --> 02:54:38.900]   Uh, and we also use the club to a subsidized new show so you saw hands on windows with paul thorat
[02:54:38.900 --> 02:54:46.500]   We do hands on mac with mica sergeant. We do the untitled linux show with donnas jonathan Bennett and uh, and uh, rob kambal
[02:54:46.980 --> 02:54:52.580]   Uh, we also do the stacy's book club. We do the giz fizz all of those are subsidized by club members
[02:54:52.580 --> 02:54:57.300]   Uh, because they're either too new too small to have advertising so the club members
[02:54:57.300 --> 02:55:02.820]   Subsidize that with their money. You also get ad free versions of all the shows because you're contributing
[02:55:02.820 --> 02:55:04.740]   So we don't need to show you ads
[02:55:04.740 --> 02:55:06.340]   You don't even get this ad
[02:55:06.340 --> 02:55:12.260]   And uh, you'll also get access to the twit plus feed which has the hands on mac hands on windows and lots of other stuff that doesn't make
[02:55:12.260 --> 02:55:18.260]   It to the public podcast and all of that that's a lot for seven bucks a month. That is a good deal
[02:55:18.260 --> 02:55:25.300]   There's yearly plans there's enterprise plans find out more and you can buy some shows individually ad free for two dollars and 99 cents a month
[02:55:25.300 --> 02:55:29.700]   If you just want to subscribe to those all of that at twit.tv/club
