[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Bandwidth for this weekend tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   This is to it this weekend tech episode 65 for August 6th, 2006, the $60 million man.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   [Music]
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Alright, let's get started. Then we've got a great panel and I'd like to introduce everybody via cell phone because he can't get grounded.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   From Los Angeles, he's back in the States ladies and gentlemen, Corey Doctorow.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Howdy.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   I'd like to have you back on Twitter.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   We'll talk a little bit about what you're up to because you're no longer the European Affairs Coordinator for the EFF.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   You're in LA now.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   What could that mean?
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   We also have Will Harris from Britain who very kindly stepped out of the way for Jerry Parnell last week.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   We owe him one.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Hello, how's it going?
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   #tec.net and you were up late last time. I think it was what two in the morning when we bumped you.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Yeah, something like that.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   I apologize.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Also with us, the poster boy for web 2.0. Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Oh no.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   [Laughter]
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   We're just proud of you Kevin. Although the picture on the front business week was in exactly the best picture of you.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   I have a story about that. We can talk about that.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Alright.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And then of course to anchor this whole mess, John C. Devorak, who only got one plug in last week.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Now I need one plug Devorak.org/blog. I'm in business.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   [Laughter]
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Is it that good? Does it work that well really?
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Well, you know, it's actually diminishing returns. If I probably, you know, at some point I noticed that, you know, I got a bunch of, I got a run up and then it's pretty much nothing now.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Nothing. You get nothing, huh?
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   You get nothing.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   [Laughter]
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   So you just appear for the goodness of your own hire. Well, I thank you very much.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   You did blog this week about Kevin's cover.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And let's, we might as well just start off with that. I'm, first of all, Kevin, embarrassed or not. I think it's wonderful.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I mean, you're getting a lot of recognition from Business Week. It was kind of the, the counting in the article is a little strange as they pointed out in the article.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Your dig is breaking even, but on the front page they say this kid made $60 million in 18 months.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Actually, a dig isn't even breaking even. So they got that wrong.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Hey, Kevin, you're taking us out to dinner tonight with all that money?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Yeah, 60 million. I have no, there's no, I'm not a multi-millionaire. I'm not a, even a millionaire or a thousandaire.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I don't know how they came up with that cover, but I guess it was just based on, they put a value to the company.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Two hundred million. And you have 40%
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   And you have 40%
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Yeah. It's all estimates and obviously it's just paper fake money.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Hey, I thought, Leo, you kind of liked that piece. I thought the article read like it like a slip shot hit piece.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Really?
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   He was a hit piece. I would seem like it to me. It was snide. He called him a kid.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I mean, the guy, you know, Kevin's 30 or close to it.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   And I mean, if you look on the pictures, you got six o'clock shadow for God's sake.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   I mean, it doesn't even look like he's young in that thing except for the crazy outfit.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   And they call him, and then they had all these Tom Cruise's, about your little brother and, you know, they were snod.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Yeah, and then about the tech TV loser, you know, kind of a loser on tech TV, you know, with unknown, I mean, the whole thing was just rang.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   It was, I was, you know, what? You're right. I'm mad as hell now.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I'm mad. Dang it.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   No, I see. It was pretty crazy how they came up with that, that cover shot.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   So the whole deal was going into this.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Honestly, it was just an interview for we were going to be one of the companies featured in the article.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   We had no idea it was going to be a cover or anything like that until the actual day that it went out to press.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Oh, they didn't even warn you before that?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   No, they said there's a possibility it might be, but they go, we want to take a photo of you, you know, come out and, you know, it's for the inside of the magazine.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Just, you know, there's a guy's walking their dogs. There's guys with hockey gear on, you know, do something fun.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   So like they're all throwing some headphones and, you know, just give us a couple different poses.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   So did they give you the backwards cap or was that your idea?
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   No, they basically, I mean, they had me like drinking a beer.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   They had me doing all different kinds of things.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   And they're just like, you know, we'll see which one everyone makes it.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Kevin, if I got you to try one of those crazy tennis shoe laitings and all the kids are into these days.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   No, I didn't have to do that.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   You got to get a handler.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I'd draw the line somewhere.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   You need a man, you need somebody to protect you from this stuff.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   I don't know.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   It is a mixed blessing though to be on the cover of Business Week.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Of course. I mean, I'm honored to be on the cover, but I mean, I was, with the whole 60 million, this kid made 60 million dollars.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   I didn't make anything, you know, the company were, while we have a path to becoming a profitable company, we are not a profitable company.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   You know, we're continuing to work on that with Federated Media and some other companies that we're signed up with to serve ads on the page.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   And go federated media.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   What's that?
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   This is John Battelle's company.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   They sell banner ads, right?
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Go federated media.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   And why do you say that, Corey?
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Well, because that's what Bling Bling gets his money too.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Oh, all right.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Good.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Is Bling Bling all Federated Media? You don't have anybody else on there?
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Yeah, well, no. So it's a little complex because John's also personally our business manager.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   So I think he occasionally does deals on our behalf with entities other than Federated Media, but it's pretty much all Federated Media.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Mattelle was a journalist.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Yeah. Well, in an entrepreneur, he founded the industry standard.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   It's kind of an interesting thing though.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Now he's selling.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Kevin, did you prefer the alternative?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I mean, did you prefer the alternative cover that got pasted?
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   What was the alternative cover?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Ah, yes.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   You mean the 40-year-old virgin one?
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   The comparison.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Stripes shirt, stripes shirt.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   That was awesome.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Where is that?
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   I didn't see that.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Was that on dig?
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Yeah, there's a bunch of different alternatives out there, which are just amazing.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   They're really cool.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   A bunch of people with Photoshop.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Oh my goodness.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Well, I think in some ways this kind of attention is a bad thing for a company because it puts pressure on you.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Of course, a lot of weasels come out of the woodwork saying, "Hey, kid, I can have for you without $60 million."
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Actually, the day it was posted, I had someone from Goldman Sachs email me like, "Hey, if you need money, man, I'm like, I can't even afford a cow."
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   I just moved into my new apartment.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Leave me alone.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   I don't have $60 million.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Oh, sure, it's going to be an avalanche at some point of stuff.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Yeah, it's pretty funny.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Bug in you.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   So tell me about John Battelle's strategies with federated media, Corey.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   It seems, is it more than just banner ads?
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   What's the idea behind that?
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Well, I think the idea is that there are sites out there that are rather their advertisers out there that want to advertise to fairly large, high quality audiences.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Sort of an order of magnitude larger than the average blog might have.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   And the transaction cost of going out and doing, say, a hundred deals with a hundred blogs is pretty high.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   And so I think John Bassick's premise is he goes out, he finds a bunch of really kick-ass blogs, kick-ass websites that have inventory of the sell and that have a unique and distinctive voice, figures out which advertisers might be a good fit for them, and then go to the advertiser and says, "I can sell you advertising in front of, I can sell you 30 million impressions on the following sites."
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   And he can go to the creators and talk to them about whether or not those advertisers are appropriate for them.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   So he's an aggregator then of the eyeballs.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   On both sides.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   He's aggregating blogs, he's aggregating advertisers, and unlike something like, say, Google Ads where you've got to feed them some editorial control and the relevance isn't so high and you don't really have any exacting fine grain control over who gets to advertise with you,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   and to tell gives you a lot of control over who gets to advertise with you, and he doesn't try to have any editorial control over what you post basically once you and he have a deal, you write your site and he helps you find the right advertisers based on what you're posting.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   He doesn't try to tell you to post something different.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Sometimes you get comical results from Google Ads.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   They really don't seem to do a very good job.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   In fact, I'm looking at your blog now to John, and the very first Google ad on your blog says, "Meet species testing."
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   The Google ad thing is only there.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   And then Scraple Geno typing.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   I don't even understand.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   It's Google Ads.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I don't think they do a very good job.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I think they do it.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   The more I experience them, the worse it seems to be.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   It doesn't seem to be a very good job.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   But it's an issue with the federated media that there's a point of which it becomes an economic because for a really big site, for example, like Dick, surely giving away, say, 50% of the time, it's a really big site.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   For example, like Dick, surely giving away, say, 50% of the revenue to federated media is a lot less efficient than hiring someone.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Why don't you sell it yourself?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Well, honestly, for us, it's just, you know, we're a small team that are just world developers and ops people.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   So we're looking at this right now.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Absolutely, because right now, down the line, doesn't it become more efficient?
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   BitTech does its own ad sales, right?
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   You have a salesperson.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Well, we have a couple of guys because there comes a point where, you know, if you're in a specialist field, you know who all the advertisers are and who are better to sell your advertising than the guy that sits in the office with you every day and understands what you're doing.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   And of course, they're only selling for us as opposed to trying to sell for, you know, to me it looks sometimes like a bit of a conflict of interest because if you're selling for, say, 40 different sites, and a company has budget to go on, say, one or two sites, well, how do you decide where they go?
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   You know, where they go necessarily.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   And it's one of those things where we've actually had a couple advertisers approach us directly and say, hey, we want to advertise on dig and FM doesn't lock you into any type of exclusive relationship with them.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   So we can use their ad engine to basically push any campaign that we direct sell and then they don't take a cut out of that.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   So, yeah, at some point, you know, as more and more people learn about dig and want to advertise directly on dig, they can contact us and we can do that.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   But right now they just have a huge sales force that go out and, you know, bring in the IBM's and Lenovo's and Hitachi's of the world.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   And it's so easy for us.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   The reason this is a relevant discussion is really Web 2.0 seems to be fueled by, or it needs to be fueled by on-site advertising.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   So if it doesn't, you know, it's got to work if Web 2.0 is going to work.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   I don't know how relevant is this, though. I think people out there are going to fall asleep.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Oh, that's why I was trying to make it relevant. All right, fine.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   All right, fine.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   All right, enough of that.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   You didn't go to Defcon, Kevin. Is this the first time you didn't go this year?
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   I know, I missed it. Well, you know, it's growing up in Vegas. I went quite a bit, but it's one of those things where I just have time to break away this year.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I think that's probably why Patrick is not with us. I forgot that he probably is at Defcon.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Yeah, he told me he was going.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Yeah, so, and he's smart enough not to try to use the Internet while at Defcon.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Ha!
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Do you see the Mac OS X hack? 30-second hack? Is that scary?
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   That's scary. That's really scary.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   What's so many clarify for me because I can't tell from the coverage, and I have been too lazy to watch the video.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Did they use a third party Wi-Fi card or the built-in Wi-Fi card? Nobody knows.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   No, I understand it was the built-in, right?
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   It was the built-in one. See, that's scary.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Because it was an issue with the...
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Explain to people out there what happened because I don't think everybody's there.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   It was a demo. I think originally done at Black Hat, and then I think they might have done it again at Defcon, but a couple of hackers.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Now, this is where it gets a little dicey. They didn't do the demo live because they didn't want people to know how to do it.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   They also wear pains to point out it's not a specific Mac issue.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   It's a problem with many Wi-Fi drivers, including many Wi-Fi drivers on Windows, but they were able to own a MacBook getting in through the Wi-Fi drivers because basically Wi-Fi is promiscuous in 30 seconds in this video.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   And, you know, Intel shortly after this came out updated their drivers.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   I don't know if they fixed that flaw in their own drivers, but apparently it's still an issue.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   I did get a Mac update a couple of days ago. I don't know if they fixed that or not.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   I don't believe so. A friend of mine from Apple said that they're working on it right now, so...
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   I don't know.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Does it mean that if you walk out into the wild world with your Wi-Fi on your vulnerable?
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Well, I don't think the exploit has been released to the public, so only a small group of people will have this.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Well, or rather, we don't know how many people have it because the whole point of not releasing an exploit like this to the public is...
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   It presumes that they're the first people who ever discovered it.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   I'm a full disclosure guy. I think it's pretty silly to say, you know, trust us.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   We're the only ones who figured it out. No one else will figure it out, especially now that we've told everyone that it can be done and given them hints at which direction to try, I'd actually be pretty concerned.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   What do we do?
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   We just fly from 8-7 MacBooks.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Yeah, me too.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   The good thing about Wi-Fi hacks, I think from a security perspective is that you're only vulnerable to people within a couple hundred feet of you most of the time, as opposed to, you know, OS-level vulnerabilities where you're potentially vulnerable to much larger pools of potential attackers who...
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   So if there are only 10 people in the world who care enough about you or are malicious enough and indiscriminate enough to attack you, the chances of them being within 300 yards of you are a lot less than the chances of them being connected to the Internet somewhere in the world.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Any other interesting hacks at DEF CON?
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Well, I think they pointed out that the ARFID chips that are being used, I think maybe from next year in US passports were easily cloned.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Yeah, they cloned the passport. Actually, they cloned European passports, yes.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Yeah, also because they're trying to start the area as well.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   They led them with, well, they were partially open as well as I understand it, which is, of course, one of the big concerns with that.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   You, speaking of discriminated and discriminated, if there's an attacker out there who doesn't care which American they attack provided that they're attacking Americans,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   then if these passports are even partially open, it appears that they can be read potentially at a great distance.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   If they're closed, they're somehow shielded?
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Yeah, I think that the actual passport material that's covered has some sort of shielding property.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   I don't know if they're competitive, some kind of Saturday mesh in it or something.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Seems pretty weird. It's like the old tin foil argument, isn't it?
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Well, it'll cover your passport into a tin foil and you won't get, you know.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   People will be huddled over their passports when they open them.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Well, you know, for at least a year now, there have been a couple of border crossings, one in Canada and one in Mexico, land crossings into the US,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   where foreigners who come in have been issued RFID readable cards that they're intended to carry at all times.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Really?
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   That are potentially readable at great distances.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Like a visa?
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Yeah, well, like a prisoner ankle bracelet.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   She's Louise.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   They give it to every corner in the United States.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   They go through every one who goes through, has to wear one.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   These two crossings, it's a pilot for enough wear them, they carry them in a pilot program.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Oh my goodness.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   I want to then, as I recall, upstate New York into Ontario and then the other one was somewhere in Mexico, I forgot to state it.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   It came as...
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   And as a Canadian, you have to do that.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Well, if I cross it back crossing, what?
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   I'll just take and throw it out.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Well, yeah, that sounds like a good theory, John, until like you run afoul of the Department of Homeland Security who discovered that you've committed some technical violation and used it as the base of the border.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   Now you're in Gitmo, baby.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   How many times have you been stopped, Corey?
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   A lot.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   I've been running in and out of the United States on different visas for seven years now.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   But he carries that metallic bill of rights in his wallet.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   I know.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   And I carry the metallic...
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   I've had a lot of problems with the American border at various times.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Well, what is a lot of problems to you?
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Because I have problems myself when I come in from Canada.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   They just are...
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   You're a citizen.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   There's a difference.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   I mean...
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   I know they still give you a bad time, especially if you just come in from Canada.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Last time I came back, you know, they're grilling me.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Why went to Canada in the first place?
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   As if it was like some horrible place I shouldn't be going.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Yeah, and it's really tough when you're trying to explain what you do for a living.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   When what you do for a living is something that's not readily explicable.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   And then there are all these trick questions like, "Well, you write novels.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Will you be working on these novels while you're in America?
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Do you have a visa to write novels while you're in America?"
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Oh my.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Is that a trick question?
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   If you say...
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   I don't even know what the answer to that is.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   You need a work permit to write an awful...
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Well, and you know, whether you be blogging while you're in America is the blogging for an American firm with, you know, servers in Toronto.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   I'm not really sure, you know.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   So, you know, one of the things they have...
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   My people, is it where the border guys in Port Angeles, Washington, where I cross a lot,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   they tell us sometimes some of the things you have to look out for in the next upcoming cycle.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   And the last one we were told is that when you...
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Because we always bring a lot of Rogers chocolates.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Oh, I can't wait.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Yeah, for Victoria.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   Oh, I'm going there in a couple weeks.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   There's a trick question coming up which is that will these...
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   You know, if you're bringing food, will this be a gift?
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Oh.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   And you have to answer no.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   I'm eating it myself.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   It's all for personal consumption because apparently if it's a gift, there's some new rule about that.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   They're going to just confiscate the chocolate and eat it themselves.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   I go into Canada monthly and actually it's a very smooth process.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   I have a work permit so the Canadian crossing is pretty straightforward.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   I do notice the customs guards sometimes are in a bad mood.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   But, I mean, you know, everybody gets in a bad mood.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   But I haven't eaten it in the last...
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Are you in taxes after a meal?
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   I get paid in Canadian dollars too.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   I found US and Canadian customs guards often to be very surly.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   You're compared particularly to British ones.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   I looked in the UK for three years and they were pretty good about it.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   My passport went through the laundry.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   And the British Home Office charges 500 pounds to glue your visa into a new passport.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Wow.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   And I've got a lot of other visas glued in there too that I just don't want to...
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   So is it soft and fuzzy now? A little furry?
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   It's a little, yeah.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   It looks like a little water damage.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   And, you know, generally speaking, they've been cool about it.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Most border crossings are cool.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   But the British ones always say, "went through the laundry, didn't it?"
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   And I say, "Well, yes, it did."
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   And they say, "Welcome back to Britain, sir."
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   And they do a little stance.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   I like that.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   The crazy ones were the Russians who went through the circle over this.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   You know, I've got a theory that the more border hassle there is,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   the less likely it is that you ever want to sneak into that country in the first place.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   All right. The two biggest ones I've had in the last year were Uganda and Russia.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   And I don't know who's going there to steal jobs from, you know,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   lose their jobs from Russians.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   And, you know, my family just wants to get out.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Smuggling lubels.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Yeah, really.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   They gave me when I went in, of course, it was in a cruise ship,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   but they gave me a red thing.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   It stuck a red bookmark in my passports, like a day pass.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   But it didn't say anything.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   It was just a piece of plastic.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   And then as you're going out, they collected back.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   I mean, it was the most primitive means I could think of to kind of, I guess,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   count people coming and going.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   I don't know what it was though.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   It seems to me there's a...
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Exactly.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   There's a country where they do it just at a habit.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   There's no rationale.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   I met someone who worked for the State Department when the Soviet Union was falling apart,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   who worked on advising former Soviet republics on border formalities.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   And one thing that she discovered is that because everyone who was in a position of power
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   in those countries had the experience of going to the U.S.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   and getting the full visit to Dr. Jellyfinger, you know, full at RecoPro background check,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   everything, that was the mark of a civilized country.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Oh, dear.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   They wanted to show that they were as grown up as America was.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   And so the consequence, everyone who came in and out of their country
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   was going to have to spend a day lining up at their embassy in some country somewhere else
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   to get a full page view that glued into their passport.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Isn't that adult?
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   You come into the bestates frequently, Will.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   Do they give you the eye scan and the thumbprint?
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Oh, yeah. You've got the full bonanza.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   But they're generally... they're pretty professional about it.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Apart from... I saw one guy, one comes as customs official,
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   pulled a gun on somebody for chatting on their cell phone.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   You know, that's funny that he pulled his gun.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   I saw the same thing happen. He didn't pull his gun.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   But he was infuriated as if that somehow he'd violated some terrorist ban.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   He was talking on the cell phone.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   It wasn't even as he approached it.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   You know, it's supposed to be bad.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   Everybody, you know, texts, girlfriends or whatever.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Actually, it rang. He didn't even pick it up. It just rang in the guy.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   There are signs all over the place, Leo in San Francisco,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   that you're not supposed to have your cell phone on.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   Because it's in polite?
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Oh, because they're so big they don't want people saying,
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   "Okay, there's only so-and-so's not working."
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   "I'll three go there because you can smuggle the goods in."
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Ahh.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Yeah, you know, we can play movie plot threats all we want.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   But like if the test for whether or not we're going to implement some security measure
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   is whether we can imagine some new quantum of security arising from it
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   and not whether it's worth the trade-off that you pay.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   You know, one of the things I've noticed is that when you land in America,
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   they give you a very long form to fill out that has a lot of questions
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   that you might need to phone someone to get the answer to.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Like, "Hey, what's your zip code person I'm staying with?"
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   Right.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   And so, you know, it can't just be, "Well, we can imagine some sequence in which doing this might make us secure from some attack."
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   And that's it. We've decided that's something that we need to secure ourselves.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   I mean, that way lives, you know, if we're going to keep doing that,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   we might as well tranquilize our dart everyone on the airplane.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   We'd be more secure, technically.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   We're going to be blindfolded and hooded them before they come in that country.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   If I pull it out, my blackberry started typing.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Would they pull a gun on me? I wonder.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   I think they should shoot you just for having a blackberry.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   For doing that.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   Hey, what was talking about San Francisco?
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   Worldwide developers conference, baby.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Yeah. Kevin's, "You have the scoop."
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   "Oh, I don't this year. It sucks."
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   You were the guy who predicted the nano. That's right.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   I have my insider, but they're gone now.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Yeah, you know why they're gone?
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   Yes, I do.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   Well, the rumors are an Apple phone. I don't see that happening.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Anybody believe they'll be an Apple cell phone?
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   No.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   No.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   That's the last business they'd want to get in them.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   I think being to hold them to the music industry is a map.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   They also want to be beholden to the, uh, different types of carriers.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   Those paragons of forward thinking.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   AT&T, "Take Me Away."
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   How about, uh, I think it's pretty clear they'll do a Conro desktop.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Yes.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   They have to.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Yep.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   Everybody else has done one.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   They're going to have the chips, uh, not in great supply, but they'll have them.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Will they do it?
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   Here's the question.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Will they do it four way?
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   What do you think, uh, will, uh, you were the one who's singing the praises of a four way?
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Uh, only, only if they decide to introduce the Mac Pro.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   I mean, the Mac Pro, I guess.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   You know, they maybe do it.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   I'd love to see a four chip.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   Oh, two.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Four chip.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   I thought you meant four way.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   I would be sure they were going to do that.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   They'll, but eight would be effectively.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Yeah, but it's not, it's not going to involve a computer.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   What will involve?
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Oh, bro.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   I'm slow.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   I haven't been reading the Durs.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   I have to.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   So, hey, you know, just to change the subject.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   No, no, yeah.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   We haven't defeated all the rumors.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Oh, please.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   Come on.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   There's got to be something good.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   Did you see the news section of the show?
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   No, no, no.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Did you see the picture, um, taken through the window of the conference?
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Yes.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   All the new icons, is that what you're talking about?
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Oh, stop the presses.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Stop the presses.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   New icons.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   No, no, no, no.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   It's exciting.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   What is this one though?
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   It says Mac OS 10 leopard introducing.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   Vista 2.0.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   Vista 2.0.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   Is that their selling point?
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Oh, I guess it is.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   I get it.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   All right.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   It's a little bit better than Vista.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Oh boy.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   That's something that Brian about.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Better face trade.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   All right.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   There's nothing to say in other words.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   Nothing to see here.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   Move on.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   Hey, I got the story that's been overlooked by everybody.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   Good.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   This is the 15th last Tuesday and nobody covered it.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   The World Wide Web.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   What happened?
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   It didn't get it.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   We got very little play.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   It turns 15 on August 6th.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   That's the day that the links to the computer code for the World Wide Web were put on alt.hypertext.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   So that others could download it and play with it.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   So in a way, this is the day the World Wide Web was going on.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   Today.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   It's on a Tuesday on August 6th in 1991.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   The memo is the original memo is floating around the net.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   That's the nice thing about the newsgroups.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   You could see Linus Torvald's first Linux posting.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   You could see the first posting of the World Wide Web.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   I think that's kind of cool.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   So what?
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   What do you want to have a cake?
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   What should we do?
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   And Kevin's buying.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   Let's dance.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   60 million dollar cake.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Robertson's Lucky's.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   I'll make it happen.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   I think it's worth certainly nodding a hat.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   15 years.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   It's not very long, is it?
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   It seems bizarre to have existed at an age without the internet, doesn't it?
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Because it's just so pervasive.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Well, you're 23, right?
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   You're the youngest on the planet.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   Right.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   So you were eight years old when this happened.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   So I, on the other hand, was 35, 30, so, I mean.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   I just remember like getting to 13 and suddenly desperately clamoring web parents to try and get a 28K modem.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   I was like, please get me on the internet, please.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Kevin, you were 15.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   Do you remember the first time you saw, it was probably links or something.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   I remember seeing the web on links was the first time I saw it, I think.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   Yes.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   Mine was all through kind of bulletin boards.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   I started off with an email that was tossers through BBS's.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   You know, so I really didn't have access to the true like World Wide Web at that point.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   I remember being on the well, which was essentially a BBS, but you could drop into shell, a shell
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   account on the well, and then you could run links.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   And this must have been right, you know, 1990, 1991, must have been fairly early.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   And I just, I remember kind of the overwhelming feeling that there's a lot of, that the world is a big place.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   There's a lot of people out there on the internet.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   It was kind of an interesting experience.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   And of course, there weren't very many relatively at the time.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   I had just dropped out of the university to be a CD-ROM programmer for Bob Stein in New York just around, you know, three months before that I'll melt it down.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   And so I found myself without anything to do.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   And so I decided that I would see if any ad agencies wanted to pay me to develop a gopher site for them.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   And actually, you could talk to an ad agency into it.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   And halfway through the project, I walked in and said, "You've got to see Mosaic.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   It kicks out.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   There's going to be hundreds of websites and they want to look at it."
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   Hundreds!
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   And we did.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Wow.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   That's cool.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   And there were hundreds.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   And you were right.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Two minutes.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   It is, it is pretty.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   I do remember the first time I saw Mosaic.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   Because that, I mean, going from links to Mosaic was probably an equal jump where you have a graphical browser all of a sudden.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   Then it made sense.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   Then it really made sense.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   And I remember the first time I saw an animated GIF.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   But that's another, that's a story for another date GIF.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   What was the first thing you had a point on?
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   Was it a GIF or a GIF or a GIF?
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   Oh, it's a GIF, I think, isn't it?
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   It's a GIF, I think I should say GIF.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   Somebody sent me the link to the page with a guy who invented it.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   Is a little bit testy about the whole thing and says,
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   It's like the famous, but my name is Nina Torvald.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   Then I pronounce Nina Torvald.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   I don't think, I think probably people who install SUSA these days don't hear that anymore.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   That's a shame.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   That used to be the sound test when you got your sound card working.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   You'd hear Linus say that.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   I love that.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   Actually, people are getting Linux pre-installed for the first time ever.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   Lenovo is putting SUSA on ThinkPads.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   I think that's pretty exciting.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Even as we speak, I'm installing Ubuntu on ThinkPads that finally arrived from Lenovo
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   after several, well, more than two months.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   But it had Windows on it though when you got it, no doubt.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   I pulled the hard drive out.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   I bought the cheapest small hard drive to have and then bought a third party drive.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   You didn't even look.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   I didn't even look now.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   I mean, it's on itself here.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   I'm probably going to use it to put MP3s on it.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   Isn't that funny?
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   So are you, you've gone to Linux now.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   You've kind of abandoned Mac for Linux?
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   Well, no, like I said, I'm presently while we're on the phone just clicking a bunch of
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   OK's as I'm installing like it was yesterday that the last part of this machine arrived
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   from Lenovo.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   I went through Lenovo hell getting this machine.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   So so far, Advantage Apple in terms of the experience of actually getting the
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   hardware shipped to Lenovo is pathetic.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   But I do remember reading about you and others saying maybe it's time to abandon this
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   closed source, you know, proprietary thing called OS 10 and move to Linux.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   How are you feeling about that?
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   Well, so for me, there were a bunch of things that drove that.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   I mean, the mailer switching to individual files that were no longer inbox files,
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   but I couldn't extract.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   I mean, the number of successful migrations I've had of my mail over the years is very
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   large, but it's when it goes into those proprietary chunks, then you leave stuff.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   I mean, lots of hundred thousand mails moving away from Entourage at one point and
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   four never again inbox files for me forever.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   And, you know, I've got a couple million pieces of archive email and I'm just scared
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   that I'm never going to get it out.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   And I've got aperture in my arm like a junkie and I want to get out of there.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   I want to get my photo metadata out before my photo collection gets so big that I'll
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   be stuck there forever.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   But it's a big one for me and it's kind of a theoretical risk, but it was getting time
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   for me to buy a new computer.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   And I was looking at the new MacBooks, which looked pretty fast, but they're the only
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   implementers of trusted computing in the world who aren't members of the
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   trusted computing group.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   And members of the trusted computing group actually have to tell you what they're
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   doing with the trusted computing chip.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   It's part of their agreement.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   This is the TPM chip that Intel --
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   TPM chip.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   And everyone assumes, and I think they're right, that all Apple is going to do with it,
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   so try to lock the OS to the hardware.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   But if you don't know what they've done with it, then you don't know what a bad
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   guy might potentially do with it.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   This is interesting.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   I didn't know they're going to implement TPM, but they're not members of the group.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   And they're not members of the group.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   And then on there was the grid, and they haven't told anyone what they've done.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   So there's no oversight at all?
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Yeah, and there's no disclosure.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   And I just feel like, you know, that's a -- you know, the old -- like, if there's a gun on
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   the mantel piece in Act I, it's going to go off by Act III.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   I think once you start designing computers so that they take orders from people other
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   than their owners, you know, there's a -- there's a gun on the mantel that's just
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   waiting to take off.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   So I mean, you know, people talk about, oh, we'll make the computer more secure, we'll
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   make -- we'll enhance your privacy, and then they design it in such a way so that a remote
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   party can control it even against your wishes.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   That's crazy.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   So there is TPM on your Lenovo, but of course Ubuntu doesn't not --
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Not a tension.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   Not a driver.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   So I could have bought a new MacBook and paid the $1000 Steve Jobs tax and installed Ubuntu
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   on it.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   And I'm going to do that with my old -- I've got a couple of 167 G4 power books here.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   I buy machines in Paris because I can't really have any downtime and I just keep them in
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   there.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   And when one goes into the shop, I just switch to the other one.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   So I've got a couple of these here, and I'm going to keep one running Mac OS just for
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   whatever it is I can't get out of it.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   And then the other one I'm going to -- I'm going to get it running Ubuntu.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   You know, you know, I find there's something interesting about this conversation.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   One somehow Leo switched back to talking about the Macintosh again, but no, no, not at all.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   And so wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   Secondly, secondly is the comic that Corey just made that when one's in the shop, I have
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   never had a computer go in the shop.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   And you're talking to Macintosh going into the shop?
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   You don't know Corey.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   I've seen his power books with the curved like a U.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Yeah, I had a machine with an 18 degree band in it.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   You don't understand, John.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   I'm like, what are you wearing?
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   The lead gloves when you type?
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   I mean, or this thing just -- I am a cloth.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   You know, I'm not as bad.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   Like Charlie Strath is pretty hard on the hardware.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   The scientific generator in Scotland here.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   I've actually seen him take a new machine and strip all the paint off the keys that label
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   the keys in three months of typing.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   Wow.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   But I'm still pretty hard on my machines.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   And I'm a big cloth and I throw them and I carry them everywhere.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   He must write really thick books.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   He does.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   He writes them fast, too.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   He wants for a hundred thousand word book in ten days.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   Dounding them.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   Wow.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   Oh, ten thousand words a day for ten days in a row.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   That's pretty good.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   That's the max you can do.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   I've talked to a lot of writers about their speeds and what they can do all the time.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   You can't think faster than that.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   The damned are novel, too.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Is it?
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Man, I can't imagine that.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   How many words a day do you think you do, John?
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   About 700.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   How about you, Corey?
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   It depends on whether you count blogging, but on novels.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Not counting blogging.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   I mean, I think that's counting blogging.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   I just wrote a hundred thousand word novel eight weeks from the day I thought of it to
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   the day I finished it.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   Holy cow.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Yeah, well, novel writers have to crank out a lot more than essay writers and it's a different
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   kind of business.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   It's a different kind of writing, but still that's a lot of words.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   That's amazing.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   It was a...
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   How was the death mark?
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   So, Corey, can you do ten thousand words a day?
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   Yeah, there were a couple of ten thousand word days in there.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   It was a real death march.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   There were a couple of... on my anniversary in Rome, I was getting up at five in the morning
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   to work on this book.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   It took hold of me and I just couldn't stop working on it.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   It was a thing you enjoyed it.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   It was a death march, but you were... you were... you were enjoying it, right?
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   I don't know if I enjoyed it as the word.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   I couldn't stop writing it.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   Wow, that's an interesting experience.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   You know, I've tried to do ten thousand words.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   The most I've ever done was about six, and it's like very difficult to go on beyond that.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   It's just hard to do.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   I mean, it's just like why?
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   But people crank out ten.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   And I know a lot of writers who can do ten.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   It's like a holy grail of high production writing.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   High speed writing.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   Kevin, how many words a day do you write?
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   None.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   None.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Emails.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   I get through a couple hundred emails a day.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   If you count email, that could actually add up.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   None of that counts.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   I think with blocking, I'm writing like seven hundred thousand words in a year.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   Jeez.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   Which is pretty wild.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   I mean, that's like Elle Ron Hubbard, great.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   Is that mostly Boing Boing, or is it a craphound too?
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   Mostly Boing Boing.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   You make it sort of religion next.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Not that hard.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   Whoopiologists.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   You may not get Tom Cruise, but you could have Tom Cruise's doughy or younger brother.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   That's right.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   I'll do it up.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   We needed a cycle to throw to the feds when they get onto us.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   Blame it all on him.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   It's his fault.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.240]   Actually, I think the first convert would have to be Kevin Rose because he's the one with
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.240]   all the money.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.240]   That's right.
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:55.240]   Who's going to buy your gold Rolls-Royces?
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:34:00.400]   How do you feel about being chained to a volcano by a galactic tyrant named Zenu, and then
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:04.000]   turned into an energy being by nuclear bomb?
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   I'm in.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   We'll make a special place for him.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.400]   So, is it a big deal that I'm sorry, not IBM.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.920]   Lenovo is shipping.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:19.320]   I think this is the first time anybody like Lenovo has actually shipped think pads or
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.920]   laptops with SUSE pre-installed.
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:21.920]   Right?
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.920]   I mean, that's unusual.
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:24.920]   Not a big deal.
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:25.920]   Sure.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:26.920]   Sure.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.920]   It's not like they're pushing that on the consumer.
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:29.920]   I don't know.
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:30.920]   Yeah.
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:34.400]   And the people buying Lenovo are like businesses and businesses just want windows to integrate
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.400]   with their windows.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.400]   They're not going to buy it.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.320]   And anybody that really wants SUSE will just put it on whatever they own themselves.
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.320]   I agree.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:44.720]   I literally have installed Ubuntu while on this phone call and I tell you it was...
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:45.720]   Is this smooth?
[00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:46.720]   It was something through a goose.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:47.920]   Ubuntu's nice.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:51.600]   I mean, there's like a huge mental leap to get over to like, "I'm going to buy a machine
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:56.600]   and I can install this, you know, weird hacker OS on it that was developed by a large community
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.840]   and not by a company."
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:01.520]   But the actual experience of sticking the city in the drive, turning it on and clicking
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.200]   install is so easy.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.240]   I mean, so easy.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:08.120]   And everything just worked.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:12.120]   I mean, I'm like running like nobody's business.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.520]   No drive issues with Wi-Fi or anything like that?
[00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.520]   Nothing.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.520]   Interesting.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:19.520]   You know, there's a company that will sell you, I forget what they're called, but they'll
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.920]   sell you machines with Linux installed.
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:26.880]   And I almost boxed and then they charge like an extra 800 bucks.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:30.240]   And I spoke to a couple of friends actually, Chris DeBona, who convinced me that I didn't
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.840]   need to do it, but it was just the dead easy.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:37.440]   All I need to do is basically turn it on, stick the CD in and everything else.
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.360]   And it's gravy.
[00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.480]   Probably harder when you've got a machine that you want to actually keep some other
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.960]   last on.
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:44.960]   You know what?
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.520]   You're putting it on a Mac, right?
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:47.840]   No, no, no, no.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.320]   Oh, it was a no-one thing.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:54.280]   Hey, by the way, just to make sure people don't think I'm just a Mac basher, but I
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.280]   there is one Mac store I guess we should bring up.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.800]   The MacBook Explode Store, I think that's what's priceless.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:03.880]   Well, it's only fair because we talked about the Dell Exploding and now it's actually an
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.200]   old power book, not the newer ones.
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:09.800]   But there was a recall, battery recall, I sent in my power book battery and got a new one.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.840]   In fact, I think there's a recall now on the MacBook Pro batteries as well.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:16.800]   These lithium-ion batteries, they can be scary.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.360]   Did you see the picture with a hole burned in the aluminum?
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:23.440]   You know, I think the manufacturers, this is what happens when we get all these machines
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:27.600]   coming in from some of the, there may be some sketchy battery makers in China.
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:28.600]   I'm convinced of it.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:32.320]   And that's, I think we're just getting some, because it never happened before we, before
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.880]   China took over manufacturing all these machines and all these Chinese.
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:36.880]   It is.
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.200]   They're ruining for us.
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:43.600]   Well, did you see the Apple Knowledge Base article about my laptop produces too much
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:44.600]   heat?
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.600]   No, what did it say?
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:49.320]   It was, because it's been all sorts of complaints that the MacBook's too hot and you know, the
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.600]   worries that they might explode.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:54.680]   And, and Apple's got an article up on the Knowledge Base that says, my laptops do hot,
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:55.680]   watched I do.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:00.600]   And they basically say, the problem of having too much heat from laptops is not exclusive
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:01.600]   to Apple.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:04.080]   We recommend you use your laptop on a desk.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.080]   It's a desktop.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:09.280]   And it's like, yeah, yeah, thanks for that.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:14.000]   Well, the scary thing about this, these explosions though is that when they're happening, I mean,
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   they're not plugged in.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   They're not plugged in.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.960]   And it's just overnight, these people are, at least this guy here, he fell asleep and
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.760]   all of a sudden the apartment's filled with smoke.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:25.360]   It scares me because it wasn't even plugged in as I remember.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.760]   So I mean, there's no predicting.
[00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:31.800]   And I mean, I, I'm hesitant now to leave laptops lying around in my office or at home.
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:36.080]   I put them all out in the front step if anybody wants to come by and pick them up.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.760]   I have stone front steps.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:43.440]   The United States has ratified the cyber crime treaty.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.520]   It's actually, we got core, we should get you to comment on it because it's a European
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:48.520]   thing.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:53.640]   It's the international treaty seeking to address internet crimes by harmonizing national laws.
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:57.280]   Originally, a convention signed by 38 European nations.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:02.720]   Now the US is a signatory as well as Canada, Japan and South Africa.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:07.200]   Treaty approved, actually US has been a signatory treaty has been ratified now by the Senate.
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:11.200]   Is it, is it, I don't know anything about the treaty, Corey, is it anything to be concerned
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.200]   about?
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:15.320]   You know, I don't know much about it either because I've been in the middle of moving to
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:20.400]   Los Angeles, but I got email from Daniel Bryan who kind of got some of my duties at
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.400]   EFF right now.
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:23.040]   And he was not happy about this.
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.760]   He was pretty worried.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.960]   But I don't know much about it.
[00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.520]   This is what they say.
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.480]   When I hear this sentence, I always get scared.
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:33.640]   This treaty provides important tools in the battle against terrorism.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:38.920]   Yeah, in other words, they're going to put some spyware in so they can stop people from
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:39.920]   pirating songs.
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:40.920]   So the RIA gets that.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:41.920]   It's all for the RIA.
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:42.920]   Come on, let's face it.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:43.920]   That's usually white though.
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.760]   That's not usually this thing.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:50.720]   This also is protecting against attacks on computer networks and the sexual exploitation
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.440]   of children over the internet.
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.760]   So Daniel, go ahead, John.
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:56.680]   I'm just going to say then you're right.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.840]   It's probably not about stealing music.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:02.520]   It's just about spying on people so they can make sure that they vote Republican when
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.160]   the next election comes around.
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.400]   I don't think the problem that there was.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.400]   Did I say that?
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.880]   I was just joking.
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:17.000]   According to the EFF, this is a quote I think, the treaty requires that the US government
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.720]   help enforce other countries' cyber crime laws even if the act being prosecuted is not
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:22.960]   illegal in the United States.
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.400]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:28.320]   The countries that have laws limited free speech on the internet could oblige the FBI
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:30.520]   to uncover the identities of anonymous critics.
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.520]   I think John was actually right.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:36.960]   This is targeted against all of MP3 because of course they get away with it because it's
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.160]   legal in Russian law.
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:41.320]   Now they would, if Russia becomes a signatory, they're required to enforce.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:46.080]   Well, if Russia became a signatory and they ratified it and you could get their police
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:48.800]   to enforce it, this is actually I think more in the other direction.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.240]   This is like about us.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:54.040]   You posted something that was critical of Singaporean government and that's illegal
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:57.360]   in Singapore and they want to prosecute you in the United States for it.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:59.200]   Well, I'll give you a good example.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:04.060]   There's a big Bruhaha in Canada over hate sites, anti-Semitic sites, which of course
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:06.160]   are protected in the US under free speech.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:10.320]   In fact, the Seaman-Simon Wieseltthallth Center in Los Angeles has said it's a problem because
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:14.360]   these guys, this is kind of the opposite what you usually hear, they just offshore into the
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:18.640]   United States where it's legal and we can't go after them.
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.200]   So that's a good example.
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.240]   But there's plenty of examples of people who tried to pull that stun.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:27.600]   And if they ever tried traveling, like if you go to the EU and you broke some law, you
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:32.280]   know, like the Nazi stuff that goes on because you posted it here.
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.800]   There's guys that have been arrested like in the Netherlands.
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:41.840]   Well, we arrested the British betting baron, bet on sports.
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.680]   He set foot bad travel agent, by the way.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:48.040]   He was on his way to Costa Rica and they booked him through Texas.
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:49.040]   Big mistake.
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.040]   I wonder whose idea that's on.
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.600]   That's a bad travel agent.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.700]   Oh, don't worry, we've got a great flight for you.
[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:56.120]   You just have to stop in Dallas for a little bit.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.960]   And then it's on to Costa Rica and all the fun and games.
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.200]   That's not a rageous British accident.
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.200]   It's terrible.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.200]   I know.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:06.320]   I'm not the Australian guy who wrestled the alligators.
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:09.400]   It was cried he was doing my crocodile then the I'm so sorry.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.400]   I'm so sorry.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:14.800]   So our technique has said that this is the worst internet law ever.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.680]   That's what Danny called it on the EFF.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:18.680]   That's right.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:22.080]   I sent out that message about it.
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.480]   I guarantee there's going to be worse.
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.280]   So this is the way things go.
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:28.560]   There's one thing that concerns me when you talk about this kind of thing.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:32.480]   You know in Canada because I used to write for a number of Canadian publications and
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.160]   I got the lecture about this.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:38.560]   And I'm always worried about if I go to Canada after having called like somebody at Intel
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:42.000]   a monopolist because it's against the water cost somebody a monopolist in Canada.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   So they can see you in Canada.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   I have to be very careful now.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.160]   I spend a lot of time in Canada.
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:47.600]   I should probably study up.
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:51.480]   As a Canadian I should point out that it's not against a lot of calls on a monopolist.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:54.720]   It's against a lot of idols someone and so if they're not a monopolist and you call
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:59.200]   them monopolist then they might be able to get a judgment against you.
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:04.320]   The problem is that where you have classes of speech that are unlawful like that isn't
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.760]   necessarily that you will get found guilty.
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:09.760]   It's that you might find yourself at the other end of a frivolous lawsuit.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:13.160]   That you get litigious people who use the threat of the law.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:16.560]   So in the US where it's relatively hard to actually get a judgment against someone for
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:18.000]   libel because of the First Amendment.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   I mean libel is illegal here too but the First Amendment can be held up as a defense against
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   it.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.720]   It's way less chilling for someone to write to you and say ah you libel me and I'll see
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:32.200]   you in court because you know that it's unlikely for example that an attorney is going to take
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:35.280]   it on on a contingency day.
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.560]   Well we have slap laws and so forth that will protect you.
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:43.240]   Yeah there's some shield laws in the United States as well but are in Canada as well.
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:47.440]   But it's more like attorneys won't do it on a contingency basis because it's way less
[00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.440]   of a slam dunk.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:53.080]   So you're not as likely to find someone who will just go out and do the suing for free.
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:58.000]   So unless you piss off a really rich Yahoo you know they're not going to find an attorney
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.200]   who's going to hound you until you pay them enough money to make them go away.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:06.800]   I do think that the key to this and the reason the EFF calls it such a bad law is that we're
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:13.480]   required now to enforce bad net laws in the US and vice versa.
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.800]   Who has the worst net laws though?
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.920]   Is it us or some other guys?
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:23.400]   Oh it would be China or another country like China but China's got some pretty bad internet
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.400]   laws.
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.720]   So I don't know are they a signatory?
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:27.720]   I don't know.
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:28.720]   I don't think they are.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:29.720]   No it's mostly European countries.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:34.600]   I mean for example one might be in Germany where it's completely legal to sell or talk
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:39.520]   about anything relating to Nazis basically and of course in the US you could say that
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:45.040]   fairly freely but the Germans have prosecuted Yahoo in Germany forcing them not to sell it.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.160]   Now they can prosecute Yahoo in America.
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:51.720]   It seems contrary to the whole notion of a global internet frankly.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:55.240]   Ultimately that's I think the biggest problem with this is that it encourages people to
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:44:00.280]   balkanize the internet even further and for there to be a German internet and a British
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:04.720]   internet and an American internet and an American government internet and American public school
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:09.760]   internet and an American library, federally funded library internet and for all these
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:13.640]   internet to be different and for them not to be writeable to one another.
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:18.160]   And you know it's part of a trend that includes things like the network neutrality fight and
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:24.040]   also fight the reliability for ISP for you've got ISP's are being encouraged to block certain
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:28.000]   ports or protocols where you know we started talking about the 15th anniversary of the
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.320]   web that depended on it being possible for a guy to just in his office invent a protocol
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:38.240]   and a client and a server for it and send it around to people all over the world and
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.960]   for that to just work without needing permission from anyone in the middle of the network.
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:46.640]   No one had to go to a system and say open port 84 being pleased or a government and say
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:50.040]   you know the web is good and will never be used for evil I promise therefore you should
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.720]   allow us to have it.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.200]   I agree 100 percent.
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:57.000]   No that's depressing us let's go on to another topic.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.840]   Oh if you want to get depressed a little bit more it was the fence threatening to sue the
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:06.920]   what is it what you call it the county of Maine if it probes for rhymes and then the
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:07.920]   NSA.
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.120]   Oh really the state the state of Maine.
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:12.160]   Which is along the same lines really.
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:19.320]   RIA and court suing LimeWire saying they want damages of $150,000 per illegally traded file
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:22.720]   which I think is more money than there is in the actual world.
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:23.720]   Yep.
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:28.600]   I don't know if they'll get that maybe they'll get a small percentage.
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:32.720]   The intention there is I think just to scare the hell out of anyone who ever thinks about
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:36.280]   investing in a technology that might upset someone's apple cart.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:42.600]   Now Kazan settled just last week or a week a couple weeks ago for $115 million and seems
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:45.080]   to have gotten off the hook with a lot cheaper than that.
[00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:48.520]   Well Kazan is over with though they said that they're introducing new filtering technology
[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:51.400]   and they're basically going completely legit now.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:53.440]   That's a killed Napster right they couldn't do that.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.960]   They couldn't figure out how to do that.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:56.960]   So that's interesting.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.440]   What will happen to Kazan if they filter out all copyright violations?
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.160]   Well just a little easy.
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:06.000]   They'll have FIAB of 30,000 users that buy songs and that'll be the end of it.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   Right.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.560]   Because people don't know how to install any other software.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:11.960]   They can do that because they have Skype.
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:15.280]   They don't really need Kazan anymore.
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:18.720]   I think one of the big worries about the Kazan settlement is that no one really knows
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:22.200]   whether or not their settlement includes indemnity for their users.
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:26.720]   So it may in fact be that while Kazan has gotten itself off the hook, if customers are
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:27.920]   still potentially on the hook.
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:29.640]   Do you think they turned over their logs?
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:32.520]   Well even if they haven't turned over their logs, do you think that in a settlement like
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:36.480]   that where they're settling for all the bad deeds, you know, that they're stipulating
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:40.040]   to and settling for all the bad deeds that they would say and we're going to, we want
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:42.360]   you to shield our customers too.
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:45.640]   You know the people who we advise to download and use this software.
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:48.240]   Interesting.
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.880]   So what do you think will happen with LimeWire?
[00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:50.880]   Well they settle.
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.480]   They don't have the deep pockets certainly that Kazan has.
[00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:55.720]   Yeah, they're just fold.
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:56.720]   Sounds like they'll fold.
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.080]   How do you fight something like that?
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.080]   Is fold.
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.080]   Yeah.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:01.080]   Walk.
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:02.080]   Walk away.
[00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:03.080]   Judgment proof it's called.
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:04.080]   Yes, please.
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:06.960]   You guys see that segue FCC approved a Bluetooth transmitter for segue?
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.960]   Yeah, what do you think they're up to?
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:09.960]   I don't know.
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:13.840]   People are thinking that it has might have something to do with allowing segue ways to
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.480]   communicate with each other so they can kind of travel in formation.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:17.480]   That's a scary thought.
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:21.040]   I think it's so they can have them recalled.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.960]   They're just not a big signal.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:26.160]   Make them all drive back to New Hampshire wherever they belong.
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:32.000]   I could see swarming segues and beautiful formations all coordinated by Bluetooth.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.840]   Just get them out of here.
[00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.000]   What could they be?
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.360]   What could, yeah, I saw that.
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:38.520]   Attack of the segues.
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:39.520]   What could they be doing?
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:41.000]   His Bluetooth only goes 30 feet.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.360]   I mean it's not a long range.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:45.280]   And so does the segue.
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:47.080]   In between charges?
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.080]   All right.
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:49.400]   I thought that was interesting.
[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:50.400]   No, that's OK.
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.400]   You don't like segues.
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.400]   You don't have to like them.
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:56.600]   Kevin, when you get your 60 million, will you buy a segues?
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:59.920]   You know, segues, the problem with them besides the price being--
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:00.920]   They're so expensive.
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:02.360]   --besides them to be so expensive.
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:04.120]   I think Steve Jobs hit it around the head.
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:07.760]   If you ever saw his kind of notes from the meeting that he had when he went to see the
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:12.360]   segues pitch, he said they're just-- you look dorky riding around on it.
[00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:16.680]   You're kind of just standing up and it's just-- it's not as cool as it-- I don't know.
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:18.880]   I can't see a whole lot of people just really go out and--
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:19.880]   It's really true.
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:20.880]   --and these even if they're cheap.
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:23.640]   You see somebody on one-- first of all, they're tall.
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:25.200]   And they just kind of ungainly.
[00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.680]   They look like you're--
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:29.480]   You know, I had-- you know, that's a comment I always made too.
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:34.040]   And I-- but I'm going to defend the other side for just a quick second, where I think
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:37.960]   it actually works to be in that kind of tall dorky look.
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:39.720]   I've noticed this in Chicago at the--
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:40.880]   Well nobody mugs you.
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:45.280]   In Chicago, one of the main parks that the security all around that thing--
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:48.760]   There's a big-- kind of a grandstand kind of thing there.
[00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:52.440]   And all the security guys are on segues and they got the-- and they're kind of formidable.
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:55.400]   You know, they come driving up to you and they stop right in front of you.
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:56.400]   Helps that one--
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.400]   --and it's gone in a uniform.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.400]   That might help.
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.120]   That makes it a little less dorky.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.120]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:03.400]   Well that's why they use mounted cops and protests.
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.840]   They're very effective on a big horse.
[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:10.560]   The worst is tourists in old European cities like Florence on segues.
[00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:11.560]   Do they do that?
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:13.280]   So dorky, I would be happy.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:16.600]   They have segues tourists up here in San Francisco and they're very-- they're expensive but they're
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:17.600]   very popular.
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:18.600]   But I would--
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:19.600]   They're dangerous though.
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:22.000]   I've had a couple friends that seriously just, you know, you get on there and they give
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   you like a 10 minute instruction.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   They're giving you enough training.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.560]   And then you kill yourself pretty much.
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:28.560]   I mean--
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:29.560]   Maybe the Bluetooth will help.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.680]   AOL, this is an interesting business strategy.
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:38.080]   Stop charging for broadband customers, give away 5 gigabytes of storage and then fire
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.440]   one quarter of your workforce.
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:42.800]   All in the same few days.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.120]   5,000 people will be laid off.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:48.120]   You know, at least they got rid of their retention department.
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:51.240]   They really, after that famous call?
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:53.360]   Consumerists had a good at its relevance as they've actually did.
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:54.360]   They got rid of the whole thing.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:59.840]   And actually, Consumerists had some good posts this week as people who are now no longer
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:04.360]   fearful of getting fired are posting some good dish about how that--
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:05.360]   Oh interesting.
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:09.800]   --the guy who used to walk in and say, you know, if you don't retain 10 people today,
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:10.800]   you're fired.
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:11.800]   You ever been on a bread line?
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:12.800]   Oh my god.
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:13.800]   Oh my god.
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:16.800]   Oh, you get me a picture of Spider-Man by 7 o'clock.
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.400]   You're fired.
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.800]   This is why they had to do this though.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:28.000]   I mean, they dropped 30% of their business, their membership in the last couple of years.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.720]   They want to go advertising based, absolutely free.
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:31.720]   Will it save AOL?
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:34.040]   AOL doesn't need saving.
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:35.040]   I think it does.
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.040]   You don't think it needs saving?
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:39.880]   Yeah, you had-- I remember years and years ago, when we both did the site, we got into
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:44.800]   a debate about AOL back then, and you were an AOL basher, and that was before the stock
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:45.800]   ran up.
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.560]   It would have been a multi-millionaire if you put your money in it.
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:50.600]   Oh, I never claimed to be smart.
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:53.400]   Historically, you have just been an AOL basher.
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:54.640]   I've noticed this.
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:56.400]   And I can document it now.
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:59.360]   What do they do with the garden?
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.360]   Is the garden going away?
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:01.360]   Or is there something--
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:02.360]   No, that's the idea.
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.000]   The walled garden is gone, right?
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   They're going to let--
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.280]   So there's no more AOL software.
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:08.280]   You install this.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.280]   You have AOL 12.0 or whatever.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:11.280]   I think that's--
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.200]   I think that's their plan.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.200]   But it's hard to say.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:18.560]   I mean, they obviously will have to maintain that for their dial-up customers.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:21.800]   I heard that they were just going to turn it into a bunch of news stories that AOL users
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:26.200]   could vote on by AOLing them up or AOLing them down, and then they're going to hire
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:28.640]   all the best people from that Netscape page.
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:31.560]   They're going to pay them money?
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:32.960]   Wouldn't that be fair?
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.440]   That's awesome.
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:38.680]   Everyone likes that idea.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:43.280]   There's only one idea, and everybody just keeps reusing it over and over again.
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:48.360]   That's monetizing the search and deconflection points on the global data network, baby.
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.360]   Wait a minute.
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:50.360]   Let me write that down.
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:51.360]   I'm going to use--
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.360]   I'm going to put blog that one.
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:54.360]   That's brilliant.
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:55.360]   Brilliant.
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:56.840]   Hey, I have a website I'd like to recommend to you.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:57.840]   What would that be, John?
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:00.440]   Have you seen goggles?
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:01.440]   No.
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.440]   The Google Map Flight Simulator there.
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:04.440]   Yeah, I didn't see that.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:08.400]   Yeah, you fly around a little biplane in New York or Tokyo or Washington, and you get
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:10.040]   to strafe the place.
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:11.040]   I love it.
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:14.520]   So you get to blow and you get to bomb London.
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:19.680]   So anyway, if anyone out there wants to check it out, it's i-s-o-m-a-m-a-dot-net/games.
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:25.720]   I'm starting to think the single most brilliant thing Google did is ever is this giving out
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:27.600]   this API for the Google Maps.
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:29.000]   Yeah, it's genius.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.960]   They've got more mileage out of that than practically anything else they've done.
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:34.760]   Anyway, I have a link to it on the blog for anyone looking for it, and you probably will,
[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:35.760]   too.
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:36.760]   Goggles.
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:37.760]   So did you guys see WorkSafe?
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:40.000]   If we're talking about interesting links this week.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.440]   No, tell us about that.
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:43.440]   WorkSafe is a proxy that--
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:47.560]   So it disguises whatever website you're looking at because it's a proxy and gets around your
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:49.720]   networks, stupid firewall.
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:52.080]   And then the other thing that it does is it reformats everything.
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.080]   It's great for reformats.
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:56.120]   It looks like you're working on a Word file.
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:57.120]   What's the--
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:58.120]   Brilliant.
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:59.120]   Sorry.
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:00.120]   What's the URL?
[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:01.120]   It's called--
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:02.120]   I think WorkSafe.com.
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:03.120]   Well, WorkSafe is unbelievable.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:04.120]   It's how cool it is.
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:05.120]   Workfriendly.net.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:06.120]   Workfriendly.net.
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.120]   And we're all going to--
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.120]   The toolbar is replaced and it actually has the word toolbar.
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.120]   So it's like the bold and the italicized.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:10.120]   It's amazing about it.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.120]   Is this done through Ajax?
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:12.120]   Is that how they're doing?
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:13.120]   Oh, look at that.
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:14.120]   Wow.
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:15.120]   I think it's a great thing.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:18.120]   I think they just pull the page and then rewrite it.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:30.120]   And then the other thing that I thought was cool this week was Dan Kaminski's network
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:34.560]   neutrality test that came out of Black Hat.
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:35.560]   How do you do that?
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:40.120]   Well, he's just-- he's got this thing he calls TCP based active probing for full.
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:44.120]   Dan's got a lot of signal virtues, but coming up with catchy names for his followers.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.120]   Not one of them, yeah.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:52.360]   But basically he's got a thing that he says that a lot of people ran it and pointed a
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:54.280]   lot of different hosts.
[00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:58.120]   We would get a pretty good picture of which ISPs were throttling which hosts.
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:53:59.120]   Absolutely.
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:00.120]   And that's great.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:04.360]   I mean, we need that whether or not you think network neutrality should or shouldn't happen
[00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:07.760]   or regulation should or shouldn't be there.
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:11.400]   I think people do have the right to know how the internet's performing and how their ISD
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:16.120]   performs with the internet and whether there's any jiggery, pokery going on there.
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:17.120]   And this is a great idea.
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:18.120]   I think this is awesome.
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:19.120]   Has he put that client--
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:20.120]   What's the name of the end?
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:22.120]   Yeah, URL.
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:23.120]   It was--
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:24.120]   You know--
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:25.120]   It may not have put the client up yet.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:26.120]   I mean, interesting.
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:30.920]   Last-- or no, it was on computer world.
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:31.920]   They did something similar--
[00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:32.920]   You did not talk--
[00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:38.200]   They did something similar with testing to see if ISPs would allow address spoofing.
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:39.200]   And we're collecting data.
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:40.200]   Who was it?
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:41.200]   It was NYU or somebody.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.200]   We're collecting data.
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:43.200]   Cornell.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.200]   I think it's a good way to do it.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:45.840]   Have the internet test it.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:48.120]   You get enough members, enough people out there testing.
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:50.600]   You know, you have a very good map of what's going on on the internet.
[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:52.520]   I mean, that tells you a lot of stuff.
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:53.760]   Well, back on the line.
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:54.760]   Yeah.
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:56.760]   So, Will, I don't know if you know about this.
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:01.960]   If you have a BTDFL line, there's some Chinese host that you can't reach from--
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:02.960]   or even a BT resolvent.
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:05.360]   We had like a blue yonder one when we were living in London.
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:09.640]   There are a bunch of Chinese hosts you can't reach from the UK because Sprint is their
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:10.640]   default route.
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:13.920]   And Sprint had a fiber break in the UK like a year ago.
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:16.480]   And they haven't updated their routing cables.
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:18.480]   And no one's fixing this, right?
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:20.720]   So this doesn't just catch network neutrality problems.
[00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:26.000]   It catches the fact that, you know, your ISP is just like lazy and badly managed too.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.720]   We assume that it's just all there and it's all available.
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:30.640]   And it's not always obvious if it's not.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:33.440]   I mean, how would you even discover such a thing?
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:34.440]   You wouldn't.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:36.440]   No, you wouldn't.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:37.440]   Without something like this.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.440]   I'd like to get bundled into like Google toolbar.
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:41.880]   You know, those guys are like hardcore about fighting for network neutrality.
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:42.880]   You bet.
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:47.160]   You know, having millions of hosts or in Alexa too, you know, that's another business
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:49.960]   who's fortune drives and fall on this stuff.
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:50.960]   What's the name again?
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:54.560]   It's Dan Kaminsky's site is Doc's Para.
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:57.440]   I like Para Doc's, Doc Para.com.
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:01.440]   And then this was, I put it on Boeing Line this week, but it was originally a computer
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:02.440]   world.
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:06.760]   If you go to computer world and you search for Kaminsky, K-A-M-I-N-S-K-Y, you know,
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:08.520]   term right up.
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:09.520]   That's great.
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:14.520]   And I hope that he releases this client to people so that we can all use it.
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:15.520]   And I think you're right.
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:16.520]   It's a great idea.
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:20.320]   So let's call Chris to Bono and get him to work on that.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:24.040]   Google should absolutely put this in the toolbar or Alexa or somebody.
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:26.880]   You know, Alexa still doesn't work with Firefox.
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:29.000]   It seems unlikely they're going to do this.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.440]   They don't quite get it.
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:34.520]   George Lucas says the Star Wars parodies can stay on YouTube.
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:37.720]   Oh, and that's a awesome one this week.
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:38.720]   Very funny ones.
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:43.400]   I'd say a classic Vader would sound mind-glimely good.
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:47.680]   So one where he's like talking to the Admiral and his cube just keeps going up and down
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:48.680]   all the time.
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:50.880]   Opening and shutting his client's shell.
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:51.880]   Yeah.
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:54.520]   Oh, I literally rolled on the full laughing.
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:56.440]   Yeah, the Chad Vader was great too.
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:57.440]   Chad Vader.
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:00.360]   You know, I think he's actually got them working for him.
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:04.320]   There's someone who works for him who actually sends us emails whenever something really good
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.440]   happens on him.
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:08.240]   The fan made media stuff.
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:11.080]   Hoping that Boeing, Boeing will look like this.
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:15.160]   I think that, you know, say what you will about those first three movies and there's
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:16.880]   a lot to say about them.
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:19.960]   But they're doing some really smart stuff with their fans.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:24.120]   And then the other thing I hope to mention was this cinema now burned to DVD DRM.
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:25.600]   Yeah, let's talk about that.
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:28.560]   Absolutely, because that seems, people are very critical of this.
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:30.040]   Tell us a little bit about what's happening.
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:34.640]   Well, so they've got this burned to DVD program where this is cinema now that download a
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:39.680]   virtual DVD and then you can burn it to a DVD that supposedly you can't copy.
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:41.800]   And it's using Windows DRM.
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:45.760]   And no one really knew how their DRM works because they hadn't disclosed anything about
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:47.760]   about their burned to DVD specification.
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:54.120]   But an engineer, a very senior optical engineer, emailed me on the condition of anonymity and
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:58:00.320]   gave me a pretty thorough breakdown of how this stuff works, having seen the specification.
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:04.560]   And basically it looks like they introduced these errors that are caused by accumulation
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:07.280]   of something called digital sun value.
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:12.320]   And that this brings the DVD right to the edge of its error correction.
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:15.680]   And that's something that apparently many PCs can't handle.
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:21.000]   But the thing is that some PCs can, and a lot of players can, a lot of standalone set
[00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.960]   top players can't, and that because these discs are right at the edge of their error
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:31.520]   correction limit, if you get even the smallest damage, you know, small scratch or dust, they
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:33.080]   stop playing altogether.
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:38.280]   And because it's so impossible to precision introduce these errors given the wide variety
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:43.960]   of chip sets and equipment and blanks, many of the tests that he did, he tested on like
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:47.160]   five machines and four of them didn't even produce a viable disc.
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:48.600]   So it's pretty crummy.
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:52.520]   He said, "I'm against people being fleeced by this kind of crap.
[00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:56.040]   How can you sell some on content on media that is so heavily compromised, especially in
[00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:59.640]   a format that relies upon its error correction system to maintain playability?"
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:02.040]   He's a very straight late engineer.
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:06.160]   And he just, he just, they designed something that is literally defective.
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:10.880]   You know, you know, the funny thing about this, this is a throwback idea.
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:15.160]   If you, Leo would remember this probably more than the other guys, which is the, back in
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:19.320]   the early 80s, and probably maybe they started in the late 70s, but probably at least in
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:24.240]   the early 80s, there was all these copy protection mechanisms designed to, to keep, you know,
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:29.680]   people from copying floppy discs, and one of them was to burn a hole in the disc, map it,
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:34.480]   see where the hole is, and then it, and then when you put the code on there, if the physical
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:38.520]   defects, yeah, it wasn't a big defect in this thing, then you couldn't, you know, you couldn't
[00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:39.520]   use it.
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:40.520]   It was unbelievable.
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:41.520]   I think they still do that.
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:42.520]   But what is the issue?
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:45.760]   So you're making a disc that's kind of not working so well.
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:46.760]   It's, so what?
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:48.560]   Well, you paid for it, right?
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:52.160]   They sold you something that was supposed to pretty, pretty, a disc you could play in
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:53.160]   it doesn't.
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:54.920]   You can't get a refund if it doesn't play.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:57.040]   Yes, it's not, it's just, it's defective, right?
[00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:01.000]   You produce media, it says you make a DVD that, it's just like a DVD that you play, that
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   you buy at the store.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   Except it's not, of course.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   Except it's not, right?
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.400]   Except it's way less robust at fall apart, and most of the time you're going to waste
[01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:10.960]   your blank media, and you need expensive blank media, it's going to fall apart.
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:14.480]   That, that introducing error strategy, it's funny, I think the first app that did that
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:19.120]   was, was the Dan Bricklin spreadsheet, the first one.
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:20.120]   That's right.
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.120]   You're right.
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.120]   VisiCalc.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.120]   VisiCalc.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.760]   That's a defective floppy, you're absolutely right.
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:30.240]   And I saw a presentation by Franklin and, and Bricklin that the two inventors and founders
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:36.280]   of VisiCalc about how they couldn't get their own data off of their, their, their VisiCalc
[01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:39.800]   program, because they couldn't run VisiCalc in an emulator, because they couldn't mount
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:40.800]   the floppy in an emulator.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:41.800]   Oh, man.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:45.240]   Because they stuck this stuff on a, you know, really hooked by their own guitar.
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:50.120]   And of course now you can download VisiCalc for its 13K and run it on an emulator, and
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:52.120]   it runs great.
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:55.720]   Hey, what, what we're talking about, about DVDs and movies, I don't know if anybody's
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:01:01.860]   aware of this, but you know, the, the archive.org operation has a lot of new feature films
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:04.720]   now that they're, they've put on their, how do they do that?
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:08.240]   Well, they got a lot, but they're all public domain supposedly, but they, but we're talking
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:15.080]   reefer madness and plan nine from, plan nine from outer space and all the flash Gordon
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:16.080]   stuff.
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:17.080]   There's a whole bunch of stuff.
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.920]   Well, I think there was a post on Bong Bong Bong, like a week ago, was all the films that
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.440]   fell out of copyright, right?
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:24.440]   Yeah, it's not a good stuff.
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:30.520]   Until 1976, you had to register copyright and then periodically renew a copyright and then
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:34.480]   in the US and then in the US, and then the US ratified something called the burn convention
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:40.120]   or partially ratified it that requires that you no longer have any formalities in order
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:41.120]   to do this kind of thing.
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:45.720]   And the downside of that has been that stuff that people literally just don't care about
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:49.840]   is still in copyright and in copyright for their life plus 70 years where you don't
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:53.640]   even know who those people are figuring out whether they've been dead for 70 years is
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:54.640]   really hard.
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:59.160]   You know, it's basically now even napkin doodles go into copyright automatically and the copyright
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:02.000]   office doesn't know what thing copyright doesn't know who it belongs to.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.080]   Doesn't know who you should contact if you want to arrange to pay for it.
[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:07.080]   It's just locked up.
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:08.080]   It's pretty crazy.
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:09.080]   Night, Mayor.
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.680]   I creative commons all my napkin doodles.
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:11.680]   I just want to make the point.
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:12.680]   Good man.
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:13.680]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:15.880]   Hey Corey, you have a podcast?
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:16.880]   Tell us about it.
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:20.640]   Well, it's your basic vanilla science fiction writers podcast.
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:26.280]   I read some of my stories and bits and pieces as I go in lots of places around the world.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:28.080]   So the audio quality isn't so great.
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:31.720]   But it's just wherever I happen to be with 20 spare minutes I'll record a podcast and
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:32.720]   put it up.
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:37.440]   And I guess the neatest thing about it is they'll do stories in progress while I'm working
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:38.440]   on the film.
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:39.440]   I think that's great.
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:40.440]   Working on short stories.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.720]   I'll be reading them aloud and it also keeps me working on them because I know that I've
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.080]   got to have 20 minutes worth of new material in a couple of days.
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:48.680]   So that'll keep my head down at the keyboard.
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:53.960]   And so I've read a whole bunch of stories and they've had a pretty good reaction.
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:59.040]   One of the stories I read is something called I-Robot that was also published on a website
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.880]   called The Infinite Matrix, a science fiction magazine online called The Infinite Matrix.
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:07.280]   And it's even, it's got a lot of critical acclaim and out there for the Hugo Award.
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.280]   So the world congratulations.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.040]   It's been a couple of weeks here in LA.
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.040]   That's exciting.
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:12.280]   I might be a Hugo.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:14.320]   Wow, that would be fantastic.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.320]   I am the Hugo.
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:16.320]   I'm the fan.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:18.560]   And well, well worth it.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:19.560]   Well deserved.
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:20.560]   That's great, Corey.
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:21.560]   That's really.
[01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:25.720]   What brings you, so you move from a Britain, are you still involved in any way in the EFF
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.120]   or just kind of unofficially?
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.720]   I'm technically I'm a fellow of the organization.
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:34.600]   So I'm planning on going up to the, to the, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.640]   staff retreat in September and I occasionally consult on active cases.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.560]   I'm still within the non-disclosure agreement.
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:45.280]   So the attorneys can talk to me about confidential client stuff without worrying about, uh,
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.280]   about material getting subpoenaed.
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:51.840]   Um, and so, uh, and, and I, obviously remain very friendly with them.
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:55.400]   Uh, they're, they're good pals of mine and, and I support what they do.
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:59.040]   And I, I do a fair bit of work on, on some of their campaigns, particularly the stuff
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:03.600]   I was directly working on, which is stuff related to digital television, uh, DRM standards
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:08.280]   and international treaties, uh, particularly something called the broadcasting treaty, which
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.680]   has really bad implications for podcasters depending on which version they passed.
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:16.160]   That the one the US has been pushing for at the behest of Yahoo and Microsoft would basically
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:19.160]   let Yahoo or, you know, AOL provide your bandwidth.
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.200]   AOL would essentially have the right to Twitch.
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:22.200]   Uh, uh.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:25.840]   Even though Twitch might be licensed under creative commons license, if you got it from AOL,
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:28.440]   you'd also have to go to AOL and get their permission.
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:29.440]   Oh, really?
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:30.440]   Yeah.
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.040]   So it would behoove us to make sure that versions are available on other, from other sources
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.040]   at all times.
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:37.080]   Well, yeah, it would, it would make it, it would make it really complicated because then
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:40.320]   you'd have to prove which version you were redistricting and so on.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:45.280]   Basically, it's a, it's a set of new rights for people who, who aren't creators, you know,
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:47.040]   who, um, they're distributors.
[01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:51.240]   Uh, contribution to the work is really just, you know, electromagnetically modulating it.
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:52.240]   Right.
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.680]   You know, these aren't the people who usually give copyright to, you know, the, the rhetoric
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:59.360]   anyway around copyright, is it to help creators, not to help, you know, casters.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:03.800]   We have a contract with, uh, AOL that specifically says that they don't assert any right to
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.800]   it.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.680]   Does that, uh, doesn't say they don't assert a copyright or a broadcast.
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:10.680]   Well, it's good.
[01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:15.040]   I mean, maybe you can manage that with contracts, but it's just another gotcha.
[01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:16.040]   Yeah.
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:22.200]   You know, and they already completely, um, and they already completely overwhelming, difficult
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:24.040]   to follow, more ask that is copyright.
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:27.720]   And copyright that my friend Jamie Boyle says copyright used to be like a tank mine.
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:30.800]   Like if you were a civilian, you just couldn't detonate it.
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:35.280]   And you know, like in 1955, if I gave you a novel and I said, don't violate copyright.
[01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:36.280]   You couldn't.
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:38.240]   It would have been pretty much impossible.
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:42.320]   And these days we keep devising these traps that are supposed to be for tanks.
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.320]   Right.
[01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:46.880]   And they catch, you know, kids, they catch the kids who are like lip-taking on YouTube.
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:47.880]   Too bad.
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:50.040]   What are you doing in LA now?
[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:54.720]   So I got a Fulbright chair at the University of Southern California, uh, at their Public
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:59.960]   Diplomacy Center to write a book called set top cop Hollywood secret war on your living
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:00.960]   room.
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:01.960]   Oh boy.
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:04.640]   And, uh, and to teach a class of the same age, I'm going to teach at grad seminar in
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.760]   the first semester and I'm into grad class in the second.
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:09.240]   I just hang around, see what those guys are up to.
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:12.200]   Do the little work with the Annenberg communication school too.
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.200]   Keep writing, blowing, blowing.
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.200]   I've got these new novels.
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:17.840]   I'm working on, I'm working on these young adult novels about kids who declare war on
[01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:21.560]   the Department of Homeland Security hacker kids called Little Brother.
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:22.960]   Oh, that's good.
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.600]   Start propagandizing them young, I think.
[01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:25.960]   We really got to work on them young.
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:26.960]   That's a good idea.
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:31.360]   It's like encyclopedia Brown meets the Anacith cookbook.
[01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.360]   I love it.
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:34.760]   Wicke feed you Brown.
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:35.760]   I like it.
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:38.160]   Hey, uh, where can people get the podcast?
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.560]   Uh, craphound.com/podcast.php.
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:46.280]   Oh, you can get it in iTunes or all the other podcast aggregators.
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:47.280]   Wonderful.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:51.040]   Will Harris is great to have you two from bit dash tech.net.
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:56.120]   You're, you, you were out in the States, uh, taking meetings just a short while ago.
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:57.960]   I hope all went well.
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:58.960]   It was excellent.
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:01.360]   I, uh, I thoroughly enjoyed the trip out.
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.040]   Yeah, thanks for coming out to San Francisco too.
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.040]   That was fun.
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:05.040]   I hear you.
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.400]   Well, you tipped a beaker with Prager and Rose, huh?
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.560]   Yeah, we had a few beers.
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:11.120]   It was, uh, it was pretty cool.
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:12.680]   Can I throw one more in there quick?
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:13.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:15.240]   I thought this was just too brilliant to leave out.
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:23.320]   Um, nor does antivirus mistakenly advises, uh, in the UK to delete this, you'll liturgy,
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:28.160]   which is there, uh, which is there, I don't know, sermonizing program of choice.
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:29.240]   But it's a virus.
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:32.600]   And they said, you know, and the quote was great from the church.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:37.600]   England saying that millions of churchgoers had been affected by this bug in Norton Antibiras.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:41.480]   So you think people actually took it seriously and deleted the, the software?
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:42.720]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:45.840]   Loads of preachers went, apparently went through and like deleted loads of stuff.
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:47.520]   And then they got it with sermons.
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.560]   One guy was so paranoid that he thought he'd been hacked.
[01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:50.880]   He canceled all his credit cards.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:51.880]   There's online.
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:53.440]   Thank you, Norton.
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:54.960]   Thank you, Norton.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:55.960]   Wow.
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.880]   A classically British story.
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:59.480]   Same thing with the word vickers in it.
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:02.320]   I like any excuse to say vickers.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:03.320]   It rhymes with nickers.
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:04.800]   That's all I can say.
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:07.000]   Kevin Rose is now worth $60 million.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.400]   And yet he dings to join us.
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:09.400]   It's fabulous.
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:10.400]   You're very kind.
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.400]   Not true.
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:12.400]   Congratulations at three.
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:13.920]   Oh, I gather it's a great success.
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:15.160]   Thanks so much.
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:16.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:20.200]   And I love, I have to say, if you haven't played with the flash stuff, the dig spy and the,
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:24.040]   then the stacking thing and the, and the swarm, I love dig swarm.
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.040]   Yeah, it's pretty big.
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:26.200]   W and a four.
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:29.040]   A must, a must to play with it.
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:30.040]   It's just so fun.
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:35.280]   Yeah, it's just, it's, we have some more flash visualization stuff that we'll have coming
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:36.520]   out here in the near future.
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.320]   But yeah, this has been a lot of fun.
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:39.320]   There's some really cool stuff.
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:43.640]   We, Amber and I did an interview with a company called Etsy that sells crafts and they have
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:49.520]   a brilliant flash programmer who's doing amazing ways to look at, you know, the catalog.
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:53.600]   And I think that there's some really interesting UI stuff being done with flash right now.
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:54.600]   It's very exciting.
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:55.600]   And swarm is one of them.
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:56.600]   And swarm.
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:59.680]   Yeah, without a doubt, it's, it's one of those things where as we, as we go forward, we really
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:05.040]   want to create tools that allow you to see where groups of users are moving and what they're
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.480]   swarming around and what they're into.
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:07.480]   Interesting.
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:09.880]   And you can actually watch in real time as that shifts from story to story.
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:13.760]   And we can adapt that and show some net neutrality data up there.
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:14.760]   So that show the internet swarming.
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:15.760]   Yeah.
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:18.760]   It's going to be the NSA taking over that company before long.
[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:22.600]   Hey, maybe, you know, it's worth 200 million.
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:26.600]   Let's see, dig.com and dig nation is courses still going strong.
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:27.600]   Yes, indeed.
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:28.600]   Yep.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:31.360]   And I loved the, the anniversary episode.
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:32.600]   It was a lot of fun.
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:35.280]   Anytime we can do those live episodes and it'll be crazy.
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:37.120]   They love you, boy.
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:41.400]   And, and of course, well, I won't, I won't go into it.
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:42.400]   Never mind.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:43.400]   I take it back.
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:44.400]   Yes.
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:45.400]   Obviously for you to go.
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:47.600]   I know where you know where I am and I know.
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.600]   Yes, I do.
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:49.600]   That's all that matters.
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:50.600]   And I'm just proud of you.
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:51.600]   I'm just proud of you, my friend.
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:52.600]   Oh, no.
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.840]   John C. Devorak, I'm not proud of him.
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:59.480]   He's once again pandering the lowest common denominator at his blog, devorak.org/blog.
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:01.200]   That should drive some traffic, John.
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:04.600]   I would hope the lowest common denominator.
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:05.840]   We go for the, yeah, we do.
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:08.000]   We go script the bottom of the bottom.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.880]   Unbelievable the stuff.
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:11.880]   The smut, frankly.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:15.800]   You know, we come, we cut, we cut, we cut short a little bit of smut.
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:20.280]   You know, I should mention since Corey's on the show that if I got my blogging, my whole
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:25.040]   blogging thing started by doing a boing, boing, boing side blog for those guys.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:27.400]   And I guess, you know, this is the way to go.
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:32.080]   They have more than one person blogging and they're writing up all kinds of weird stuff.
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:33.080]   Boing Boing is brilliant.
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:34.080]   Oh, well, thank you.
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:35.080]   A brilliant conception.
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.240]   Was it Mark that thought it up?
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:37.240]   Did you think it up to?
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:43.960]   Mark Fromflder and his wife and Derek Brownwin and some of their friends published a print
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:46.880]   magazine called Boing Boing that I used to read.
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:48.880]   And then Mark started Boing Boing as a blog.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:53.120]   I think when he was checking a blogger for an article that he was writing and then he
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:57.480]   invited me to guest blog to, yeah, to guest blog while he was on holidays.
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:01.480]   And then Shani came on and David came on and that's the whole team.
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:02.480]   That's neat.
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.320]   I should get Gareth back because Gareth's a great writer.
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:05.320]   I love his stuff.
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:06.320]   Yeah, he is awesome.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:09.240]   There's a big gang of people in those days who are working on Boing.
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:10.240]   Real, real nice folk.
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.400]   It's a cool thing to be a part of.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.280]   Well, this has been our international edition.
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:19.280]   We had a Canadian, a Brit, Devorak and a rich guy.
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:21.080]   What's a Devorak?
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:22.600]   I don't know.
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:23.600]   I said once it's...
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:24.600]   How did Nigma?
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.600]   Nigma wrapped into a car for a sapphire.
[01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:28.160]   I've been walking through a bar.
[01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:29.160]   Wrapped and smelt.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.760]   Hey, I want to thank everybody for being here.
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:34.400]   It's really been a fun episode and we'll see you soon.
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.640]   I hope all of you come back and join us.
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:40.920]   Another Twitter is in the can.
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:44.120]   My friends, my tweets, are you ready?
[01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:45.120]   Yeah, the Twitter army.
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.120]   I don't know what the answer is.
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:47.120]   I really don't.
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.120]   Microsoft proof-rooted.
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:49.120]   It is.
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:50.120]   It is a fool's paradise.
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.120]   It is.
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:52.120]   It is.
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:53.120]   It is amazing.
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.120]   It is amazing.
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.120]   Microsoft proof-rooted.
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.120]   It is a good thing to deny this.
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:57.120]   It is no problem.
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:58.120]   It is a good thing to deny this.
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:11:59.120]   It is a good thing to deny this.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:00.120]   It is a good thing to deny this.
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.120]   It is a good thing to deny this, it is no problem.
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:02.120]   It is a good thing to deny this.
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:03.120]   It is a good thing to deny this.
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:04.120]   It is a good thing to deny this.
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:05.120]   It is a good thing to deny this.
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.120]   It is a good thing to deny this.
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.120]   It is a good thing to deny this.
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:14.120]   It is a good thing to deny this.
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:21.120]   It is a good thing to deny this.
