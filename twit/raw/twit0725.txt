[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.120]   Oh, a fun panel this week, Jason Heiner,
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.160]   my old friend formerly of the tech republic now,
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.000]   officially editorial director at CNET.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.600]   He's in charge of the advice side, which is reviews.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.160]   Jason Heiner, great to see you again.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.200]   Always a pleasure.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.120]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.920]   And now you have a corner office with a garden behind you.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.080]   I mean, obviously this is a major promotion.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.520]   (laughs)
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.600]   It's the same office because I'm still
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.840]   what CBS Interactive, but yeah.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.640]   It seems like you got a better view behind you
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.840]   than you had before.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.920]   My desk used to face the other way.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.760]   Oh, okay.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.760]   (laughs)
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.080]   I get it.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.760]   It looks like you're in a zen freaking garden here.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.360]   I mean, I'm waiting for the sand rakers to come out.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.640]   Dwight Silverman's also here, old friend, dear old friend
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.760]   from the Houston Chronicle.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.040]   He's now in charge of the tech burger,
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.400]   which is the chronicles kind of tech.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.320]   What do they call that?
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.600]   There's a word for it.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.440]   Oh, vertical.
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.280]   Vertical.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.120]   It's a bit vertical.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.720]   Which I hate that word, but yes, that's what it is.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.960]   And soon I'll be starting a newsletter called Release Notes.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.360]   And I'm really excited about that.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.800]   You can even sign up for it now.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.320]   It's at houstonchronicle.com/releasenotes.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.360]   And we'll be starting up in a couple of weeks.
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.600]   Nice.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.440]   And the woman who shares my fetish for handbags,
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.000]   Christina Warren, film girl is here.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.640]   She's senior cloud advocate at Microsoft.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.120]   And I only say that because I can see at least 10 bags
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.240]   behind you right now.
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.240]   Completely.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.960]   Everyone can see like, what do I like?
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.560]   Like you see like a sonos in the back.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.600]   I like the sonos.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.440]   I saw that.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.280]   I saw that.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.280]   Yeah, you see like handbags, various other electronic stuff.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.320]   Like, you know, I'm messy, but you can see
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.960]   what are the things that make up my personality?
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.960]   Well, it's all of that.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.280]   I love that.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.960]   That's, it's like, I spy with my little eye.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.600]   I can play a game with Christina's office.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.120]   No, I love it.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.560]   So it's great to have all three of you on.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.360]   All three of you, dear friends.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.960]   Big story of the week, Johnny I.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.680]   But before I get to that, I want to note
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.800]   that this is the 12th anniversary of the release
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.160]   of the first iPhone.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.120]   January, June 29th, 2007.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.680]   Let me get my numbers right.
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.160]   June 29th, 2007, 12 years ago.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.200]   The iPhone hit the stores.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.400]   I remember, did you, any of you wait in line
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.560]   or do anything to get to?
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.480]   What'd you do?
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.080]   I was in line for, I was in line for like five or six hours.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.920]   Me too.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.240]   It was just about this time on that day.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.120]   I kid you not.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.400]   I remember it being like between 5.30 and 6.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.120]   When finally the first person got one
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.840]   and I think I was like 12th or something in line.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.600]   Wow.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.840]   I wasn't going to go to the city to the Apple store,
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.840]   which is where, you know, the faithful went.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.640]   But I knew the line would be,
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.440]   I knew the line had started three days earlier, basically.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.320]   So I went to our AT&T store here,
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.320]   hoping they would have enough units.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.800]   And I was like seventh or eighth in line.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.400]   The people in the guys in front of me
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.720]   had come all the way up from Google,
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.000]   from Mountain View, two hours south of us.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Because for the same reason,
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.440]   so they came to the Petaluma AT&T store.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.200]   And we were talking, he said, yeah,
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.840]   I've just pulled three all-nighters
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.200]   getting Google Reader ready for the iPhone.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.920]   Wow.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.080]   That was a wasted effort.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.840]   Thank you.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.640]   I read your spec.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.600]   I was still in college,
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.920]   and so I did not have the money for an iPhone.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.760]   It was one of those things.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.120]   I also was a teamable customer.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.080]   I really wanted one, but I was like, yeah, no, this.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.560]   This is like, this is my rinse.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.760]   You would have had to move to AT&T
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.200]   because they had an exclusive on it.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.920]   Exactly.
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.960]   And not only that, but then it was like $700 or something.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.240]   No, no, it was expensive.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.920]   Walt Mossberg tweeted, the reason I know this, he tweeted,
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.240]   "Oh, yeah, my first review of the iPhone,
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.680]   "this is his 2007 review is still up on the web
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.040]   "at allthingsd.com."
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.160]   He noted it was a very expensive $499.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.680]   Okay, so it was $500.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.360]   But regardless, that was 500 more than I had.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.520]   No, it's still expensive,
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.880]   but a lot less than a modern iPhone.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.360]   I was half what a modern iPhone is.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.000]   Oh, totally.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.880]   I mean, though to be fair, you were still in a contract.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.040]   Like, it wasn't subsidized.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.200]   Like, in subsequent years, they'd be selling for $199 or $299,
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.640]   and it was subsidized.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.760]   In that case, it was not subsidized,
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.440]   but you still have a contract.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.560]   It's fascinating to read Walt's review
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.360]   because on the one hand, Walt was smart enough
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.320]   to realize this was very important.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.520]   He said, "The iPhone, the headline is,
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.560]   "the iPhone is a breakthrough handheld computer."
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.640]   He understood right away.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.120]   This isn't a phone particularly.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.960]   This is a computer.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.600]   He says, "The phone's minimum price is a hefty $499,
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.240]   "but people are already three days before the phone comes out,
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.320]   "lining up outside Apple stores
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.240]   "for when they go on sale Friday evening."
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.280]   He said, "It's not a great phone."
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.400]   Again, the beginning of the not such great phone.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.280]   So I think it's funny that he talks about how thin it is
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.320]   and how big the screen.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.560]   It has the largest and highest resolution screen
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.360]   of any smartphone we've seen,
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.440]   and the most internal memory by far.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.400]   Anybody remember how much internal?
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.920]   - It was four or eight.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.240]   Like, they would do both,
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.840]   and then they ended up dropping the four gigabyte model
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.920]   because they dropped the price within like 60 days,
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.600]   and there was a big kerfuffle over that,
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.440]   but they dropped the price really soon,
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.520]   and they got rid of the four gigabyte option,
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.720]   and then they added that spring before the 3G
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.440]   and eight gigabyte, or a 16 gigabyte option,
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.880]   if I remember. - That's right.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.720]   So it came in $499, you got four gigabytes of storage.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.120]   - See, okay, so I was right.
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.680]   It was $600 for the eight gigabyte.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.000]   - $600 for the one you wanted.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:37.840]   - That's right.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:38.680]   - Exactly. - It's 700.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.040]   - It's the tax and stuff.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.480]   No, this is making sense.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.480]   I was like, wait, was that off on price?
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.600]   Yeah, no.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.040]   - Also, no support for 3G.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.760]   It was edge only on the A&T network,
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.000]   which meant it was pig slow.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.240]   It didn't have cut and paste,
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.920]   and most importantly, it didn't have an app store.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.080]   I remember when Stephen asked it,
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.400]   he said, "Oh, you don't need..."
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.080]   All you need is the web.
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.880]   - It was on 2G, and all you needed was the web,
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.640]   which was just made it painfully, really painful.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.920]   I remember going to a meeting of some developers
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.960]   here in Houston where someone had been to a session
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.000]   at Apple where they had taught him how to program
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.040]   these web apps, and he was explaining this to them,
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:24.040]   and they all said, "But it's 2G, but it's 2G."
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.080]   And it was, the devs knew what was coming
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.000]   and that it was going to be the kind of things they had.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.560]   They were gonna have to do in order to make it even work.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.520]   - Did you have to wait in line to get it, Dwight or...
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.200]   - I did not get one right away.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.280]   I waited till the 3G S,
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.600]   - Smart.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.680]   - Or the 3G, but the one thing that I did do
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.200]   is I went and interviewed all these people in line,
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.720]   even in Houston, and if I remember right,
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.560]   it was raining that night here.
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.400]   - Oh, wow.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.280]   - And so they were out with umbrellas and intense,
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.760]   and of course, being Houston, it was really hot and rainy,
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.160]   so it was like a sauna, and I thought these people were crazy.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.600]   - Reading again from Walt's review,
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.520]   the phone is simply beautiful.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.800]   It's thinner.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.560]   Can you get me my phone?
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.840]   Is somebody there to go?
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.840]   - Oh, yeah, I've got one here too.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.760]   - Yeah, my phone's in the back cupboard there in my museum.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.240]   The iPhone is simply beautiful.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.560]   It's thinner than the skinny Samsung Blackjack,
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:27.320]   yet almost its entire surface is covered by a huge vivid
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.760]   three and a half inch display.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.680]   (laughs)
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.120]   - But at the time, that, yeah, the fact that it was capacitive,
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.680]   I mean, that was so huge.
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.720]   Like, I remember going and playing with it and being like,
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.480]   you know, looking down at my trio and being like,
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.760]   I hate you so much.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.400]   (laughs)
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.960]   - My last two things I remember from that first week,
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.320]   or first few weeks with the iPhone,
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.960]   'cause it was so slow, the typing was a nightmare,
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.200]   because on that three and a half screen screen,
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.880]   you know, it was just tough.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.320]   But I remember going into a Home Depot,
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.080]   and I had to buy like this part,
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.800]   and something was like a plumbing or electric,
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.080]   something at the house was like messed up.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.280]   And I got, and I forgot to look up whatever the sort of
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.800]   the size of something.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:16.880]   And I was there and I was like,
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.840]   oh shoot, I forgot to do that.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.760]   And then I was like, oh, hang on, wait.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.120]   On the iPhone, I can just look this on the web.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:23.960]   - Amazing.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:24.800]   - And it took forever.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.640]   It probably took five minutes to load.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.720]   - Yeah, but still.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.480]   - But I looked up which part I needed,
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.040]   and I was like, oh, like I was able to do this,
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.320]   'cause before you try to do that on a trio,
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.880]   or one of these Windows mobile devices at the time,
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.640]   and it was just brutal trying to look up a webpage
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.480]   on those devices.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.480]   And eventually you just, it wouldn't load,
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.840]   or parts of it would fail,
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.280]   and you'd just be like, forget it, you know, whatever.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.840]   In this case, I would have just gone back home
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.320]   and figured out what I needed.
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.120]   So I remembered that, and then I was still
[00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.360]   a little unconvinced, you know?
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.960]   I remember my review at the time was kind of like,
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.640]   you know, still even handed.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.320]   Like, clearly this was the future of phones.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.280]   But I couldn't really advise anybody
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.200]   to go out and buy it right that moment, right?
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.240]   Because most people were paying 100 to 200 bucks
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.160]   for a phone on contract at that point,
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.360]   versus having to pay.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.520]   You really couldn't recommend anybody get the 4G.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.760]   You're like, if you're gonna do this,
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.920]   you're gonna have to just get the 8, you know?
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:17.760]   - 6.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.120]   - So what I--
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.440]   - 6.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.640]   - But the Waps, you didn't have to worry about putting it.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.960]   - Yeah, but the operating system
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.000]   must have taken more than half the storage.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.840]   - It did.
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.680]   It took a bunch.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:29.760]   If you were gonna take any photos or do video or anything.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.200]   - Or use it as an iPod.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.080]   Which a lot of people use it as an iPod, right?
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.880]   - So Walt said in our tests,
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.720]   we were able to get 1000, how many songs?
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.960]   More than 1000 songs on there.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.200]   So, you know, as a size,
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.400]   that's, remember 5 gig iPod was 1000 songs in your pocket,
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.360]   the original iPod.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:51.400]   - I had an iPod Nano at the time that was like 8 gigs, right?
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.400]   - That's the same, yeah.
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.760]   - That little tiny thing was 8 gigs.
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.680]   And I was like, oh, I don't wanna carry this
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.480]   and the iPhone both.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.360]   But I remember where I really became a believer was,
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.200]   I wanna say this was like a month into testing it,
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.280]   a month or two.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.760]   My daughter was only,
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.200]   she was three at the time.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:19.040]   And when I set the phone down,
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.880]   I'd been taking some pictures with it
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.600]   and I had been showing her the pictures
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.720]   and that kind of thing.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.160]   And I was like, oh, you know, that picture that we took.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.120]   And she picked up the phone,
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:32.320]   swiped to unlock, tapped the phone.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.960]   And started flipping through.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.800]   And I was like, holy crap,
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.800]   like the three year old has already figured out
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.200]   how to use this thing.
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.600]   Like this is incredible.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.680]   'Cause you know what, back then,
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.840]   if you were trying to get,
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.240]   I remember trying to teach, you know,
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.200]   people how to just get to the phone app
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.800]   to make a call on a Windows phone or a trio
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:51.640]   or something like that.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.800]   They're like, look, I know I can get my messages on this,
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.480]   but how do I make a phone call, you know?
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.840]   And people would just freak out at figuring out
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.800]   how to do the simplest things.
[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.000]   And you know, when this thing was that easy to use,
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.160]   I was like, okay, yeah, this is something different
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.240]   and this is gonna be pretty special.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.120]   - Walt said the 8Gig model held 1,000,
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.360]   3rd year in his songs, it does in videos
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.760]   and get this over 100 photos.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.760]   I took 100 photos yesterday.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.760]   (laughing)
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.200]   And over 100 emails, including some attachments.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.960]   This is not the original iPhone, this is the 3GS,
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.560]   but it's the same size and form factor.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.840]   Put it next to a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.320]   And you can see how far we've come.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.720]   And yet, this is so important, this phone.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.480]   This is really, if you look back now,
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.680]   I think while undersold how important this phone was gonna be.
[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.160]   And he saw, I think, the importance of it.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.320]   But this was the beginning of carrying
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.960]   a supercomputer in your pocket,
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.360]   having a full 24/7 access to the internet,
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.200]   always on, always connected.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.920]   That is life-changer.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.520]   And we've seen that in the 12 years intervening.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.640]   I think our lives have changed 100%.
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.120]   - Oh, without a doubt, I mean, I think it's funny.
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:07.840]   Sometimes people think that you're being hyperbolic.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.320]   And I remember the 10th anniversary,
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.520]   I wrote something about how it changed.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.400]   You can't make any, you know,
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.320]   that it's been one of the most important technological,
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.640]   you know, advances in our lifetime.
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.800]   And I think that's absolutely true.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.040]   I mean, you could maybe say, you know,
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.120]   the microcomputer or whatever is the only thing
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:27.360]   that might have the same amount of impact.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.200]   Because when we think about what our lives
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.240]   were like 12 years ago and what they are now,
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.440]   they're so different.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.280]   And the primary driver and why they're different
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.560]   is the phone.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.360]   - Yeah, we talk about Twitter and Facebook,
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:41.160]   but without the phone, Twitter's Facebook
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.320]   aren't as powerful as this.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.720]   - Yeah, I mean, they might exist,
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.240]   but they wouldn't be very important.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.080]   - When the history of the smartphone is written,
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:52.520]   all those other devices, the trio and the Blackberry,
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.240]   all the various, you know, Windows mobile devices,
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.560]   those will all be preludes.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.320]   They will all be proto devices
[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:05.120]   when it really happened when the smartphone,
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:05.960]   when the iPhone is hot.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.720]   - It's also important because we are now
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.400]   in the midst of new technologies.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.000]   I don't know if there is a technology
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.720]   as important as the iPhone in our midst today,
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.480]   but we do see things like VR and augmented reality.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:21.120]   And it's very primitive, very simple, very unusable.
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.520]   - It's important to remember, so was the iPhone,
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:25.480]   even when it first came.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.320]   Is this it?
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.560]   - But it accelerated quickly.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.920]   I mean, it got a iPhone.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.720]   - It did.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:33.920]   - It got to the point within, I'd say,
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.480]   the second generation where it actually was usable
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.800]   by most people and certainly having 3G helped it a lot.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.680]   I mean, it made a leap very quickly.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.680]   I had a blackjack at the time that it came out
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:50.680]   and I loved my blackjack until I saw people using
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.520]   their original iPhone and even though it was slow,
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:57.480]   I had to have one when I could afford it and I did.
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.680]   And I think a lot of people were like that.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.840]   It made the leap, I'd say, within two years
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.440]   to being an essential device.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.960]   - And very famously, Google was already developing
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.040]   its first Android phone, saw the iPhone
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.840]   and said back to the drawing board,
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.280]   they threw everything out.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.120]   - Right.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.480]   - Yep, they said we're no longer gonna be taking
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.280]   on Windows Mobile and Blackberry.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.840]   And instead, this is going to be what we'd go after,
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.560]   which is obviously the right move.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.480]   A little bit complicated by the fact that Eric Schmidt
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.720]   was on the Apple board, but that aside,
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.560]   I mean, that's the point.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.440]   - Which by the way, I gotta point out,
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.000]   Steve Jobs never forgave him.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.160]   He said Eric stole it.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.000]   - Oh, of course not.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.160]   - There it is, that's the old, that's our old baby.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.760]   There you go.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.120]   Let me see if I was rich enough.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.600]   Yes, I got an eight gig.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.240]   By the way, every once in a while,
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.080]   we fire this up.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.160]   I think the last time Christina was on the 10th anniversary
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.360]   and it still works.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.400]   - Still got all my phone numbers on there.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.440]   In my old songs, I was apparently very much
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.080]   in a Britney Spears at the time.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.720]   (laughing)
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:56.760]   Hey, what can I say?
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:57.600]   - I mean, whatever.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.440]   - I mean, whatever.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.400]   - Well, this was good.
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.400]   - Yeah, and if you have an Android phone now,
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.800]   and I do, and I think there's some real,
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.280]   I mean, I love my Samsung, you still owe it to Apple.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.640]   Those, these black slabs of glass wouldn't exist
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.480]   without Apple.
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.160]   And by the way, without Steve Jobs,
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.040]   who, I mean, we've all read now the stories
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.920]   of that first demo in January of 2007,
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.960]   where that thing barely worked.
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.240]   But he sold it, man.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.160]   He made it the thing you had to have.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.080]   And...
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.560]   - And that relationship with the carriers too,
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.960]   one thing that's gets overlooked is,
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.200]   you know, he had the mojo to go in there
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.240]   and change the relationship between phone makers
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.680]   and carriers, 'cause the carriers really dominated
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.080]   how phones were designed and built back then.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.040]   And they strong armed all of the, you know,
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.200]   all of the phone makers into making the phones that they wanted.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.880]   And they did most of the marketing.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.960]   And they did most of the, again,
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.840]   the design and the integration of the way the phones were made.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.680]   They did a lot of those decisions.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.760]   And Steve Jobs went in and said,
[00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.680]   "No, we think we can handle this better.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.200]   "You know, look, we have a lot of loyal users
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.240]   "who are gonna be interested in this device.
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.120]   "And we think we can handle that.
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.680]   "And if you wanna be part of it,
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.520]   "then, you know, we'll give you an exclusive
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:18.280]   "and you'll be the one to have this device,
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.280]   "'cause look, it's gonna be great
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.600]   "and you wanna be part of it."
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.560]   And that did forever change the shift,
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:28.560]   the balance of power and put phone makers back in charge
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:29.720]   and for the better, right?
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.800]   Because not only Apple,
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.560]   but a lot of others came on HTC, Samsung,
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.960]   and others quickly, LG at the time,
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.320]   even though, you know, since they've had their challenges.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.360]   But they came in and followed up
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.600]   on what the iPhone did and innovated
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.440]   that then a lot of the features they worked on
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.760]   eventually came into iPhone as well.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.000]   And it really unleashed this innovation,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.480]   this wave of innovation that wouldn't have happened
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.640]   unless it was decoupled from the carriers
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.120]   in the way that it was.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.720]   - I don't-- - Yeah, but you wanna know something.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.520]   They're still imitating.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.840]   - I know.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:12.600]   This is the LG V50 ThinkQ, the Sprint 5G phone.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.760]   - Yeah. - So what does this look like?
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:17.600]   This looks like-- - A big iPhone.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.640]   - Like a big iPhone.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.080]   - It even has the notch.
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.640]   They're even imitating the notch.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.800]   - You have the notch, it's like an equivalent.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.120]   - In fact, people will see this on my desk
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.920]   and say, "Oh, you got a new iPhone."
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.560]   - Yeah. - I like to say, "Oh, I didn't."
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.760]   - But to be fair, there's not a whole lot you could do.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.720]   I mean, this form factor is that way
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.480]   because that's the way it is.
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.200]   It's gotta be a black slab of glass,
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.360]   gotta be edge to edge.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.000]   I mean, how many-- - But that notch--
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.400]   - You're not gonna make it round.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.520]   You're not gonna make it pyramid.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.520]   Oh, the notch. - That notch
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.960]   that everybody's made fun of.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.520]   - Yeah, I know, but you know what?
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.920]   The Samsung doesn't have a notch, it has a cut out.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:57.600]   And I have the OnePlus 7 Pro now,
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.440]   which has, instead of, actually,
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.280]   it's a perfect black slab.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:05.560]   And the front-facing camera comes rising out of the top of it,
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.200]   which is pretty hysterical.
[00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.680]   So, everybody's not slavishly copying Apple.
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.000]   They did drop the headphone jack
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.920]   on a number of those phones,
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.560]   which I guess is a slavish copy.
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.120]   But still, you hold this in your hand,
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.280]   you realize how important it was.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.680]   It's hard to believe.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:22.720]   I don't think we knew when Steve announced this
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:27.360]   that he was sick, but he died only four and a half years later.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.720]   - Yeah. - He was already--
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.720]   - Yeah. - On,
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.440]   for Deathly Ill.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.680]   This was his, really, this in the iPad
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.680]   for his last great creations.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:41.760]   And to his credit, I don't think this exists
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:42.960]   without Steve Jobs.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.320]   And one other guy, Johnny Ive,
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.720]   and that takes us to our second story
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.920]   because it was this week we learned that Johnny Ive,
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:52.760]   who really has only been half there anyway,
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.160]   apparently his own, according to Mark Gurman,
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.320]   only goes in two days a week anyway,
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.520]   has finally admitted he is leaving Apple.
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.320]   And that really is the end of the era, I think.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:08.320]   The, I think the best quote comes from John Gruber,
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.320]   who says, let me see if I can,
[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.320]   it's right at the end of his article.
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.320]   I don't worry that Apple is in trouble
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.320]   because Johnny Ive is leaving.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.320]   I worry that Apple is in trouble
[00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.320]   because he's not being replaced.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.320]   I don't know who you'd replace him with,
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.320]   but what's happening is the design team,
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.320]   Evans Hanky, Vice President of Industrial Design,
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.320]   and Allen Dye, Vice President of Human Interface Designer,
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.320]   going to report to Apple's COO, Jeff Williams,
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:37.320]   in a way this feels like the end of the design era at Apple.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.320]   - Yeah, Gruber's point, and which I think is a good one,
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:43.320]   is just that nobody's gonna replace Johnny Ive, right?
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.320]   Like with the iPhone, right?
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.320]   That he designed something that's gonna have impact
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:52.320]   for decades after he's gone, very likely, if not longer.
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.320]   But the position, chief design officer,
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.320]   because of Apple being such a design-centric company,
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.320]   that is critical.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:07.320]   And to not have that, I think is, and that is what Gruber said,
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:11.320]   and I think he said it best because that is critical,
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.320]   and for them not to do that, not even to try to replace them,
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:19.320]   not to whether it's if you are going to move somebody up internal
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:22.320]   or you're gonna go find somebody at another brand
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.320]   or bring somebody up from the outside the way they did with
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:30.320]   Angela Arrens when they wanted to take the retail stores
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.320]   to the next level.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.320]   You know, not doing that, not committing to that
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.320]   is what is questionable.
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:43.320]   And it's what worries people 'cause there has been,
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:47.320]   beyond this year where there have been a really pretty interesting
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:51.320]   and exciting wave of some new products,
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:56.320]   they're design shops have been called into question
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.320]   the last few years and their commitments have designed
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.320]   in the same way.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:04.320]   - Was Johnny Ive without Steve Jobs like, say Paul McCartney
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:05.320]   without John Lennon?
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:08.320]   Was it, was it somewhat, I mean, the two of them together
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.320]   were a synergy that has rarely or have ever been seen?
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.320]   - No, I mean, I think you're exactly correct.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.320]   I mean, they were obviously, I think,
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.320]   some of the best industrial design work and some of the best,
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.320]   you know, consumer electronic work was done
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.320]   because of the two of them and because Johnny Ive is,
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.320]   and he's so young, he's like 52,
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.320]   which just makes me feel completely inadequate.
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.320]   - He's done a lot.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.320]   - Yeah, you have some fame.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.320]   - He started, what was his first design apple?
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.320]   Was it the Bondi Blue iMac?
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.320]   - The iMac, yeah, first one.
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.320]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, it was the message.
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:41.320]   - Well, his first famous one, his most famous one.
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.320]   - Well, his most famous one, but if you look back
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.320]   and look at that second Newton, that message mate,
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.320]   it looks a whole lot like the Bondi Blue iMac.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.320]   - It was kind of clear.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.320]   That was the one that was sold mostly for education.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:56.320]   - Right, and he also did the 20th anniversary.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.320]   - Oh, yeah, we have that.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.320]   Yeah, that's right, I forgot.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:03.320]   - And then Jobs came back, he was going to leave
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:08.320]   and John Rubenstein and Jobs are able to convince him to stay.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.320]   But, no, I mean, I think that the two of them together,
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.320]   you're right, they had this sort of synergy,
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:17.320]   but I don't know if it's fair to say that like when Steve passed
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.320]   that he wasn't able to do the right things,
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.320]   I always got the sense from reading the various profiles
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.320]   of him in places like the New Yorker and Financial Times
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.320]   and things like that, that his personal interests kind of shifted.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.320]   Like he was all in on the watch.
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.320]   I think the watch was he was all in on,
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.320]   and that was supposed to be, you know,
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.320]   and it was very much marketed in the beginning
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:43.320]   as a piece of jewelry and as a fashion kind of, you know,
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.320]   timepiece, and that didn't work, and so they had to pivot to health,
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.320]   which obviously did, but when you pivot,
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.320]   when you make that pivot, the design and the things that go into
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.320]   that kind of design become a little bit less important,
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.320]   I think you could argue.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:01.320]   And then, you know, he got really interested in doing the space
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.320]   shape, yeah, apart.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.320]   And so I don't know, I mean, I don't know the guy,
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.320]   but it wouldn't seem unfair to say, okay,
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.320]   you've been at this job for 27 years and your own personal
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:13.320]   interest in the things you like, and if you look at his other
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:17.320]   collaborations that he's done with his friend Mark Newsom,
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.320]   you know, maybe he has just like a different aesthetic
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.320]   and different things he's interested in,
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.320]   and maybe that was related to Steve Dine.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.320]   Maybe it wasn't, I don't know, but I don't feel like--
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.320]   There was criticism of him, though,
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.320]   that it was design over function.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.320]   Sure, yeah, I agree with that.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.320]   But I mean, I think you could also say that Steve Jobs wasn't without
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.320]   history on that too.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.320]   I mean, look at the cube, right?
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.320]   The G4 cube is--
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.320]   I love that, though.
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.320]   I am.
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.320]   I said I agree.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.320]   It's a great computer.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.320]   And it's a great design.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.320]   It didn't work.
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.320]   It cracked.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.320]   It cut was--
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.320]   Not only that, but I had one.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.320]   We had one at my high school that caught on fire.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.320]   Like, it was terrible.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.320]   But it sure looked good.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.320]   And you know what?
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.320]   The Mac Pro 2013 Mac Pro sure looked good.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.320]   Crappy product.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.320]   And that's a Johnny Ive as well.
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.320]   Here's the e-mate, not the message,
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.320]   this is what you were talking about, the e-mate 3000.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.320]   So that was the first Johnny Ive.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:14.320]   You definitely see the iMac, Bondi iMac in that.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.320]   He did this crazy--
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.320]   Really?
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.320]   I've just learned that we got rid of art.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.320]   We had a 20th century-- 20th anniversary Mac.
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.320]   But when we moved studios, we got rid of a lot of stuff.
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.320]   I hope somebody up and went to a good home.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.320]   Probably Alex Gumpel got it.
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.320]   There's the cube.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.320]   I loved my cube, but you're right.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.320]   It wasn't a smart design.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:38.320]   You know, what surprised me when the announcement came that Johnny was
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:42.320]   leaving was almost immediately there was, as you said, Leo,
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:48.320]   this criticism of Johnny Ive's designs that essentially they have
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:53.320]   driven the entire industry to devices that aren't repairable,
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.320]   that can't be-- there aren't modular--
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.320]   You're mice you can't charge while you're using.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.320]   Right.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.320]   Right.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.320]   And it is-- you know, to a certain extent, I think they're right.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:06.320]   But I think that the-- if you look at the things that were happening
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:10.320]   at the time of the iPhone and around the time of the iPad,
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:12.320]   that was already in play.
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.320]   I think there were a lot of things coming at the time.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.320]   Things were getting thinner, things were getting smaller.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.320]   And I think I just took it to its natural progression.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:24.320]   I'm not sure that he deserves all the criticism that he's got.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.320]   Maybe not.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:30.320]   Although Gruber does point out that if you hadn't had the Apple Design team
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:33.320]   insisting on thinner and thinner laptops, you probably wouldn't have the
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.320]   keyboard.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:39.320]   Apple wouldn't be so dug in on this keyboard that clearly is a failure.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.320]   And that hurt Apple, honestly.
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.320]   So that's a commitment.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:49.320]   Particularly since other makers of laptops and other devices have made
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.320]   them small but haven't made the same kind of sacrifices, you could buy some
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:58.320]   really nice Windows machines that have a lot more connectivity types that are
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.320]   very thin and have an excellent keyboard.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:05.320]   So it's not, Apple doesn't necessarily, they've driven things in a
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:08.320]   certain direction, but a lot of people have improved on what Apple did.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:13.320]   Christina, do you think that this will be an opportunity for Apple to abandon
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.320]   some of those bad design decisions like the keyboard?
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.320]   I mean, I hope so.
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:22.320]   I think the big question is going to be what takes control of Design at Apple.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.320]   Because I think that's kind of John Gruber's point.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:27.320]   And I agree with it, which is that it is sort of disconcerting that there isn't
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:31.320]   a big difference, kind of a figurehead who is now at the company who is making
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:35.320]   those design decisions.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.320]   You know, I think you could be optimistic and say this might be an opportunity.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.320]   There might be plenty of people at that company who have had really good ideas
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.320]   but haven't had the opportunity to express them and to execute them because
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:51.320]   you've had one of the greatest industrial designers of all time working there.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:56.320]   So how would anybody else get a chance to even make any sorts of changes
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.320]   or put their own vision out there?
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.320]   So I think it kind of depends, right?
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:03.320]   But definitely, I think this is an opportunity to say we don't have to be
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.320]   a guest, maybe beholden to these decisions.
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.320]   We can make other decisions.
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:13.320]   But obviously, if there is a change to the keyboard design within the next two years,
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:17.320]   in all likelihood, that design was led by Johnny Ives team, right?
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.320]   Like these things don't work in the vacuum.
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.320]   These decisions are made far in advance.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:26.320]   So it'll be years before we don't see Johnny's imprint.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.320]   Right.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:31.320]   And then, you know, he's forming his own company and Apple is going to be one of his, you know,
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.320]   his clients, how Apple's probably been a little bit more powerful.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.320]   It might be an advisory thing.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.320]   I don't know.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:42.320]   But I'm just saying you could understand that if it got to it, if they didn't have,
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.320]   they wanted somebody to kind of do a general design and then they would, you know, hone in on it.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.320]   That could be still somebody that they want to go to.
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.320]   You never know.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.320]   So I'll play devil's advocate on this a little bit.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.320]   Sorry, Dwight, just I'll make this quick.
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:30:00.320]   I'll play devil's advocate just a little and say, one of the reasons, you know, you have to ask,
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.320]   why would Apple do this?
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.320]   Tim Cook knows it's a design driven company.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:08.320]   You know, obviously sort of the other people with the company Phil Schiller and others.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.320]   Why would they make this change?
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:16.320]   And from their perspective, it could be that, you know, design has taken them having a design
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:22.320]   chief be able to have to be able to overrule some of these other sort of functional decisions
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:28.320]   to the point you made earlier, Leo, may have not been, may have not have served Apple real well
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.320]   in the last few years.
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:36.320]   And this may be an acknowledgement of that and a fact that design, you know, is still going to be
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:43.320]   important to them, but that they're going to follow users and user needs a little bit more
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:51.320]   and be less beholden to sort of an aesthetic decision by design that leads to the touch bar,
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:58.320]   that leads to a somewhat compromised first design of the Apple Watch that leads to the
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:02.320]   challenges with the, you know, even with the headphone jack and with other things.
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:10.320]   And so perhaps that pragmatic design will be part of what they're going for with this move.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:14.320]   If we're trying to read the tealies and understand why they might have done this.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.320]   No, that's a good point.
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:19.320]   I mean, actually, because, you know, when they gave Johnny the figurehead title of, you know,
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:23.320]   chief design officer and had everybody report to him, it was kind of officially stating what had
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:26.320]   already been, at least from what I understand how Apple works.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:30.320]   They're very secretive, but based on things they've been written, was that, you know,
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:35.320]   the Johnny's design team operated in their own silo and were kind of separate from everything else.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:40.320]   But when you actually give him that, you know, spot on like the reporting structure, that
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.320]   makes that very clear.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:47.320]   This could be like Jason saying, maybe a potential reset of saying, okay, you still do your own
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:52.320]   thing and what you do is still leading the company, but this is no longer going to be separate from
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:57.320]   the rest of the work that's being done so that if we do have concerns, maybe in some other
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.320]   areas, that's going to be taken into account as well.
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.320]   That's a pretty good theory, Jason.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:08.320]   It's funny because also, one thing I think you want to think about is that they haven't said
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.320]   they're not going to replace him.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.320]   They haven't said they're not going to have a chief design officer.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.320]   They just haven't yet.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.320]   Oh, so this might be a temporary structure.
[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:18.320]   And it's something like that.
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:22.320]   This might be a temporary structure where they look at these, the two guys are going to be reporting
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:26.320]   to the COO, one of them, one or either of them could be a candidate for it, and they may be
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.320]   looking on the outside.
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:31.320]   The fact that they haven't done it now doesn't mean they won't do it later.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:35.320]   I feel like Apple made him, so there's two ways to look at this.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:40.320]   On the one hand, you could say, "Oh my God, John and Paul have left the group.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.320]   We're stuck with Ringo."
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:50.320]   And without the two most important people, I think, in personal technology over the last
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:55.320]   30 or 40 years, Steve Jobs and Johnny Ive, that doesn't bow well.
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:58.320]   You're not going to see another thing like this iPhone.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:01.320]   Who's going to make that next thing?
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:05.320]   On the other hand, you could say there was a big mistake made by Apple a few years ago,
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:09.320]   because they put Johnny not only in charge of industrial design, but in charge of all
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:12.320]   user interface and software design.
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:18.320]   And that was actually the point where iOS went way south with iOS 8, which was horrifically
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.320]   poorly designed.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:24.320]   And I think you could make the case that Johnny Ive running software was a big mistake on
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.320]   Apple's part.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:28.320]   So I think there's two point of views.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.320]   I'm not sure which I hold.
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.320]   And I think you're right, Dwight.
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.320]   It could very well be.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.320]   I mean, it can't be.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.320]   There's only one Johnny Ive in the world.
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:37.320]   No, I mean, there aren't going to be many, right?
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.320]   But it doesn't mean that we won't see it again.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:43.320]   It remains to be seen if Apple will be the company that has that, or if it's another
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.320]   one.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.320]   I mean, it's interesting.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:50.320]   Robert Brunner was the guy who hired Johnny Ive at Apple, and he was the Apple, and the
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.320]   lead Apple designer before that.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:59.320]   He went on to be the lead designer for Beats by Dre, and is very talented in his own right.
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:03.320]   But I talked with him a number of years ago at a Beats event, and he said, and in very
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:07.320]   good naturely, I have to say, it was in no way with any bit of bitterness at all.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.320]   He was like, "I hired Johnny Ive is going to be on my tombstone."
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:18.320]   And this is the guy that created the PowerBook that created Beats that is in his own right,
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:22.320]   like a very, very successful and amazingly talented and still designer.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.320]   But yeah, he knows.
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:26.320]   And again, it's completely good nature about it.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.320]   There was no bitterness at all.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:33.320]   But you're like, "Yeah, the fact that I hired Johnny Ive is going to be what I'm best at."
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:37.320]   That PowerBook design was bananas for the time.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.320]   That thing was mind-blowing.
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:41.320]   John DeVor, I called it a toilet scene.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:42.320]   Oh my gosh.
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.320]   Not that one, the black one.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.320]   Oh, the black one.
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.320]   The Darth Vader.
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.320]   The Darth Vader thing.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:52.920]   Yeah, the original PowerBook was so sweet.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:57.560]   It was at the time, then, and all the laptops were beige, right?
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:01.240]   And they made this black, very stealth-looking thing.
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.240]   Remember it pretty soon after the first mission impossible movie?
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.320]   This is it, the PowerBook G3, is this what you're talking about?
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:08.320]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.320]   That is actually, given that era, pretty impressive.
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.320]   Oh my gosh, yeah, yeah, the original one was really sweet.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.320]   That was the one that Carrie uses in Sex and the City.
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:16.320]   Ha!
[00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:20.320]   I remember it from Mission Impossible.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:23.960]   In Mission Impossible, he's hanging up from upside down from the ceiling, you know, and
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.560]   he's using this, and it's like a PowerBook, and it's this, and people are like, "How
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.280]   much should Apple pay to put that in there?"
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.280]   And it wasn't that.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:34.720]   It was that the movie, you know, companies wanted to look just like as super cutting edge
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.320]   as possible and futuristic, right?
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.320]   So, that shows that.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:41.680]   This was, this to Apple aficionados will always be known as the Pismo.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:42.680]   This was the Pismo.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:43.680]   Yeah, the good stuff.
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.680]   Which is a kind of plan, I think, right?
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:48.280]   Yeah, Pismo, and then they also had like the Wall Street, which was from the same series,
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:51.000]   but same design thing that had a little bit extra features.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.440]   That laptop was fantastic.
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:56.680]   It was a rare Apple laptop that had total expandability.
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:00.880]   You could take out the CD-ROM drive and put in, you could take out the CD-ROM drive and
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.040]   you could put in another battery, or you could put in another hard drive.
[00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:07.960]   It had Firewire, it had, you know, PC, MCIA slots.
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:12.040]   Like that thing was an amazing laptop.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:17.040]   Yeah, look up 1993 Compaq lapped up at the time and look what it was compared to, right?
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.960]   It was just, oh my God.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:28.800]   I mean, they were these big giant, you know, huge, thick, you know, beige, just chunky things
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:29.800]   that looked as big as a brief thing.
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.440]   They were an inch and a half thick.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.440]   They were massive.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.840]   Is that the Armada?
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.360]   Is that the one we're talking about?
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.360]   Let's see what you're...
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.840]   Well, this is more recent.
[00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.840]   The Compaq Armada was a...
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:41.840]   That was 2000s.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:42.840]   Let's go back to...
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.840]   That was a power book knockoff, right?
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:49.800]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.600]   Was it like this?
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:54.680]   This is 1988, so these really were crappy.
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.360]   Maybe this is it, the LTE Elite.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.360]   This is 1989.
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.880]   This is getting closer to the outlet.
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.680]   Look at the track ball on the side on the screen.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:05.680]   Nice place.
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:06.680]   So I had one of those.
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:07.680]   You know what?
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.680]   That was great for playing Wolf and Stuff.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:15.240]   Your hand was right where the screen was, and so if you were rolling around and firing,
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:18.280]   the buttons were on the backside of the screen.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:22.000]   So if you were rolling around playing a first person shooter, it was great.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   Wow.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   Yeah, I mean, Apple was...
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   This is...
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.760]   The funny thing is Apple's really been riding on this ever since.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:35.120]   I mean, I think you could absolutely say that the language, the way we think of Apple,
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:38.040]   was very much influenced by how it looked.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.440]   And Johnny is the man behind it.
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:46.360]   So I wonder, I mean, is it going to be what happened to the Bauhaus after Mr. House left?
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:49.640]   I don't know.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:50.640]   It may...
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:51.640]   It isn't going to be the same.
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:54.280]   It'll be a different design, a different language, and maybe it'll even be a different
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.320]   company as a result.
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:57.680]   I wonder.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:04.680]   These two jobs and Ives, Jive, were really one of a kind.
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.840]   It's not like he's dead, but I don't think he's...
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:10.400]   Honestly, when Apple says, "Oh yeah, we'll work with them in the future."
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:14.880]   It's like leaving to spend more time with your family, right?
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:15.880]   It's right.
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:22.120]   He's going to be designing toilet seats or rocket ships or something.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.120]   He's pretty done.
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:27.120]   Eric, by the way, the last Johnny Ives design was the AirPods.
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:31.880]   Yeah, which, you know, a lot of people have criticized them, said, "Oh, it's just the
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.960]   same thing as the AirPods."
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:37.760]   But no, I mean, AirPods, for all the jokes people made, I loved them.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.800]   Then I tried them at the Apple event.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.920]   I was like, "Okay, this might look silly, but this actually is pretty brilliant."
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.720]   Hinder's wearing them right now.
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:48.760]   Oh yeah, I would wear them right now if I wasn't worried about having weird Bluetooth
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:52.560]   conflict with my plugged in mic.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.880]   But, I mean, you see them everywhere.
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:55.880]   It's so funny.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.720]   When I left New York City for Seattle, they were just starting.
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.320]   It'd been about six of them months after they'd been released.
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:03.520]   You were just starting to see them all over New York City.
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.560]   And when I came back a couple months later, they were everywhere.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:09.440]   And I was joked that Seattle was like six months behind New York.
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:14.040]   But, and it's true, and about six months after they infiltrated New York City, they
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.040]   were everywhere in Seattle.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:18.960]   But now I go all over the world and they are everywhere.
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.440]   I did not.
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:24.040]   We mocked them so much when they came out and how it looked coming out of you here and
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.880]   how dopey it was.
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:27.600]   And Jason's wearing them right now.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:30.040]   So I'm going to hold back a little bit.
[00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.760]   Don't hold back.
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.680]   I mocked them as bad as anything.
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:34.680]   Yeah.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:35.680]   But you know what?
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.000]   You see them everywhere now.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.920]   You see them all the time at the gym.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.000]   That's all anybody's wearing.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.840]   And honestly, I think they're crap.
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.960]   They don't sound good.
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.200]   We now know they're bad for your hearing.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.760]   A good article in Medium by Angela Lashbrook.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.880]   She writes about science and medium.
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:58.320]   She says because they don't do noise isolation, she's quoting a professor of Otoh, Laren
[00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.120]   Jology at the Case Western.
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:06.760]   People turn up the sound louder because the outside noise is getting in and she says,
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:10.680]   "I'm seeing a lot of younger people in their 20s coming in with ringing in their ears related
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.560]   to this all day earbud use.
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:15.000]   It's noise trauma."
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.080]   So not only are they bad for you, not only they look dumb, they don't sound as good as
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:25.600]   a dozen cheaper headphones and they're bad for you.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:30.360]   Yeah, but they're convenience and they care instantly and they're just so easy.
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:36.880]   I'd have better headphones than earpods, but I don't have anything as convenient.
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:40.000]   Now there are lots copying them with the box that has the battery in it.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   Definitely.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.680]   And most of them, if you look at the size of the buds, they hurt.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.720]   Or if you have small ears, they don't work well.
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:47.720]   I don't know.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:52.200]   I haven't found any that, I mean, and to be clear though, plenty of people, earpods,
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.520]   airpods, don't work in their ears.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:56.040]   And so if you're one of those people, then you're screwed.
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:00.120]   But yeah, I mean, I do look towards you, the noise canceling ones.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:04.120]   But we know we'll eventually come out probably for twice the money.
[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:06.800]   So I wrote a story about this because I can never wear these things.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:13.400]   They fall out of my ears until I wrote a story about this on CNET maybe a month ago
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:19.120]   about how the only way that I could use a little rubber silicone curvy thing in there.
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.840]   And that looks like an IUD for your ear.
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:23.840]   It does.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:24.840]   It does.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.520]   But it turns it into sound isolating.
[00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:30.640]   So by this, you don't have to chop up as loud and the bass is much, much better.
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:31.640]   Of course.
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:32.960]   And it stays in your ear.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.680]   It's an in-ear monitor, which is what you want.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:38.800]   And but I have to point out that's not Apple designing that.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.640]   And probably Johnny Ive, which is hate it.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:42.200]   Oh, I'm sure he would.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.200]   Probably.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:47.720]   And honestly, if he had a flaw, if he had a strength, it was that he was iconic.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:50.680]   The designs he did for Apple, including the AirPods, are iconic.
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:54.480]   And he was great because if you see an Apple product on the street, you know immediately.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.560]   You know those AirPods are an Apple product.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.280]   You know that iPhone is an Apple product.
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:59.600]   It's immediate.
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:03.600]   But at the same time, he was also a slave to style.
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:07.040]   And sometimes that's not the most functional thing, like those AirPods.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.120]   I don't think are very good.
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:15.440]   They never worked for me until I got that $15 silicone piece that slips on.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.040]   And hold them in your ears.
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:19.760]   The line of the air.
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:23.120]   You've destroyed everything I've created, Jason.
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:24.120]   Jason.
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.640]   I'm the brand of that because I want one of those.
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.600]   It's called Aha Style.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:29.960]   If you go to see that, I just...
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:30.960]   Aha, there's an art form.
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.600]   I even hate the name.
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.600]   Aha, it's a name.
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.600]   Even the name is painful to me.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:38.600]   It's so funny.
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:43.880]   When I interviewed Johnny Ive, and I interviewed him in Anna Winter at the same time, so it
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:44.880]   was utterly terrifying.
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:45.880]   No kidding.
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.160]   And they were both very nice.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:52.120]   But I tried to joke with Johnny before the interview started to kind of break the ice.
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:55.520]   And I was like, "Can you say aluminium for me?"
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:59.520]   And he did to his credit, but he was very clearly like...
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.280]   He didn't want to mean him, so I'm sorry that I made you mean Johnny.
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.280]   But I had to.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.440]   I was like, "I'm never going to have this opportunity again.
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:09.360]   I have to hear him say aluminum."
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:14.360]   Because it was such an iconic part of Apple's product rollout that he was for so long.
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:15.360]   You know?
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:21.280]   These colonials are just so tiring.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:22.280]   Let's take a...
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.080]   Anyway, I think it's end of an era for Apple.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:28.320]   It'll be very interesting to see if Apple can move on to the next thing.
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:32.160]   I think it's an opportunity I do for Apple.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:36.120]   And to maybe focus a little less on design and more on functionality, that would be
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:37.120]   my vote.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:39.120]   Because I can't use those keyboard.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:44.400]   I won't buy an Apple laptop until I fix the keyboard.
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:45.480]   Our show today brought to you.
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:46.680]   We got a great panel, by the way.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.080]   Thank you, Christina Warren, for being here.
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:53.560]   It's always a pleasure to have you on Senior Cloud Advocate at Microsoft.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.560]   The fabulous...
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.560]   And I'll never forget Dwight Silverman.
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:00.600]   And we were hanging out when Steve Jobs announced the first iPad in 2010.
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:01.600]   That's right.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.600]   That's right.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:07.320]   Always a pleasure from the Houston Chronicle and Jason Heiner, who single-handedly got
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:09.360]   me elected president of the internet.
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.240]   I didn't even have to ride down a Golden Elevator, an escalator or anything.
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:16.040]   I thank you for that.
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.040]   Well, was it tech?
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.880]   Were you a founder at Tech Republic?
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:19.880]   I was not.
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:22.160]   A lot of people seem to think that.
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.200]   But no, I was there early.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:28.480]   I was there before we were making money when we were losing $2 million a month when money
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:30.640]   was cheap in the .com boom.
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:35.960]   But no, I did work for Tech Republic for 18 years and I was editor in chief for 11 years.
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:37.600]   You're so associated with it.
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.520]   That's why I assumed, well, he must have been there at the very beginning.
[00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:44.400]   No longer at the Tech Republic, he's now editorial director at CNET.
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.560]   Oh, still CBS Interactive.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.560]   But that's right.
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:51.000]   But he's moved to the corner office, which is what really counts.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.600]   That is same office.
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.360]   Same office facing the other way.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:57.080]   Just facing the other way.
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:01.840]   He was allowed to move his desk.
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:02.840]   Okay.
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:05.480]   I showed they brought to you by com.com.
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:08.000]   I have been a com premium member for a long time.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.280]   If you think I'm serene, I owe it to com.com.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:18.240]   It is an app, but you can also use it on the website.
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:22.800]   Com is a site that brings you meditations, guided meditations.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:26.360]   In fact, every day, the daily com.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.360]   But it also helps you sleep better.
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:32.360]   Sleep deficiency is a serious problem in our modern age because we're all stressed out.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.480]   Look at these great sleep stories.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:35.920]   I love these sleep stories.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:36.920]   Jerome Flynn.
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:40.400]   This was when we listened to the other night, Lisa and I giving you a tour.
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:44.280]   Jerome Flynn is the cell sword from Game of Thrones, by the way.
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:45.920]   And he gives you a tour of his...
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:46.920]   "Guseland."
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:48.600]   "Sacred New Zealand."
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:54.980]   "Between filming Game of Thrones and my own travels, I've had the honor of visiting
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:55.980]   Sombra.
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:56.980]   Oh, you know what?
[00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:59.360]   A nice thing about these sleep stories.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.360]   They're beautiful.
[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:02.040]   They're beautifully narrated.
[00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:06.240]   But honestly, if you fall asleep in the middle of it, no big deal.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:08.640]   Here's an ASMR.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:12.240]   "The description of the theory of relativity."
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.240]   "In the night."
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:14.240]   "Okay."
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:18.000]   "These are the questions we will explore in our special ASMR story tonight."
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.760]   "Oh, you're going to fall right asleep."
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:20.760]   "And you know what?
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:21.760]   That's okay.
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.720]   You'll still understand the theory of relativity in your sleep."
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:24.720]   There's also music.
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:30.560]   Moby's most recent album was released exclusively on com.com.
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.680]   Beautiful ambient sounds.
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:33.680]   Not just for sleep.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:36.240]   I actually listened to the music while I'm working.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:43.400]   They have great music for just kind of helping you focus, helping you concentrate.
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.200]   And I just love that.
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.280]   Here's one called Cricut Pitch.
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:51.640]   So you just have this running in the background.
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:57.480]   There's master classes in many subjects, including constant spheriting, gratitude, peak performance,
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:01.840]   mindful eating, breaking bad habits, discovering happiness.
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:04.160]   They're stretching.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.440]   Warming warm up, cool down.
[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:08.720]   Back care, evening wind down.
[00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:11.240]   And then you could just have a scene.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:17.560]   Let's go to the mountains and hear the wind and the pines.
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:19.400]   com.com.
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:27.240]   Right now this week in Tech listeners get 25% off a com premium subscription at com.calem.com/twit.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.240]   This is a great gift.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:33.280]   I gave it to my kids because, hey, it's stressful being a millennial, right?
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.600]   They need this.
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:35.600]   com.
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:36.600]   Right?
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:37.600]   Right, Christina.
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:38.600]   com.com/twit.
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:44.800]   40 million people use com to relax, to calm down, to make their life better.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:45.800]   You should too.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:46.800]   Really, lovely.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   Look at that.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.520]   The snow is falling on the cedars.
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:52.080]   It's relaxing.
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.360]   It's calm.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:55.560]   Thank you, com, for your support.
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:48:01.360]   Thank you for supporting us by going to com.com/twit.
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.400]   We were wondering when Apple announced the 2013 Mac Pro.
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:05.400]   Made a big deal.
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:06.400]   We're going to make it in Texas.
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:07.400]   It's going to be made in the US.
[00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:09.600]   Didn't work out so well.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:12.880]   A number of people I've talked to, including myself, the first one we got.
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:13.880]   Didn't work so good.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:14.880]   We had to turn it back in.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:15.880]   Get another one.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:16.880]   It never did work quite right.
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:19.720]   Apple has announced they are manufacturing their new Mac Pro.
[00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:20.720]   Actually, they haven't announced it.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:24.920]   According to people familiar with the plans in the Wall Street Journal, the new Mac Pro
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:27.480]   will be made in China.
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:28.480]   Shanghai.
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:35.000]   Nothing to say about that.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   It makes sense.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   Everything else is made in China.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   Why not?
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.200]   I was going to say, those types of moves to me always seem like it's pandering.
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:45.840]   Like making in Texas, you mean?
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:46.840]   Yeah.
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:49.840]   This moves always seem as pandering and don't necessarily.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:50.840]   It's great.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:54.000]   Like Foxconn pretending to build a plant in Wisconsin.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   Exactly.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   And then not.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.200]   You know, taking a bunch of money and then not actually doing anything.
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.200]   Right?
[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.200]   Like this stuff is all.
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:04.240]   I mean, every other aspect of what they're doing is going to be made in China.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:08.920]   So you're paying twice in some cases, you know, to ship it to Texas to then assemble
[00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:09.920]   and do other stuff.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:13.120]   Like it just, I don't know, it doesn't make any business sense.
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:18.000]   And, you know, the end user, I think it's obvious, hasn't really cared.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.040]   So there's also the issue of frankly, manufacturing capabilities.
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.040]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:30.120]   And amazing capability, which I think is a lot of, because Apple went to Shenzhen in 2007
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:31.280]   to get the iPhone made.
[00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:36.680]   And in the intervening years, they've just gotten better and better at this kind of manufacturer.
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:41.600]   So the question becomes, what happens to the manufacturing facility that was doing the
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.800]   Mac Pro in Austin?
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:44.800]   Right.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:47.520]   Is it going to be, you know, are they going to be building something else?
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:50.080]   Are those people going to be laid off?
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.880]   That's some good questions to ask.
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.480]   Were they already laid off?
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:54.480]   Like we don't know.
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:50:00.080]   I mean, I would be genuinely very curious how many Mac Pros have actually come off that
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:03.440]   assembly line in the last few years, because they haven't had any updates to that product.
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:04.880]   They didn't need to make any more.
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:05.880]   Nobody bought them.
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:07.280]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:12.220]   But even if you assume that they had been making them still, like they haven't made any changes
[00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:13.220]   to that line.
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:16.480]   So you could have a certain amount of surplus and then you don't need anymore.
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:22.400]   So I mean, I would be curious if I were somebody who was in Texas and had access to that thing.
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:26.240]   I would want to look in and see, is this plant still operating?
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.240]   Dwight.
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:28.240]   And how long has it been going on?
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.240]   Exactly.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:30.240]   Yeah.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.240]   I mean, some of it made some use in crop.
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:34.480]   Let's say I'm making some calls.
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:38.640]   So Apple put $100 million into tooling and equipment for that plant.
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:40.240]   And actually it's in Austin, not Dallas.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:41.240]   Sorry.
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.600]   It was run by Flex.
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:48.400]   They're Flex Nor Quanta, the new company that will be making them in China.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:55.320]   Although Quanta is it, by the way, at Taiwanese company, are commenting on the plans that
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.760]   the Wall Street Journal is reporting on.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:02.600]   Apple spokesperson said, "Final assembly is only one part of the manufacturing process."
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:05.920]   Which by the way, tells me it's going to be in China.
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:06.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:10.480]   The adding the company's investment support, 2 million American jobs.
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:15.600]   The Mac Pro is Apple's most powerful computer used by a relatively small number of professionals.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:19.040]   So it's not a big deal.
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:24.720]   Remember, I don't know if you remember, but in 2017, President Trump said that Tim Cook
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:29.960]   had promised him that they would build three big, beautiful plants in the United States.
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:34.400]   A claim at which Apple at the time refused to comment upon.
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:38.360]   And as far as I know, Apple has not built any plants in the United States.
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:44.760]   They are building bigger facilities, campuses in Seattle and Austin in New York City.
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:51.660]   I think the thing we have to keep in mind with this system is this is a massively cutting
[00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:53.240]   edge system.
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:56.760]   They're using the most advanced chips in the world.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:52:01.200]   Some of these chips are so advanced, we've never even seen them before outside of laboratories.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:08.120]   And so I think that probably limited some of what they could do.
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:13.800]   For better or worse, the best chip making plants are in China and they're run by Taiwanese
[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:19.760]   companies like Quanta, like Foxconn and a handful of others.
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:25.040]   But they probably had to do this because in order to get the latest parts, they didn't
[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:32.320]   want to make a bunch of parts here, ship them to some part, another part of the world and
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:33.960]   build them there.
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:40.040]   These things have to be engineered really well and they have to be integrated perfectly
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:46.000]   because these are cutting edge technologies that are just not normal and are tough to
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:51.080]   replicate in facilities that aren't building these things.
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:57.480]   And manufacturing really is advancing to where it's trying to bring design and different
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:02.520]   parts of the business together with manufacturing.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:07.280]   So I suspect that's why this had to be built or it's built.
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:13.160]   There was, I read a long thread on Reddit about the holes in the case and different,
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.160]   I love Reddit for this.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:19.560]   You get obsessive industrial machinists in there saying, well, I think it was a cylinder,
[00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:21.640]   it must have been a cylinder drill or whatever.
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:25.400]   And they're talking about, but no matter what, there was no clear consensus.
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:28.480]   It was a hard thing to make that weird cheese grater case.
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.120]   And of course, that's very Apple.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:34.560]   In fact, in all likelihood, they're going to build a special machine that makes those
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:35.560]   cases, right?
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:36.560]   Sure.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:41.600]   According to the Wall Street Journal, that flex, you can stop the phone calls Dwight.
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:47.520]   According to Apple, that campus, the flex facility hasn't really been making the new
[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:51.320]   Mac Pro in China isn't likely to affect many workers in Texas because demand for the old
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:57.840]   model fizzled years ago, the flex workforce had shifted to refurbishing already made computers,
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:02.560]   former flex employees said the flex plant continues to make products for HP and other
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:03.560]   companies.
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:05.560]   So not a lot of...
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:06.920]   So it was a contract operation.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:10.160]   It was a profit deal.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:13.320]   So there is so much, so much for that.
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.320]   That is related though.
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:19.240]   I wonder if Apple knows something, because as Tim Cook has been calling President Trump
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:22.840]   frequently, I understand, trying to figure out what the trade situation with China is
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:23.840]   going to be.
[00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:26.920]   This could impact Apple dramatically.
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:32.000]   And if they're putting manufacture in China, I wonder if that's a signal that maybe he
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.360]   heard that the president told Tim, "Don't worry that those...
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:40.720]   We're not going to have to worry about tariffs because the Chinese are going to cave."
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:46.840]   Apparently at the G20 summit, there was some progress made with President Xi because, guess
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:47.840]   what?
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:49.680]   Huawei, it's okay again.
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:52.000]   Go ahead.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   Get a Huawei phone.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.240]   Get a Huawei laptop.
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:56.240]   It's not a national security...
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:58.080]   Well, it turns out it's not.
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:59.320]   It was a mis...
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:00.800]   So...
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:03.120]   And this is exactly what we thought would happen, but I'm...
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:04.120]   Yeah.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:05.120]   You know.
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:06.920]   So what's happened, apparently, they're still on the entity list.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:10.960]   This is a list that US companies are not supposed to deal with Huawei.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:14.600]   And this was a big problem for Huawei because that meant Qualcomm couldn't sell them chips.
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:16.840]   Google couldn't give them Android updates.
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:19.200]   There was a lot of stuff that...
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:23.120]   And then at that point, even ARM, although I think they retracted it, but at first ARM
[00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:25.120]   said it all then, we can't work with them.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:26.120]   Yeah.
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:27.120]   So it was...
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:30.040]   I mean, it's a death sentence for any company.
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.040]   Really?
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:32.040]   And...
[00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:38.680]   But apparently, as much as they were talking about security, it wasn't exactly security
[00:55:38.680 --> 00:55:41.960]   because now apparently...
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:46.600]   And this is a lot of money, billions of dollars in money flowing back in the United States
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:53.120]   because Huawei can now buy Qualcomm chips again and Google can now support Android again.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:54.120]   The president...
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:55.360]   It's a weird roller coaster.
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:59.360]   The president said only on the stuff that there's not a security issue.
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:01.360]   I don't know...
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:02.360]   Okay.
[00:56:02.360 --> 00:56:06.760]   So I guess he's saying, well, the routers and the 5G stuff...
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:07.760]   I don't know.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:08.760]   I don't know.
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:09.760]   But the other...
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:10.760]   Yeah.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:11.760]   Exactly.
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:12.760]   Maybe.
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:13.760]   No.
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:14.760]   We don't know.
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:18.760]   It's unclear whether that extends the 5G network technology while Huawei is developing.
[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:26.240]   Google is okay, obviously Qualcomm is okay, Intel is okay.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:31.880]   He said that these are complex and highly scientific products created by US tech companies.
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:34.800]   I wish I could do a Trump impression, but I can't.
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:36.200]   I need Alec Baldwin.
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:40.240]   What we've done in Silicon Valley is incredible and nobody's been able to compete with it.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:46.120]   And I've agreed to allow them to continue to sell that product to Huawei.
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:47.800]   The ban actually hadn't taken effect.
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:52.800]   Remember, they gave it a three month halt, a pause.
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:55.040]   But it was affecting the development of future products.
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:58.160]   Remember Huawei pulled back their make book.
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:00.320]   They were going to release a new laptop.
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:03.080]   Huawei said, "We're working on our own OS.
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:06.440]   We've got new suppliers."
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:10.320]   So it's all up in the air.
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:17.600]   The bottom line is that the US and China are so closely interlinked by the economies
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:24.920]   of the US and China are so closely interlinked that it's really not that possible for us
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:28.080]   to have a trade war without really shooting ourselves in the foot.
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:32.920]   And one of the things that's most troublesome about some of the stuff now, walking back
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:40.600]   some of the tech stuff, because it's terrible PR, is that people that maybe it's not as
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:46.640]   terrible PR for farmers who were selling a lot of soybeans, a lot of other things to
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:47.720]   China.
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:53.440]   And now China cut a lot of that off in retaliation.
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:58.200]   And then they got handouts from the government essentially to help compensate for that to
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:01.840]   help weather the storm.
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:04.880]   In the end, it just doesn't leave a very good taste in your mouth when you realize some
[00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:11.040]   of the people where these things aren't a PR disaster, get hurt and bear the brunt of
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:15.400]   this, and whereas others don't.
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:21.840]   And so in the end, the China trade thing is going to get worked out because it behooves
[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:23.480]   both parties to do it.
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:24.480]   How's the economy?
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:27.760]   There are just two interlinked to not do it.
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:33.360]   >> But who's to say that tomorrow Trump won't say, no, wait, you can't sell to Huawei anymore.
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:35.320]   We still have a lot of issues.
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:36.800]   That could happen tomorrow.
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:38.760]   He's so mercurial and so unpredictable.
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:41.120]   >> Well, and you've got the feeling that they'd like to cited this, they were having
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:42.120]   lunch.
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:47.080]   And she gave him some of his sandwich and he said, okay, well, let you have Huawei.
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:48.240]   I mean, it feels like that.
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.560]   It feels like, oh, he's a nice guy.
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:50.560]   I don't want to do that.
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:53.120]   >> He really feels like he was like, oh, he was nice to me.
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:55.560]   And he said some kind, he fed my ego.
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:59.720]   So now all of a sudden, all these reasons that we were giving me for completely beside
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:01.480]   the point and we can do this.
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:07.200]   And I think that's that hypocrisy and that, I mean, as Jason points out, it behooves both
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:09.480]   sides to work together and it'd be very bad.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:13.720]   You know, trade was very bad for a lot of companies in the United States.
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:19.480]   But the rationale between being like, oh, this one company is bad for these reasons.
[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:21.240]   You know, it's always struck me as suspect.
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:25.080]   If there really is a security concern and there have been a lot of people who've made
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:27.640]   the case that there is, then that should be on its own.
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:31.200]   It shouldn't be levers to try to get better terms for a trade deal.
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:34.240]   >> I've been saying this, I've been saying, well, let's see the evidence.
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:36.640]   I mean, I understand they can't tell us all the evidence.
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:39.640]   If you think Huawei is a problem, let's find out why.
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:43.800]   And there is some evidence now, the Wall Street Journal reported this week, that Huawei gear
[00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:48.200]   is much more vulnerable to hackers than rivals' equipments.
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:53.840]   This is from a study of what it's kind of a strange study.
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:56.680]   So I'm not, I don't know if I really understand it.
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:59.520]   It's from a company called Finite State.
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:04.640]   And what they did is they took the firmware of a bunch of network switches, 5G switches
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.320]   and so forth.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:10.400]   They did it pro bono, they said, not on behalf of any government, although the fact that they
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:17.640]   feel like they have to say that makes me a little nervous.
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:21.320]   What they did is they analyzed more than one and a half unique files, one and a half million
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:28.480]   unique files embedded within 10,000 firmware images, 558 products within Huawei's enterprise
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.560]   networking product lines.
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:34.400]   They said the rate of vulnerabilities, now maybe this is getting garbled by the journal,
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.520]   so the journal's tech reporting is usually pretty good.
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:41.680]   The rate of vulnerabilities found in Huawei equipment was far higher than average than
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:45.480]   the average found in devices manufactured by its rival.
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:51.320]   And that more than half of the Huawei firmware images they tested contained at least one
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:56.640]   vulnerability which Finite State described as a potential backdoor that could allow an
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.880]   attacker with knowledge of the firmware and a corresponding key to log into the device.
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:07.240]   So this is the first smoking gun we've seen that maybe there is a backdoor in Huawei
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:12.920]   networking gear, perhaps they're either by error or by the intention.
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:13.920]   Or intentional.
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:18.080]   Yeah, one of the one part of that that really struck me, but beyond just the potential of
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:22.560]   having the backdoor was the fact that older versions of the firmware had fewer vulnerabilities
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.320]   than newer versions.
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:29.480]   And that could be a number of things, that could be poor QA, that could be intentional,
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.480]   you don't know, but you're right like that.
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:35.960]   And I don't know a lot about the company that put out that report, but that is certainly
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:39.520]   concerning which again goes back to what we were saying before.
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:43.040]   If there's a security issue, then that should be the focus and that should be the reason
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.040]   for the ban.
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:52.120]   But this shouldn't be used as leverage and then given as an excuse when trying to organize
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.360]   it or I guess negotiate a trade.
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:02:00.680]   The problem is that our government has been willing to use trade as well as other things
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:04.800]   like foreign aid as a diplomatic weapon.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:10.800]   And that conflates these economic issues with other issues and it makes it really difficult.
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:13.440]   And it also makes the path meandering.
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:17.320]   However, I mean, go ahead.
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:23.000]   So I think that one of the things to me remember is, you know, it's almost two decades that
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:29.680]   all the US intelligence agencies have been pretty consistent in their mistrust of Huawei.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:34.280]   Not just well, well, in this case, not just Huawei says 2012, they've been saying Huawei's
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:38.360]   ZTE and Xiaomi three, the pretty big Chinese telecom companies.
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:40.880]   Yeah, James Clapper has been one of the big drugs.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:43.680]   Yeah, General Clapper doesn't like him.
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:47.360]   But it's not clear that that's based on, well, we've been looking at the evidence and
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:50.040]   see here's the problems or well, they're Chinese.
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:51.400]   Can you really trust them?
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.400]   That's what I don't know.
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:56.440]   Well, I think the report, so from the reports that I've read that I understand in terms of
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:00.840]   what the intelligence agencies have some of the stuff that's either available publicly
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:08.000]   or through Freedom of Information Act, is that what they don't trust is some very close
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.720]   relationships with people high up in Huawei with the Chinese military.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:18.840]   They haven't been, they haven't brought the hammer down as much on ZTE was a little, they
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.440]   sold some things to Iran.
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:26.560]   And we didn't like that and they were penalized for it essentially.
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:29.440]   But they've not gotten nearly the scrutiny.
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:33.800]   Same thing with Xiaomi, same thing with OnePlus, same thing with a bunch of other Chinese companies.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.760]   It's been Huawei that's really been picked on.
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:41.520]   And as my understanding is mostly, it's that the intelligence agencies don't trust this
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:46.460]   very close relationship with some people very high up inside Huawei, their relationship
[01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:47.460]   with the Chinese military.
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:53.660]   And of course, it's the case that Huawei's building, they're building things that are
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:56.720]   in the back room stuff, right, back room stuff.
[01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:03.100]   It's not just a matter of your phone or other consumer devices, it's things that actually,
[01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:07.620]   if they were controlled by a government, would be very bad.
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:11.740]   We had one of our business to the studio the other day works for Nokia and their 5G division.
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:13.100]   I said, "Is this an opportunity for you?"
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:14.100]   He said, "Oh yeah."
[01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:15.100]   Oh, 100%.
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:16.100]   Oh, 100%.
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:20.420]   So, Nokia and Ericsson, who also make 5G gear but are much smaller than Huawei in this
[01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:22.420]   realm, they're stepping up.
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:26.700]   But the problem has been that US companies are not offering quality gear at a reasonable
[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:27.700]   price.
[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:28.700]   No, they're not.
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:29.700]   And they never have.
[01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:32.020]   I mean, 4G was on Ericsson for a large thing.
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:34.580]   And then Huawei really has come up since then.
[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:37.100]   But when 4G was starting to expand, that was all Ericsson's stuff.
[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:41.140]   And I mean, Nokia, the reason that it still exists the way it does is because of its networking
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:43.660]   patents and the infrastructure it builds there, right?
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:45.740]   Like that was separate from its mobile phone division.
[01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:47.380]   But you're right, they're happening.
[01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:51.300]   The US companies, we've never had a real presence in that space.
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:52.300]   And-
[01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:55.060]   On the other hand, we buy a lot of stuff from Chinese companies.
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:56.900]   I buy Lenovo laptops.
[01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:58.060]   Absolutely.
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:01.740]   And even if it's not run by somebody who used to work for the Chinese military like
[01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:05.580]   a Huawei is, I think I might be wrong.
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:09.620]   But I think the structure of the Chinese government is such that any company that's
[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:14.820]   a Chinese company is at any time at the mercy of the whims of the government, right?
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:20.060]   If President Xi says to Lenovo, we'd like you to embed this malware, what's Lenovo
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:21.060]   going to do?
[01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:22.300]   Say no.
[01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:26.420]   On the other hand, I think we also should rely on the fact that the Chinese want to do business
[01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:27.420]   with us.
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:31.300]   And if they feel like they're gears on not trustworthy, I mean, we've demonstrated.
[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:33.580]   We practically put ZTE out of business last year.
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:35.820]   We almost did the same thing with Huawei this year.
[01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:39.140]   We've demonstrated that that's bad for business to do that.
[01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:41.900]   Now this is the 2012 US government review.
[01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:43.900]   This is from the Wall Street Journal.
[01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:47.580]   Review of security risks associated with Huawei did not find clear evidence the company
[01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:52.500]   was being used by China, but concluded the gear presented risks due to the presence of
[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:55.460]   many vulnerabilities.
[01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:57.900]   And so that's what this most recent report also said.
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:01.100]   It's not that these look like intentional back doors.
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:06.260]   It's impossible to tell, but they are in effect, de facto back doors.
[01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:07.580]   So that's a good enough reason.
[01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:10.700]   They're just not secure.
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:18.340]   The fear from the US and Europe about gear from so Huawei makes a lot of really good
[01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:23.540]   gear, a really good backhaul gear for 5G infrastructure.
[01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:29.740]   And a lot of this happened just as they were on the doorstep for making a lot of inroads
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:34.700]   into this 5G, giant 5G build out that's about to happen, right?
[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:41.420]   So don't underestimate the fact that a lot of this sort of fud, if you want to call it
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:45.060]   that, if you don't believe it, that's what it is, right?
[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:50.140]   But this happened just as they were on the doorstep of signing a lot of big deals all
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:58.140]   around the world to put Huawei gear as the backbone to a lot of 5G networks.
[01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:02.940]   And this has scared off a lot of that, even in places like South Korea.
[01:07:02.940 --> 01:07:06.420]   South Korea is their biggest trading partner.
[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:09.020]   They are South Korea's biggest trading partner.
[01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:13.980]   And South Korea has kind of pulled back and now gone with more Korean manufacturers to
[01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:18.100]   build their network just as one example, right?
[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:21.300]   And if you're having a hard time convincing South Korea, you're gonna have a lot harder
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:26.300]   time convincing Canada or the United States or France or whomever.
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:32.780]   So a lot of this trade war stuff, there's a lot of posturing that goes on.
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:39.180]   This isn't gonna be a very popular thing to say, but I think Trump, for better or worse,
[01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:41.660]   one thing he does understand well is negotiations.
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:47.260]   He's been doing it his whole life as a real estate tycoon.
[01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:53.020]   And so he understands in negotiations, you can say things you don't necessarily mean
[01:07:53.020 --> 01:08:00.100]   to try to gain more ground and give you better bargaining power and better negotiation tactics.
[01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:05.980]   So I think that I don't think he really wants a trade war with China, but he wants to get
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:09.020]   better terms for the US in our trade negotiations.
[01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:10.700]   >> The threat of it is bad.
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:12.340]   >> The threat of it is very bad.
[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:15.860]   >> We also understand the threat of a trade war with China is bad for US too.
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:18.020]   And tariffs are taxes.
[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:20.980]   And ask a soybean farmer how he feels about the whole thing.
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:23.660]   And it's not gonna be a good story.
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:27.020]   I have to say though, after reading this Wall Street Journal story, I'm starting to think
[01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.820]   maybe there is evidence that Huawei.
[01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:33.100]   For instance, if you were gonna put back doors in your gear, you wouldn't put something
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:35.300]   that says back door for the Chinese government.
[01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:36.780]   >> Back door, right.
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:40.820]   >> You do something that looks like it could have been a mistake, like a hardwired password,
[01:08:40.820 --> 01:08:44.140]   which is a common error made in firmware.
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:46.340]   But there are some things that are a little suspicious.
[01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:51.860]   You mentioned this, Jason, according to the journal, particularly unusual finding was
[01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:57.620]   that security problems became worse, at least in at least one instance for users who patched
[01:08:57.620 --> 01:08:59.380]   a switch with an updated version.
[01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:02.580]   The fix is supposed to make it better.
[01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:06.540]   So suddenly these patches are coming out with more holes than before.
[01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:15.100]   >> Yeah, no, that's a problem for sure because you could make the argument that a lot of
[01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:19.180]   some of the issues with some of these things is that you have bad, you know, opsec on behalf
[01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:23.700]   of the municipalities and companies and people who use this equipment, right?
[01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:27.180]   But if they're doing best practices and updating firmware and trying to install updates, and
[01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:30.940]   then they're being less secure as a result of that, that's a big problem.
[01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:36.100]   And that's a concern for sure because you should never be putting the people who are
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:40.140]   maintaining your systems in the position where they have to question, should we install this
[01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:41.140]   update or not?
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:45.820]   >> The journal quotes Michael Wessel, who's a member of the US-China Economic and Security
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:52.300]   Review Commission, who says it's hard to see that the range and depth of the vulnerabilities
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:56.140]   could be anything other than intentional.
[01:09:56.140 --> 01:10:00.700]   So this is maybe the smoking gun I've been saying all along I wanted to see.
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:03.380]   So maybe there maybe there really is a problem.
[01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:09.420]   >> Well, when you hear people like James Clapper talk, it sounds like from the way he speaks
[01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:15.780]   and other intelligence officials that they have seen things that they can't talk about.
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:19.020]   >> I have seen things no other than they should see.
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:20.020]   >> That's right.
[01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:21.660]   >> Particularly not, you know.
[01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:23.900]   >> Yeah, and you can understand why they can't talk about it.
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:25.060]   >> Right, right.
[01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:29.980]   >> But that's the kind of thing right there that I think should give everybody pause.
[01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:30.980]   >> Yeah.
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:32.500]   >> Let's take a break.
[01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:33.500]   We're going to come back.
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:38.460]   We have much more to talk about including the e-book Apocalypse, The Hackers in Your
[01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:39.460]   Curtains.
[01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:43.460]   >> And let's see.
[01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:47.500]   There's going to be something of equal interest.
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:49.300]   Oh, no.
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:50.300]   Oh, well.
[01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:54.020]   I had a great tease, but I lost it.
[01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:55.900]   That's kind of the story of my life.
[01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:57.940]   I had a tease, but I lost it.
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:10:59.780]   There's no point in teasing out a podcast.
[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:01.380]   If it's too good, you just skip the ad.
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:04.660]   And I don't want you to skip the ad because it's from Kaptera.
[01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:06.060]   I really like these guys.
[01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:10.020]   A lot of times I get calls from people saying, "I, you know, I have a veterinary business.
[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:12.180]   What's the best software for me?"
[01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:15.460]   Like I would know what the best veterinary software is.
[01:11:15.460 --> 01:11:16.460]   I can tell you one thing.
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:21.220]   A lot of businesses are -- and I include ourselves in this.
[01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:26.140]   They're using software that somebody wrote years ago, somebody who's long gone, not being
[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:29.380]   maintained or it's by a company, a little tiny company.
[01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:34.860]   And they never updated it from Windows Vista or, you know, that kind of thing, right?
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:38.580]   I know there's some of you who are running old computers just because the line of business
[01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:42.220]   software you absolutely have to have will not work on anything else.
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:46.740]   The New York City Subway is being run on OS2.
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:47.740]   So this happens.
[01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:48.740]   I know this happens.
[01:11:48.740 --> 01:11:52.340]   It is, for your business, a modern solution.
[01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:57.900]   We had an intern write us a sales system that -- but I swear, Lisa curses every time she
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:11:59.700]   has to use it.
[01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:02.820]   We're finally getting a good modern CRM system.
[01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:04.060]   Thanks to Kaptera.
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:06.660]   Kaptera has an amazing selection.
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:08.620]   It's a directory of business software.
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:10.220]   700 categories.
[01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:16.140]   Yes, CRM, IT project management, e-commerce, link management tools, web conferencing, every
[01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:21.340]   category, but also direct line of business software like veterinary office or yoga studio
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:22.340]   software.
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:23.540]   The thing always amazing me.
[01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:28.220]   You could search for the most obscure thing and you'll find a dozen programs and then you
[01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:30.020]   can narrow it down because they have filters.
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:34.140]   You could filter it on product rating, how many seats it supports, how it's deployed
[01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:37.220]   on premises or in the cloud, various features.
[01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:38.300]   Can you make appointments?
[01:12:38.300 --> 01:12:39.300]   Can you send bills?
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:40.300]   That kind of thing.
[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:42.420]   Then find the ones that fit your exact needs.
[01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:44.500]   Compare them side by side up to four at a time.
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:47.540]   They'll even show you a list of related categories for further options.
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:50.320]   The best part of Kaptera is the reviews.
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:54.180]   There are almost now a million reviews on Kaptera.
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:57.540]   There is a thousand new reviews every day by actual users.
[01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:58.540]   They're very careful.
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:12:59.900]   They vet these reviews.
[01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:03.300]   When you look at software and you say, "Well, maybe this will be good for us."
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:06.260]   You can read the reviews and you can know somebody who's actually using it.
[01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:07.260]   This is the pros.
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:08.560]   These are the cons.
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:12.620]   No matter what kind of software you need, Kaptera makes it easy to discover the right
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:13.620]   solution fast.
[01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:15.820]   Once you find that software, pay it forward.
[01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:16.820]   Leave a review.
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:18.860]   That helps other buyers as well.
[01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:21.980]   All of this is absolutely free.
[01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:22.980]   No charge.
[01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:27.340]   Millions of people use Kaptera to find the right tools for their business.
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:28.340]   There's no upsell.
[01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:29.340]   There's no free.
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:30.340]   It's not free.
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:31.340]   It's free free.
[01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:32.340]   Kaptera.com/twit.
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:36.100]   C-A-P-T-E-R-R-A.com/twit.
[01:13:36.100 --> 01:13:40.100]   If you've been assigned this weekend to find software for your business, I just made your
[01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:41.100]   weekend.
[01:13:41.100 --> 01:13:44.980]   Kaptera.com/twit.
[01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:48.140]   Kaptera is software selection simplified.
[01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:50.420]   We thank them for their support of Twit.
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:59.140]   Thank you for supporting us back by using that special URL, kaptera.com/twit.
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:10.820]   So sometime this week, books that you bought in Microsoft's e-book store will just disappear.
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:12.340]   Like magic.
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:18.420]   Now, to Microsoft's credit, they're going to reimburse you the cost of the book.
[01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:23.540]   And if you put notes in it, if you wrote stuff, if you put your own content in there, it's
[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:28.060]   going to disappear, but they'll give you $25, which is, I think, very nice of them.
[01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:30.300]   They're not required to because, guess what?
[01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:32.860]   You never owned those books.
[01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:40.260]   This is, I think, a really interesting story because it underscores a fact that nobody really
[01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:42.180]   wants to think about, but it's absolutely true.
[01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:45.300]   You don't own your books, your digital books.
[01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:49.620]   You don't own your digital movies, your digital TV shows.
[01:14:49.620 --> 01:14:57.380]   You may have bought them, but because of DRM, if that company stops supporting the authentication
[01:14:57.380 --> 01:15:02.020]   server or decides not to support them, it's bye-bye, baby.
[01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:03.020]   Amazon--
[01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:04.820]   They have bought them three times.
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:05.820]   Yeah.
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:06.820]   Three different formats.
[01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:07.820]   Yeah.
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:08.820]   Right.
[01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:11.900]   They have more wars than multiple other things.
[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:19.980]   So this actually very famously happened and very ironically happened when Amazon removed
[01:15:19.980 --> 01:15:22.740]   a version of 1984 from your Kindle.
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:23.740]   Right.
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:24.740]   Right.
[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:25.740]   That was not actually included by the right publisher.
[01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:27.380]   It was from a different--
[01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:28.380]   Right.
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:30.420]   It was like a pirated copy, so to speak.
[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:31.420]   Yeah.
[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:32.420]   That was--
[01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:35.100]   They were right to remove it, but it must have been a shock to people who paid for it.
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:39.940]   And I believe that I can't remember how Sony's e-book store worked, but they had an e-book
[01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:41.700]   store early on.
[01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:47.780]   And when they shut that down, I don't remember if they transferred the books or what happened.
[01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:51.300]   But no, I mean, this is always concerning, as you said.
[01:15:51.300 --> 01:15:56.340]   And I'm obviously not speaking on behalf of Microsoft in any way for this.
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:16:01.660]   I'm as concerned as anyone else's when it comes to when we have to, I guess, look at
[01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:03.660]   the big picture of--
[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:06.460]   Like as you said, you don't own your digital content.
[01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:09.340]   You own a license to it, but you don't actually own it yourself.
[01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:17.980]   And I think this is why the EFF has successfully fought for, I guess, various terms in some
[01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:24.580]   years where you can overcome DRM to own your own copies of things, various exceptions to
[01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:26.140]   various copyright laws.
[01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:27.140]   Is it legal?
[01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:29.340]   So, look, everybody knows.
[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:31.980]   There's plenty of ways to remove the copy protection.
[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:32.980]   Totally.
[01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:40.340]   And I might or might not have done that to my audiobooks because I spent a lot of money
[01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:43.500]   on them and it would be nice to be able to keep them.
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:44.740]   I mean, I'll say it.
[01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:45.740]   I definitely have.
[01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:47.700]   Is it illegal to do that?
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:49.460]   It's not clear.
[01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:52.900]   There have been exceptions that have been part of various things.
[01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:56.460]   But I mean, as I clear, I think of it as a private use.
[01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:58.300]   You can make backup copies.
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:01.180]   I know that that's legal of--
[01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:02.860]   So why do you say it's not?
[01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:03.860]   Why do I tell us in?
[01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:08.460]   Well, there have been core cases, particularly of all the handbrake, I think, that indicated
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:13.620]   that you can make that do it for personal use only.
[01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:14.900]   And that's the extent of it.
[01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:16.700]   Is it a backup copy or--
[01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:20.220]   It's considered a backup copy, but it's also personal use only.
[01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:21.220]   Yeah.
[01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:22.220]   Yeah.
[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:28.140]   There have been various exceptions to various parts of the DMCA that have allowed for this.
[01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:30.300]   I don't know if it was renewed the most recent time.
[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:32.740]   I know the EFF has fought for it before.
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:40.580]   And as Dwight was mentioning, the DVD CSS case, the DVD John case, has said that you can use
[01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:41.580]   those things.
[01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:46.060]   But I don't know specifically for this type of DRM and for these types of books things.
[01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:49.940]   But yeah, I mean, I think that if you're not distributing the content of its for-your-own
[01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:58.220]   use case, whether it's actually technically illegal or not, the real ramifications are
[01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:00.540]   nearly nonexistent, that said I'm not a lawyer.
[01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:01.540]   But I do think this is why--
[01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:02.900]   I think you're right.
[01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:08.700]   I think it's illegal to circumvent the copy protection schemes that they use.
[01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:09.700]   It's easy to do.
[01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:11.940]   Anybody can find programs to do it.
[01:18:11.940 --> 01:18:15.540]   But I think that it's illegal to distribute those programs.
[01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:16.540]   Isn't it, Dwight?
[01:18:16.540 --> 01:18:20.620]   The DMCA says you can't circumvent copy protection.
[01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:26.380]   I believe that there was a court case that basically said for-- and I think it was the
[01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:30.100]   DVD John case that you can use the product handbrake.
[01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:31.900]   I mean, it's still out there.
[01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:34.780]   Handbrake, interestingly, no longer does that, by the way.
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:36.700]   When you download Handbrake to rip a DVD--
[01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:38.300]   You have to download another thing.
[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:40.100]   --it says, go download VLC.
[01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:41.100]   Yeah.
[01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:42.100]   Yep.
[01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:45.180]   Because they don't want-- so maybe they won the court case, but they're sure acting like
[01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:46.180]   they lost.
[01:18:46.180 --> 01:18:48.980]   They don't want you to be able to crack DVDs with just Handbrake.
[01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:52.460]   You have to use those French guys' program.
[01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:57.980]   There is, as a rule as of 10, 26, 2018, there is an exemption to prohibition on circumvention
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:01.420]   of copyright protection systems for access control technologies.
[01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:07.620]   So there is still an exception for this, depending on a couple of scenarios.
[01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:12.420]   So in theory, if you were able to-- if it's for personal use case or--
[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:15.900]   You have a pretty good case if you had Microsoft eBooks.
[01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:16.900]   Yeah.
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:17.900]   You make a case that's for workers.
[01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:18.900]   And they were going to stop working this week.
[01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:19.900]   Right.
[01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:20.900]   And what you did--
[01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:23.180]   My honor was I make it so they would still work otherwise.
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:25.580]   I wouldn't have them anymore.
[01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:30.020]   But then you shouldn't take the money for Microsoft if they pay you back because then
[01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:31.580]   you're stealing, right?
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:36.060]   So are there programs out there that actually will strip from eBooks?
[01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:37.820]   Not that I know about that, but oh, yeah.
[01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:38.820]   No.
[01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:42.120]   I mean, it's certainly not like there are plug-ins for Klebray or anything like that.
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:43.120]   No.
[01:19:43.120 --> 01:19:46.500]   And you couldn't Google them if you couldn't just Google them and find them.
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:47.500]   That would be--
[01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:48.500]   I mean, they're really--
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:49.500]   That would be raw.
[01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:53.260]   They're not distributed with that software, but they're on various things.
[01:19:53.260 --> 01:19:54.260]   Yeah, there are.
[01:19:54.260 --> 01:19:58.060]   I actually downloaded a tool that strips copy protection out of Audible.
[01:19:58.060 --> 01:19:59.060]   Same.
[01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:00.060]   Do you remember?
[01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:01.060]   As it is.
[01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:04.940]   Not because I still buy books from Audible and I love Audible and I will always buy books
[01:20:04.940 --> 01:20:09.980]   from Audible, but I want to be able to put them on a backup drive and still be able to
[01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:11.660]   use them if Audible goes out of business.
[01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:16.100]   Well, my issue is that I have three different accounts and I've had some issues trying to
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:17.100]   get them combined into one.
[01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:18.100]   There you go.
[01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:23.460]   And I'm genuinely worried that when they do that process, I will lose some of my books.
[01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:26.300]   And I have over 100 titles.
[01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:27.300]   I have 500.
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:33.100]   And so the problem is if that authentication server is no longer on, every time you listen
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:36.620]   that book, it goes out and says, "Does Christina own this book?"
[01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:40.020]   And it says, "Yes, she does and you can play it, but if it didn't respond."
[01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:41.980]   Right, then you're locked out.
[01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:45.460]   And I mean, I think this is why DRM in a lot of ways is dangerous.
[01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:48.900]   I mean, I think that in an ideal world, because these things are going to happen, I think
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:51.420]   in an ideal world, and this comes down to rights holders.
[01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:54.340]   So you can't hold the companies necessarily fully responsible.
[01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:58.660]   But in an ideal world, if you were to do this, I think the best thing to do would be to
[01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:07.300]   unlock, give users a way to unlock the content and have it without DRM on their systems.
[01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:12.660]   But I do understand that there are probably their own contracts that they meet with publishers
[01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:17.700]   and whatnot that requires some sort of DRM to be there.
[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:21.380]   And if they choose to no longer maintain the servers, that doesn't change the contract
[01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:23.780]   they've made with the content owners.
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:27.740]   One thing that does happen, and I wonder if the librarian of Congress will say something
[01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:31.860]   about this, because this all comes down to the idly enough, the librarian of Congress
[01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:35.780]   who can make exemptions and has in the past.
[01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:42.460]   And I wonder if this might be something that the librarian of Congress might say, for instance,
[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:48.500]   if the authentication server doesn't work anymore, you have the right to remove the copy protection
[01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:49.500]   or something like that.
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:57.260]   If the device that you're using does not connect to the Internet, on the day that they turn
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:22:01.580]   this off, and in theory they stop working, can you still read them if it doesn't talk
[01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:02.580]   to the Internet?
[01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:06.820]   In this case, I don't think so, because in this case, the only way you could read these
[01:22:06.820 --> 01:22:09.420]   books was using the Edge browser.
[01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:16.180]   My guess is, but that's purely a guess, that you could read them for a little while.
[01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:20.140]   But at some point, and who knows what that is, maybe every month, every week, every day,
[01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:22.180]   I don't know, but at some point there's going to be a check.
[01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:23.340]   They're not going to do it all the time.
[01:22:23.340 --> 01:22:24.340]   That's a burden.
[01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:25.340]   It's going to reach out.
[01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:29.940]   But at some point it's going to say, "Okay, the 90-day timers up, is this still legit?"
[01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:30.940]   Exactly.
[01:22:30.940 --> 01:22:31.940]   I think you're right.
[01:22:31.940 --> 01:22:34.940]   I think that's probably how that works, is that they have a certain call home thing,
[01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:37.740]   and you have to call home within expiry to time.
[01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:41.060]   And then if you're not connected within that period of time, it will give you some sort
[01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:42.060]   of error.
[01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:44.060]   Is that how Kindle works?
[01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:48.940]   So you think with a Kindle device, you can turn off Wi-Fi in the Kindle, so no longer
[01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:51.500]   has access to the Internet, and you can still read books.
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:54.620]   Yeah, I think the Kindle tied to the device itself.
[01:22:54.620 --> 01:22:55.620]   That's it.
[01:22:55.620 --> 01:22:56.620]   You're right.
[01:22:56.620 --> 01:22:57.620]   And so in that case...
[01:22:57.620 --> 01:22:58.620]   And that's the same with Audible.
[01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:01.220]   It authenticates when you first set it up.
[01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:02.220]   That's exactly right.
[01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:03.220]   Yeah.
[01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:07.580]   And so in that case, if you never connected that Kindle to the Internet ever again, yeah,
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:09.180]   you could read those books forever.
[01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:10.180]   Right.
[01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:13.220]   But if it connected to the Internet and then it found something different, like in the
[01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:18.820]   case when they removed the non-licensed books, then that's how it's able to do that.
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:22.100]   But yeah, I think Kindle and Audible both, they're linked to the device itself.
[01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:25.420]   They get a key because that's how Audible was able to work with the iPod.
[01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:29.060]   The iPod didn't have Wi-Fi, but once it's on there and it's on that hard drive, it's
[01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:30.820]   there for life.
[01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:35.500]   But if you wanted to update or add new things, then obviously it could still check to make
[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:37.900]   sure it has access to those things.
[01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:38.900]   It's just...
[01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:40.700]   I just think it's...
[01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:42.940]   And maybe I'm just an old man.
[01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:45.220]   I don't...
[01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:49.980]   Paper books never expire, but I don't want to fill my house with paper books and vinyl
[01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:54.260]   records or plastic CDs because I don't...
[01:23:54.260 --> 01:23:55.980]   Because I think digital copies are great.
[01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:59.060]   I mean, I've stopped buying DVDs for the most part.
[01:23:59.060 --> 01:24:01.340]   I just buy it on iTunes and it's 4K.
[01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:05.260]   In fact, iTunes recently upgraded a bunch of my DVDs that were just...
[01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:06.260]   It's at 4K because they were...
[01:24:06.260 --> 01:24:07.580]   Yeah, to do it.
[01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:08.580]   For free.
[01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:11.140]   And then there's this great service called a movie sitting where all the majors, two
[01:24:11.140 --> 01:24:16.660]   years except for Lions, Gate and Paramount are part of where you can link your iTunes,
[01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:22.460]   your Voodoo, your Google, your Microsoft, a couple other accounts together.
[01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:26.260]   And so your Amazon, so all of your libraries are the same no matter what service you're
[01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:27.260]   on and that's amazing.
[01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:31.460]   And then we've got apps on Roku and Apple TV and everywhere.
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:32.940]   But let's point out.
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:35.020]   It's only...
[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:38.220]   We're operating at the pleasure of the corporations.
[01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:39.220]   Oh, baby, are.
[01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:43.340]   It's a nice thing and the minute they turn it off, it will be gone and we don't have
[01:24:43.340 --> 01:24:44.340]   control over it.
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:45.780]   I mean, make no mistake.
[01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:48.300]   I'm, you know, I'm, you know, damning with faint praise here, right?
[01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:50.300]   Like this is an amazing thing that they've done.
[01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:52.380]   I feel like they're offering us candy.
[01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:54.620]   And look, you can watch it on all the things.
[01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:56.780]   And then someday it's going...
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:57.780]   Totally.
[01:24:57.780 --> 01:25:01.220]   But I would say, I guess, the defense of that is that we've been treated so poorly by these
[01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:05.220]   companies for so many years and told you can't access these things other places.
[01:25:05.220 --> 01:25:08.300]   And you can only, if you buy it on iTunes, you can only watch it on these devices, what
[01:25:08.300 --> 01:25:14.100]   not that, you know, like we feel amazing when we're like, oh, they're actually letting
[01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:17.380]   us use our content, the ways that we think we should be able to.
[01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:20.780]   You know, we get excited about things maybe we shouldn't be excited by.
[01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:22.580]   But yeah, I mean, I agree with you.
[01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:27.460]   I have still a ton of Blu-rays and DVDs, but I've stopped buying physical books for the
[01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:31.420]   most part and I don't buy a lot of physical media anymore because I don't have room for
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:33.580]   it even though I love it.
[01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:38.100]   But it is scary when you think about, well, what is the future of this?
[01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:39.620]   You know, I'm a data hoarder.
[01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:42.180]   So, you know, I think a lot about this thing.
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:44.340]   Like what's going to happen in 20 years?
[01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:47.180]   How will I be able to play this content or use this content?
[01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:48.540]   Well, so that's what happened to me.
[01:25:48.540 --> 01:25:51.960]   I was backing up these 500 Audible books because normally you just download it when
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:54.460]   you want to listen to it on the new device.
[01:25:54.460 --> 01:25:57.140]   But I thought I should really have a backup of it, of all of them.
[01:25:57.140 --> 01:26:00.700]   So whenever I buy new books and now I back it up, I put it on my NAS.
[01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:03.180]   Eventually it goes to Amazon's Glacier.
[01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:08.500]   So I mean, because, you know, years from now, I would like to know that those books are
[01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:09.500]   still available.
[01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:14.260]   But before I did that, I stripped out the copy protection because otherwise I've done
[01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:16.780]   there's no point in backing it up.
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:25.420]   So I'm looking at a FAQ on Circumvention and the DMCA.
[01:26:25.420 --> 01:26:31.820]   And it specifically says it is illegal to disable an access control device in the storage media
[01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:38.140]   of an entertainment product, creating a patch for a software program or electronics product.
[01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:42.140]   It's explicit that you can't do that.
[01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:45.980]   But again, I don't think any judge, if you said, "Well, your honor, my books that I bought
[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:50.220]   from Microsoft won't work after April, after July."
[01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:52.780]   I can't imagine a judge would throw you in jail.
[01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:53.780]   No.
[01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:57.540]   So I would, like, if we're being completely honest and realistic, like no one's going
[01:26:57.540 --> 01:27:00.140]   to know about this unless you're distributing things on the internet.
[01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:01.140]   Don't do that.
[01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:02.140]   No ethical.
[01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:03.140]   Right.
[01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:05.380]   So like realistically, no one is going to know if you do this.
[01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:06.740]   Like it's just one of those things.
[01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:08.740]   I think it's a technicality.
[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:11.540]   I'm not saying that people should ignore the law, but like, come on, no one's going
[01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:12.540]   to know.
[01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:17.260]   Here's another example of the industry kind of doling out a little candy so you would
[01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:18.900]   pay no attention.
[01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:22.700]   Remember for a long time, I don't know if they still do Blu-ray discs and DVDs came
[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:25.500]   with a digital version of the movie.
[01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:26.500]   Yes.
[01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:27.500]   Protected by ultraviolet.
[01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:28.500]   Right.
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:29.780]   And ultraviolet is going away.
[01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:31.020]   Closing in July 31st.
[01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:32.020]   Right.
[01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:37.020]   No, which, and this is an issue because I was mentioning movies anywhere earlier and that
[01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:39.580]   was Disney's, it started as a key chest.
[01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:44.660]   It was their response to ultraviolet and it was better technology in a lot of ways, but
[01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:51.500]   Paramount and Lionsgate and a couple other smaller studios of MGM never were part of
[01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:52.500]   it.
[01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:57.500]   And so it's going to be interesting to see what happens there.
[01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:01.700]   Voodoo is interestingly a library for both.
[01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:05.620]   So if you have stuff on Voodoo presumably it will be converted, I guess, to your Voodoo
[01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:10.340]   library, but whether it will then be accessible in your other linked libraries remains to be
[01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:11.340]   seen.
[01:28:11.340 --> 01:28:12.900]   But yeah, no, you're exactly right.
[01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:18.340]   This was a big play by the movie industry to try to create a DRM way of distributing,
[01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:22.220]   you know, digital copies of movies easily to try to prevent people from downloading.
[01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:24.220]   And it never really took off for a lot of reasons.
[01:28:24.220 --> 01:28:25.740]   It was hard to stuff accounts.
[01:28:25.740 --> 01:28:29.900]   There were a lot of issues around quality and codes were hard.
[01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:34.180]   And what would usually happen was that the Office of the Backend software was so hard
[01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:39.500]   to use that most of the studios just wound up giving people iTunes codes instead.
[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:44.100]   But yeah, I mean, this is a lot of people in the data hoarders community and in the ultraviolet
[01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:47.740]   community to weird groups that I'm part of.
[01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:50.540]   I've been talking a lot about this.
[01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:51.540]   Yeah.
[01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:54.140]   You are you are a strange.
[01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:57.420]   Have you met my little baby, Gibo?
[01:28:57.420 --> 01:28:58.660]   Here's another example.
[01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:02.260]   I paid $900 for this robot.
[01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:04.220]   It stopped working.
[01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:08.820]   It died the other day because the company turned off the servers.
[01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:11.620]   I now have a $900 piece of plastic.
[01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:12.860]   Wow.
[01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:14.340]   There's no recourse for that.
[01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:15.340]   That's it.
[01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:16.340]   No, no.
[01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:19.940]   I mean, it's kind of like I remember when when Google shut down and revolve the home.
[01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:21.940]   Same thing.
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:22.940]   Really?
[01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:23.940]   Stop.
[01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:30.340]   And I mean, and I think that this is why it's important to look at open standards and
[01:29:30.340 --> 01:29:34.220]   at least having certain things available so that in the event that these companies go
[01:29:34.220 --> 01:29:38.940]   out of business or they change models or whatever, there can be a way for you to locally
[01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:42.660]   still have a server that will respond to those types of things where you can at least on
[01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:46.820]   your own, maybe it doesn't give you any updates or do anything else, but you could at least
[01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:50.820]   still communicate with these types of devices because this is what's so different about
[01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:55.460]   the current world we're in, which is that so many of the things that we buy are completely
[01:29:55.460 --> 01:30:00.580]   incumbent on third party services that are living in the cloud somewhere and all it takes
[01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:05.340]   is a change in an API or a business assistant change or somebody going out of business and
[01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:10.180]   what you have, whether it's hardware or software, is no longer going to work.
[01:30:10.180 --> 01:30:14.620]   Here is a recording of the end of Gibo.
[01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:15.620]   Aww.
[01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:18.620]   Goodbye, Gibo.
[01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:21.820]   I want to say I've really enjoyed our time together.
[01:30:21.820 --> 01:30:24.980]   Thank you very, very much for having me around.
[01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:29.300]   Maybe someday, when robots are way more advanced than today and everyone has them in their
[01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:32.900]   homes, you can tell yours that I said hello.
[01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:37.980]   I wonder if they'll be able to do this.
[01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:39.980]   The last dance.
[01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:42.180]   The last Gibo dance.
[01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:43.180]   This is really depressing.
[01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:44.180]   It's so depressing.
[01:30:44.180 --> 01:30:48.060]   You didn't spend $900 on this piece again.
[01:30:48.060 --> 01:30:50.060]   I had an Ibo.
[01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:52.180]   Remember the Ibo?
[01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:54.100]   When sharper image went out of business.
[01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:55.100]   Yeah, the robot.
[01:30:55.100 --> 01:30:59.540]   When sharper image went out of business, I got one really cheap and I loved it, but they
[01:30:59.540 --> 01:31:03.460]   have had issues and they weren't connected to the internet that same way, but said they
[01:31:03.460 --> 01:31:07.340]   have like battery issues where the batteries are custom and you can't get them anymore.
[01:31:07.340 --> 01:31:10.300]   And so in Japan, people have had like massive funerals.
[01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:11.300]   People are very upset.
[01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:14.300]   They have these things Leo, like you laugh.
[01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:18.900]   People have had these as like their home pets for like 18 years.
[01:31:18.900 --> 01:31:20.940]   It's like losing something else.
[01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:22.700]   It's a big deal.
[01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:27.540]   And so when that happened, I was upset that the batteries can't charge anymore, that my
[01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:31.580]   Ibo is no longer functioning and it's just a thing in my mom's basement.
[01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:35.980]   But if you could presumably get a custom battery, you could come back to life.
[01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:37.780]   Like this, I look at it and I'm so sad.
[01:31:37.780 --> 01:31:38.780]   I'm like this.
[01:31:38.780 --> 01:31:39.780]   I know.
[01:31:39.780 --> 01:31:44.740]   You go through the trouble of making this, you know, anthropomorphic kind of, you know,
[01:31:44.740 --> 01:31:47.700]   being to get us all to like the robots and then you like turn it off.
[01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:51.940]   It's like the movie AI that the students who work with kids really depressing.
[01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:52.940]   Yeah.
[01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:55.100]   We did a big feature on this and CNET actually this week.
[01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:56.100]   They just ran.
[01:31:56.100 --> 01:32:01.260]   And in fact, the one is on replay on the CNET front door right now on Sony Ibo and we went
[01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:09.820]   to the homes of several of our several of our readers who have Sony Ibo and just, you
[01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:13.060]   know, love it and treat it like one of the, you know, member of the family.
[01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:14.060]   So there's a great video.
[01:32:14.060 --> 01:32:15.940]   It's about seven, eight minutes.
[01:32:15.940 --> 01:32:18.180]   And they are super attached to it.
[01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:20.620]   And in many cases, they have other real pets.
[01:32:20.620 --> 01:32:23.580]   And so, so we have the first video there.
[01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:25.020]   You see it with the cat on the.
[01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:27.540]   There's a new, there's a new Ibo though, isn't there?
[01:32:27.540 --> 01:32:28.540]   Yeah.
[01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:29.540]   There is.
[01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:30.540]   Yeah.
[01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:32.420]   And it's, and it cloud connected the same way.
[01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:36.460]   You'd be stupid to buy it now knowing that at some point, well, of course you're stupid
[01:32:36.460 --> 01:32:37.820]   to get a dog in general.
[01:32:37.820 --> 01:32:39.220]   They always die somehow.
[01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:40.220]   I don't know.
[01:32:40.220 --> 01:32:45.700]   I mean, basically, who wasn't said, you know, I'll never have a dog.
[01:32:45.700 --> 01:32:50.980]   It's just a, you know, you just buying into grief 12 years down the road, right?
[01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:52.380]   It goes into the club.
[01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:55.980]   But you would think a robot would last longer than you.
[01:32:55.980 --> 01:32:56.980]   Maybe.
[01:32:56.980 --> 01:33:01.620]   Is your $900 device at all hackable?
[01:33:01.620 --> 01:33:03.620]   Could you do something to bring to the line?
[01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:08.540]   At some point, I'm going to let Burke decapitator, but I don't.
[01:33:08.540 --> 01:33:09.540]   Yeah.
[01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:10.540]   Yeah.
[01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:12.740]   Well, see, that would be the interesting thing.
[01:33:12.740 --> 01:33:17.180]   I'm like, this is why I'm a proponent of open source for some of these things because
[01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:21.620]   I'm completely in line with companies, not like, I don't think that you should hold
[01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:24.940]   any company accountable to maintaining an old server for a long time.
[01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:30.820]   Like last year, Sonos got some flack because literally some ActiveX flash thing for a
[01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:31.820]   controller.
[01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:32.820]   They last sold in 2006.
[01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:36.420]   They were like, okay, we're not going to support this anymore.
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:39.940]   And we'll give you a certain amount of money to buy, you know, a new controller and you
[01:33:39.940 --> 01:33:41.020]   can use our app.
[01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:42.540]   And people freaked out.
[01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:45.980]   And like, but I understand they had like old, you know, unsafe code that they were having
[01:33:45.980 --> 01:33:49.500]   to maintain with some other other stuff for a thing that hadn't been sold in 12 years.
[01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:53.740]   Like, I understand that a business reality say you can't maintain this forever.
[01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:58.460]   But in a perfect world, you could say, okay, but, you know, if we're using open source
[01:33:58.460 --> 01:34:01.420]   things or whatnot, we will at least open source how some of this stuff works so you
[01:34:01.420 --> 01:34:04.620]   can run your own server if you have the ability to do that.
[01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:10.220]   And it's even a business opportunity for other places to maybe say, hey, we will host this,
[01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:12.300]   you know, in a cloud for you and you can access it.
[01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:17.100]   But like, to me, that would be the best way to do these things is to say, you know, if
[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:23.300]   you have the means to do this yourself, you can set up your own local thing and still engage
[01:34:23.300 --> 01:34:24.300]   with your device.
[01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:25.940]   It's such a good idea.
[01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:29.620]   And it really is, you know, that's like a good hygiene and good, you know, digital
[01:34:29.620 --> 01:34:31.340]   manners of the 21st century.
[01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:34.820]   If you're going out of business, like open source your stuff, put it up on GitHub, let
[01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:40.380]   somebody else, if they have the resources or even hobbyists, you know, do something
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:41.380]   with it.
[01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:47.060]   If you're no longer going to, you know, be the curator and the, you know, guardian of
[01:34:47.060 --> 01:34:48.060]   it as it were.
[01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:50.620]   Yeah, somebody on Twitter just mentioned on key.
[01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:51.940]   And that's another one, right?
[01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:53.940]   Like that, you know, they went on.
[01:34:53.940 --> 01:34:58.740]   I have a sad number of these actually, the on key racetrack.
[01:34:58.740 --> 01:34:59.740]   Yeah.
[01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:00.740]   And I mean, that's the thing.
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:01.740]   And they killed Vector.
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:02.740]   Yeah.
[01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:05.180]   And I mean, on key is right now it's an iOS app.
[01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:08.780]   And so presumably it'll work maybe the next version, but there's going to be a time when
[01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:10.700]   that code is not going to work correctly.
[01:35:10.700 --> 01:35:15.220]   And so again, I think it would be great if, you know, the on key people would open source
[01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:20.100]   what they have so that somebody else can, you know, find a way to make it work if they
[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:21.540]   if they have the capability.
[01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:24.700]   At least give people the option, you know, like I'm not saying you need to maintain it
[01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:27.900]   or, or, you know, run queries, but just putting it out there.
[01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:29.700]   I think that would be really nice.
[01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:31.900]   So it's a great idea.
[01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:37.180]   There's a open source home automation package called openhab.
[01:35:37.180 --> 01:35:41.260]   Is that the kind of thing you're talking about where and everything just stood, use
[01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:46.540]   standards, then you wouldn't have the problem of the back end shutting down at some point.
[01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:48.340]   You'd be running your own thing.
[01:35:48.340 --> 01:35:49.340]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:50.540]   I think, I think like that.
[01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:55.420]   I mean, obviously that's really good or just, you know, if like when, when Google shut
[01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:59.620]   down, you know, revolve, it would have been really nice if they had released some of the
[01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:03.700]   codes so that people could locally run those things because the problem with revolve was
[01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:06.220]   that the devices themselves still worked.
[01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:09.540]   It was just that because there wasn't a central server to connect to, they couldn't do anything.
[01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:13.540]   But there's no reason it couldn't have been somebody couldn't have, you know, augmented
[01:36:13.540 --> 01:36:15.980]   things to run locally on a network.
[01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:19.660]   So yeah, but I mean, I think as much as you can use open standards, obviously that's,
[01:36:19.660 --> 01:36:21.340]   it's even better.
[01:36:21.340 --> 01:36:22.340]   But I don't know.
[01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:26.220]   I like the idea that says if you're going to get out of the market or go out of business,
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:28.300]   you know, open source your stuff.
[01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:29.300]   Yeah.
[01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:34.620]   Well, this is kind of depressing segment.
[01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:39.860]   You want more depression?
[01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:42.820]   Another a third Florida city.
[01:36:42.820 --> 01:36:45.140]   It's fallen prey.
[01:36:45.140 --> 01:36:49.420]   So it started with Baltimore, which got ransomware encrypted for three weeks.
[01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:50.740]   I don't know what's the city of Baltimore.
[01:36:50.740 --> 01:36:52.740]   I think they're still hobbling along.
[01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:55.740]   Yeah, they're still, they're still fighting it.
[01:36:55.740 --> 01:36:57.020]   They did not pay, right?
[01:36:57.020 --> 01:36:58.820]   They didn't pay the ransomware guys.
[01:36:58.820 --> 01:36:59.820]   No.
[01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:07.420]   Then Riviera Beach, Florida, a small town, 65,000 people decided they got hit.
[01:37:07.420 --> 01:37:16.380]   They decided to pay $600,000 to get their ransomware unlocked on Monday.
[01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:19.860]   Lake City, Florida, this is a Florida man's story.
[01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:26.260]   Lake City, Florida, another small Florida city voted to pay half a million dollars in
[01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:31.740]   ransom to Bitcoin to the ransomware gang and get their data back.
[01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:37.380]   Now a third Florida city has also fallen.
[01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:40.140]   They're trying to decide what to do.
[01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:46.620]   This cane bay, the problem is it's a really tiny city, 1,200 people.
[01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:51.620]   And I don't know if what they decided they had a town, the village, what they call it,
[01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:54.140]   a village hall meeting last night.
[01:37:54.140 --> 01:37:56.940]   I don't know what they have decided to do.
[01:37:56.940 --> 01:38:01.460]   Is it ever a good idea to pay the ransom?
[01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:07.420]   I mean, I guess it depends on how much you need that information, how good your resources
[01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:08.420]   are.
[01:38:08.420 --> 01:38:12.060]   And some of these cities, I think the reason they pay the $600,000 as bad as it is, is
[01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:16.220]   that the cost of recreating those things, well, A, they have insurance, B, the cost of
[01:38:16.220 --> 01:38:20.100]   those things is going to be substantial and C, they might, they clearly don't have the
[01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:23.060]   IT staff who's skilled enough to do what they need to do.
[01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:26.620]   So next time pay a tenth of that.
[01:38:26.620 --> 01:38:27.620]   Right.
[01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:29.620]   An IT staff.
[01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:30.620]   Yeah.
[01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:31.720]   Or is it inevitable?
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:33.700]   Should every company be saying we're next?
[01:38:33.700 --> 01:38:36.100]   Every city in the country be saying we're next.
[01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:39.540]   It only matters if you don't have a backup, right?
[01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:40.540]   If you have no backup.
[01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:42.020]   Well, it has to be more than a backup.
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:46.980]   It has to be an immutable backup because if you've got a backup running and it backs
[01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:50.420]   up the encrypted data on top of the good data, right?
[01:38:50.420 --> 01:38:53.220]   So you have to have backup that isn't going to get corrupted.
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:57.580]   And these weren't just script kitties.
[01:38:57.580 --> 01:39:01.780]   These are people who kind of are putting out there some fairly sophisticated things.
[01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:07.060]   And just the random IT guy that they hire is not necessarily himself going to have the
[01:39:07.060 --> 01:39:12.660]   himself or herself going to have the skills to be able to go in there and fix it.
[01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:17.380]   You're going to have to go outside and probably it's going to cost you more than the $500,000
[01:39:17.380 --> 01:39:19.820]   or $600,000 to recover from it.
[01:39:19.820 --> 01:39:24.420]   Well, and you might have a responsibility if you're the city council and you know that
[01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:29.620]   on there is the tax rolls on there is every plan for every building that's going to be
[01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:34.060]   built over the next five years and you don't have a way of recovering that except to pay
[01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:35.060]   the ransom.
[01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:37.380]   I think I can understand why you'd pay the ransom.
[01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:40.940]   You would have that's a huge breach of your responsibility.
[01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:45.380]   You damn better be sure that you don't and it's not going to happen again.
[01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:51.340]   I mean, once they are out of your system, supposedly out of your system, you better
[01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:53.540]   make sure that they don't come back.
[01:39:53.540 --> 01:39:58.900]   Now my other thought on this is of course, no individual listening to show should ever
[01:39:58.900 --> 01:40:02.220]   pay the ransom where fee because these are bad guys.
[01:40:02.220 --> 01:40:04.420]   You're like saying, oh, I'll give you $10,000.
[01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:06.220]   I'm sure you'll give me the key.
[01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:08.300]   No, they're just going to say thank you.
[01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:09.580]   Goodbye.
[01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:14.780]   But I think if you're a high profile case like these cases, you're probably likely to get
[01:40:14.780 --> 01:40:17.900]   the key because the ransomware authors do want you to think it works.
[01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:19.500]   Otherwise, you would never pay, right?
[01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:20.500]   No, totally.
[01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:21.500]   I mean, and that's the thing too.
[01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:27.620]   I mean, it's I think it's always probably stressful to consider am I going to pay and
[01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:30.940]   or they can unlock it or not, but it's in their best interest to unlock it because that's
[01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:33.820]   how you can convince people to pay them.
[01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:41.580]   My dad, my dad has been the victim of ransomware, not once but twice.
[01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:42.580]   What did he do?
[01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:43.580]   Did he pay?
[01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:49.020]   He paid and then my mom found out and they ended up, you know, I think that they disputed
[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:52.260]   the charge with American Express or something and I don't know.
[01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:53.260]   That's good.
[01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:55.460]   Put your Bitcoin American Express kids.
[01:40:55.460 --> 01:40:59.620]   Yeah, yeah, because they didn't ask him to do a Bitcoin thing.
[01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:01.780]   It was it was a real money.
[01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:02.780]   Right.
[01:41:02.780 --> 01:41:06.540]   And so then, you know, my mom found out and then they, you know, I guess just speed it
[01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:09.180]   with the MX and it was it was fine.
[01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:13.140]   The second time I think that I was just like, we have a backup from a while ago.
[01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:17.660]   You have most of your stuff and in Office 365, we're just starting over on this.
[01:41:17.660 --> 01:41:22.820]   And then, you know, I made sure that he wasn't running some of the stuff he was running before,
[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:24.780]   but I don't I live really far away from my parents.
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:27.500]   So I can't monitor his activities.
[01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:32.180]   But, you know, as I understand it, they did unlock his system.
[01:41:32.180 --> 01:41:37.860]   It's just, you know, but but, you know, it's just it's it's a ridiculous kind of scenario
[01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:43.340]   and they go after people who aren't tech savvy and they go after, you know, um, municipalities
[01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:46.020]   in this case who look, I mean, that's $600,000.
[01:41:46.020 --> 01:41:48.860]   That's a lot of money and that's a lot of money for those towns.
[01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:54.420]   But again, if a they probably have insurance and be the cost of not, you know, getting
[01:41:54.420 --> 01:41:58.620]   around it otherwise is probably way more than that.
[01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:04.500]   I just hope that any of these cities who pay the ransom will then immediately conduct a
[01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:08.820]   real security audit and hire and pay people, even though it's going to be expensive for
[01:42:08.820 --> 01:42:14.020]   them to actually secure and create best practices around what they're doing.
[01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:17.420]   Unfortunately, I kind of don't believe that'll happen, but I that's what I hope they do
[01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:20.100]   because otherwise this is just going to happen again.
[01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:24.380]   Larry Dignon writing on a ZD net said it's actually in many cases a good idea.
[01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:26.380]   To pay the ransomware.
[01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:31.540]   Um, the many of the these cities often said that was what we are advice was that we were
[01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:32.540]   given.
[01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:34.580]   Fortunately, I think they had some insurance.
[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:37.820]   Although I mentioned there, there ransomware insurance costs are going to go.
[01:42:37.820 --> 01:42:40.660]   Oh, yeah, I didn't know you could get ransomware insurance.
[01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:42.380]   I might be looking into that.
[01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:46.780]   Um, the FBI says still says do not pay ransomware.
[01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:49.820]   There's some reasons not to one is it just encourages them.
[01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:53.180]   Uh, two is there's no guarantee you'll get your data back.
[01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:59.580]   Um, and in most cases, go ahead.
[01:42:59.580 --> 01:43:00.780]   Go ahead, Jason.
[01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:04.580]   No, no, Jason, I'm going to, I'm going to rule on this one.
[01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:08.300]   I always want to be a judge.
[01:43:08.300 --> 01:43:14.900]   Yeah, I also says that, you know, there are annually now over a billion dollars in losses
[01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:18.460]   from ransomware that's paid.
[01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:23.140]   And that is likely a tip of the iceberg because nobody's going to report.
[01:43:23.140 --> 01:43:24.140]   Yeah.
[01:43:24.140 --> 01:43:27.180]   Those are the ones that actually reported it.
[01:43:27.180 --> 01:43:28.180]   Yeah.
[01:43:28.180 --> 01:43:29.180]   Yeah.
[01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:30.180]   Most of the time it's not reported.
[01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:31.180]   Yeah.
[01:43:31.180 --> 01:43:32.180]   Totally.
[01:43:32.180 --> 01:43:36.020]   And in almost all these cases, it's done by spearfishing.
[01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:37.020]   Right.
[01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:42.940]   People come in and they trick you into installing the software on your machine by clicking on
[01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:43.940]   a link.
[01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:47.900]   I think you have another story about a guy who almost fell for a similar thing in your
[01:43:47.900 --> 01:43:48.900]   list today.
[01:43:48.900 --> 01:43:51.540]   Security guy, a guy who you're better.
[01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:52.540]   Yeah.
[01:43:52.540 --> 01:43:58.540]   And so it's, you know, it's kind of also embarrassing for the city because one of their employees
[01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:01.300]   fell for something that, hopefully, they have been trained about.
[01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:07.260]   You know, I think every company and every institution does a lot of training around this.
[01:44:07.260 --> 01:44:10.420]   But people still fall for it, like the security guy in this instance.
[01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:12.900]   Well, this is the thing.
[01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:16.460]   And I still see, and I know that he was a Chronicle, never does this, but I still see
[01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:24.460]   in, or seen at or Microsoft, but many other places say, oh, if, if you don't know the person
[01:44:24.460 --> 01:44:26.700]   that the email came from, don't open it.
[01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:31.020]   And that's exactly the wrong, that's exactly the wrong advice because it always comes from
[01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:33.180]   somebody you know, often you know, right?
[01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:34.180]   Yeah.
[01:44:34.180 --> 01:44:35.420]   Or your boss.
[01:44:35.420 --> 01:44:36.420]   So it's really important.
[01:44:36.420 --> 01:44:40.860]   So yeah, that's job one is to train employees not to click links, not to open emails and
[01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:46.420]   not to open attachments, especially to be suspicious of attachments from the boss.
[01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:50.460]   Or from coworkers because the spearfishing attacks, especially for, I'm sure this is
[01:44:50.460 --> 01:44:52.420]   why it's cities, it's happening in cities.
[01:44:52.420 --> 01:44:54.820]   It's easy to see who's in the city government.
[01:44:54.820 --> 01:44:55.820]   It's on the website.
[01:44:55.820 --> 01:44:57.220]   So you go to the say, who's the city manager?
[01:44:57.220 --> 01:44:58.220]   Okay.
[01:44:58.220 --> 01:44:59.220]   That's his name.
[01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:00.220]   Okay.
[01:45:00.220 --> 01:45:01.220]   Who's the comptroller?
[01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:02.220]   Okay.
[01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:03.220]   That's his name.
[01:45:03.220 --> 01:45:04.540]   Send an email from the city manager, the comptroller saying, here's the spreadsheet.
[01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:06.180]   I'm a little concerned about the numbers here.
[01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:08.180]   You better open this and look at it.
[01:45:08.180 --> 01:45:10.820]   How many controllers are going to say, wait a minute, that couldn't have cut.
[01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:12.300]   They're going to open it.
[01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:16.180]   So that's job one job to have a good backup and immutable backup.
[01:45:16.180 --> 01:45:22.820]   I've been told, check me if I'm wrong, that Google does not allow spearfishing and ransomware
[01:45:22.820 --> 01:45:27.460]   attacks to go through because they scan and they block these malware attachments.
[01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:34.540]   And certainly if you have good intrusion detection and hardware firewalls, we have hardware
[01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:39.740]   software software running to protect us, Cisco, umbrella and stuff like that, that kind of
[01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:42.740]   software is going to filter that stuff out before it even gets to your employees.
[01:45:42.740 --> 01:45:43.740]   Am I right?
[01:45:43.740 --> 01:45:44.740]   Yeah.
[01:45:44.740 --> 01:45:45.740]   That's true.
[01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:51.300]   And we have things like, at Office 365, somebody in IRC mentioned this, and if this is true,
[01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:56.260]   there's advanced threat protection for things like that that go into things like that.
[01:45:56.260 --> 01:46:01.900]   And this is actually arguably in some ways a reason to use software as a service if you're
[01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:05.020]   these types of governments because you can get updates to these types of things.
[01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:09.580]   I think the issue is that most of the time they're running older versions of server products
[01:46:09.580 --> 01:46:13.460]   and maybe of email servers or other things.
[01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:19.500]   It's not doing that because they were making decisions about their stack a while ago and
[01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:23.540]   haven't allocated money in the budget to update.
[01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:24.540]   And that makes sense.
[01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:28.940]   Things are expensive and you can't expect small governments, especially to always be
[01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:29.940]   up to date on stuff.
[01:46:29.940 --> 01:46:36.620]   I think though, if you used Office 365 or G Suite, most of these threats would not happen.
[01:46:36.620 --> 01:46:41.900]   But the issue is that they might have set something up in 2003 and maybe haven't updated
[01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:45.220]   since then because you were talking in your last ad break about things like that.
[01:46:45.220 --> 01:46:48.820]   This is a reality of how these things work.
[01:46:48.820 --> 01:46:50.460]   It's reality for small businesses.
[01:46:50.460 --> 01:46:55.060]   It's even a bigger reality for small governments and for city governments.
[01:46:55.060 --> 01:46:59.380]   And as we've seen Detroit, that's a much bigger city than you would think would be impacted
[01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:00.380]   by that.
[01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:07.140]   But if they have other pressing concerns, I can understand that people in their city council
[01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:10.980]   would argue against spending money on tech stuff.
[01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:15.300]   This is probably why we need more people who are tech savvy to be in roles in government
[01:47:15.300 --> 01:47:17.060]   at all stages, if we're being honest.
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:18.060]   Amen.
[01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:19.060]   Amen.
[01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:20.060]   Amen, sister.
[01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:21.820]   I want to take a break and come back.
[01:47:21.820 --> 01:47:26.380]   I will talk about this Robert Heaton piece, which is a really great piece, how he was
[01:47:26.380 --> 01:47:28.900]   seven words away from being spearfished.
[01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:34.540]   And this is a software engineer, a guy who is as knowledgeable as any of us and still
[01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:37.540]   almost, almost fell for it.
[01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:40.940]   And it's a very telling story about that.
[01:47:40.940 --> 01:47:42.380]   We'll do that in just a little bit.
[01:47:42.380 --> 01:47:47.620]   And if you missed anything this week on Twitch, well, you missed a mouthful watch.
[01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:53.740]   Previously on Twitch, Google's very first tablet.
[01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:57.340]   I can't wait to unearth this time capsule.
[01:47:57.340 --> 01:47:59.060]   I just want to see what apps you have installed on it.
[01:47:59.060 --> 01:48:00.060]   I do too.
[01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:02.420]   I bet you you got Google goggles on there.
[01:48:02.420 --> 01:48:03.420]   Maybe I could.
[01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:04.420]   I could have.
[01:48:04.420 --> 01:48:05.420]   What was it?
[01:48:05.420 --> 01:48:06.420]   Google listen?
[01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:07.420]   Was it?
[01:48:07.420 --> 01:48:09.060]   Tech news weekly.
[01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:14.300]   The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is the first flagship level update.
[01:48:14.300 --> 01:48:17.340]   The Pi 3 released more than three years ago.
[01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:21.420]   35 bucks gets you the computer that you see inside here.
[01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:29.420]   This weekend enterprise tech, you don't go and set up a bank and use a plywood door
[01:48:29.420 --> 01:48:30.940]   for your vault.
[01:48:30.940 --> 01:48:35.900]   You invest in a good vault door that city councilman, when you start looking at your
[01:48:35.900 --> 01:48:41.380]   budget, if you're going to be depending upon your IT group, you really and truly need
[01:48:41.380 --> 01:48:47.340]   to also invest in making sure you have a nice, strong vault door.
[01:48:47.340 --> 01:48:48.340]   Ham Nation.
[01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:54.300]   On this episode of Ham Nation, we've got a great report on Phil Day from everyone in
[01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:57.140]   the team and a few friends.
[01:48:57.140 --> 01:48:58.140]   iOS today.
[01:48:58.140 --> 01:48:59.500]   Here, I'm so excited.
[01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:01.380]   iOS 13.
[01:49:01.380 --> 01:49:04.060]   You'll notice immediately the icons are smaller.
[01:49:04.060 --> 01:49:08.860]   Plug a thumb drive, which in the past, it would just go, "I don't know what that is."
[01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:09.860]   To it.
[01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:11.220]   We're no strangers to love.
[01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:14.460]   You know the rules, and so do I.
[01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:17.460]   There's some great stuff in there.
[01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:21.020]   I remember that Microsoft or that not the Moodle Zoom.
[01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:22.020]   Yeah.
[01:49:22.020 --> 01:49:26.020]   I remember having that thing under embargo and looking at it and then going, "Hold on.
[01:49:26.020 --> 01:49:27.020]   Wait.
[01:49:27.020 --> 01:49:29.460]   You don't want me to turn it on the other way."
[01:49:29.460 --> 01:49:30.460]   The vice.
[01:49:30.460 --> 01:49:31.460]   Oh, boy.
[01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:34.020]   Also, I noticed on your iPad, I noticed you had that bridged key.
[01:49:34.020 --> 01:49:36.020]   That bridge keyboard on your iPad.
[01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:37.020]   Yeah, I love that.
[01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:39.260]   Man, that thing is awesome.
[01:49:39.260 --> 01:49:43.260]   With iOS 13 and the bridge keyboard, now it's practically a usable laptop.
[01:49:43.260 --> 01:49:45.340]   It's very interesting to use it.
[01:49:45.340 --> 01:49:47.900]   I think Apple's on the track with iPadOS.
[01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:48.900]   So, yeah, we have it.
[01:49:48.900 --> 01:49:49.900]   It is.
[01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:52.340]   That's on our Hands-On Tech channel, our review channel.
[01:49:52.340 --> 01:49:56.340]   We take reviews from all of our shows and additional reviews of new products and we put
[01:49:56.340 --> 01:49:57.980]   them on a channel called Hands-On Tech.
[01:49:57.980 --> 01:50:00.340]   If you're not a subscriber to that, it's really, really good.
[01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:03.740]   Actually, what everybody should do is pick the podcast you like.
[01:50:03.740 --> 01:50:05.100]   Maybe it's not mine.
[01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:09.260]   Maybe it's Jason's or Christina's or do you have a podcast?
[01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:10.740]   You must have a podcast.
[01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:12.740]   Dwight, how could you?
[01:50:12.740 --> 01:50:13.740]   No podcast.
[01:50:13.740 --> 01:50:14.740]   All right.
[01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:20.500]   Well, if you have a podcast that you love, subscribe to it.
[01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:24.220]   That's the best way to make sure that you get an episode every week automatically.
[01:50:24.220 --> 01:50:26.020]   You don't have to think about it.
[01:50:26.020 --> 01:50:29.340]   It's the best way for us as podcasters to build an audience.
[01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:32.980]   So don't forget to subscribe to all of our Twitch podcasts.
[01:50:32.980 --> 01:50:36.380]   When you get our Twitch podcasts, you're downloading them from our content distribution
[01:50:36.380 --> 01:50:37.380]   network.
[01:50:37.380 --> 01:50:38.380]   It's really amazing.
[01:50:38.380 --> 01:50:45.580]   CashFly is a CDN, a content delivery network that gives you better speed, more reliability.
[01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:50.260]   It's up to 10 times faster, the traditional delivery methods, up to 30 times faster than
[01:50:50.260 --> 01:50:52.500]   other CDNs.
[01:50:52.500 --> 01:50:55.780]   The way it works is it has servers all over the world.
[01:50:55.780 --> 01:51:01.820]   And when your users come to download your app, to access your data, to download your podcast,
[01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:04.620]   they do it from the server that's closest to them.
[01:51:04.620 --> 01:51:07.620]   And that speeds things up by a lot.
[01:51:07.620 --> 01:51:12.500]   And because there's servers all over the world, it's got 100% SLA.
[01:51:12.500 --> 01:51:15.740]   I know people say, you can't have more than whatever it is, 5, 9, 6, 9.
[01:51:15.740 --> 01:51:20.940]   No, you can because they have so many servers, they can guarantee 100%.
[01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:22.060]   And there's an SLA for that.
[01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:25.740]   The best user experience for all your customers, no matter where they are, what they are, what
[01:51:25.740 --> 01:51:26.740]   device they're on.
[01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:28.540]   I am a huge fan of CashFly.
[01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:33.540]   I never get that 3 AM called, the content, the systems downward, people aren't getting
[01:51:33.540 --> 01:51:34.620]   the podcast.
[01:51:34.620 --> 01:51:37.740]   The roads must roll and CashFly keeps them rolling.
[01:51:37.740 --> 01:51:44.260]   Join the thousands, the trust, CashFly's reliable network, LG, Microsoft Adobe, R's
[01:51:44.260 --> 01:51:45.380]   Technica.
[01:51:45.380 --> 01:51:50.180]   No billing spikes either because CashFly works to make a plan tailored to your needs.
[01:51:50.180 --> 01:51:52.340]   We have very spiky demand, as you might imagine.
[01:51:52.340 --> 01:51:56.180]   A lot of people download Sunday night, they download Twit.
[01:51:56.180 --> 01:52:00.340]   But what CashFly will work with you is to base it on your yearly trends, not your daily,
[01:52:00.340 --> 01:52:02.420]   nightly, weekly, monthly trends.
[01:52:02.420 --> 01:52:04.780]   That way you get a great result.
[01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:07.260]   See, 5 by 5 is on CashFly.
[01:52:07.260 --> 01:52:09.700]   CashFly's awesome.
[01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:14.420]   On average customers who switch to CashFly save 20%.
[01:52:14.420 --> 01:52:16.500]   That's a nice chunk of change.
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:20.980]   Just for you right now, CashFly will give you a complimentary detailed analysis of your
[01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:25.540]   current CDN bill to see if you can save 20%.
[01:52:25.540 --> 01:52:27.380]   Roblox uses CashFly.
[01:52:27.380 --> 01:52:29.540]   Zappier uses CashFly.
[01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:31.820]   Proctor and Gamble uses CashFly.
[01:52:31.820 --> 01:52:33.420]   The NFL uses CashFly.
[01:52:33.420 --> 01:52:35.820]   Twit.cashfly.com.
[01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:38.020]   See if you're paying more than you should be.
[01:52:38.020 --> 01:52:39.340]   twit.cashfly.com.
[01:52:39.340 --> 01:52:44.140]   We thank CashFly for literally bringing you our show.
[01:52:44.140 --> 01:52:45.780]   Robert Heaton, Software Engineer.
[01:52:45.780 --> 01:52:47.220]   This was such a great piece.
[01:52:47.220 --> 01:52:51.380]   I had to bring it today.
[01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:55.540]   Three weeks ago he writes, "I received a very flattering email from the University of Cambridge
[01:52:55.540 --> 01:52:59.580]   asking me to judge the Adam Smith Prize for Economics."
[01:52:59.580 --> 01:53:01.940]   Wow, what an honor.
[01:53:01.940 --> 01:53:05.260]   He does point out he's not an economist.
[01:53:05.260 --> 01:53:08.620]   He does have a subscription to the economist.
[01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:13.300]   He's read capital in the 21st century, but he's not an economist yet.
[01:53:13.300 --> 01:53:15.820]   That did not raise any alarm bell.
[01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:16.820]   Well, maybe a little.
[01:53:16.820 --> 01:53:17.820]   A little suspicious.
[01:53:17.820 --> 01:53:22.420]   So he says, "I reflexively did some basic security hygiene checks."
[01:53:22.420 --> 01:53:27.700]   The email was from a Cambridge, University of Cambridge, cam.ac.uk email address.
[01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:31.980]   There was a link to know more about the Adam Smith Prize.
[01:53:31.980 --> 01:53:36.260]   The link was on the Cambridge domain.
[01:53:36.260 --> 01:53:37.420]   He said, "Strike me a little odd.
[01:53:37.420 --> 01:53:42.580]   The page was hosted inside somebody's personal directory instead of on the main site, but
[01:53:42.580 --> 01:53:45.580]   well, maybe less bureaucracy."
[01:53:45.580 --> 01:53:50.740]   So he clicked the link and read a little bit about the history of the prize.
[01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:53.140]   That was his mistake.
[01:53:53.140 --> 01:53:55.580]   Can you pinpoint the mistake at this point?
[01:53:55.580 --> 01:53:58.100]   He clicked on the link.
[01:53:58.100 --> 01:54:02.860]   He said, "If the person sending this email had added a seven extra words this page, I
[01:54:02.860 --> 01:54:05.140]   would have been screwed.
[01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:07.340]   This page must be viewed in Firefox.
[01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:08.980]   The reason is there's a zero day.
[01:54:08.980 --> 01:54:15.500]   It's been fixed, but there was a zero day in Firefox that allowed a bad guy, a mouth
[01:54:15.500 --> 01:54:22.420]   formed web page to attack your Firefox and steal all your passwords stored in Firefox.
[01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:30.020]   It's been used against the folks at Coinbase with great effect.
[01:54:30.020 --> 01:54:33.260]   I guess it was being used against even more than that.
[01:54:33.260 --> 01:54:37.900]   He didn't see any problems, so he emailed him back.
[01:54:37.900 --> 01:54:39.700]   Went back and forth.
[01:54:39.700 --> 01:54:42.740]   He did say, "I'm curious.
[01:54:42.740 --> 01:54:47.900]   Why did you ask who recommended me?"
[01:54:47.900 --> 01:54:54.380]   Gregory, not his real name, replied, "We got a candidate's list from San Francisco State.
[01:54:54.380 --> 01:54:58.780]   Well, now," he says, "I'm starting to worry."
[01:54:58.780 --> 01:55:03.180]   He says, "Probably there's another guy with a similar name sitting in his office wondering
[01:55:03.180 --> 01:55:06.820]   why he wasn't being asked to judge."
[01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:07.820]   He says, "Hi, Greg.
[01:55:07.820 --> 01:55:09.380]   I'm starting to wonder if some wires got crossed.
[01:55:09.380 --> 01:55:13.380]   I've read some books by Paul Krugman, but I'm not an economist.
[01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:15.260]   I'm a software engineer.
[01:55:15.260 --> 01:55:19.500]   Is there another Robert Heaton in San Francisco that knows more about economics?"
[01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:22.700]   Then Gregory, "Yeah, it might be a mistake.
[01:55:22.700 --> 01:55:23.900]   I'll get back to you."
[01:55:23.900 --> 01:55:26.860]   That's the last he heard from him.
[01:55:26.860 --> 01:55:33.740]   I think this type of phishing email is the kind of thing that would get through something
[01:55:33.740 --> 01:55:39.180]   like an Office 365 because it went to a legitimate link.
[01:55:39.180 --> 01:55:43.820]   It was obviously a compromised directory that used to judge the mallet.
[01:55:43.820 --> 01:55:48.500]   Here's how it might have because remember that you've got this, I know, as you surf
[01:55:48.500 --> 01:55:50.220]   around the net, you'll get an error.
[01:55:50.220 --> 01:55:53.020]   Google said, "This page has malware."
[01:55:53.020 --> 01:55:54.380]   They are scanning.
[01:55:54.380 --> 01:55:55.780]   There are databases.
[01:55:55.780 --> 01:55:56.780]   Edge uses it.
[01:55:56.780 --> 01:55:57.780]   Chrome uses it.
[01:55:57.780 --> 01:55:59.860]   Firefox and others use it.
[01:55:59.860 --> 01:56:05.020]   Obviously that page wasn't flagged because he was able to go to it without a flag.
[01:56:05.020 --> 01:56:06.020]   Maybe you're right.
[01:56:06.020 --> 01:56:08.660]   If it's fresh, then you can't--
[01:56:08.660 --> 01:56:11.140]   The data came from a legitimate URL.
[01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:12.820]   It was a zero day.
[01:56:12.820 --> 01:56:13.820]   That's the real point.
[01:56:13.820 --> 01:56:16.700]   I think that's the really scary part, right?
[01:56:16.700 --> 01:56:24.260]   This was a zero day that was able to be exploited that quickly.
[01:56:24.260 --> 01:56:27.140]   If they had put it has to be viewed, although I think there's something to be said, it has
[01:56:27.140 --> 01:56:31.700]   to be viewed in Firefox, but probably in some cases, hopefully, raise suspicions.
[01:56:31.700 --> 01:56:35.340]   I know for me, if I were to read something that said you have to view this link in this
[01:56:35.340 --> 01:56:36.340]   browser.
[01:56:36.340 --> 01:56:37.420]   I don't know who it's from.
[01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:39.500]   I would like to think I can't guarantee this.
[01:56:39.500 --> 01:56:42.340]   I easily could have fallen victim of this too.
[01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:46.220]   I would like to think that I would think to myself, "Wait a minute.
[01:56:46.220 --> 01:56:50.260]   Why are they telling me that I have to use this browser?"
[01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:57.220]   Or I would disregard it and try to use the browser I typically use anyway.
[01:56:57.220 --> 01:56:58.580]   It's scary for sure.
[01:56:58.580 --> 01:57:05.820]   I think the thing here too is the fact that it was able to grab the passwords from Firefox's
[01:57:05.820 --> 01:57:07.660]   browser.
[01:57:07.660 --> 01:57:13.900]   This is probably another good, again, diversification of security stuff.
[01:57:13.900 --> 01:57:17.260]   I tend to try to store all my passwords in my password.
[01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:19.060]   Never use your browser to store your passwords.
[01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:24.500]   I've actually gone to the point where I've removed it from all my browsers because I've
[01:57:24.500 --> 01:57:25.780]   been worried about things like that.
[01:57:25.780 --> 01:57:28.700]   Now, seeing this again, I'm going to double down on that.
[01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:32.300]   Anything that's important anyway, I certainly don't want to store my browser, even though
[01:57:32.300 --> 01:57:33.300]   it's me.
[01:57:33.300 --> 01:57:37.140]   I don't know any one of us could have fallen for this.
[01:57:37.140 --> 01:57:38.140]   Totally.
[01:57:38.140 --> 01:57:39.140]   Yeah.
[01:57:39.140 --> 01:57:44.700]   When was it this week?
[01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:46.620]   I guess it was.
[01:57:46.620 --> 01:57:49.500]   Cloudflare for three hours was offline.
[01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:50.580]   That was like, "What?
[01:57:50.580 --> 01:57:51.580]   Cloudflare.
[01:57:51.580 --> 01:57:58.580]   This is the Internet backbone for so many sites to keep them safe from DDoS attacks.
[01:57:58.580 --> 01:58:00.700]   Wasn't a DDoS attack.
[01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:05.420]   It was a bad BGP route.
[01:58:05.420 --> 01:58:09.020]   This is such a horrific story.
[01:58:09.020 --> 01:58:13.020]   What's really horrific is it keeps happening.
[01:58:13.020 --> 01:58:17.620]   The border gateway protocol is a protocol, and I'm not an expert on this.
[01:58:17.620 --> 01:58:23.660]   Steve, I think did a better job explaining this on security now, but in general, you
[01:58:23.660 --> 01:58:28.220]   can use a router to broadcast your route to the Internet.
[01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:34.580]   If it's properly formed, it says, "If you want to come to my website, this is how you
[01:58:34.580 --> 01:58:35.580]   get here."
[01:58:35.580 --> 01:58:43.100]   If it's malformed, you can in effect say, "All Internet traffic come to me."
[01:58:43.100 --> 01:58:44.460]   That's what happened.
[01:58:44.460 --> 01:58:51.020]   A small Internet service provider screwed up its BGP route.
[01:58:51.020 --> 01:58:54.500]   Actually, it did it because it was using an optimizer, and the optimizer screwed it out.
[01:58:54.500 --> 01:58:58.420]   It was a DQE communications in ISP in Pennsylvania.
[01:58:58.420 --> 01:59:02.900]   They used the optimizer and essentially published a route that said, "All Internet traffic should
[01:59:02.900 --> 01:59:10.660]   go through a small company in Pennsylvania called Allegheny Technologies."
[01:59:10.660 --> 01:59:16.860]   The transit provider for DQE was a little company you might have heard of called Verizon.
[01:59:16.860 --> 01:59:22.780]   Verizon then broadcast that route worldwide.
[01:59:22.780 --> 01:59:29.340]   Cloudflare noticed it as you might expect they did, and they tracked it down, and they
[01:59:29.340 --> 01:59:33.500]   figured out it was coming through Verizon.
[01:59:33.500 --> 01:59:35.300]   They tried to reach Verizon.
[01:59:35.300 --> 01:59:37.060]   Nobody answered their emails.
[01:59:37.060 --> 01:59:38.860]   They're actually in their blog post.
[01:59:38.860 --> 01:59:42.300]   They published the phone calls, the emails.
[01:59:42.300 --> 01:59:45.900]   They, urgent, route leak from your customer.
[01:59:45.900 --> 01:59:51.500]   Here's the phone calls they made to DQE's knock, to Verizon, to Verizon engineers.
[01:59:51.500 --> 01:59:53.140]   They tried pager duty.
[01:59:53.140 --> 01:59:55.340]   They tried to wake up everybody.
[01:59:55.340 --> 01:59:58.740]   Finally, DQE responded three hours later.
[01:59:58.740 --> 02:00:01.420]   They were able to fix this.
[02:00:01.420 --> 02:00:06.060]   But is that me?
[02:00:06.060 --> 02:00:08.860]   I think maybe Verizon's on the line.
[02:00:08.860 --> 02:00:11.460]   But this is in the Cloudflare blog post.
[02:00:11.460 --> 02:00:13.580]   How could this leak have been prevented?
[02:00:13.580 --> 02:00:17.700]   There are multiple ways this leak could have been avoided.
[02:00:17.700 --> 02:00:22.340]   For instance, you configure your session to have a hard limit of prefixes to be received.
[02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:27.700]   So if all of a sudden the entire internet arrives at your door, you go, "Oops," and
[02:00:27.700 --> 02:00:29.460]   you take that route offline.
[02:00:29.460 --> 02:00:34.540]   Had Verizon had such a prefix limit in place, none of this would have happened.
[02:00:34.540 --> 02:00:38.140]   It doesn't cost a provider like Verizon anything to have such limits in place, and there's
[02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:44.740]   no good reason other than sloppiness or laziness that they wouldn't have them.
[02:00:44.740 --> 02:00:46.060]   There's other ways to do it.
[02:00:46.060 --> 02:00:48.460]   There are filtering.
[02:00:48.460 --> 02:00:51.900]   There's an RPKI framework that prevents this.
[02:00:51.900 --> 02:00:52.940]   It has happened before.
[02:00:52.940 --> 02:00:54.940]   It probably will happen again.
[02:00:54.940 --> 02:00:58.620]   We're losing people right and left here.
[02:00:58.620 --> 02:00:59.620]   We just lost white.
[02:00:59.620 --> 02:01:01.780]   Now all three of you have fallen off.
[02:01:01.780 --> 02:01:02.780]   Skype.
[02:01:02.780 --> 02:01:05.300]   Skype must be having some of these problems, too.
[02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:07.180]   Anyway, it's just another caution.
[02:01:07.180 --> 02:01:09.380]   A second cautionary tale.
[02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:12.980]   We really got to get people to do the right thing and protect the internet.
[02:01:12.980 --> 02:01:14.700]   This is ridiculous.
[02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:16.460]   This should never have happened.
[02:01:16.460 --> 02:01:17.460]   It never should have happened.
[02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:24.980]   It's really frustrating that Verizon, it took them three hours to get back and touch it.
[02:01:24.980 --> 02:01:29.740]   There should, you would think that with one of the biggest back calls in the world, there
[02:01:29.740 --> 02:01:32.660]   should be an easier way to, because obviously they use pager duty.
[02:01:32.660 --> 02:01:36.500]   Obviously they have people who work on call for these purposes.
[02:01:36.500 --> 02:01:40.260]   For partners who are the size of Cloudflare, I would like to think that they would be able
[02:01:40.260 --> 02:01:41.900]   to have that direct line.
[02:01:41.900 --> 02:01:45.260]   I should point out Cloudflare says Verizon never got back to them.
[02:01:45.260 --> 02:01:47.180]   It was DQE, the internet service provider.
[02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:50.500]   They were finally able to work with their engineers and fix it.
[02:01:50.500 --> 02:01:51.500]   Verizon.
[02:01:51.500 --> 02:01:54.940]   We're too busy.
[02:01:54.940 --> 02:01:57.300]   We can't handle that.
[02:01:57.300 --> 02:02:01.780]   Also a great story in Bloomberg Business Week this week about the hotel hackers hiding
[02:02:01.780 --> 02:02:04.940]   in the remote control curtains.
[02:02:04.940 --> 02:02:05.940]   It's a fun story.
[02:02:05.940 --> 02:02:11.620]   I actually hired white hat hackers to try to penetrate a hotel.
[02:02:11.620 --> 02:02:15.740]   They won't mention hotels are very vulnerable.
[02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:21.500]   This is mostly a story about why you shouldn't, you should be careful not to give any company
[02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:23.540]   too much information.
[02:02:23.540 --> 02:02:27.260]   You certainly shouldn't use open Wi-Fi networks at hotels or coffee shops.
[02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:32.340]   You should use a VPN especially on these networks because, yeah.
[02:02:32.340 --> 02:02:35.900]   No, you don't only should, although it sure is a shame that when you check the phone,
[02:02:35.900 --> 02:02:39.220]   you can check into an international hotel, they require you to get them your passport.
[02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:40.740]   Oh, I know, but they do.
[02:02:40.740 --> 02:02:41.740]   And they keep them.
[02:02:41.740 --> 02:02:42.740]   I know.
[02:02:42.740 --> 02:02:43.740]   They keep them.
[02:02:43.740 --> 02:02:44.740]   I know they do.
[02:02:44.740 --> 02:02:45.740]   And they keep them.
[02:02:45.740 --> 02:02:46.740]   And they make you feel squirrely?
[02:02:46.740 --> 02:02:47.740]   Yes.
[02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:48.740]   This is what I'm saying.
[02:02:48.740 --> 02:02:49.740]   This is all great advice.
[02:02:49.740 --> 02:02:50.740]   Don't give too much information.
[02:02:50.740 --> 02:02:51.740]   Don't do this and that.
[02:02:51.740 --> 02:02:52.740]   It's like, yeah.
[02:02:52.740 --> 02:02:53.740]   But they get your passport anyway.
[02:02:53.740 --> 02:02:54.740]   They have your address.
[02:02:54.740 --> 02:02:55.740]   You know what I mean?
[02:02:55.740 --> 02:02:57.380]   I want 1000% agree with that.
[02:02:57.380 --> 02:03:04.380]   But there's a certain irony that at the base level at the top, as we saw with the Marriott
[02:03:04.380 --> 02:03:10.140]   Mac, I was like, and I'm one of those bomb boy, like ambassador people.
[02:03:10.140 --> 02:03:11.140]   I was like, oh, yeah, the great.
[02:03:11.140 --> 02:03:12.140]   I'm really, really happy.
[02:03:12.140 --> 02:03:13.140]   Oh, yeah.
[02:03:13.140 --> 02:03:14.140]   They got all my information too.
[02:03:14.140 --> 02:03:16.060]   I've been a long time star with member.
[02:03:16.060 --> 02:03:17.260]   I was a long time star word person.
[02:03:17.260 --> 02:03:18.260]   I was like, wonderful.
[02:03:18.260 --> 02:03:20.300]   I'm really, really glad between that and Echo facts.
[02:03:20.300 --> 02:03:22.300]   I'm like, well, my identity is screwed.
[02:03:22.300 --> 02:03:28.020]   Hey, I'm happy to say that at least one of Equifax executives get in jail time.
[02:03:28.020 --> 02:03:30.300]   Yeah, less than Martha Stewart.
[02:03:30.300 --> 02:03:31.300]   Yeah.
[02:03:31.300 --> 02:03:34.980]   And by the way, not for the breach, but because the insider traded.
[02:03:34.980 --> 02:03:35.980]   That's what I'm saying.
[02:03:35.980 --> 02:03:36.980]   That's what I'm saying.
[02:03:36.980 --> 02:03:37.980]   And he got left.
[02:03:37.980 --> 02:03:43.380]   The Martha Stewart did for take a couple months, probably in one of those country club jails.
[02:03:43.380 --> 02:03:46.220]   Was it the CFO?
[02:03:46.220 --> 02:03:48.660]   Anyway, he is the CIO.
[02:03:48.660 --> 02:03:50.220]   CIO, that's right.
[02:03:50.220 --> 02:03:53.820]   And it was great too, because the, I mean, he pleaded guilty, which I'm sure is part
[02:03:53.820 --> 02:03:54.980]   of why it's since was so good.
[02:03:54.980 --> 02:03:56.140]   But they had him dead to rights.
[02:03:56.140 --> 02:04:02.860]   He literally researched what the impact was on other companies of a breach of a data breach.
[02:04:02.860 --> 02:04:03.860]   Yes.
[02:04:03.860 --> 02:04:06.900]   And then when he realized he was like, before it was publicly announced, we should point
[02:04:06.900 --> 02:04:07.900]   out.
[02:04:07.900 --> 02:04:08.900]   Yes.
[02:04:08.900 --> 02:04:10.540]   And then he was like, oh, this is going to be bad for me.
[02:04:10.540 --> 02:04:12.020]   I'm not going to make as much money.
[02:04:12.020 --> 02:04:16.980]   So he sold his stock and made, you know, like $60,000 or something by selling it when he
[02:04:16.980 --> 02:04:17.980]   did.
[02:04:17.980 --> 02:04:22.340]   I hope he made more than that because he's going to have to pay $117,000 in restitution
[02:04:22.340 --> 02:04:26.460]   and a $55,000 fine in addition to four months in jail.
[02:04:26.460 --> 02:04:28.020]   And I don't care if it's a country club jail.
[02:04:28.020 --> 02:04:30.340]   Four months in jail is no picnic.
[02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:31.340]   No, it's not.
[02:04:31.340 --> 02:04:35.940]   But, you know, like for all the things they do, it's like, okay, I mean, he's the CIO.
[02:04:35.940 --> 02:04:42.020]   So if there's a certain, yeah, I don't have any good written stewed.
[02:04:42.020 --> 02:04:47.780]   No, I would like to see more consequences to the folks at Equifax.
[02:04:47.780 --> 02:04:54.060]   Actually, he made $480,000 and avoided a loss of $117,000.
[02:04:54.060 --> 02:04:57.060]   That's why that was the fine.
[02:04:57.060 --> 02:04:58.060]   That's why that was the fine.
[02:04:58.060 --> 02:04:59.860]   Well, you're going to get that loss anyway.
[02:04:59.860 --> 02:05:04.140]   And free meals from the state for four months.
[02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:09.860]   FCC has allowed Verizon to remember that Verizon didn't doesn't lock its cell phones because
[02:05:09.860 --> 02:05:11.660]   of his consent degree.
[02:05:11.660 --> 02:05:12.660]   Right.
[02:05:12.660 --> 02:05:17.300]   Because of the right because of the 700 megahertz spectrum.
[02:05:17.300 --> 02:05:18.300]   Yeah, the spectrum stuff.
[02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:19.300]   Yeah.
[02:05:19.300 --> 02:05:20.300]   But now they can.
[02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:21.300]   But now they can.
[02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:22.300]   And that's only two months.
[02:05:22.300 --> 02:05:23.300]   And they will auto unlock.
[02:05:23.300 --> 02:05:24.300]   That's the good thing.
[02:05:24.300 --> 02:05:27.460]   Like the, I'm a Verizon customer, but grudgingly.
[02:05:27.460 --> 02:05:29.220]   And I am at least happy.
[02:05:29.220 --> 02:05:32.860]   Like this is frustrating, especially for people who do go internationally or whatever.
[02:05:32.860 --> 02:05:37.060]   But this is, at least it's only two months and they'll auto unlock what's always frustrated
[02:05:37.060 --> 02:05:40.860]   me before, like with AT&T and some of the others is you have to call them.
[02:05:40.860 --> 02:05:44.100]   And even if you bought it outright, they'll give you the run around before they'll unlock
[02:05:44.100 --> 02:05:45.100]   your phone.
[02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:47.460]   Like, okay, but I'm going to another country.
[02:05:47.460 --> 02:05:49.300]   Oh, we'll just pay our inflated rate.
[02:05:49.300 --> 02:05:52.340]   I'm like, no, but I don't want to do that.
[02:05:52.340 --> 02:05:57.900]   So that's at least, I guess, good that it'll be auto unlock, but it is disappointing that
[02:05:57.900 --> 02:06:01.700]   they're able to auto lock, that they're able to lock people's phones.
[02:06:01.700 --> 02:06:05.420]   They're, excuse for this, which the, and by the way, they've been locking them before
[02:06:05.420 --> 02:06:06.420]   sale as well.
[02:06:06.420 --> 02:06:09.620]   Their excuse for it is to prevent theft.
[02:06:09.620 --> 02:06:11.100]   But T-Mobile had none of it.
[02:06:11.100 --> 02:06:12.500]   They told the FCC.
[02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:16.860]   There's no evidence this limited action would have the desired effect during the 60 day
[02:06:16.860 --> 02:06:22.300]   period, a fraudulent party would merely be required to make a payment of about $40.
[02:06:22.300 --> 02:06:23.300]   Right.
[02:06:23.300 --> 02:06:25.700]   And Verizon would unlock it.
[02:06:25.700 --> 02:06:26.700]   Right.
[02:06:26.700 --> 02:06:30.260]   So if there's no evidence this is going to do anything, I don't know, Verizon, I think
[02:06:30.260 --> 02:06:34.580]   probably would just like to slowly increase this from 60 days to 90 days.
[02:06:34.580 --> 02:06:36.060]   No, that's totally what they want.
[02:06:36.060 --> 02:06:38.620]   They don't want people to leave their network, right?
[02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:43.580]   They don't want people buying their phones and then able to use them on another network.
[02:06:43.580 --> 02:06:47.900]   And it's like, okay, but as long as I'm paying my bill, then why do you care?
[02:06:47.900 --> 02:06:48.900]   Exactly.
[02:06:48.900 --> 02:06:51.100]   This matters even less now.
[02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:57.340]   In the old days where you bought a phone and it was subsidized, like you could make a certain
[02:06:57.340 --> 02:06:58.340]   argument.
[02:06:58.340 --> 02:07:00.340]   Yeah, they were there.
[02:07:00.340 --> 02:07:01.340]   Yeah, right.
[02:07:01.340 --> 02:07:02.780]   During the subsidy period.
[02:07:02.780 --> 02:07:03.780]   Yeah.
[02:07:03.780 --> 02:07:04.780]   Totally.
[02:07:04.780 --> 02:07:09.980]   Now where you're not, that's just not a thing anymore and you are essentially, you know,
[02:07:09.980 --> 02:07:15.180]   least seeing this phone, but you are paying for it.
[02:07:15.180 --> 02:07:19.460]   And a lot of times not directly to the carrier, right?
[02:07:19.460 --> 02:07:21.860]   Sometimes it's due or whatever the third party is.
[02:07:21.860 --> 02:07:28.540]   So yeah, it's really not cool that the sim locking thing is still a thing.
[02:07:28.540 --> 02:07:35.500]   But love to see the FCC take a stronger hand in making sim locking illegal.
[02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:36.500]   Oh, yeah.
[02:07:36.500 --> 02:07:40.340]   You mean, you mean with our current FCC share, who's a former Verizon executive?
[02:07:40.340 --> 02:07:41.340]   Yeah.
[02:07:41.340 --> 02:07:43.420]   I definitely think that's going to happen.
[02:07:43.420 --> 02:07:44.420]   Of course.
[02:07:44.420 --> 02:07:46.420]   I definitely think that's a hassle.
[02:07:46.420 --> 02:07:48.180]   Yeah, we're not going to happen.
[02:07:48.180 --> 02:07:50.820]   But we'd love to see, I believe they should do that.
[02:07:50.820 --> 02:07:54.300]   That is something that's a place where the FCC should step in.
[02:07:54.300 --> 02:07:56.860]   No, I want 1000% agree.
[02:07:56.860 --> 02:08:01.980]   I mean, and it's interesting, but at this point, people move to these payment plans.
[02:08:01.980 --> 02:08:06.260]   Like Apple obviously has their own and if you get your phone through Apple, then it's
[02:08:06.260 --> 02:08:07.900]   unlocked by whatever.
[02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:12.100]   But then Verizon and AT&T and T-Mobile will have their own kind of payment plans where they'll
[02:08:12.100 --> 02:08:15.100]   say, oh, you just have to pay an extra $20 on your bill.
[02:08:15.100 --> 02:08:20.500]   And for some people, that can be more convenient than having to get a secondary contract agreement
[02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:22.140]   with another company.
[02:08:22.140 --> 02:08:27.060]   But I think that that really is kind of the best case scenario for consumers.
[02:08:27.060 --> 02:08:31.820]   If you can get it directly through your phone manufacturer and you can avoid the carrier
[02:08:31.820 --> 02:08:33.980]   altogether, that's probably the best.
[02:08:33.980 --> 02:08:36.820]   I said they brought to you by LegalZoom.
[02:08:36.820 --> 02:08:39.260]   LegalZoom is awesome.
[02:08:39.260 --> 02:08:40.500]   We've been using LegalZoom.
[02:08:40.500 --> 02:08:45.380]   We started Twit with LegalZoom, the corporation at the LLC, but the LLC papers.
[02:08:45.380 --> 02:08:48.780]   I asked Kevin Rose, I said, I want to start a business.
[02:08:48.780 --> 02:08:49.780]   You're experiencing this.
[02:08:49.780 --> 02:08:50.780]   What should we do?
[02:08:50.780 --> 02:08:52.860]   Go for LegalZoom.
[02:08:52.860 --> 02:08:54.580]   And they will do that because I can't afford a lawyer.
[02:08:54.580 --> 02:08:56.100]   They will do all the documents for you.
[02:08:56.100 --> 02:08:57.100]   It's great.
[02:08:57.100 --> 02:09:01.580]   They'll do LLCs, DBAs, S-Corp.
[02:09:01.580 --> 02:09:06.620]   And by the way, you can also do your will there, your last will or living trust.
[02:09:06.620 --> 02:09:09.220]   They have a friends and family discount right now.
[02:09:09.220 --> 02:09:13.020]   I want you to take advantage of it because it's almost too late.
[02:09:13.020 --> 02:09:14.020]   LegalZoom is not a law firm.
[02:09:14.020 --> 02:09:16.220]   I want to make this clear.
[02:09:16.220 --> 02:09:19.820]   Although they do have a network, they've organized a nationwide network of independent
[02:09:19.820 --> 02:09:23.540]   attorneys who can provide actual advice from attorneys for your business.
[02:09:23.540 --> 02:09:28.580]   But what their whole idea was to create, there's a lot of stuff that's paperwork so
[02:09:28.580 --> 02:09:34.060]   that you can get a lot of the stuff done, business formation, wills and trusts, intellectual
[02:09:34.060 --> 02:09:35.060]   property.
[02:09:35.060 --> 02:09:36.060]   We did our trademarks with LegalZoom.
[02:09:36.060 --> 02:09:39.420]   They could just do with LegalZoom, save huge amounts of money.
[02:09:39.420 --> 02:09:42.300]   And then if you need a lawyer, no problem.
[02:09:42.300 --> 02:09:47.060]   They have lawyers that pre-negotiated flat fee prices with them all over the country.
[02:09:47.060 --> 02:09:49.620]   Don't wait another minute putting off the things you need to get done.
[02:09:49.620 --> 02:09:53.340]   There is, I mean, I wish we didn't need lawyers, but it's true we do.
[02:09:53.340 --> 02:09:54.340]   We need paperwork.
[02:09:54.340 --> 02:09:55.780]   This has to happen.
[02:09:55.780 --> 02:10:00.540]   And if you're starting a business, if you don't have a will, you've got to do this.
[02:10:00.540 --> 02:10:02.460]   Visit LegalZoom.com right now.

[02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:34.900]   I'm not real happy about GrubHub.
[02:10:34.900 --> 02:10:35.900]   Did you see this there?
[02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:36.900]   Oh, yeah.
[02:10:36.900 --> 02:10:38.060]   That was-- that's sleazy.
[02:10:38.060 --> 02:10:39.460]   That's so sleazy.
[02:10:39.460 --> 02:10:46.420]   So apparently they're buying up restaurant web addresses for web restaurants that you
[02:10:46.420 --> 02:10:48.500]   don't use GrubHub, I guess.
[02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:50.100]   No, no, it's even worse.
[02:10:50.100 --> 02:10:53.940]   Sometimes it's that don't use them, but a lot of times it's web addresses that do use
[02:10:53.940 --> 02:10:58.460]   them and it will take them to their GrubHub page and the GrubHub phone number.
[02:10:58.460 --> 02:11:01.140]   So if you called order, you're actually going through GrubHub.
[02:11:01.140 --> 02:11:02.140]   Oh.
[02:11:02.140 --> 02:11:03.140]   It's a commission.
[02:11:03.140 --> 02:11:04.140]   What happens is--
[02:11:04.140 --> 02:11:05.140]   What happens is--
[02:11:05.140 --> 02:11:06.140]   Right.
[02:11:06.140 --> 02:11:08.620]   Because a lot of the restaurants themselves, they'll use GrubHub, which also owns Seamless,
[02:11:08.620 --> 02:11:11.420]   because it can be more convenient and they handle a lot of back-and-things.
[02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:13.060]   But it costs a lot of money.
[02:11:13.060 --> 02:11:19.260]   And I know that when I was in New York, City, we're Seamless rules, the whole kind of space.
[02:11:19.260 --> 02:11:23.740]   Very frequently, a lot of the delivery places would have things inside the food saying,
[02:11:23.740 --> 02:11:29.340]   please order directly from our website, because they can get better.
[02:11:29.340 --> 02:11:33.460]   They don't have to pay as much money there and their margins are a lot better.
[02:11:33.460 --> 02:11:39.380]   So the idea would be, OK, I Googled this restaurant and rather than going to the page that has
[02:11:39.380 --> 02:11:43.980]   their own delivery system, which might cost them less money, instead GrubHub is buying
[02:11:43.980 --> 02:11:48.660]   their very similar domain name and trying to filter everything through them.
[02:11:48.660 --> 02:11:54.500]   This is kind of an explicit, published in NewFood Economy at NewFood Economy.org.
[02:11:54.500 --> 02:12:00.180]   GrubHub sent them a statement saying, "GrubHub is never cyber-squatted, which is identified
[02:12:00.180 --> 02:12:04.660]   by ICANN as a generally bad faith registration of another person's trademark in a domain name
[02:12:04.660 --> 02:12:07.700]   as a service to our restaurants."
[02:12:07.700 --> 02:12:08.700]   We have created--
[02:12:08.700 --> 02:12:13.900]   We have created micro sites for them as another source of orders and to increase their online
[02:12:13.900 --> 02:12:15.220]   brand presence.
[02:12:15.220 --> 02:12:20.460]   Additionally, we have registered domains on their behalf consistent with our restaurant
[02:12:20.460 --> 02:12:21.660]   contracts.
[02:12:21.660 --> 02:12:23.380]   We no longer provide that service.
[02:12:23.380 --> 02:12:27.380]   And it's always been our practice to transfer the domain to the restaurant as soon as they
[02:12:27.380 --> 02:12:28.380]   request it.
[02:12:28.380 --> 02:12:34.180]   So I actually ran into this a couple of weeks ago where I ordered some Chinese food near
[02:12:34.180 --> 02:12:39.780]   the Chronicle for lunch, and I had done this before online with this particular restaurant,
[02:12:39.780 --> 02:12:45.020]   and I would go to their website, and they would have their own system.
[02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:51.100]   I went--I googled their website and clicked on a link, and it took me to a GrubHub site.
[02:12:51.100 --> 02:12:54.620]   And it was not the restaurant itself, and I thought, "Wait a minute."
[02:12:54.620 --> 02:12:59.860]   And so I manually typed in the URL, which I knew, and it took me back to them, and then
[02:12:59.860 --> 02:13:06.300]   I clicked on their order online, and it took me to a GrubHub embed page on their site.
[02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:12.100]   But my initial trip, my initial click, took me to this GrubHub thing that didn't look
[02:13:12.100 --> 02:13:14.580]   right, and it almost looked like it hit the hijack.
[02:13:14.580 --> 02:13:16.300]   Oh, this actually happened to you.
[02:13:16.300 --> 02:13:19.860]   So the reason this works is because GrubHub's contracts with the restaurant give them a
[02:13:19.860 --> 02:13:26.900]   higher commission if the customer comes through GrubHub to the restaurant as opposed--
[02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:31.140]   So if you go to the restaurant page and order, even if GrubHub delivers it, they don't make
[02:13:31.140 --> 02:13:34.020]   as much money as if you go through GrubHub to get to them.
[02:13:34.020 --> 02:13:35.020]   So it makes sense.
[02:13:35.020 --> 02:13:36.020]   And that's what I wound up doing.
[02:13:36.020 --> 02:13:38.340]   I wound up using the embedded version.
[02:13:38.340 --> 02:13:39.340]   Yeah.
[02:13:39.340 --> 02:13:43.940]   So it's really--it's just so not cool, because, you know, for example, there's a small business
[02:13:43.940 --> 02:13:48.660]   owner, not far from here, that owns a smoothie and sandwich shop.
[02:13:48.660 --> 02:13:55.420]   And they started taking one of these services recently, and I was asking them just because
[02:13:55.420 --> 02:13:58.020]   they're great and a lot of us go there.
[02:13:58.020 --> 02:13:59.340]   And I was just like, how's that going?
[02:13:59.340 --> 02:14:02.220]   You know, just what--you know, is there a good reason to do it?
[02:14:02.220 --> 02:14:07.660]   And they're like, look, we think of that as 80% of a sale, right?
[02:14:07.660 --> 02:14:12.420]   Because the service takes 20% of that sale in this case.
[02:14:12.420 --> 02:14:16.020]   80% of a sale that we wouldn't have gotten anyway.
[02:14:16.020 --> 02:14:17.620]   So for us, we're willing to do it.
[02:14:17.620 --> 02:14:23.540]   We take a small on margin, but that's why we're willing to.
[02:14:23.540 --> 02:14:26.940]   But if that's a customer that would have come to them anyway, and then they're getting
[02:14:26.940 --> 02:14:31.620]   redirected and basically GrubHub's taking that, they're really taking money straight
[02:14:31.620 --> 02:14:35.820]   out of the pocket of small business owners who are working on small margins, who are
[02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:41.700]   just trying to make it, you know, and trying to live off of this and pay, you know, their
[02:14:41.700 --> 02:14:42.700]   employees.
[02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:44.540]   And so it's just so not cool.
[02:14:44.540 --> 02:14:46.540]   It's in such bad faith that they would do it.
[02:14:46.540 --> 02:14:50.900]   It just makes you not want to do business with a company that would, you know, try to
[02:14:50.900 --> 02:14:53.900]   literally just take money out of the pocket of small business.
[02:14:53.900 --> 02:14:56.100]   This is an example.
[02:14:56.100 --> 02:14:58.020]   There's a Daytona Beach.
[02:14:58.020 --> 02:15:01.140]   There's a sub shop called Molly Hatchets.
[02:15:01.140 --> 02:15:06.660]   They're, which is a great name, they're URL is Molly Hatchets sub shop.com.
[02:15:06.660 --> 02:15:10.540]   And if you go there, you'll get the real Molly Hatchets page where they have their own
[02:15:10.540 --> 02:15:13.580]   or online ordering system, not a GrubHub system.
[02:15:13.580 --> 02:15:16.180]   But there is a GrubHub page they made.
[02:15:16.180 --> 02:15:21.740]   Molly Hatchets sub shop Daytona Beach.com where the order goes through GrubHub.
[02:15:21.740 --> 02:15:23.220]   And of course, they make a lot more money.
[02:15:23.220 --> 02:15:26.900]   In fact, they don't make any money if you use Molly Hatchets order system.
[02:15:26.900 --> 02:15:32.220]   So that is kind of that's close to the main squatting.
[02:15:32.220 --> 02:15:33.820]   I definitely think so.
[02:15:33.820 --> 02:15:37.300]   I mean, you know, and I like seamless GrubHub.
[02:15:37.300 --> 02:15:40.860]   I use them a lot, but that's, I'm not a fan of this and the slightest.
[02:15:40.860 --> 02:15:46.700]   And especially since that article, and I read it, I was not familiar with that publication,
[02:15:46.700 --> 02:15:47.900]   but it's really good.
[02:15:47.900 --> 02:15:55.100]   They've talked to some business owners who have seen the fees can increase over the years
[02:15:55.100 --> 02:15:58.700]   and they've had to kind of, it's impacted their businesses quite a bit.
[02:15:58.700 --> 02:16:02.740]   Like it really makes you kind of, it's gross, right?
[02:16:02.740 --> 02:16:05.900]   Because they're already, they have a good service.
[02:16:05.900 --> 02:16:09.700]   And it's one of those things where a lot of, I think restaurants would use them anyway.
[02:16:09.700 --> 02:16:12.100]   And like Jason was saying, knowing the trade offs.
[02:16:12.100 --> 02:16:14.260]   But this is going into another direction.
[02:16:14.260 --> 02:16:19.620]   Like this is literally trying to use your own SEO, your own purposes to, you know, take,
[02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:20.620]   you know, to take.
[02:16:20.620 --> 02:16:22.180]   This is the next, this is like Uber, isn't it?
[02:16:22.180 --> 02:16:25.940]   It's the next area where these companies, there's a lot of competition.
[02:16:25.940 --> 02:16:27.420]   They're moving into markets.
[02:16:27.420 --> 02:16:29.580]   What do you, what do you use in Seattle?
[02:16:29.580 --> 02:16:31.620]   I use, I use seamless GrubHub.
[02:16:31.620 --> 02:16:33.700]   We don't have great delivery stuff, but I use that.
[02:16:33.700 --> 02:16:36.900]   I mean, sometimes Uber eats or whatever, but yeah.
[02:16:36.900 --> 02:16:38.700]   Jason, do you ever use these services?
[02:16:38.700 --> 02:16:39.700]   Yep.
[02:16:39.700 --> 02:16:42.580]   Uber eats, DoorDash, seamless GrubHub.
[02:16:42.580 --> 02:16:44.740]   They're all here in Louisville.
[02:16:44.740 --> 02:16:48.540]   So you see the competition and it's tough.
[02:16:48.540 --> 02:16:50.380]   I mean, how do you decide that day?
[02:16:50.380 --> 02:16:52.700]   Is it by restaurant or?
[02:16:52.700 --> 02:16:56.100]   It's, it's, sometimes it depends on for me, like what the delivery fee is going to be,
[02:16:56.100 --> 02:16:57.100]   to be totally honest.
[02:16:57.100 --> 02:17:00.860]   Like a lot of times it does tend to be cheaper on seamless, but sometimes for instance,
[02:17:00.860 --> 02:17:04.420]   like postmates will have a better deal with or an arrangement with somebody or DoorDash
[02:17:04.420 --> 02:17:05.420]   will.
[02:17:05.420 --> 02:17:07.860]   And sometimes Uber eats has like a promo.
[02:17:07.860 --> 02:17:09.620]   So, how about you, Jason?
[02:17:09.620 --> 02:17:13.180]   Is there, is there a, what criteria to use to decide?
[02:17:13.180 --> 02:17:16.460]   They're all pretty, pretty much the same, but they, the different restaurants will use
[02:17:16.460 --> 02:17:17.460]   different ones.
[02:17:17.460 --> 02:17:19.660]   And so sometimes it just depends on the restaurant.
[02:17:19.660 --> 02:17:21.260]   I know what I want to eat out.
[02:17:21.260 --> 02:17:22.260]   Yeah.
[02:17:22.260 --> 02:17:23.260]   Yeah.
[02:17:23.260 --> 02:17:26.060]   Well, you know, it's such, it's such a tough business that Amazon got out of it.
[02:17:26.060 --> 02:17:30.540]   Amazon's doing these kinds of deliveries and they, they decided that he wanted a piece
[02:17:30.540 --> 02:17:31.860]   of it and they walked away from it.
[02:17:31.860 --> 02:17:34.820]   That's surprising since they're already driving to my house every day anyway.
[02:17:34.820 --> 02:17:37.820]   Well, that was the thing, they were trying to use that.
[02:17:37.820 --> 02:17:41.420]   To be fair, the Amazon food thing, at least when I tried it, was not good at all.
[02:17:41.420 --> 02:17:45.420]   It was expensive compared to the others and usually, you know, you waited longer and then
[02:17:45.420 --> 02:17:47.140]   their restaurant selection was not good.
[02:17:47.140 --> 02:17:48.140]   But yeah, you're exactly right.
[02:17:48.140 --> 02:17:50.580]   They, they're like, peace, we're out of this.
[02:17:50.580 --> 02:17:52.140]   So funny, when I was growing up, I'm sure.
[02:17:52.140 --> 02:17:53.140]   I hate to say it.
[02:17:53.140 --> 02:17:54.140]   Go ahead.
[02:17:54.140 --> 02:17:57.540]   So I was just going to say, I hate to say it, but cause, cause I'm not a fan of Uber.
[02:17:57.540 --> 02:18:00.420]   Like if I have to, I use Lyft whenever possible.
[02:18:00.420 --> 02:18:06.340]   You never use Uber unless I have no choice but anything else, but Uber Eats is actually
[02:18:06.340 --> 02:18:08.420]   the ones that I've used.
[02:18:08.420 --> 02:18:09.700]   They're the, they're the best.
[02:18:09.700 --> 02:18:10.700]   They're the most reliable.
[02:18:10.700 --> 02:18:11.700]   They get it.
[02:18:11.700 --> 02:18:12.700]   They're the fast, fast, fast.
[02:18:12.700 --> 02:18:14.940]   They're, they're just Uber drivers doing delivery, right?
[02:18:14.940 --> 02:18:16.540]   Is that it's the same people, right?
[02:18:16.540 --> 02:18:17.540]   Yeah.
[02:18:17.540 --> 02:18:20.660]   Usually sometimes I think that like I believe the background checks and stuff are different
[02:18:20.660 --> 02:18:23.380]   for Uber Eats versus Uber because they're literally strong.
[02:18:23.380 --> 02:18:27.140]   If you kidnap my egg for young, it's not the end of the world.
[02:18:27.140 --> 02:18:29.140]   Well, it might be.
[02:18:29.140 --> 02:18:32.860]   It's a lot of, a lot of kids on, on mopeds internationally.
[02:18:32.860 --> 02:18:37.060]   Like when I've done it in France and in, or my Spain, I should say.
[02:18:37.060 --> 02:18:41.420]   Yeah, there's deliberu internationally in the UK and in a lot of other countries.
[02:18:41.420 --> 02:18:42.420]   There's some other ones.
[02:18:42.420 --> 02:18:45.060]   It's amazing how this has changed because I mean, Dwight, right?
[02:18:45.060 --> 02:18:47.220]   It was just pizza for the longest time.
[02:18:47.220 --> 02:18:48.220]   Right.
[02:18:48.220 --> 02:18:54.700]   We have, it's when the Chronicle moved from downtown out to a, not necessarily suburban
[02:18:54.700 --> 02:18:57.220]   but a rather further out location.
[02:18:57.220 --> 02:19:00.900]   We're kind of, you have to get in your car to go somewhere to get any food.
[02:19:00.900 --> 02:19:04.820]   And so, we have two services here that are very interesting.
[02:19:04.820 --> 02:19:09.620]   They have one called lunch drop where every day there are two different restaurants and
[02:19:09.620 --> 02:19:14.020]   you could choose from the complete menu of either these two restaurants and you pay and
[02:19:14.020 --> 02:19:18.820]   there's a very small delivery fee because they're bringing items in at bulk and you
[02:19:18.820 --> 02:19:24.140]   can get one for these restaurants and they usually arrive, you know, hot, it's fresh.
[02:19:24.140 --> 02:19:31.980]   And then there's also a company called food that comes in and allows places, restaurants
[02:19:31.980 --> 02:19:36.300]   to set up pop up shops in our cafeteria area.
[02:19:36.300 --> 02:19:41.500]   So we have like a Chick-fil-A from down the road comes in and sells Chick-fil-A.
[02:19:41.500 --> 02:19:48.420]   We have a bunch of barbecue places at Cubbins and those are good.
[02:19:48.420 --> 02:19:49.660]   We have a lot of Asian.
[02:19:49.660 --> 02:19:52.300]   We have a lot of halal comes in.
[02:19:52.300 --> 02:19:57.700]   So every day there's a different restaurant in the building and you order through an app.
[02:19:57.700 --> 02:20:03.620]   You go in, you take the one, you show them your barcode and you walk away with it.
[02:20:03.620 --> 02:20:04.620]   I'm so impressed.
[02:20:04.620 --> 02:20:10.460]   We talk a lot about, you know, economic struggles and stuff but this is where all the innovation
[02:20:10.460 --> 02:20:12.420]   is happening now, right?
[02:20:12.420 --> 02:20:13.980]   It's almost a new...
[02:20:13.980 --> 02:20:14.980]   It's a service.
[02:20:14.980 --> 02:20:19.420]   It's like a new economy and it's springing up everywhere and people see...
[02:20:19.420 --> 02:20:25.220]   I mean, that's very specific to your area, Dwight, because I mean, they wouldn't do that
[02:20:25.220 --> 02:20:26.700]   here because there's plenty of...
[02:20:26.700 --> 02:20:28.700]   There's an I-hop next door.
[02:20:28.700 --> 02:20:34.140]   But for you, and I imagine a lot of businesses in Houston, that's a sensible business.
[02:20:34.140 --> 02:20:36.540]   And what is empowering this?
[02:20:36.540 --> 02:20:41.140]   Is it the fact that the internet and apps and computer in your pocket make it so easy for
[02:20:41.140 --> 02:20:42.980]   this kind of stuff to happen?
[02:20:42.980 --> 02:20:45.940]   Back to the first story, it is smart folks.
[02:20:45.940 --> 02:20:46.940]   Yeah.
[02:20:46.940 --> 02:20:50.660]   And it's things that came out of that, like Stripe, right?
[02:20:50.660 --> 02:20:52.620]   Or not Stripe Square.
[02:20:52.620 --> 02:20:57.260]   Like, which is a great example of being able to finally collect payments.
[02:20:57.260 --> 02:21:01.060]   You don't have to have that huge POS system, food trucks and other places.
[02:21:01.060 --> 02:21:02.060]   And now just...
[02:21:02.060 --> 02:21:04.300]   Everybody uses a square now, right?
[02:21:04.300 --> 02:21:05.300]   Totally.
[02:21:05.300 --> 02:21:09.060]   And it's a psychotherapist who uses Square to take care of.
[02:21:09.060 --> 02:21:13.140]   How long before we get rid of the credit card and start using Apple Pay or Venmo or some
[02:21:13.140 --> 02:21:17.340]   sort of all digital or Facebook, Zuckbox.
[02:21:17.340 --> 02:21:23.060]   I mean, the idea of a Stripe or a swipe with the credit card in the Square is kind of...
[02:21:23.060 --> 02:21:24.060]   Yeah.
[02:21:24.060 --> 02:21:26.060]   Well, they're already just contactless with the...
[02:21:26.060 --> 02:21:27.060]   Oh, they're already using iPhone.
[02:21:27.060 --> 02:21:28.060]   Yeah, it's kind of...
[02:21:28.060 --> 02:21:33.020]   Yeah, it's going to say, it's really cool to go to Europe where every place takes contactless.
[02:21:33.020 --> 02:21:36.940]   And my Rose Gold American Express card does support that, which is nice.
[02:21:36.940 --> 02:21:38.540]   And they've had that for years.
[02:21:38.540 --> 02:21:41.140]   They look at things like Apple Pay and they're like, "That's..."
[02:21:41.140 --> 02:21:42.140]   Oh, I know.
[02:21:42.140 --> 02:21:43.140]   We're just catching up.
[02:21:43.140 --> 02:21:44.140]   We still...
[02:21:44.140 --> 02:21:46.340]   It's the last year you had to sign your name.
[02:21:46.340 --> 02:21:49.660]   Like that was some magic incantation that we're carrying.
[02:21:49.660 --> 02:21:52.140]   This is really you.
[02:21:52.140 --> 02:21:53.140]   That was crazy.
[02:21:53.140 --> 02:21:54.140]   Let me take one more break.
[02:21:54.140 --> 02:21:55.140]   There's still some things to talk...
[02:21:55.140 --> 02:21:56.140]   Lots of things to talk about.
[02:21:56.140 --> 02:21:57.580]   What a great panel though, Christina Warren.
[02:21:57.580 --> 02:21:59.980]   Filmgirl is here.
[02:21:59.980 --> 02:22:03.340]   In fact, you know Simone is going to be on the show next week.
[02:22:03.340 --> 02:22:04.340]   I'm so excited.
[02:22:04.340 --> 02:22:05.620]   She's so excited about that.
[02:22:05.620 --> 02:22:06.860]   She has never done it before.
[02:22:06.860 --> 02:22:12.740]   Of course, Simone de Roch for along with Brianna Wu, a co-host rocket with Christina.
[02:22:12.740 --> 02:22:14.100]   And she's never been in our shows.
[02:22:14.100 --> 02:22:15.100]   I've never even met her.
[02:22:15.100 --> 02:22:16.100]   So I'm really excited.
[02:22:16.100 --> 02:22:17.100]   She's so good.
[02:22:17.100 --> 02:22:19.100]   I love her on Rocket.
[02:22:19.100 --> 02:22:20.100]   So yeah.
[02:22:20.100 --> 02:22:22.300]   Are you going to give her some tips before she comes on?
[02:22:22.300 --> 02:22:23.300]   Yes, yes.
[02:22:23.300 --> 02:22:25.500]   She's a little nervous, but she's going to do great and you're going to love her.
[02:22:25.500 --> 02:22:30.340]   Tell her to have all her purses hanging up behind her.
[02:22:30.340 --> 02:22:31.340]   Is she French?
[02:22:31.340 --> 02:22:33.420]   Originally, her parents are...
[02:22:33.420 --> 02:22:35.060]   Her dad, I think is.
[02:22:35.060 --> 02:22:40.100]   So we're doing it, I think, in all French episodes next week because it's Patrick Bejah, Simone
[02:22:40.100 --> 02:22:44.700]   de Roch for Leola Baut, and who's the fourth person?
[02:22:44.700 --> 02:22:47.060]   There's another French person.
[02:22:47.060 --> 02:22:48.260]   Who is it?
[02:22:48.260 --> 02:22:51.140]   Paris Martineau and Michael Sargent.
[02:22:51.140 --> 02:22:52.140]   He's the wild card.
[02:22:52.140 --> 02:22:56.180]   We're throwing Mike in because we're very pleased to have announced today that we just hired
[02:22:56.180 --> 02:22:57.180]   Michael Sargent.
[02:22:57.180 --> 02:22:58.180]   Oh, that's wonderful.
[02:22:58.180 --> 02:22:59.180]   Niceest guy ever.
[02:22:59.180 --> 02:23:00.180]   Congratulations.
[02:23:00.180 --> 02:23:01.180]   I love Michael Sargent.
[02:23:01.180 --> 02:23:02.180]   Isn't it great?
[02:23:02.180 --> 02:23:03.180]   Yes.
[02:23:03.180 --> 02:23:04.180]   Yes, we do.
[02:23:04.180 --> 02:23:08.940]   Thanks for I'mor and we loved him and I'mor, but I don't want to poach because Renee Ritchie
[02:23:08.940 --> 02:23:12.980]   is a regular on MacBrick Weekly and I love the I'mor team.
[02:23:12.980 --> 02:23:16.660]   But when I'mor shrank a little bit, they did some layoffs and Michael became available.
[02:23:16.660 --> 02:23:22.860]   He said, "Oh, the only trick was getting him and his chihuahas to move out here."
[02:23:22.860 --> 02:23:23.860]   But he's going out.
[02:23:23.860 --> 02:23:25.380]   So I'm very excited.
[02:23:25.380 --> 02:23:28.180]   I don't know how the chihuahas aren't going to like it, but I know he'll be very happy
[02:23:28.180 --> 02:23:29.180]   here.
[02:23:29.180 --> 02:23:30.180]   Oh, I'm so excited.
[02:23:30.180 --> 02:23:31.180]   I love him.
[02:23:31.180 --> 02:23:32.180]   No.
[02:23:32.180 --> 02:23:33.180]   He and I used to do a podcast, a cartoon cast together.
[02:23:33.180 --> 02:23:35.100]   He does like a million podcasts.
[02:23:35.100 --> 02:23:38.540]   I know we weren't able to keep it up, but it was a lot of fun and he's wonderful.
[02:23:38.540 --> 02:23:39.540]   I love him so much.
[02:23:39.540 --> 02:23:40.540]   He's kept great energy.
[02:23:40.540 --> 02:23:41.540]   Yeah.
[02:23:41.540 --> 02:23:47.940]   Ask him some time to tell you about the time his iPad was stolen and I almost went full
[02:23:47.940 --> 02:23:50.580]   on like anyway.
[02:23:50.580 --> 02:23:52.100]   We tried to track the thieves down.
[02:23:52.100 --> 02:23:53.100]   Let's just put it that way.
[02:23:53.100 --> 02:23:54.100]   Ask him to tell you about that.
[02:23:54.100 --> 02:23:55.100]   Never.
[02:23:55.100 --> 02:23:56.100]   Don't do that.
[02:23:56.100 --> 02:23:57.100]   That's very dangerous.
[02:23:57.100 --> 02:24:04.540]   I was very upset for my friend having his device stolen at a party.
[02:24:04.540 --> 02:24:07.940]   The only thing Michael wanted to know is if he could bring his chihuahuas to work and
[02:24:07.940 --> 02:24:11.340]   I said, "If you don't bring your chihuahuas to work, I'll be mad at you."
[02:24:11.340 --> 02:24:14.900]   We will now be chihuahua powered.
[02:24:14.900 --> 02:24:17.500]   Jason Hire is also here.
[02:24:17.500 --> 02:24:18.900]   Congratulations on his new gig.
[02:24:18.900 --> 02:24:20.220]   He couldn't tell us about it last time.
[02:24:20.220 --> 02:24:22.140]   Editorial director of CNET Advice.
[02:24:22.140 --> 02:24:26.420]   Big is that a big promotion for you, Jason?
[02:24:26.420 --> 02:24:35.780]   I mean, CNET is such a big and important brand and CBS interactive portfolio.
[02:24:35.780 --> 02:24:40.820]   It's just a great opportunity to work with so many awesome people.
[02:24:40.820 --> 02:24:47.060]   Got a team of terrific folks who actually would be wonderful guests on a lot of your
[02:24:47.060 --> 02:24:48.060]   shows.
[02:24:48.060 --> 02:24:49.060]   We can talk about that later.
[02:24:49.060 --> 02:24:50.060]   Let's talk.
[02:24:50.060 --> 02:24:53.980]   People like Dan Ackerman and David Katzmeyer and Jessica Dolkort.
[02:24:53.980 --> 02:24:54.980]   I love to.
[02:24:54.980 --> 02:24:56.140]   Oh, I know Jessica.
[02:24:56.140 --> 02:24:57.140]   That would be great.
[02:24:57.140 --> 02:25:00.620]   Of course, your boss, Lindsay Ternetin, is a regular on Twitch.
[02:25:00.620 --> 02:25:01.900]   It's a good crew over there.
[02:25:01.900 --> 02:25:04.580]   You know I was the third or fourth employee of CNET.
[02:25:04.580 --> 02:25:05.580]   Did you know that?
[02:25:05.580 --> 02:25:06.580]   I know.
[02:25:06.580 --> 02:25:07.580]   Oh, you wrote the book about me.
[02:25:07.580 --> 02:25:08.580]   I forgot.
[02:25:08.580 --> 02:25:09.580]   That's amazing.
[02:25:09.580 --> 02:25:10.580]   I did not know that.
[02:25:10.580 --> 02:25:17.660]   Oh, my boss, Jeff Sanquist, would also like to come on anytime you would want him to Leo.
[02:25:17.660 --> 02:25:20.660]   Hired or whatever it is that we do.
[02:25:20.660 --> 02:25:22.300]   He's booked.
[02:25:22.300 --> 02:25:23.660]   Just send me an email or send card.
[02:25:23.660 --> 02:25:24.660]   Best of luck.
[02:25:24.660 --> 02:25:27.460]   I'll send you an email because I don't even look at my email.
[02:25:27.460 --> 02:25:32.180]   And also Dwight Silverman, who for a long time, he said, "I don't want to do tech anymore.
[02:25:32.180 --> 02:25:35.660]   I'm just a reporter now at the Houston Chronicle.
[02:25:35.660 --> 02:25:36.900]   We had to say goodbye to him.
[02:25:36.900 --> 02:25:39.660]   Thank God he went back to tech with TechBurger."
[02:25:39.660 --> 02:25:41.580]   And now he's once again a regular.
[02:25:41.580 --> 02:25:42.580]   He's incredible.
[02:25:42.580 --> 02:25:43.940]   They pulled me back in.
[02:25:43.940 --> 02:25:45.580]   You can't get out of it, can you?
[02:25:45.580 --> 02:25:46.580]   No, I cannot.
[02:25:46.580 --> 02:25:52.820]   And as I said earlier, I'm expanding with the newsletter release notes at heustoncronicle.com/release
[02:25:52.820 --> 02:25:53.820]   notes.
[02:25:53.820 --> 02:25:54.820]   And it's going to be very personal.
[02:25:54.820 --> 02:25:55.820]   It's not just like reporting.
[02:25:55.820 --> 02:25:56.820]   It's going to be personal.
[02:25:56.820 --> 02:26:01.820]   Well, so what we're going to do is the first item in it is actually going to be a story
[02:26:01.820 --> 02:26:15.580]   or a column that will appear only in the newsletter for an exclusive period of time.
[02:26:15.580 --> 02:26:18.660]   And then we'll show up on the website and then later in print.
[02:26:18.660 --> 02:26:23.780]   And we'll do kind of the best links of the web for the week, kind of this week in tech.
[02:26:23.780 --> 02:26:30.780]   And then we'll do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a new list of the videos.
[02:26:30.780 --> 02:26:36.060]   And we'll do a little bit of a new list of the videos that we're going to do.
[02:26:36.060 --> 02:26:40.860]   And we're going to do a little bit of a new list of the videos that we're going to do.
[02:26:40.860 --> 02:26:44.460]   And we'll do a little bit of a new list of the videos that we're going to do.
[02:26:44.460 --> 02:26:49.400]   So, we're going to do a little bit of a new list of the videos that we're going to do.
[02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:54.040]   For the moon landing, we've got a newsletter called Space Junk.
[02:26:54.040 --> 02:27:00.600]   And we have a podcast called Cigarettes and Rocket Fuel that takes place in the 1960s
[02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:02.600]   in the walk up to the landing on the moon.
[02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:03.600]   So we're having a great time.
[02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:04.600]   That's awesome.
[02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:05.600]   That's July.
[02:27:05.600 --> 02:27:07.680]   It's coming up at 50th anniversary.
[02:27:07.680 --> 02:27:09.160]   That's really exciting.
[02:27:09.160 --> 02:27:17.080]   There's a wonderful website that I mentioned a while ago that is a timeline of the Apollo
[02:27:17.080 --> 02:27:18.080]   11 launch.
[02:27:18.080 --> 02:27:19.080]   It's like a real-time timeline.
[02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:20.080]   It's in real time.
[02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:21.080]   It's in real time.
[02:27:21.080 --> 02:27:27.640]   Because I don't know if you've seen the Apollo 11 movie, which was amazing.
[02:27:27.640 --> 02:27:34.320]   But there is, it turns out, a lot of footage, including like Cinerama quality 4K footage,
[02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:36.440]   film footage of it.
[02:27:36.440 --> 02:27:39.600]   And it's really cool.
[02:27:39.600 --> 02:27:45.680]   So what they did, if I can find it, I don't know where it is, is they, there's so much,
[02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:49.840]   there's hours and hours of mission control recordings.
[02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:53.760]   There's all this footage nobody's ever seen from all the different cameras.
[02:27:53.760 --> 02:28:01.120]   And they just put it in this timeline, which is a brilliant idea that you can participate
[02:28:01.120 --> 02:28:04.040]   in real time if you wanted to start right now.
[02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:06.480]   And you'd go up to, what is it, July 11th?
[02:28:06.480 --> 02:28:07.480]   Is the landing?
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:08.480]   July 20th.
[02:28:08.480 --> 02:28:10.360]   July 20th, yeah.
[02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:14.520]   You could have it running in the background at all time.
[02:28:14.520 --> 02:28:19.960]   But there's a lot, unfortunately, if I'm searching Apollo 11 timeline, there's like 800 of these.
[02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:21.600]   Oh, here's an interactive timeline.
[02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:23.520]   Let's see if this is it.
[02:28:23.520 --> 02:28:25.240]   Is this the one?
[02:28:25.240 --> 02:28:27.640]   No, there's quite a few of these though.
[02:28:27.640 --> 02:28:30.360]   Well, I guess I found a number of them.
[02:28:30.360 --> 02:28:32.040]   It's very elaborate.
[02:28:32.040 --> 02:28:36.480]   And you kind of have to learn how to use it, but it's an excellent resource.
[02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:38.560]   Yeah, I love reliving.
[02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:39.640]   You and I are of an age.
[02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:41.160]   These young guys, they don't know.
[02:28:41.160 --> 02:28:42.360]   But you and I remember it.
[02:28:42.360 --> 02:28:43.360]   I don't know.
[02:28:43.360 --> 02:28:44.360]   I think I would expect you to.
[02:28:44.360 --> 02:28:45.360]   I certainly do.
[02:28:45.360 --> 02:28:55.040]   I sat in front of our Philco future television set with my reel to reel recorder recording
[02:28:55.040 --> 02:28:58.160]   the audio of the landing because I wanted to have it.
[02:28:58.160 --> 02:29:00.360]   And I was 13, I believe.
[02:29:00.360 --> 02:29:02.320]   The same age as me.
[02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:03.320]   Exactly.
[02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:04.320]   Who could forget that?
[02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:09.960]   I mean, that informed our whole life, I would say.
[02:29:09.960 --> 02:29:13.040]   And frankly, it's the greatest thing humans ever did.
[02:29:13.040 --> 02:29:14.040]   Sort of the iPhone.
[02:29:14.040 --> 02:29:17.080]   Yeah, except for the iPhone.
[02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:18.320]   Here's some happy news.
[02:29:18.320 --> 02:29:24.080]   The 737 MAX software, you know, this is the Boeing jet that's been grounded now for
[02:29:24.080 --> 02:29:25.720]   quite a while.
[02:29:25.720 --> 02:29:27.720]   They keep finding more problems with it.
[02:29:27.720 --> 02:29:29.560]   Maybe now we know why.
[02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:31.920]   Oh my God.
[02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:34.800]   This Boeing was laying off engineers.
[02:29:34.800 --> 02:29:35.800]   Yeah.
[02:29:35.800 --> 02:29:42.800]   Trying to cut costs and outsourcing the software for their jet to temporary workers.
[02:29:42.800 --> 02:29:46.680]   Overseas making as little as $9 an hour.
[02:29:46.680 --> 02:29:53.280]   These are the same engineers that provided patch updates for Huawei equipment.
[02:29:53.280 --> 02:29:54.280]   This is terrifying.
[02:29:54.280 --> 02:29:55.720]   And it's also very sad.
[02:29:55.720 --> 02:29:57.160]   You're up in Boeing country.
[02:29:57.160 --> 02:30:04.520]   Boeing was legendary, Christina, for being engineers, rigorous engineers who would do
[02:30:04.520 --> 02:30:08.000]   it right no matter what.
[02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:12.240]   And then they decided to cut costs.
[02:30:12.240 --> 02:30:15.960]   Long-time Boeing engineers told Bloomberg that the effort was complicated by a push
[02:30:15.960 --> 02:30:21.360]   to outsource work to lower paid contractors.
[02:30:21.360 --> 02:30:23.840]   And it may have cost many, many lives.
[02:30:23.840 --> 02:30:27.440]   And that's very sad.
[02:30:27.440 --> 02:30:34.480]   In fact, Bloomberg did a good job of tracking this down because they were looking at, they
[02:30:34.480 --> 02:30:40.800]   used social media check resumes posted by Indian engineers.
[02:30:40.800 --> 02:30:46.080]   And a company called HCL.
[02:30:46.080 --> 02:30:47.680]   And many of them had on their resume.
[02:30:47.680 --> 02:30:52.960]   They helped design and test Boeing's Max flight display software.
[02:30:52.960 --> 02:30:56.680]   Another Indian company handled software for the flight test equipment.
[02:30:56.680 --> 02:31:04.000]   So in fact, it was much less efficient because the coders from HCL technologies were designing
[02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.480]   the specifications from Boeing.
[02:31:06.480 --> 02:31:07.720]   So it added an extra step.
[02:31:07.720 --> 02:31:11.360]   In fact, it took many rounds according to one engineer going back and forth because the
[02:31:11.360 --> 02:31:13.760]   code wasn't done right.
[02:31:13.760 --> 02:31:17.640]   That's not a reflection on the Indian engineers by any means.
[02:31:17.640 --> 02:31:19.280]   No, not at all.
[02:31:19.280 --> 02:31:25.280]   But they're hiring out contractors and vendors for something that this much up most important
[02:31:25.280 --> 02:31:26.880]   should be done in house.
[02:31:26.880 --> 02:31:27.880]   Job one.
[02:31:27.880 --> 02:31:28.880]   Precisely.
[02:31:28.880 --> 02:31:29.880]   Job one.
[02:31:29.880 --> 02:31:30.880]   Yeah.
[02:31:30.880 --> 02:31:31.880]   Exactly.
[02:31:31.880 --> 02:31:32.880]   I was going to say we should be careful with that.
[02:31:32.880 --> 02:31:35.360]   Because in India, there are some of the best, you know, I--
[02:31:35.360 --> 02:31:36.360]   Absolutely.
[02:31:36.360 --> 02:31:39.000]   --development companies in the world.
[02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:43.560]   It's just a flawed way to do it, which is design this place in Seattle, send it to
[02:31:43.560 --> 02:31:44.560]   India.
[02:31:44.560 --> 02:31:50.760]   And not only, you know, a different time zone engineers who are not maybe as experienced,
[02:31:50.760 --> 02:31:55.960]   if they're making $5 an hour, which was the going rate at the time--
[02:31:55.960 --> 02:31:58.320]   It's a process problem.
[02:31:58.320 --> 02:31:59.800]   It's a process problem, I guess.
[02:31:59.800 --> 02:32:00.800]   Yes.
[02:32:00.800 --> 02:32:05.200]   And we've seen this happen so many times in so many American companies where the outsource
[02:32:05.200 --> 02:32:08.080]   and the results are not good.
[02:32:08.080 --> 02:32:11.200]   Let's see.
[02:32:11.200 --> 02:32:18.120]   53 essential tech bro terms.
[02:32:18.120 --> 02:32:19.600]   How to speak Silicon Valley?
[02:32:19.600 --> 02:32:22.520]   This is from the Guardian.
[02:32:22.520 --> 02:32:26.440]   And there are a few that I think-- you know, if you listen to our shows, you hear Angel
[02:32:26.440 --> 02:32:30.640]   Investor and Apple and autopilot all the time, you know these terms.
[02:32:30.640 --> 02:32:34.720]   Well, let's look at their definition of tech bro to start.
[02:32:34.720 --> 02:32:35.720]   Tech bro.
[02:32:35.720 --> 02:32:42.200]   Now, a US-born college-educated Patagonia-clad male whose entry-level salary at one of the
[02:32:42.200 --> 02:32:46.440]   FANG companies-- so that's defined somewhere else, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and
[02:32:46.440 --> 02:32:52.320]   Google-- at one of the FANG companies was at least $125,000 and frequently assists his
[02:32:52.320 --> 02:32:55.400]   female coworkers give him high fives.
[02:32:55.400 --> 02:32:57.600]   Typically, works of product management or marketing.
[02:32:57.600 --> 02:33:02.000]   Had he been born 10 years earlier, he would have been a finance bro instead.
[02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:03.000]   Accurate?
[02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:04.000]   Accurate?
[02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:05.000]   Absolutely.
[02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:06.000]   I love this one.
[02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:07.000]   Thought leader.
[02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:08.000]   Those are the guys you see in the TED Talks all the time.
[02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:09.440]   I'm a thought leader.
[02:33:09.440 --> 02:33:15.640]   An unemployed rich person.
[02:33:15.640 --> 02:33:21.680]   It's funny because it's true.
[02:33:21.680 --> 02:33:25.440]   The president's tweets might be-- you may-- next time you look at the president's tweets,
[02:33:25.440 --> 02:33:27.880]   you might see a gray box.
[02:33:27.880 --> 02:33:34.240]   Twitter is finally somehow addressed the conundrum of what do you do if the leader
[02:33:34.240 --> 02:33:37.800]   of the free world doesn't follow your rules.
[02:33:37.800 --> 02:33:41.320]   You can't cut them off the platform.
[02:33:41.320 --> 02:33:45.240]   So they're rolling out a new notice for tweets belonging to public figures that break the
[02:33:45.240 --> 02:33:48.840]   community guidelines.
[02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:53.640]   What they do is they'll give you a gray box that says the Twitter rules about abusive
[02:33:53.640 --> 02:33:56.040]   behavior apply to this tweet.
[02:33:56.040 --> 02:33:59.960]   However, Twitter has learned it may be in the public's interest for the tweet to me
[02:33:59.960 --> 02:34:03.480]   and available, and then they have a button, "view."
[02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:04.480]   Yeah.
[02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:09.600]   Something tells me that Trump is going to somehow not be subject to any of the--
[02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:14.040]   Do you think they want-- they say they'll only do it to people who are politicians,
[02:34:14.040 --> 02:34:17.720]   verified users, or accounts with more than 100,000 followers.
[02:34:17.720 --> 02:34:19.600]   You're right, it's not going to happen over the president.
[02:34:19.600 --> 02:34:24.440]   No, it'll be other lower-level politicians, but no, the president is--
[02:34:24.440 --> 02:34:30.320]   And can I just point out, if you're browsing along on Twitter and you see that, who's not
[02:34:30.320 --> 02:34:31.840]   going to click "view"?
[02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:35.480]   Yeah, it's like-- it's an advertisement.
[02:34:35.480 --> 02:34:36.480]   Totally.
[02:34:36.480 --> 02:34:39.800]   Pay attention to this tweet.
[02:34:39.800 --> 02:34:42.000]   It's forbidden fruit, you know, right there.
[02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:43.160]   But there was a little bit--
[02:34:43.160 --> 02:34:45.080]   But they're also going to hide them a little bit.
[02:34:45.080 --> 02:34:46.080]   Right, that's what I was going to say.
[02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:47.080]   They won't be in the searches, right?
[02:34:47.080 --> 02:34:48.080]   Right, right.
[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:49.080]   Right.
[02:34:49.080 --> 02:34:54.640]   It won't be serviced in the trending feed.
[02:34:54.640 --> 02:34:58.200]   It's a little like YouTube taking away your monetization.
[02:34:58.200 --> 02:35:00.920]   Slap on those.
[02:35:00.920 --> 02:35:03.960]   If you're big enough to cause damage, then it doesn't work.
[02:35:03.960 --> 02:35:08.080]   But if you're smaller, like I think monetization-- demonetization actually does work.
[02:35:08.080 --> 02:35:11.640]   I think that for people who have their own income streams, it's a different scenario.
[02:35:11.640 --> 02:35:16.120]   But for a lot of smaller creators, not being able to monetize is actually a pretty good
[02:35:16.120 --> 02:35:18.840]   way of shutting down people.
[02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:26.680]   And let's end our show today with this picture of dozens of drivers, dozens of Colorado drivers
[02:35:26.680 --> 02:35:28.480]   stuck in the mud.
[02:35:28.480 --> 02:35:30.000]   It's a great story.
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:33.880]   Because Google Maps routed them into a mud pit.
[02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:34.880]   Oh, no.
[02:35:34.880 --> 02:35:40.880]   Apparently, the road to the Denver airport was closed due to a crash on Panea Boulevard.
[02:35:40.880 --> 02:35:43.280]   So Google Maps suggested a detour.
[02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:48.040]   Of course, a lot of people rushing to the airport to catch a flight or pick up travelers.
[02:35:48.040 --> 02:35:55.680]   The detour took them to a dirt road near the border of Denver in Aurora.
[02:35:55.680 --> 02:35:57.000]   She wasn't immediately concerned.
[02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:00.240]   They're quoting Connie Moncees.
[02:36:00.240 --> 02:36:04.160]   Thanks to crowd psychology, my thought was, well, all these other cars are in front of
[02:36:04.160 --> 02:36:06.520]   me, so it must be OK.
[02:36:06.520 --> 02:36:10.160]   Then the dirt road turned into a muddy slop.
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:13.240]   That's when I thought, oh, this was a bad decision.
[02:36:13.240 --> 02:36:17.520]   100 cars had taken the detour, ended up in the muddy, empty field.
[02:36:17.520 --> 02:36:23.560]   By the way, there's the shotgun blasted road closed sign that's fallen over.
[02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:29.640]   Apparently nobody paid by their every roadside in Colorado is shotgun blasted.
[02:36:29.640 --> 02:36:31.960]   I'm sure it's true in Houston too.
[02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:36.920]   I love that picture.
[02:36:36.920 --> 02:36:37.920]   So is this the case?
[02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:43.280]   This is one of those places where Google Maps has been pulling in features from Waze.
[02:36:43.280 --> 02:36:45.360]   Is this one of those cases?
[02:36:45.360 --> 02:36:50.160]   Because Waze will give you detours sometimes that are very bizarre to get you around things.
[02:36:50.160 --> 02:36:55.920]   Yeah, I've done some really weird ways, detours in the past.
[02:36:55.920 --> 02:36:57.960]   It's also saved me a zillion times.
[02:36:57.960 --> 02:36:58.960]   Off to.
[02:36:58.960 --> 02:36:59.960]   I've never had a problem.
[02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:00.960]   It actually works.
[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:04.600]   So what this really underscores is the fact that people are sheep.
[02:37:04.600 --> 02:37:07.600]   And if Google tells you drive into a muddy field.
[02:37:07.600 --> 02:37:08.600]   You will.
[02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:16.000]   If it's literally the office when Michael Scott listens to the GPS on his car and drives into
[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:17.000]   the lake.
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:20.560]   This is literally what this is.
[02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:24.120]   But what I want to know is how many Ubers this was.
[02:37:24.120 --> 02:37:25.840]   This would be terrible regardless.
[02:37:25.840 --> 02:37:27.680]   You're going to miss your flight, your life, the airport, whatever.
[02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:32.480]   But imagine if you're the person who's in the Uber.
[02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:37.080]   The Uber driver just follows Google Maps blindly and then you're like, everybody involved
[02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:38.080]   there.
[02:37:38.080 --> 02:37:39.080]   That would be.
[02:37:39.080 --> 02:37:40.960]   She said there were a number of Ubers in the mud.
[02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:42.280]   She had a four wheel drive.
[02:37:42.280 --> 02:37:44.320]   So she actually it was really nice of her.
[02:37:44.320 --> 02:37:46.520]   She took a bunch of people to the airport.
[02:37:46.520 --> 02:37:47.520]   They drove.
[02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:48.520]   Oh, that's really nice.
[02:37:48.520 --> 02:37:49.520]   And went on.
[02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:54.160]   So that's a great, a great story from the Denver ABC affiliate.
[02:37:54.160 --> 02:37:55.160]   Wow.
[02:37:55.160 --> 02:37:59.160]   That's one of those like end of Western civilization, as you know, stories.
[02:37:59.160 --> 02:38:00.160]   Yeah.
[02:38:00.160 --> 02:38:03.160]   In the accuracy, it's happening.
[02:38:03.160 --> 02:38:08.240]   Zimmer has designed a soundtrack for a new BMW concept car.
[02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:10.840]   I'm going to end you and the show with his hands.
[02:38:10.840 --> 02:38:12.680]   Zimmer, can you hear this?
[02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:13.680]   Soundtrack.
[02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:18.840]   Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you so much.
[02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:21.560]   I want this car now that worked.
[02:38:21.560 --> 02:38:23.600]   I thank you so much for joining us.
[02:38:23.600 --> 02:38:26.400]   The great Christina Warren host of Rocket.
[02:38:26.400 --> 02:38:30.560]   You see her on channel nine doing a cloud advocacy.
[02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:32.080]   Where else where else, Christina?
[02:38:32.080 --> 02:38:33.080]   Where else you want to talk about?
[02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:38.240]   Yeah, you can go to youtube.com/MicrosoftDeveloper to see the videos that we put out every week.
[02:38:38.240 --> 02:38:43.160]   I do a weekly kind of developer news show and we've got other stuff going on.
[02:38:43.160 --> 02:38:48.280]   But yeah, my podcast Rocket that Leo mentioned at a relay FM.
[02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:51.960]   So are they they must just love you at Microsoft?
[02:38:51.960 --> 02:38:53.080]   I'd like to think that they like me.
[02:38:53.080 --> 02:38:54.080]   I like them a whole lot.
[02:38:54.080 --> 02:38:55.080]   Are you happy there?
[02:38:55.080 --> 02:38:56.080]   I am.
[02:38:56.080 --> 02:38:57.080]   I am.
[02:38:57.080 --> 02:39:00.280]   It's been two years now and you know, it was I didn't know how it was going to be making
[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:03.080]   the transition from from journalism to product.
[02:39:03.080 --> 02:39:04.120]   And I really like it.
[02:39:04.120 --> 02:39:06.400]   And I still get to do things like this.
[02:39:06.400 --> 02:39:08.400]   You're nice enough to still let me come on and talk.
[02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:09.400]   We love you, Christina.
[02:39:09.400 --> 02:39:10.400]   We love you guys.
[02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:14.000]   So I feel like I kind of get the best of both worlds.
[02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:18.200]   I get to be more involved in trying to make things better and engage with our communities.
[02:39:18.200 --> 02:39:23.320]   But I still get to do my podcast and you know, be a be an idiot on Twitter.
[02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:28.000]   So and I'm sorry, sorry that we didn't get a chance to get to the Taylor Swift, Taylor
[02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:29.400]   and Carly thing.
[02:39:29.400 --> 02:39:35.520]   But maybe next time next time there will be some sort of drama next time I don't even
[02:39:35.520 --> 02:39:37.840]   know what it is.
[02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:38.920]   But all I see is your tweet.
[02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:41.480]   I'm glad we finally know what happened to Taylor and Carly.
[02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:44.120]   So that's, you know, important.
[02:39:44.120 --> 02:39:48.080]   Spencer Pratt responded to me, which was my moment of my life.
[02:39:48.080 --> 02:39:49.080]   Yeah.
[02:39:49.080 --> 02:39:50.080]   Yeah, he's famous.
[02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:51.080]   I take it.
[02:39:51.080 --> 02:39:52.080]   He was on the hills.
[02:39:52.080 --> 02:39:53.080]   Yes.
[02:39:53.080 --> 02:39:54.080]   Yeah.
[02:39:54.080 --> 02:39:55.080]   Yeah.
[02:39:55.080 --> 02:39:58.680]   Leo's like what the audience like what I'm so not a millennial.
[02:39:58.680 --> 02:39:59.680]   That's all I could say.
[02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:01.320]   But neither are you Dwight Silver.
[02:40:01.320 --> 02:40:02.840]   And that's why we get along.
[02:40:02.840 --> 02:40:03.840]   We're of an age.
[02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:04.840]   Yeah.
[02:40:04.840 --> 02:40:05.840]   Right.
[02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:08.720]   We're the grizzled veterans of the tech industry.
[02:40:08.720 --> 02:40:10.240]   Houston chronicle.com/techburger.
[02:40:10.240 --> 02:40:11.240]   What?
[02:40:11.240 --> 02:40:14.960]   I was going to say I'm still 24 in spirit.
[02:40:14.960 --> 02:40:15.960]   Yeah, me too.
[02:40:15.960 --> 02:40:17.520]   Isn't that the weirdest thing about getting old?
[02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:20.240]   I still think I'm younger than Christina.
[02:40:20.240 --> 02:40:22.720]   That makes no sense at all.
[02:40:22.720 --> 02:40:23.800]   But that's what happens.
[02:40:23.800 --> 02:40:26.160]   The body ages, the mind.
[02:40:26.160 --> 02:40:27.160]   That's right.
[02:40:27.160 --> 02:40:28.160]   Little slower.
[02:40:28.160 --> 02:40:31.480]   We can also find Dwight on his new newsletter.
[02:40:31.480 --> 02:40:37.680]   So everybody has to go to Houston Chronicle.com/releasenotes.
[02:40:37.680 --> 02:40:41.280]   Release notes and subscribe as I have because you want.
[02:40:41.280 --> 02:40:42.280]   Thanks Leo.
[02:40:42.280 --> 02:40:43.280]   Yes.
[02:40:43.280 --> 02:40:44.280]   Thank you.
[02:40:44.280 --> 02:40:45.280]   Great to see you again.
[02:40:45.280 --> 02:40:48.440]   And the great Jason Heiner now in charge of all advice at CNET.
[02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:52.160]   He's editorial director CNET advice.
[02:40:52.160 --> 02:40:53.160]   That's the reviews.
[02:40:53.160 --> 02:40:54.160]   That's all the stuff.
[02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:55.160]   That's all the good stuff on CNET.com.
[02:40:55.160 --> 02:40:56.160]   How to?
[02:40:56.160 --> 02:40:57.160]   How to.
[02:40:57.160 --> 02:40:58.160]   Yeah.
[02:40:58.160 --> 02:41:01.640]   They picked a good person to do it.
[02:41:01.640 --> 02:41:03.880]   I'm so glad that you got the corner office.
[02:41:03.880 --> 02:41:09.120]   Oh, let's not forget follow the geeks.
[02:41:09.120 --> 02:41:10.120]   Follow the geeks.
[02:41:10.120 --> 02:41:14.840]   The only memoir, the only bio I'll ever get.
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:22.240]   Great book that Jason wrote about 10 digital innovators in the future of work along with
[02:41:22.240 --> 02:41:26.800]   Lindsey Gilpin and I'm channel, not channel, chapter 9, right?
[02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:27.800]   Chapter 10.
[02:41:27.800 --> 02:41:28.800]   Right?
[02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:29.800]   That's right.
[02:41:29.800 --> 02:41:30.800]   It's also on audible.
[02:41:30.800 --> 02:41:34.160]   And if you go to audible and you listen to the sample chapter, the sample chapter is
[02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:35.160]   Leo's story.
[02:41:35.160 --> 02:41:36.160]   Oh, wow.
[02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:43.800]   You get the first two minutes or I can't remember how long.
[02:41:43.800 --> 02:41:44.800]   Oh.
[02:41:44.800 --> 02:41:45.800]   Yeah.
[02:41:45.800 --> 02:41:46.800]   You can listen to the first part of Leo's.
[02:41:46.800 --> 02:41:48.760]   You get through the part where I get hired at McDonald's.
[02:41:48.760 --> 02:41:49.760]   Is that it?
[02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:51.880]   That's all you get.
[02:41:51.880 --> 02:41:54.240]   And then I became a Fry Cook at McDonald's.
[02:41:54.240 --> 02:41:56.160]   No, I know what it starts with.
[02:41:56.160 --> 02:41:58.400]   It starts with a great scene in Las Vegas.
[02:41:58.400 --> 02:42:00.480]   Kate Patel on me getting out of the car.
[02:42:00.480 --> 02:42:02.040]   She's gripping my arm.
[02:42:02.040 --> 02:42:04.600]   You've got to read the book to find out why.
[02:42:04.600 --> 02:42:05.600]   That's right.
[02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:07.240]   That's a great fly.
[02:42:07.240 --> 02:42:08.240]   Yes.
[02:42:08.240 --> 02:42:09.240]   Ian.
[02:42:09.240 --> 02:42:10.240]   Thank you, Jason.
[02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:11.240]   We should take this on the road.
[02:42:11.240 --> 02:42:12.600]   We had a great studio audience today.
[02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:14.400]   Thank you all for joining us.
[02:42:14.400 --> 02:42:15.600]   We only lost about half of them.
[02:42:15.600 --> 02:42:16.600]   So that's pretty good.
[02:42:16.600 --> 02:42:17.600]   Yeah.
[02:42:17.600 --> 02:42:21.360]   So usually most of them stick around, but sometimes we lose a few during the four hour
[02:42:21.360 --> 02:42:22.360]   episode.
[02:42:22.360 --> 02:42:25.880]   If you want to join us in the studio, we love having you.

[02:42:40.680 --> 02:42:42.160]   the show.

[02:43:10.480 --> 02:43:14.040]   And you can use any podcast client.
[02:43:14.040 --> 02:43:15.720]   You want to do that.

[02:43:24.080 --> 02:43:25.080]   The Twit.
[02:43:25.080 --> 02:43:26.080]   This is the camp.
[02:43:26.080 --> 02:43:27.080]   Bye bye.
