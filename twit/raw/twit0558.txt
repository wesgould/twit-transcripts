[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.600]   It's time for Twit this weekend tech the show where we cover the weeks.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.600]   Tech news and friends I'm just going to sit back and bathe in the brilliance of our panel this week.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.600]   It's fitting because this is our 11th anniversary episode the first Twit which at the time was called
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.600]   the revenge of the screensavers was broadcast or released to the wild.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.600]   We didn't stream it live we didn't do video we only did audio we only did 25 minutes on April 17th,
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.600]   2005 with Patrick Norton and Robert Herron and Kevin Rose my old friends from a tech TV.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.600]   And that's how we began 11 years old go on this day.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.600]   Great.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.600]   And fast forward and it's been a wonderful ride there it is in fact it's still online if you want to go to
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.600]   twit.tv/twit/one you can hear the first episode.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:54.600]   Now I had to bleep out the word screensavers because shortly after I recorded that I got a letter
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.600]   she sent a sis letter from g4tech.tv which had bought the show and bought the net worth goodness saying you can't use that name.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   So we couldn't call it the revenge of the screensavers I asked our audience to come up with a name they came up with
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.600]   this weekend geek was my favorite and I thought what if I were this weekend tech then we could call ourselves Twits.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.600]   Which seemed like a good idea at the time.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:24.600]   We had a competition for the logo and wonderful logo from Loyola Bo Walsh that we're still using.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:31.600]   So it was and at the time we distributed it via BitTorrent because I didn't have any bandwidth and that was the only way we could go out.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.600]   Oh, grief.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.600]   But from says a whole bit corner BitTorrent was killing the media industry and you've done it very nicely.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   Yeah. So thank you for the card by the way Ian brought me a very nice card with a Wayne Tebow painting on the front of birthday cakes and we have our own cake.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.600]   Now you all in the other you've been waiting to get in this cake I said you couldn't have the cake till we started the show.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.600]   You may now come and take your cake and Ian wants a piece and Ben I'll send you one.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.600]   You'll get it sometime next year.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.600]   Nice stale piece of birthday cake.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   There you go.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.600]   Ladies and gentlemen where's Waldo? Well we know he works for us now.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.600]   Thank you Chris.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.600]   So how you doing Ben Thompson from Stratecary?
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.600]   Good and congratulations.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.600]   I'm honored to be here on the anniversary I think 11 years ago.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.600]   I remember listening to you pretty pretty early.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.600]   I don't know if I listened to that episode per se but 2005 or 2005 or so that sounds long time.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.600]   I remember I was working on I remember the project I was working on and this idea of I could listen to podcasts at the same time.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.600]   I think were you okay then where were you?
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:52.600]   No I was in I was in Taipei I was building out a a computer based teaching system for English schools.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:05:01.600]   I started out in itinerant world wonder before I actually realized I support you.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.600]   You didn't work in Okie. It was Apple Microsoft.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.600]   Yeah that was a couple years later came back to the US in 2009.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:21.600]   And Ben now is all on his own with his website Stratecary which is there's a wonderful free article every week which I read religiously but I'm also a subscriber to the newsletter.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.600]   It's well worth it and he is one of the best analysts out there.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.600]   I'm really thrilled and honored that you could be here on our 11th anniversary episode.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.600]   Thank you for joining us. I know it's early morning in Taipei.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.600]   It is and because there's no daylight savings time here it is earlier than it is.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.600]   Oh I'm sorry but I'm here in the winter.
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.600]   No it's fine. I'm happy to be here.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.600]   Thank you so much.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.600]   Also with us from the register.co.uk another great friend of the networking in Thompson.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.600]   We can't get enough of you.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.600]   You know what's Thompson and Thompson? We got the Thompson twins.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.600]   Yeah I know. Huxey is marvelous.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.600]   And there was the band the Thompson twins as well.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.600]   Yeah and it's Tanten right? There's the Thompson twins in Tanten.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.600]   So everybody you know there's there we go all the illusions you could ever want.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.600]   Ian Thompson thank you for being here. We appreciate it.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.600]   Well it was fun.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.600]   I know I could start.
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:18.600]   Before the show we started talking about Tesla and actually what we'll do is we'll take that conversation and we'll go to it right now because I thought it was a very interesting conversation.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:25.600]   You did a good piece a couple of weeks or maybe last week about the rollout of the Model 3 Ben.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.600]   Tesla's really a real car company now.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.600]   No that's not exactly what I said.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:37.600]   Oh I read it but obviously didn't understand it and that's probably.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.600]   No that's the real question.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:46.600]   I think that my broader point was that there's something very powerful that they've built here.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.600]   For a brand new perspective and they could only have another of the high end.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.600]   They were very smart.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:07:01.600]   And you know what they played it very gutsyly because you know that he bootstrapped the whole thing and it really wasn't viable until he showed that he could sell him in mass quantities.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.600]   Well it's not clear that it's viable. That's still the question.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:15.600]   Well they're a company that's still if you, if you, if you, if you, what's the thing about Tesla is they, in their financial statements they wouldn't have to do it.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.600]   When they calculate, like their gross margin, their cost of goods sold.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.600]   R&D is not included.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.600]   That's, that which is typical for a tech company.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:31.600]   Usually for a tech company the cost of goods sold is only the actual cost of the goods in whatever the device is like an iPhone and the, the R&D cost is separate.
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.600]   In a, for a traditional car company that's not the case.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:40.600]   Usually the, the R&D cost is included in the calculation of gross margin on sort of thing.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:50.600]   If you calculated Tesla's financials like you would a, a traditional car company they would be, they would have a neck, they'd be losing money on every car sold and there's a significant amount of money.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:59.600]   And the problem is there's not, there's not any evidence that they can manufacture this car for the price that they said they can manufacture that.
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:09.600]   That said to your point, I mean, if they can pull it off, like basically all they have to do is, is actually do what they say they're going to do.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:15.600]   And they are going to be, you know, very successful, much more successful than most people realized.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.600]   And, and the way they came at the high end and built this powerful brand is, is a big part of that.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:25.600]   So, I mean, I'm certainly, it's certainly fascinating to watch.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:34.600]   I mean that the, the, it really is the new Apple and that's just from a brand new perspective, but in the passionate and fervor of their fans perspective as I discovered.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:42.600]   Oh yeah, did you get in line? I, I did just kind of like, why not?
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.600]   Why not?
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.600]   Well, I think you make the point that it's refundable thousand bucks.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.600]   It's not like they get to keep the money or anything.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:55.600]   Right. I mean, I'm fortunate that I can need all that for did to go, you know, without, without that money for who knows how long.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.600]   But it's kind of a nice long term loan to you on it.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:04.600]   Well, well, well, yeah, the problem is that, well, right now that you can't buy Tesla's in Taiwan, which is a pain.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:12.600]   Although just a couple weeks ago, some, some, someone found like a company registration from Tesla, like maybe they may be going on sale soon.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.600]   The other problem is just the infrastructure here is tougher.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.600]   You, everyone lives in these big.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.600]   That's the real issue.
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.600]   Because of media.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.600]   Where did you charge it?
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:20.600]   Yes.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.600]   Exactly.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.600]   That's what's held back.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:28.600]   That's held back, electric cars until now is that it was massively inconvenient, but I think that that's changed a lot.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.600]   Well, I mean, if that's part of it for sure.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:51.600]   I think what I, what I preach about Tesla, I preach about the approach and the way they built this brand is I, in kind of the point of the article that I wrote was, you know, the garden was called, it's a Tesla is I'm not convinced that those 300,000 people or however many of registered now are really
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.600]   that interested in buying an electric car.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:10:09.600]   I mean, certainly that plays a part in what it means to be a Tesla and why they're excited, but it doesn't follow that just because 300,000 people put $1,000 on a Tesla that there's a big market for the Chevy Bolt, for example.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:19.600]   What is so great about what, what, what Elon Musk has accomplished with this is he just to be, not to be tried about it, but he made a electric cool.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:27.600]   And that's something, and if you go back and read his master plan, people have talked about always, you know, paying, paying a forward or paying for future cars.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:39.600]   There's not really that much evidence that's happened, but what there's a line in there that talks about if we want electric to change, to take over the Alabama world, we have to make it like basically says it has to be cool.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:48.600]   And that's what he has absolutely accomplished. And that's what's so impressive. And, you know, certainly, you know, more, more, more power to him.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:59.600]   Yeah. And I think getting that many reservations probably makes it easier to go to the investors investment market and say, you know, absolutely.
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.600]   Absolutely. That's the real point, really, right?
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:07.600]   Absolutely. Because everything they've done has been paid for primarily by issuing stock or taking a net.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:16.600]   Nothing but lose money from day one. Right. And this, this makes that possible. And, you know, certainly, you know, there's, you know, the cost of batteries is coming down.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:24.600]   That's, that really is the controlling factor. I mean, I think the battery, the Model S costs like $35,000 on its own, which is really a bunch of tiny batteries all wrapped together.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:35.600]   And there's the extent that, you know, he says, I'm not an earnings call, basically that with the Model S, they were trying to figure out how to make a car.
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:47.600]   Whereas with the, whereas with the Model 3, they can really like build it for manufacturing, build it for scale. And that there's, that's totally valid.
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:56.600]   Like that makes a ton of sense. And there's no question they'll get, they'll be able to move on the cost curve much more efficiently with the Model 3 simply because they know what they're doing.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:05.600]   Do you remember the roadster? They didn't really build. I mean, they built it, but it was a, it was a, that's what the drive. Right. That's what figuring out how to build it in.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:11.600]   Right. It's a model. It's been, I think this is a real case study in Haddabood's trap of business. It's quite fascinating.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:27.600]   He's quite smart, quite gutty too, because I'm sure the day before they, they put, they opened up the orders for Model 3, he's like on tenor hooks because either, I mean, here's an opportunity to go big and really go home or if it's a flop, they don't have a company.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:33.600]   So it could have gone either way. And I think that it went as well as it could possibly have gone for him.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:44.600]   I was trying to think when the last time you actually saw people queuing up outside a motor show in order to actually buy a car and it's virtually unheard of. I can't think of it happening with any other.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:49.600]   The question is, can you ramp up production quickly enough? That's going to be absolutely key.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:55.600]   He has a real problem now because he has five years of orders. Exactly. And they need to be fulfilled before people lose interest.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:10.600]   He has to give people in a year. And I think that's where he goes to the equity markets and says, "Okay, we need to take this new meat plant which could be really expanded. I think he's only using a fourth or fifth of the capacity and maybe build more."
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:16.600]   And he's going to have the Giga battery factory goes online in time. That's part of it too.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:22.600]   He's also going to need some serious supplies of lithium and various other elements just to actually get the whole thing up.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:29.600]   You feel like this was a very well played chess game. He kind of took big chances. It was a big gambit.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:35.600]   But I think he saw the end game at the beginning and he knew where it was headed and he did a very good job.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:43.600]   Now, I think the only caveat, I know he's going to start with this. And like I said, I wrote the article I wrote was very admiring of this.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:50.600]   And really, he's done it different than the traditional business approaches said that he should or whatever.
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:58.600]   And I think it's because brand matters and making electric cool matters. I guess the only caveat I would say is that he hasn't won yet.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:06.600]   Things are looking great. You could not be in a better position given his strategy, but the actual hard part.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:15.600]   And that feels stupid to say because everything they've accomplished has been so incredible and against the odds already, which is why you don't want to bet against the guy.
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:23.600]   But if you look at it objectively, the real hard part really is now because this is of a scale of complexity and difficulty.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:30.600]   And like Dave, they've pushed all the chips in the table now. And it's going to be fast. It's going to be absolutely fascinating to watch.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.600]   Yeah, if they can deliver at the price they need to and in the quantities they need to.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:44.600]   Because the other thing that's so risky about this is, Ian, I think Ian just made the point very well, is they're risking not just the company, but the brand.
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:51.600]   The brand is the value that they've built right now. If they don't deliver this car on time, if they don't deliver it to the point they deliver to.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.600]   And if it takes like years, then it's going to be that much more damage to them.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:00.600]   If GM screws with the bolt, no one cares. It's GM, they screw up everything.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:08.600]   So it's super high risk, but the risk goes both ways. There's upside risk and downside risk.
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.600]   The upside risk is massive with the approach they've taken.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.600]   And it's kind of nice that they're trying to save the world, too.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:26.600]   It does seem ridiculous. We're still burning very valuable hydrocarbons in the stage when we could be using electricity, which I think also going further ahead,
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:36.600]   electric cars offer one huge advantage, which is if you can put motors on all four wheels, the performance and cornering ability of these cars just goes through the roof.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:41.600]   We're going to see with the Hill Climb event in California later on this year.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:48.600]   And their electric cars are outpacing petrol engine cars simply because they can independently control their wheels, and they just go like rails.
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.600]   Through all wheel drive.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:16:02.600]   Yeah, the X and most of the S's, but not all the threes have two engines, one for each axle, but they don't have four engines yet.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:10.600]   No, that would be. I think that originally that's going to be the remit of racing cars, but it'll come.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.600]   I know these things filter down.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:17.600]   I just feel like Elon is it would be a dangerous opponent in poker.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:23.600]   I was thinking bridge, but yeah, the guy strategizes so far ahead down the right down the line. It's just a smart guy.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:38.600]   Well, and the real advantage he has is, and this is the power of being, you know, mission driven, is if he fails, if Tesla does not successfully make the Model 3 for the price he says and all this sort of stuff,
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:43.600]   what's the worst that happens? One, he accelerated the move down the curve when it comes to batteries.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:49.600]   To the kind of point of the article, he made electric cool in a way that certainly a company like Jim was going to.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:55.600]   He's motivated the car companies to really accelerate the efforts in this space.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:06.600]   And if his goal is not just to build a successful company, but to really shift the world in a meaningful way, away from carbon based transportation.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:13.600]   I mean, that's a nice sort of, that's a nice failure option. If that's your real goal.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:27.600]   And that's the power that really comes from being a real sort of mission driven company is you kind of get lose a bit from the financial imperative, something or other.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.600]   It doesn't change the fact that they still have very real questions they need to answer.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:35.600]   And I can understand why some people will start their stock and all that sort of thing.
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:40.600]   But if you're going to short them, though, it's a long term short, I think.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:45.600]   I mean, I mean, at this point, they've got years. They've got some runway.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.600]   Right? No, they don't have that much money. They have a little over a billion dollars.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:53.600]   Can't they raise money on those 300,000 pre-orders? Absolutely.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:18:07.600]   I mean, that's a huge benefit of this. They've really demonstrated a real sort of demand and power in the market that I think will let them raise money at a better rate than they would have otherwise.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:21.600]   I think if they're going to have to make that money back, and it's still an open question. Like I said, I mean, the if the margins are going in the wrong direction, actually, in 2015, they went down right not up.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:26.600]   And they're not moving down the cost curve yet.
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:33.600]   They've in fact shown an amazing capacity to lose money, and they're having technical issues with their Model X. All of the Model Xs were just recalled.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:38.600]   They're only a couple of thousand. They were all had to be recalled for safety issues.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:45.600]   The company itself said it. We actually showed some hubris. We tried attempted too much, and we're having difficulty making the car.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.600]   I think they would not do the Model X if they could do it all over it. That's why I want one.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:56.600]   Right? Don't you want the car that was the biggest stretch? Unless it's a piece of crap, but I don't think it's going to be.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:02.600]   You can get great money for a Ford out for an insult right now. They go for major amounts of gas.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:08.600]   So it's only 10 years ago, though, that they remember the documentary Who Killed the Electric Car?
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:13.600]   Remember the General Motors EV1, which came out in the 90s?
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:28.600]   The documentary really documented, I thought, very effectively, how the oil industry, the government, the battery industry, the car industry, all united to say this is a bad idea for business.
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.600]   Exactly. We're not going to let it happen.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:40.600]   Yeah. It was a huge mistake, because given the fact that first Toyota with the Prius and now Tesla, basically eating American car companies lunch for an hour a day.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:47.600]   Exactly. If they've taken that opportunity 20 years ago and addressed this market, they could be earning a big bank right now.
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.600]   And as it is, the nature of competition, someone else is earning it.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:57.600]   But I think Elon did learn a lesson from that, that one of the things people would need is range.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:04.600]   They would also need a way to fill up. Yeah. And Tesla very wisely addressed that early on with the superchargers.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:08.600]   Yeah. The Supercharger Network is one of the most impressive things about Tesla.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:16.600]   And, you know, it's funny because Tesla actually says that they will share the Supercharger Network with other cars along with their share in the costs.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.600]   As long as it's not a Chevy Bolt.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:19.600]   No, I won't.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:25.600]   But I'm very curious as to how Tesla measures that cost that the other car company has to contribute to.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.600]   I imagine that the amount is exceptionally substantial.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:33.600]   And it's interesting because in some respects, you get a weird, it's not, I'm not saying Tesla will sell it as a network effect,
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:42.600]   but you get a little bit of a network effect in that the more Tesla's that are on the roads, the more supercharger stations they can afford to build out and justify building out.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:47.600]   And so you do get a fact where they're being more Tesla's and makes your Tesla more valuable.
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:51.600]   Again, this is more of a weaker effect. I'm not saying that's why they would or wouldn't be successful.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.600]   But it is interesting that there is a little bit of that effect there.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.600]   And again, if Tesla's like, "Oh, of course, we'll be open with the Supercharger Network.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:03.600]   You just have to pay us, you know, X billion dollars because we, you know, all the R&D and all the costs that we're into it.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.600]   And you have to pay your fair share."
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:20.600]   I mean, no, and I mean, that's the real advantage they have by being electric only the way they think about what to invest in is very different than a company like GM or even BMW or Mercedes where all their revenue comes from a different part of the company.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:24.600]   That already has infrastructure in place. It's definitely an advantage.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:32.600]   I do think just to go back to a point, GM gets a little bit of a bad rap for that electric car in that movie.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:45.600]   I mean, any rational manager would have done exactly what GM did, which is collect all the cars and smash them to bits because they were on the hook for, like, the cars cost them a tremendous amount of money and continued cost them a tremendous amount of money over time.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:52.600]   And they did them for very rational reasons, I guess, what I would say.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:22:00.600]   I'd say I think they're painted as a, they're painted a bit as a villain when what they did, I think, was a change.
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.600]   It was a sensible business move.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.600]   Right.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.600]   I don't think anybody disagrees with that.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.600]   The question is, did their business interests coincide with our national and global interests?
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:21.600]   Well, I think there's also an element that this was very like the Kodak case where they could have ruled the digital camera market and they decided to put it to one side because it was interfering with their main profit stream.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:27.600]   That's always the problem, isn't it, though? Is the innovator's dilemma?
[00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:35.600]   Yeah. I mean, GM wasn't as bad as the film made them out to be, but they were pretty underheaded in this whole thing.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:41.600]   I mean, people wanted electric cars, people went with their rivers, they protested and they fought to keep them.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:45.600]   And they still had to hand them in and that caused an enormous amount of bad feeling.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:51.600]   I mean, electric cars make sense. I don't see what the argument is now in terms of the market has spoken.
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:56.600]   People want these things. Other car manufacturers are going to have to supply them as well because not everyone's going to like...
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:01.600]   Well, they also bring emissions down, right? I mean, there's a mandate. There's a governmental mandate.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.600]   They have to get their overall emissions of all their vehicles down significantly.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.600]   One easy, fast way to do that is with an electric vehicle.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.600]   Well, I mean, to that end, it was not clear that people want electric vehicles.
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.600]   Right.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:17.600]   And that was kind of the point of my article. It's clear people want Teslas, which is amazing.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.600]   No, you're right.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.600]   I don't say that truth, but it's brand.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:23.600]   That's so powerful what they've built in their approach they've taken.
[00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:29.600]   To that end, GM is farther ahead than a lot of other car companies.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:34.600]   I didn't think I'd be on a textual defending GM, but they're ahead of a lot of other car companies when it comes to electric cars.
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.600]   They have the Volt already on the road. The Bolt is coming out later this year.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.600]   And the problem is no one's lining up to buy a Chevy Bolt.
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:47.600]   And the truth is every single electric car in the market has sold massively under expectations, not just them, but also the roof.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:53.600]   Also, any number of other ones. The truth is there's not evidence that they're popular.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:24:00.600]   Again, to go back to the EV1, they sold it because actually California passed a law that you had to sell an electric car.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:01.600]   Right.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:09.600]   And so it just gets to the limitations, if you will, about when it comes to government mandates and stuff.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:14.600]   GM lost money on these cars because they were mandated to do so.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.600]   And then when the mandate went away, they got rid of them.
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.600]   So they wanted to keep supporting them and keep losing money on them.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:29.600]   I mean, you could just as feasibly make it an article about when government regulation doesn't work, but that doesn't fit with the world,
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:33.600]   probably the world of filmmakers in this case.
[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:41.600]   As you point out, unlike other technical innovations, the Tesla isn't in any way better than existing cars on the road.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:47.600]   Well, it is, though. It accelerates faster, which I guess is important.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:55.600]   Well, it is important. I mean, the fact that it's awesome to use the technical term.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:02.600]   I don't think it's awesome to the degree that it's awesomely better than any other $100,000 car, though.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:11.600]   Yeah, and a lot of people say, I'm not a $100,000 car expert or kind of sewer, but the quality of the interior and the components and stuff.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:19.600]   No, I actually turned me off. I feel like, boy, for the car that costs this much, this was with the Model S, it sure doesn't feel like it costs that much.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:25.600]   Right. I think, though, I mean, again, I can't remember.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:30.600]   You said you're going to include that extra. I'm not sure if it's in there, but to go back to the actual quote, the secret Tesla Motors master plan,
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:35.600]   which again, I think all the focus on them somehow paying it forward and all the financials.
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.600]   No, he wrote this in 2006.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:42.600]   Right, but the parts that people are focusing on in this plan, none of it's actually reality.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:50.600]   I mean, again, Tesla is paying for the Model 3 or will pay for it with capital raises, not from Model S profits because there aren't any Model S profits.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:59.600]   If you calculate it on a traditional car company accounting basis, but he says in here, I am funding the company.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:04.600]   He says, like, why do we have the Tesla Motors or why do we have this amazing car that wants to kick everyone's ass?
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:15.000]   This is because the overarching, I'm quoting the piece. This is because the overarching purpose of Tesla Motors and the reason I'm finding the company is to help expedite the move from a mine and burn hydrocarbon economy towards a solar
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:24.600]   electric company, which I believe the primary nexus, you know, critical to making that happen is an electric car without compromises, which is why the Tesla Roadster is designed to be the generic gasoline,
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:37.600]   sports car, a car, a Ferrari and a head to head showdown. What I think is getting, is getting to with that is you have to make people, you have to make electric cool.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:43.600]   And the way you make electric cool is by having videos of a Tesla racing a 737 down the runway, which came out like last week.
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:58.600]   I mean, that's cool. It's desirable. And it makes people be willing to pay $100,000 for a car that feels like a $40,000 car, $3,000 car on the interior or however much, wherever it slides into.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:16.600]   And that, it's that line that to me is really the most remarkable thing about the approach he's taken and really insightful in his kind of understanding of the market. And people do want Teslas remains to be seen, as I said, if they want electric.
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:24.600]   I just think the biggest success he has is in making a brand that is so obviously in demand.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:36.600]   Yeah. I mean, almost jobs in in that respect. I mean, Steve Jobs turned the iPhone, which was quite frankly in hardware terms, a second generation, well behind the pack phone and made it really, really sexy and everyone wanted it.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:45.600]   I do think the big worry I have with Tesla is that they've got a long term problem in that these battery packs don't last forever.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:55.600]   Now, paying $35,000 for a Tesla three is all well and good. But if you've got to pay another $10,000 in four or five years time, then is that going to turn people off?
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:02.600]   Is that going to really damage the brand in that regard? I'd love to see some more stats on how long these batteries will survive.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:10.600]   Yeah. He claims they're recyclable. Even at the end of a hundred thousand miles, there's still some value in it.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:17.600]   Yeah, it is a good question. And it works just still early enough in the in the in the Model S. It's not clear. It's going to turn out.
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:26.600]   I would I do think the comparison is to Apple. I mean, certainly not from a financial perspective and no one saying that and it drives me through all the people that I'm telling those financials actually heard Apple.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:36.600]   We're talking about for good. That said, I mean, the the the iPhone was was a technologically forward. I would disagree with you. You know, I guess on that point.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:49.600]   And I think there's a lot of Apple does think about this. And you took the type of stuff like, you know, the chamfered edges and they buy these hot these machines and all this sort of stuff and all the all the stuff they go on about about these sort of high and finishes and touches.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:29:03.600]   A lot of that is about building building the building the brand. And I think, you know, I will be as annoyed as anybody else by the argument that Apple Apple's built on advertising or marketing.
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:15.600]   But I think the reason there's there. It's also not true to say that it's just purely popular because for technical reasons, that's not true to have an iPhone is is to mean something.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:23.600]   It has status. You pull it out and you put it on the table to show something particularly in other parts in certain parts of the world.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:33.600]   And and I think just as much as it's silly to say that's the only reason people buy iPhones. It's also silly to say that that's not doesn't play a role.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:44.600]   And and absolutely that's Tesla. I think has pulled that off. I mean, people don't buy something without even put down a thousand dollars out even knowing what something looks like without there being.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:59.600]   Powerful brand up way. They don't line up at 645 in the morning. My friend didn't be 123rd in line without having seen the car without there being something really powerful at play from a brand and what it means to be a Tesla.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:07.600]   I do see Tesla drivers. If you see two Teslas going cross it, going down a road, the two drivers will sort of check each other out and give it a little nod.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:17.600]   Well, we're in the club. It's a club because we suffered together. That's what makes you in the club.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:24.600]   Let us let us take a little break. We're going to have a great time today. We have lots more to talk about Ian Thompson is here. It's Thompson and Thompson.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:36.600]   Ian Thompson from the register register.co.uk Ben Thompson from Stratecory. And we are talking about hi tech. I want to talk about tracker and why I will never again.
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:47.600]   Lose my keys. This is a really great success story that started in crowdfunding and has now really become I think one of the best products I've ever used.
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:56.600]   Tracker. This is a tracker. It's on my keys. It's a coin sized device that pairs to your iOS or Android phone.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:09.600]   It has a key loop, but you can also use adhesive and glue it to something. And what's cool is if you lose your phone, you press the button on the tracker and the phone rings, even if it's on silent.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:18.600]   And if you lose your keys, your phone goes, "Hey, your keys." It even has a map of where your keys were seen last. But here's the thing I'm most excited about.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:29.600]   This is also a crowd sourced network because the tracker for battery life reasons has a one year battery. Not rechargeable. You just put a new lithium cell battery in there.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:40.600]   But it doesn't have GPS, but it does pair with your phone, which does have GPS. So what they've actually built is a tracker network. 1.5 million devices now.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:56.600]   That's more than anybody else out there. And if you lose something and you lose your tracker's attached to, it can show up on your map, on a map, even if it's far, far away.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:06.600]   It's kind of remarkable. Scroll down a little bit and you'll see the map of trackers in the wild right now. And this map is growing and growing and growing.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:15.600]   And this means no matter where you lost it, and by the way, not just your phone, this is small. If you could put it on a dog or a cat collar, you could put it on your laptop. I keep it in my backpack.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:29.600]   The tracker records its last known location on a map. And if another tracker user comes within 100 feet of your lost item, you're going to get a GPS update of where your item is.
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:49.600]   So it says, "Hey, I just saw your keys. They're in San Francisco." That is amazing. They just introduced this tracker atlas. It works with a tracker bravo, which is what I have here, or a third party Bluetooth tracker to pinpoint your items in a customizable floor plan of your home.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:33:03.600]   So it's one thing to know your keys are in the house. It's another thing to know. They're under the sofa cushion. You'll save time and energy just by asking tracker atlas where your item is, and you will instantly get a location.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:16.600]   This is truly amazing. These guys have really figured it out. And I kind of want to get more people to buy them because the more people who have them, the bigger the tracker network gets, the better it gets.
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:25.600]   And I want people to buy them all over the world. Notice Amazon Echo integration? Just ask your Echo.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:41.600]   Hey, where's my phone? I love this. You got to get it. Here's the deal. Go to the tracker, T-H-E-T-R-A-C-K-R.com. And you're going to get 30% off your entire order right now if you use a promo code to it.
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:55.600]   So get three or four. You'll find lots of places to use it. It is a great idea. And you will never lose your phone or your keys or your car or your home.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:01.600]   I don't think people lose their homes unless they're on wheels. Unless they're very, very drunk.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:07.600]   Yes. Where do I live? I don't know. Look on your tracker. I'm going to put this back now because I do not want to lose.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:16.600]   And I'm traveling and I do not want to lose my backpack. So here's what I do. See, it's on my keys. So if I take the keys off, I have them.
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:23.600]   But then I attach it to my fob, which is chained to my backpack. And now I really am kind of doing double duty on my tracker.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:33.600]   I will never lose my backpack either. So great. T-H-E-T-R-A-C-K-R.com. Never lose anything again.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:38.600]   Use a promo code to it and you'll save 30% off your brand new.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:43.600]   Tracker. I lost my phone last weekend. Seriously use that.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:53.600]   Wait a minute. How did you find your phone? The old fashioned way. I worked out where I'd been the night before, where I would have most likely have left it.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:35:01.600]   Did it work? Yeah. Somebody actually handed in at the bar and it was sitting there behind there waiting for me. It really restored my faith in humanity.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:05.600]   You obviously didn't have the new iPhone or you would have never seen it again.
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:09.600]   No, no, no. I've Nexus 5, but...
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:13.600]   Yeah. I don't want this here. I'll leave it at the bar.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.600]   Come on. I've got to say I do like this.
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:23.600]   No, I do. I actually become a major Android fan. I know it bothers me in every time I say that, but I am an Android fan.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.600]   I think I have an extra tracker. I was going to see if I could find it and give it to you.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:31.600]   I think I have an extra one in here. I will keep looking. I lost my tracker.
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:34.600]   No, it's not activated. So you couldn't...
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:38.600]   Oh, actually... Here you lose it. Here it is. Extra tracker. Just for you. You'll never lose your keys again.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.600]   How about that? Okay. All right.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.600]   Burr Feinstein.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:48.600]   Names that will live in infamy.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:54.600]   It is now officially a bill...
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:58.600]   The Compliance with Court Orders Act of 2016.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:02.600]   Oh, the mindless stupidity and we want it now, Act of Madness.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:06.600]   It is the sense of Congress that no person is above the law.
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:12.600]   Economic growth, prosperity, security, stability, and liberty require adherence to the rule of law.
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:20.600]   So all providers of communications, services, and products, including software...
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:32.600]   must, to uphold the rule of law, listen to an judicial order and, in a timely manner, respond to an authorized judicial order for information or data.
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:42.600]   It has to be intelligible information. In other words, not encrypted or appropriate technical assistance to obtain such information or data.
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:48.600]   This is not prescriptive. It doesn't tell us how we should do it. It doesn't mention back doors.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:37:00.600]   It's just your requirement. If you're Apple or Google or Microsoft or Dropbox or anybody selling stuff, you need to have a way to unencrypted if law enforcement comes knocking on your door.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:22.600]   Furthermore, it also applies to third-party, so-called license distributors, which means that Apple, and its App Store, and Google, and its now store, and Microsoft and its Windows Store, would be required to verify that every single app sold in those stores also provides access.
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:31.600]   They are required under penalty of law. So if this bill were to become law, it would be the end of encryption in the United States.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:36.600]   Not the end of encryption, but at the end of securing, in the end of security.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:39.600]   You call it in your article, "Brain Dead."
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.600]   Well, actually, I was quoting Bruce Schneier on that. This is the guy who literally- I trust him.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:51.600]   Yeah, he literally wrote the book on cryptography, and I had some of the stuff that in that article, I actually had to leave out because he would have got sued over it.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:58.600]   Well, say it now, and then- Well, it just couldn't believe that they were actually putting this out there- Oh, dumb.
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.600]   And saying, "Right."
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:05.600]   He pointed out it doesn't just affect phones, it would even affect things like compression, like zip.
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:12.600]   Compression, even on a broad reading, companies would have to provide deleted data and provide it in an internal way.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:17.600]   I mean, it's just- He told you, this is the most brain dead piece of legislation I've ever seen.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:23.600]   The person who wrote this either has no idea how technology works or just doesn't.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.600]   I should point out, Diane Feinstein is the Senator for Silicon Valley.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.600]   I know. How about that?
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:29.600]   Just California Senator.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:36.600]   And Richard Burr is from North Carolina where the research triangle is some of the most advanced technology in the world.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:42.600]   And these are the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is supposed to oversee the NSA and other intelligence agencies.
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:45.600]   That's a- That shows such a mind.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.600]   Oxymoron, isn't it?
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:49.600]   Yeah, it just boggles the mind.
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:50.600]   What are they thinking?
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:55.600]   I mean, it basically says, "Do this, it's mathematically impossible, but do it anyway."
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:07.600]   So what Shnier is saying, if you went to Microsoft and said, "Well, we want that file that was on OneDrive, and Microsoft says, "Well, no, that was deleted. That doesn't work."
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:09.600]   They have to say, "No, here it is."
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:10.600]   Yeah.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.600]   Which means they've got to keep it back up.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:15.600]   Delicions, they've got to keep all the content.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:20.600]   It's not physically possible for companies to do this and stay in business.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:23.600]   And it's going to make their products about as popular as rattlesnake it up in Yatta.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:29.600]   I mean, it just- it would kill an awful lot of American business.
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:33.600]   It would possibly even make what the NSA does illegal because I can't see them back during the encrypted tech.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:37.600]   Now, we should point out it's not a foregone conclusion that this will become- Bill will become law.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:42.600]   It's pretty clear that the president, if he's still president, will not- will veto it.
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:46.600]   Ron Wyden, I love Ron Wyden. I'm loving him more and more.
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:59.600]   He's from Oregon, Senator from Oregon. He says, "I will filibuster this thing. This thing will never- never ever become a bill as long as I'm here. Good for him. Good for you, Ron."
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:03.600]   It's in committee, though, right? We were reading drafts of it.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:08.600]   I think it's- Yeah, they released a draft that leaked out to the Hill about 10 days ago.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:09.600]   Right.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:19.600]   Then this version, which they've put in, is amended slightly so that the bill can only be- a court order can only be raised with a serious felony or drugs charge or-
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.600]   Okay.
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:24.600]   A whole bunch of other charges that you could probably make stick to pretty much anyone.
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:29.600]   But it just- it's so overarching.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:34.600]   There's no hint of what the penalties would be. There's no hint of how this should be done.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:42.600]   And then they have the nerve to say in the bill, "Of course, we're not prescribing how these things should be billed," which is exactly what the entire bill is all about.
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:44.600]   It's- it's frankly insulting.
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:52.600]   The good news is there was a bill in California to prevent the sale of smartphones that had encryption.
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:53.600]   That died in committee.
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:54.600]   And that died.
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:56.600]   They couldn't get a second before it, which says it-
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:57.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:02.600]   No one should take this- not take this seriously.
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:08.600]   But there is some hope that this is not widely viewed as a- as a good idea.
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:09.600]   No.
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:14.600]   I mean, it's- it's going to be very unlikely that this bill, as it stands, goes through.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:25.600]   What he is worrying, though, is that this is a sign of the position the government is taking, and they will carry on hammering away and hammering away as FBI will do with the next Apple iPhone case that needs to be decrypted.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:29.600]   And it's- if this is their starting point, then we're in serious trouble.
[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:40.600]   Because if something like this eventually goes through in two or five or ten years time after a big terrorist attack and everyone's very panicky, and it's a whole, well, let's give up our security just to, you know, just this once.
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.600]   And this is the kind of thing they're trying to do.
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.600]   And, yeah, California, their bill couldn't even get a seconder.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.600]   In Congress, however, what is it?
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.600]   Sixty percent of Congress are lawyers.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:55.600]   There's only about five Congress people with any direct technology experience.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:59.600]   And that's even if he's including Darrelis', you know, car alarm systems.
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:03.600]   There are very, very few people who know anything about technology in Congress.
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:09.600]   And with the First Crypto Wars Congress ducted it, they passed a stupid law and it took the courts to resolve it.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:16.600]   Now, thankfully, the EFF and others are coming in on this, but, you know, if something like this goes through, the results are going to be catastrophic.
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:21.600]   And getting us getting security back from this is going to be a really tough job.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:26.600]   So, it's been a few.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:31.600]   No.
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:36.600]   So I think to go back to win this Apple, I think broke.
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.600]   I think it was on to it actually that week.
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:49.600]   And my point then was exactly this, that the real danger with that case was not that particular phone.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:43:02.600]   And what the F.I. was asking Apple to do was certainly problematic, particularly from the government compelling Apple to weaken their own security was a problem.
[00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:07.600]   But that was, I'm pretty sure I said that at the time, I certainly wrote it at the time.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:18.600]   That was a very small problem relative to their political movement forming to weaken encryption.
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:20.600]   And that's exactly what this is.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:28.600]   Fortunately, I think I would hesitate to characterize, you know, Dianne Feinstein and Richard Burr as the government.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:32.600]   It's two senators in the government.
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:35.600]   Although ranking senators that has intelligence commitment.
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:36.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:37.600]   It's true.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:45.600]   But I mean, I don't think that just to go back to the 90s, I mean, one, this was an issue.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:47.600]   And Congress did pass a law.
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:52.600]   They passed the Kalya Act, which basically, again, it's a very complex issue.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:44:04.600]   And I'm going to very oversimplify it, but basically led to the capability of the NSA to force telecommunication carriers with them to listen in on everything.
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:10.600]   But strictly forbid, but a requirement that manufacturers modify their phones.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:11.600]   Well, interestingly.
[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:13.600]   Well, it did.
[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:14.600]   It did.
[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:21.600]   But I mean, it didn't allow them to dictate the design of devices.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:26.600]   And that's arguably a core reason why the All-Ritz Act does not apply.
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:31.600]   Because basically, the All-Ritz Act is a is a is a if nothing else in the law applies, then apply this.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:41.600]   But the core argument, Apple's legal briefing and the argument under which in this Brooklyn case, the Apple was found to not have to unlock the phone in that case.
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:47.600]   Is that actually Kalya specifically considered this question and chose not to make them design it?
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:49.600]   That said, it did.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:58.600]   In effect, and I think to Ian's point earlier, in effect, Kalya did force communications carriers like 18 E Verizon, you know, that secret room, right?
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:02.600]   In the suit centers, that's an outcome of Kalya.
[00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:08.600]   But Kalya also, at the same time, also did say that.
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:17.600]   Encryption, it did legislate encryption and say that encryption was allowed and that the government could not not allow encryption, basically.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:22.600]   Which if you go back at the time that it was an open question, there was the, you couldn't export encryption.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:32.600]   You can only have it for the US, which the net effect was everyone got the crappy encryption, 40-bit encryption in browsers, which we're still dealing with problems today because of that.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:39.600]   But I guess the good, there's good bad news. The bad news is this is the negative outcome.
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:53.600]   I certainly fear from the beginning when it comes to the Apple FBI case that because which wasn't about encryption actually was about weakening their security measures so they could, they could brute force a phone, a fordage of passcode.
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:46:00.600]   But the concern is that this would result in a political movement to weaken encryption.
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:07.600]   And that's where we're are. And the fact that it's just a fight that we as an industry are going to have to win.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:15.600]   But again, I don't know how far we're going to get by demonizing the opposition or calling people names.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:21.600]   I mean, this is an argument that it's on us. It's a complicated argument. It's one that's hard to explain.
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:37.600]   And it's on us to explain exactly why this is so problematic and make the case that it not only is the wrong thing to do for technological reasons and for privacy reasons, but it's the wrong thing to do for security reasons.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.600]   That's the big deal, right? It makes us less safe.
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:50.600]   It does. And basically to get into this, and there was a good video by CPG Gray this week kind of getting a little bit into encryption.
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:55.600]   It wasn't it didn't quite there's like one more point you could have made it even better.
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:47:09.600]   But basically the idea is that, you know, we in the physical world were okay with granting the police power with a warrant to break a physical lock basically and do that.
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:19.600]   And I think that's an important point for advocates of encryption to make that to acknowledge there is a legitimate,
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:37.600]   need for this. And, and that's the case. I think that the trick that the trouble is when the government breaks a lock and they're doing it in the in the physical world, that is one lock.
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:46.600]   It's constrained by by by by the if you even you want to take an example of a golden key, like if you want to like the TSA luggage.
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:51.600]   And then you can bring it to the table and then you can bring it to the table.
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:56.600]   And then you can bring it to the table and then you can bring it to the table.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:48:01.600]   And then you can bring it to the table and then you can bring it to the table.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:05.600]   And then you can bring it to the table and then you can bring it to the table.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.600]   And then you can bring it to the table.
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:09.600]   And then you can bring it to the table.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.600]   And then you can bring it to the table.
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:17.600]   And now everyone has access to every single luggage lock in the world was weakened immediately, all at the same time.
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:24.600]   The difference is you still have to get the key and go to every piece of luggage and unlock it one by one by one by one.
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:29.600]   There's a physical constraint on what can be done with with a golden key.
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:34.600]   The real danger with a digital golden key and this idea that there.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:40.600]   I mean, the only way that you could build in the only way to fulfill this law, the only way is that Apple has or or Google.
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:43.600]   Or WhatsApp or any service Amazon.
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:48.600]   And this again, this applies to basically every single company that's in the internet period.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:55.600]   That every single company has to retain a key that can undo their encryption.
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:59.600]   But the difference is when and if that key weeks and these things do week.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:02.600]   And again, you don't design for the best case.
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:03.600]   You design for the worst case.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:06.600]   So you presume what happens if this key weeks.
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:15.600]   Not only is every single piece of software and every service and everything that that touches immediately vulnerable.
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:20.600]   But it's vulnerable in a way that can be taken of advantage of immediately and at scale.
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:22.600]   Because that's how digital works.
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:29.600]   Like some bad guy in some Eastern European company or Russia or China or in the US or wherever it may be.
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:35.600]   Can immediately compromise and take advantage of that weakness in a matter of minutes.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:40.600]   And that's very different than having to go to every single piece of luggage in the airport and lock them one by one.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:45.600]   Like the degree of risk is massively massively greater.
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:49.600]   And you put that in an equation where figure out who has the most to lose.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:51.600]   Who has the most to keep secure.
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:57.600]   If you did a dissensus of every single country and every single citizen and every single company in the world.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:59.600]   Who has the most to lose.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:03.600]   And if you put this in a ledger and you weigh it out and you balance it out.
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:07.600]   It comes out that the United States has the most to lose of any single country in the world.
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:18.600]   And instituting an environment where you're hoping, basically your security rests on hoping that stuff doesn't leak.
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:19.600]   Or doesn't get out.
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:25.600]   Which the history of everything shows never persists and over the arc of time will get out.
[00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:26.600]   That's what happens.
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.600]   And that's why you design security for the worst case.
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.600]   You don't design it for the best case.
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:33.600]   So when it that happens, who will be decimated?
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:34.600]   It will be us.
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:35.600]   It will be the US.
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:38.600]   And that's the argument that we need to win on.
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:42.600]   Not calling the medians even though they are.
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:44.600]   Yeah, I know.
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:48.600]   It's it's it is tremendously satisfying to call these people white because you're right.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:51.600]   I know you're in a conversation in a way, shape or form.
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:53.600]   You said on Twitter you were going to decide a while to.
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:54.600]   I don't know.
[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:56.600]   You baited him into it.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:57.600]   You made him do it.
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:02.600]   Just yeah, I would love though to ask Senator Feinstein.
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:04.600]   What do you you know, what's your thinking here?
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:07.600]   Now remember these two are ranking members of the intelligence committee.
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:12.600]   Maybe they know something, you know, maybe they and they probably do have a good reason
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:16.600]   to be very worried and think that well, you really need to do something about this.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:22.600]   Yeah, I mean, I'm sure they're being told by the intelligence agencies that they are going dark and you know,
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:27.600]   but we seem to forget that, you know, before smartphones, we did have a pretty good record of catching criminals.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:28.600]   You know, it wasn't.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:29.600]   Yeah, when we do before phones.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:30.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:37.600]   Yeah, I mean, we've had encryption now for decent encryption for decades and we're still catching criminals.
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.600]   There are still stupid people out there.
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:44.600]   It's just it's that mindset that this will make law enforcement's life easier.
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:47.600]   Therefore, we should do it and we should ignore the consequences.
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:52.600]   And as you say, the consequences of this are absolutely huge.
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:58.600]   If the government's OPM department can't keep its senior fingerprints and securities clearances safe,
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:03.600]   if Microsoft can lose its source code, if Google can suffer serious outages, you know, I mean,
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:06.600]   there is no way to keep an escrow system key safe.
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:10.600]   And if you're going to introduce deliberate flaw into the encryption,
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:16.600]   China, Russia, Malwell writers will do a Manhattan project to find out what that is and to exploit it.
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:21.600]   Yeah, just to be clear, you can design a golden key that cannot be discovered.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:29.600]   I mean, it's a like the problem is the golden key can and will leak or can will be discovered.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:40.600]   And I think I really think a core issue here is I think it's hard for normal people to,
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:47.600]   I mean, what do tech companies sell? They sell, especially taking my Apple, they sell magic.
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:52.600]   They sell like it's a magical device. It's amazing what we can do with all these things we can do.
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:58.600]   And then it I think to go back to brand, I mean, they're selling this kind of amazing behavior
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:02.600]   and what we made in we made a robot that can beat can win it go,
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:06.600]   like can be the best player in the world in amazing these amazing innovations,
[00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:11.600]   all these sorts of things. And it to turn around and say, sorry, can't do it impossible.
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:19.600]   Well, true. In many respects goes against the image that tech has been selling of itself for a long time.
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:24.600]   And and frankly, you know, oh, sorry, that's hard to use. Sorry, computer crash.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:26.600]   This stuff's, you know, this stuff's really difficult.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:35.600]   But you know, you know, it I think it's just hard for people to to appreciate that this really is
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:41.600]   it's a fundamental trade off like either because the difference the difference with encryption.
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:47.600]   The difference with encryption is with real encryption with proper encryption where every device
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:52.600]   and every person has their own individual key that's like, I mean, in the case of an iPhone, right?
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:59.600]   It's based on the passcode is a is a piece of the key that goes into unlocking that phone.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:07.600]   And can you can that pass code leak? Can there be an iPhone and the passcode or the password even they got super secure?
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:12.600]   Let's say I have a noise at Nexus. Say I have like an 18 digit passcode on it or something,
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:17.600]   which is basically unbreakable if it's, you know, with a computer particularly given the speed of the processor on here.
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:22.600]   And can that leak? Yes, it can. And this phone could be compromised.
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:26.600]   But the difference is the only thing that's compromised is this one phone.
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:31.600]   And that's a big difference with a golden key where when and if it leaks, every single phone in the world is not compromised.
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:34.600]   Or with WhatsApp, every single message in the world is not compromised.
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:39.600]   Or with Amazon, every single transaction and everything that involves that is compromised.
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:43.600]   And that's the other thing. It's not just about like, it's not just about iPhones.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:48.600]   It's every like everything on the Internet depends depends on this.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:55.600]   And to think that it I don't know to make a broader point just to make a broader point is this is that
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:55:03.600]   the obvious point that we haven't said yet, but it is a key thing is that the US can ban encryption doesn't mean encryption goes away, right?
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:11.600]   Encryption is fundamentally an idea that is manifested in ones and zeros that is at a high level manifested in code.
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:14.600]   And the idea is out there. You can't put it back in a box.
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:20.600]   So given that, highly motivated, sophisticated criminals will always have access to encryption.
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:29.600]   So the only people that are hurt by this is one, law abiding citizens and two, stupid criminals who are dumb.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:37.600]   And to that end, the police in the US are mostly concerned with stupid criminals that are dumb.
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:45.600]   And a lot of us do with drug charges, which is a whole nother debate, but it could do with murders.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:52.600]   It could do with these terrible crimes, but and this is the harder you make.
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:56:00.600]   You sound very callous making it at the end of the day, the sort of folks that are going to pull off a 9/11 sort of attack,
[00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:09.600]   which one as awful as it was was in the four digits and you put that up against other thing, you know,
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:11.600]   people who die in car crashes, for example.
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:18.600]   But even said, the people who have the sophistication to pull off that degree of an attack by definition,
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:22.600]   have the sophistication to get an encryption algorithm that was made outside the US.
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:31.600]   The sort of people that the police will not be able to get to because an iPhone has encryption or because WhatsApp has encryption.
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:37.600]   Those are the sort of people that the degree of crime they can commit.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:48.600]   And again, it could be murder, it could be awful crimes, terrible crimes, but the physical constraint on their actions,
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:57.600]   just by virtue of no one person could be in a ton of places that once or pull off something of that, of a huge magnitude,
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:00.600]   it goes into the pros and cons equation.
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:08.600]   And it sounds very callous to say that, but the trade off, not all criminals are the same.
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:16.600]   The sophistication of the crime, I think, probably correlates very closely to the sophistication they have in getting encryption on their own,
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:23.600]   relative to someone who gets encryption on accident because Apple happened to include it on an iPhone, if that makes sense.
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:31.600]   Microsoft's getting into the act, they have filed a federal lawsuit, they say to stand up for what we believe are customers
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:36.600]   constitutional and fundamental rights that help protect privacy and promote free expression,
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:44.600]   they don't like the fact that so many government orders are secret and cannot be revealed,
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:50.600]   and they have decided that they are going to pursue this in court and good on them.
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:58:03.600]   They say over the last 18 months they've received 2,576 legal demands that as part of the demand required that Microsoft not say anything about it,
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:08.600]   they couldn't tell customers about the warrants or the legal processes.
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:17.600]   And of those secret demands, 68%, 1,752 didn't have an end date.
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:26.600]   So it means that never, not a year from now, not 10 years from now, there's no statute of limitations, never could Microsoft tell customers
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:34.600]   that government is obtaining their data, and they think that violates the Fourth Amendment and the First Amendment.
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:40.600]   They should be able to talk, and the Fourth Amendment protects you against unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:46.600]   They would like to change that, and they've gone to a court to sue over in the United States.
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:51.600]   I want to see more companies like Apple and Microsoft step up and defend their customers.
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:56.600]   No, exactly. I mean, Reddit's Warren Canary died a couple of weeks ago as well.
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:57.600]   One more.
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:06.600]   You know, it's on one level, the people who I speak to at Microsoft about this do believe passionately in the arguments that they're making that's the First and Fourth Amendment issue.
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:09.600]   On the other hand, there's also business motive here, let's not deny it.
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:10.600]   It looks good.
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:12.600]   It's customers like it.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:13.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:16.600]   That justifies the spend, I guess, the attorneys.
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:19.600]   But yeah, I mean, they genuinely do believe in what they're doing.
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:27.600]   And to be honest, they've got a point because they can be very few cases where the person should never ever know their being surveilled.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:38.600]   I think it's kind of a... It seems to me a fundamental point of fairness in not just American law, but in common law in general that you have the right to face your accusers.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:42.600]   You have the right to know if you're being investigated.
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:51.600]   And to be secretly investigated, I understand that that's a useful tool for law enforcement if they're trying to crack a drug ring or find a terrorist cell.
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:54.600]   You don't want to let them know you're looking for them.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:59.600]   Yeah, but it's also very useful for police if they're trying to do something completely innocuous and stress the law to do it.
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.600]   You know, I mean, it's...
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:02.600]   That's the fear is they're using it overusing.
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:07.600]   In 18 months, that's a lot of warrants.
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:16.600]   I mean, when the Patriot Act went, got rammed through in two days, then it was just like, "Oh, we're only going to use this in very certain circumstances to protect against terrorism."
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:19.600]   And then before you know it, it's being used left, right and center.
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.600]   And the same thing's happened in the UK with the Ripper Act.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:27.600]   I mean, once these laws are in station, then the police will use them because it saves them work and that's perfectly understandable.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:31.600]   National Security has become the tool of scoundrels, I think.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:36.600]   No, there's a specific, like, to Ian's point, I actually have the article in front of me.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:44.600]   There was a provision in the Patriot Act called "Sneak and Peak," which basically is the ability to conduct a search while delaying notice the suspect of the search.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.600]   It's this point exactly.
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:52.600]   Although this is about an actual physical search, I believe, not about this point specifically, but it's the same principle.
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:01:03.600]   And when this went through, this was actually a very controversial provision, and they stated that this was only going to be used for terrorism.
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:15.600]   To investigate these crimes without tipping off the terrorists, Robert Mueller said, "Is an invaluable tool in the war and terror efforts to combat serious criminal conduct?"
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:20.600]   Well, since the Patriot Act has been passed, there have been over 11,000 sneaking peak requests.
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:25.600]   And of those 11,000, a total of 51 have been used for terrorism.
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.600]   There you go.
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:33.600]   An infinitesimal percent of the vast majority have been used for run-of-the-mill drug cases.
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:47.600]   And again, I'm more than happy to have a debate about the war on drugs and the sort of impact it's had and the questionable motivations for why even got started.
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.600]   Did you read what Ehrlichman said about it?
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:53.600]   I did. I did. I thought that was fascinating.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:58.600]   So John Arundtman was one of the Watergate co-conspirators and did some jail time.
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:03.600]   It was just recently, somebody was interviewing him.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:11.600]   And he said, "Yeah, well, you want to know about the war on drugs? Really? It was because we couldn't really just go after black people.
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:14.600]   We couldn't really just go after hippies.
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:22.600]   So we inaugurated a war on drugs that would in fact just by accident just kind of reel them all in.
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.600]   This is under Nixon.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.600]   Out of the mouths of baits and scumbags.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.600]   I mean, it just-
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.600]   We're still fighting that war on drugs.
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:33.600]   And there are so many people in jail for so long for one joint.
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.600]   It's criminal.
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:43.600]   And boy, you know, I don't, I mean, Ehrlichman has passed on and I don't know if this is true or not.
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:51.600]   But, I mean, given the fact that we've had this 40 year war on drugs and drugs are cheaper, more powerful and more available than they've ever been,
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:55.600]   by all logical reasons, it's a failure and should be scrapped.
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:00.600]   But for some reason, it's being kept in. And then you've got to wonder why who wins out of this.
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:03.600]   I mean, it's my fault for setting this down this rabbit hole.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:06.600]   Yeah, I don't mind though. I think it's fascinating, really.
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:14.600]   But here's the thing though, even if, even, the reason why it's maybe not productive, not to take over your show,
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:27.600]   but the point being is that I think we can all at least agree that the war on drugs does not rise to the level of 9/11.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.600]   That's right.
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:52.600]   And the problem is that, and this is what's, this is the key to this debate, is that the, all the reality of the matter is that the law enforcement in general are cloaking themselves in terrorism
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:04:06.600]   and people's fear of things like 9/11. And actually, the debate that I would have is that the real problem is we wildly overestimate the cost of terrorism,
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:17.600]   again, not to trivialize people who died in 9/11, but you compare it to one, other countries, and two, the number of people who died in any number of other things.
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:23.600]   And the, on a cost benefit basis, our reaction is completely out of whack, and that's what really needs to be fixed.
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.600]   But that's a whole nother rabbit hole.
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:40.600]   But the fact that it's even as bad as it is, I think the, the, the, all evidence is that law enforcement is being duplicious in leveraging that fear to, in fact, get a tool that's going to be used for drug dealers.
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:55.600]   And, and I think that's the case that, that, I think if people understood that this would be a different, this would be a different conversation, because the fact matter is this Feinstein-Burr bill, all these bills are going to do nothing to disrupt al-Qaeda.
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:01.600]   There's nothing to disrupt ISIS, because this technology is out there, it exists.
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:09.600]   The only people that it's going to help, the only law enforcement it's going to help, and we have evidence of this is small-scale stuff.
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:20.600]   And do we want to trade the ability to more easily arrest a drug dealer for exposing the secrets and values of all your corporations and property to whoever may come along?
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.600]   That's the real issue at Case here.
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:30.600]   Apple, by the way, this is Jermaine to tech, because Apple is now fighting yet another case where the feds want them to unlock a phone.
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:36.600]   In this case, it's a drug case in New York, a federal drug case, with a guy who's already imprisoned as well.
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:42.600]   Yeah, yeah. This is the case I referred to earlier, where Apple actually did win the first round.
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:54.600]   What's interesting about this particular case is, Apple, this is, in some respects, this is an easier case for the government to win, because Apple doesn't actually have to do it.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:59.600]   Apple can just unlock it. They don't have to actually create a West secure operating system and all this sort of stuff.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:05.600]   Because it's running iOS 7, it's not full-disc encrypted.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.600]   iOS 7 has some encryption, but it's not full-disc encrypted.
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:10.600]   And Apple has unlocked these cases in the past.
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:14.600]   In this case, the judge actually invited Apple.
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:18.600]   In all cases, Apple just, we asked without agreeing or disagreeing with whether it was justified.
[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:23.600]   In this case, the judge actually asked Apple, "Do you actually think this is legally permissible?"
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:25.600]   And Apple could actually say, "Actually, no, we don't."
[01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:27.600]   And the judge agreed?
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:28.600]   Initially.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:34.600]   Right. Well, it's interesting because the guy went to prison, and so they kind of fell off the radar.
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:41.600]   But then once the San Bernardino thing happened, Apple actually went back to this judge and said, "You know, why don't you rule in that case?
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:43.600]   We're curious what you think."
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:49.600]   And that ruling came out before the San Bernardino case was wrapped, and the judge ruled in favor of Apple.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:55.600]   I think this guy is kind of a well-known agitator in this area, so Apple probably knew that was going to happen.
[01:06:55.600 --> 01:07:00.600]   He said, "You can't keep using the All-Ritz Act for all this for everything you want to do."
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.600]   Right.
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.600]   That's what I think you think it means.
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:07.600]   It's interesting though, because the government, I think the reason the government is appealing this, and this is an appeal,
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:12.600]   is because the issues for this case, again, it's all about precedent without question,
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:21.600]   but the issues in this case are narrower in that the government is not requesting that Apple be compelled to do additional work.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:22.600]   Right.
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:26.600]   Well, and that's Apple's point. The government could do this without us. They don't need us.
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:28.600]   Why are they demanding this?
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:32.600]   Well, Apple's now, frankly, that's Apple kind of obfuscating.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:35.600]   Because what they really want is a broader ruling.
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:39.600]   Anyway, enough of this. We talked enough about this.
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:41.600]   You can get the weeds for ages on this, for sure.
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:42.600]   Yeah, I know.
[01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:49.600]   The House has passed a bill to sabotage net neutrality. At least that's the interpretation by the EFF.
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:53.600]   It's HR 2666.
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:08:00.600]   Now, it's ostensibly about regulation. The no-rate regulation of broadband Internet access act.
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:04.600]   And by the way, a strong 241 to 173 of vote.
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:10.600]   Ostensibly, this just bars the FCC from regulating the rates.
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:13.600]   However, the bill is awarded in such a way according to the EFF.
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:18.600]   It could be used to keep the FCC from enforcing other consumer protections.
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:23.600]   Including the net neutrality regulations that they proposed.
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:27.600]   President Obama says he will veto the bill. It has to get through the Senate.
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:30.600]   Just thought I'd pass that along. And here's another tip.
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:34.600]   Thanks to Mike Elgin for this. Do not carry a satellite phone in India.
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.600]   Oh, yeah. This was terrible.
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:42.600]   Chris Daniel Morton, he's 65 years old. He lives in Illinois.
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:44.600]   And he's a physician.
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:55.600]   He carried a satellite phone into India with him because he needed to stay in touch in some of the rural areas he was visiting with his patients and his hospitals.
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:59.600]   He was arrested.
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:06.600]   Turns out it's illegal to have a satellite phone in India.
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:13.600]   He didn't know apparently, but of course, ignorance is no defense even in a case like this.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:24.600]   He has been bailed out, but he has to stay in India until the investigation is conducted in a report regarding the calls made from the phone.
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:34.600]   Yeah. I mean, you can understand people getting a getting hassle for their phones, but you have to figure that law is made by Indian telecoms that want to own the wireless business.
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:47.600]   Right. Yeah. I mean, it's just, but the fact is you need satellite phones in parts of the world. If you need to get access anywhere, phone access anywhere in the world, a lot of sailors use them, a lot of medics as this guy.
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:55.600]   Well, you know, it's to actually say, right? Okay. It's almost as stupid as say, I don't know, an American lawmaker looking to ban and crypto.
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:06.600]   Hold on. No more government stuff. Let's talk about Facebook in just a little bit. Google Netflix Twitter.
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:19.600]   And if you're using QuickTime for Windows, a little warning all coming up. Oh, and the Oasis. I don't know if you've seen Amazon's new, highly expensive, kindle.
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:30.600]   I don't even know who's asking for it, but somebody is, I guess. Our show today brought to you by Harry's the best shave ever for a fraction of what you're paying now from Harry's.com.

[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:47.600]   The idea that you can afford to get a new blade every week. Nice sharp blade. Harry's comes to you in directly from their factory in Germany.

[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:15.600]   One more. This really irked me. And Motherboard, by the way, has been doing a really great job on tech reporting. This is a vice column.
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:22.600]   But this one really bugged me. The FBI says, talk about losing the golden keys.
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:30.600]   It says a mysterious hacking group has had access to government files for years.
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:42.600]   Since 2011. And there's nothing they can do about it. The group known as APT6 have compromised and stolen.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:49.600]   This is a quote stolen selective and sensitive information from various government and commercial networks since 2011.
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:57.600]   This is an FBI alert. It comes months after the government revealed the group of hackers.
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:03.600]   Widely believed we were working for the Chinese government. Got into the OPM, the office of personnel management.
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:06.600]   Stole data about millions of government workers.
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:15.600]   This underscores the fact that you can't give the FBI this kind of stuff because they have no control over what's going on.
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:19.600]   It doesn't make me wonder what our law enforcement money is being spent on.
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:23.600]   It's like we're supposed to have the NSA, the finest hacking squad in the world.
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:28.600]   We're supposed to have sort of rock card government protection of our data. And this happens.
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:33.600]   And it's not the first case. I mean, there have been hackers going around the White House computer systems for months now.
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:41.600]   They can't get out of there. And you've got to wonder why, you know, it's probably, in this case, I'm almost certainly a nation state act.
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:47.600]   I think it's a Chinese government. Yeah. Which would explain why the new Chinese jet looks very very like an F2.
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:56.600]   The Michael Adams was quoted by a motherboard. He's an information security expert who was served 20 years in the US Special Operations Command.
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:02.600]   Said, "Looks like they were in for years before where they were caught. God knows where they are.
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:06.600]   Anybody who's been in that network all this long, they could be anywhere and everywhere."
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:13.600]   He said, "This alert is a demission that the government still is not in control of what goes on inside its most sensitive networks.
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:20.600]   It's just flabbergasting. How many times can this keep happening before we finally realize we are screwed?"
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:24.600]   Oh, that's great. That really inspires confidence. Oh, yeah.
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:31.600]   It's lovely stuff, isn't it? It's just what you want to hear from the people who are supposed to be guarding our tax returns this weekend.
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:36.600]   Yeah, by the way, 700,000 tax returns lost by the IRS last year.
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:42.600]   Lost to mysterious hackers. We don't know where do they come from? Who are they? What are they doing? We don't know.
[01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:50.600]   In San Jose. The broader point is, frankly, we're probably well infiltrated into China.
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.600]   Oh, yeah. We're doing the opposite. I'm sure, yeah.
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:15:01.600]   The broader point is, the broader point is, you have to design for failure. You have to presume that security will fail.
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:07.600]   You have to presume that people will break into anywhere and everywhere.
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:13.600]   You start with that, and then you think through what makes sense.
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:22.600]   That at a very core level is why this golden key thing is the issue,
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:27.600]   is because you have to presume it gets out. Then it gets out how do you mitigate the damages?
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:34.600]   Well, if you're in a situation where hundreds of millions of services or devices are compromised immediately,
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:42.600]   and because it's digital, said compromise can be exploited immediately and at scale,
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:46.600]   that's the fundamental problem with the golden keys,
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:51.600]   is the fact that it compromises everything at once and it compromises all immediately
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:54.600]   and can be taken advantage of immediately.
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:59.600]   That's the key thing about this, that I think so many people who like,
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:07.600]   "Well, the government, we let the police have a warrant. We let people break walks."
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:12.600]   Once you get digital, it changes everything about this.
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:17.600]   Again, you have to design with the assumption that everything is compromised.
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:21.600]   That's what's brilliant about encryption, is that it really can make it,
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:28.600]   encryption defeats the power of scale because it can be encrypted on a one-to-one,
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:31.600]   every device can have its own individual encryption key.
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:36.600]   I should mention, by the way, that somebody said, "Oh, big deal, you lost 700,000 returns."
[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:39.600]   I mean, "lost." I mean, hackers got them.
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:45.600]   And we'll then use those to only add to steal money from everyone else.
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:52.600]   The IRS originally said, "Oh, it's about 125,000. Now we know it was 700,000."
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:56.600]   It's really not just the returns, it's the entire account, including search.
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:58.600]   That is such a good thing.
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:03.600]   The digital checking system they put in place to reassure people that then got hacked as well.
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:08.600]   You couldn't make this stuff up. It just boggles the mind.
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:13.600]   Uber, on the other hand, FBI is probably saying, "Think of doing stuff. Why can't you be more like Uber?"
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.600]   Yeah, bending over.
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:19.600]   That should be more like Uber. Uber says, "We never got any national security letters.
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:25.600]   We have never received any orders under the Foreign Service Intelligence Surveillance Act."
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:32.600]   No. We just decided to hand over information on 12 million riders and drivers to various regulators.
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:35.600]   And that was 12 million in the last six months, wasn't it?
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:36.600]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:39.600]   Well, we just feel like we ought to be more helpful.
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.600]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:46.600]   It's 415 requests from law enforcement agencies and majority from state governments.
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:48.600]   And you know what? We got a great record on that.
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:52.600]   We were able to hand over data in 85% of those cases.
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:56.600]   Now, tie that into the story that's going around.
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:00.600]   And I don't know if I'm completely worried about this,
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:10.600]   that Uber's new Android app asks for access to your history, your browser, and your text,
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.600]   and a whole bunch of other stuff.
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:16.600]   Browsing history, bookmarks, running apps.
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:21.600]   Now, I mentioned this, but I'm going to jump in here.
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.600]   Because I...
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:27.600]   We can't have our cake and eat it, too.
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:32.600]   Like, you can't, at the end of the day, we'll start with the law enforcement thing.
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:40.600]   I mean, the police do have a legitimate interest if they have a warrant in getting information for one.
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:44.600]   For two, like, there's trade-offs you make just to live in public.
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:47.600]   I mean, you're asking to use a car service.
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:48.600]   Right.
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:49.600]   And I agree with you.
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.600]   I agree with you.
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:52.600]   I agree with you.
