[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.680]   Welcome everybody to episode a 383 of this week in Tech.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.600]   The week of Tech News.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.600]   We analyze it.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.600]   We explain it.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.480]   We have a great panel today.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.560]   Joining me, Aussie, the Wonder Dog.
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.120]   Also with us, Jolie Odell.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.120]   Good to see you.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.640]   Lovely to be seen.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.640]   With Barkley, Lieutenant Barkley.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.160]   He's thrilled to be here as well.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.200]   He's wearing a Santa outfit and you're wearing a Santa hat.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.200]   Very festive.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.040]   Nice to have you, Jolie.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.040]   He sounds like a baby.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.040]   Who, Barkley?
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.040]   No.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.040]   Well, that would be the baby.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.040]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.040]   There's also a baby.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.040]   Patrick Norton is also here.
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.760]   With Tristan, how old is Tristan now?
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.080]   Tristan is seven months.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.320]   He made his debut on this show when he was one week old.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.320]   Exactly.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.960]   I'd like to apologize in advance.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.280]   I didn't realize that my final solution for babysitting was grading papers Sunday afternoon.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.280]   Uh-oh.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.120]   No, we're glad to have Tristan.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.720]   And any baby noises you hear either come from Aussie, Barkley or Tristan.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.720]   Or John.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.720]   Or wait a minute.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.720]   John C. de Boerack is also here.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.720]   He's got his baby.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.720]   I was not told in advance of the gimmick show.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.160]   We've got a dog, a cat, birds.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.160]   We have a lot of animals.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.080]   All right, we're going to put our animals down.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.240]   We'll keep the human versions.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.240]   And did you notice, John, I'm wearing a UK t-shirt.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.240]   You know, I have a UK hoodie.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.680]   And UK, of course, is great.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.160]   They're the, that's University of Kentucky.
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:41.080]   And they are the preordained yearly, I think, is going to be an NCAA basketball champion.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.360]   Because they only bring in the top kids who quit the first year.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.760]   And every year it's a new team.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.760]   And they all go to the NBA.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.760]   It's an amazing story.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.000]   It's actually kind of, is that what's that?
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Is that a parry guy?
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Yeah, no, he's unbelievable.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.240]   He's learned to coach new kids.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.440]   He gets them to actually play.
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.680]   He said he would promise that he can quit.
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.480]   He's obviously a brilliant scout as well, because he can find the right kids.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.720]   No, they come to him at this point.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.720]   Oh, at this point, he doesn't have to.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.920]   Because they know they're not going to be harassed.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.520]   Because a lot of schools, they say, well, you got to stay in the grade.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.520]   You got to stay in the grades.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.520]   You know, let's just bring them in.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.520]   They're here to go to the NBA.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.520]   Boom.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.520]   And they went, they do very well every year.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.680]   I can hear Ryan Shraut spinning.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.680]   He's a good team.
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.680]   He's a good team.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.680]   He's a good team.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.680]   He's a good team.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.680]   Huge.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.680]   Yeah.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.680]   That's what I thought.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.680]   Now, he would say the same thing.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.680]   I don't know about that.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.680]   Oh, yes.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.680]   Believe me.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.680]   Anybody who knows anything about basketball knows that this is what they do.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.000]   Ryan's a host of this weekend computer hardware with along with the Patrick.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.640]   And he is in Louisville.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.800]   Yes.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.800]   And he's a UK fan.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.800]   A rabbit.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.800]   Like a rabbit.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.800]   Like a UK shirt.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.320]   I had a visitor from Kentucky earlier.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.320]   Mm.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.920]   Yeah, dropped it off.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.840]   Apple's profit to fall for the first time in nine years.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.800]   Apple has not had a good run.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.280]   They're stock price down, how much?
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.280]   I don't know.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.280]   20%.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.280]   What's it at?
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.280]   540 now?
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.280]   Something like that.
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.280]   Something bad.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.280]   Something bad.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.520]   Well, I guess if it isn't unless you bought Apple stock, which neither of us have.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.480]   If you bought it at 700, yeah.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.480]   Well.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.880]   If I may offer some perspective.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.960]   Yes, please.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.280]   It's up from 400 a year ago.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.280]   That's true.
[00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.880]   It's still up over a year over a year.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.880]   This is not Netflix.
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.880]   You don't know that.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.000]   The problem is I think a lot of people probably jumped on at the high of not.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.120]   See, that would be stupid.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.080]   You don't buy stock when it's high.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.080]   That's dumb.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.680]   That's telling them, Jolie.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.680]   You buy it now.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.680]   Buy Apple stock now.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.680]   And it will go up.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.320]   And you don't buy houses at the top of the market either.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.360]   I do it all the time.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.360]   And analyst says I.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.600]   Which is why you're day drinking with all of us, right?
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.600]   And it's a day drinking.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.600]   It's a thing.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.600]   Day drinking.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.600]   It's not day.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.800]   It's the sun's over the yard.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.240]   Besides that, it'll be dark in a minute.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.320]   One analyst is saying his prediction is $390.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.040]   So and I think if if Apple does in fact have a falling profit for the.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.280]   Now remember, this is not not a profit.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.560]   This is not a loss.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.000]   This is not a increase as big an increase as usual.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.520]   According to and again, it's it's expectation.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.160]   Because when is Apple's quarterly earnings?
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.560]   I'm not sure when they're going to.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.560]   They'll do fine.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.840]   There's a ways away before Apple collapses.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.480]   S&P dropped its forecast.
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.160]   It's now from 9.8 to 4.7 percent.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.880]   Half the original estimate.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.640]   Facts set down.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.680]   Growth will be down from 3.8 to 3.5 percent.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.960]   So was all of this before or after they made the announcement on bringing one Mac line back
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.440]   to the United States before?
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.000]   And I think that the reason I found all these stories is because I was starting to wonder
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.360]   why is Tim Cook all of a sudden on the interview trail?
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.920]   He did Brian Williams.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.320]   He did Bloomberg Business Week.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.200]   He's starting to give a bunch of CEO interviews.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.680]   And usually that's a sign, right?
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.280]   You try out the CEO for a reason.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.120]   Maybe to say, hey, look, this next Steve Jobs is here or maybe because you see trouble
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.120]   ahead.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.760]   He did, but he did it.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.560]   One of the things he told Brian Williams is we're going to make, we're going to start
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.160]   making Macs in the US.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.160]   Looks like he'll be partnering.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.040]   They won't be doing their own factory.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.560]   They'll be partnering with a Foxconn or somebody like that.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.560]   Foxconn has already built a Brazilian plant.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.560]   Yeah, they want to build here.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.560]   There's no doubt about it.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.560]   That was the funniest tweet I saw.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.760]   It was like, yes, Foxconn's coming to the US.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.280]   And I was like, oh, what could be worse than working for Walmart?
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.000]   But that could be the opposite of the whole point of the PR move of making computers in
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   the United States.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.640]   Well, as long as they employ US workers, I guess it's all right.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.640]   No, that's part of the deal.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.640]   Right.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.640]   But they also--
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.080]   They're going to put-- I understand at least $100 million in the suicide prevention hotline
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.080]   as part of the deal.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.040]   You saw the nets they put up at Foxconn.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.040]   Suicide nets.
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.040]   Yeah, that's crazy.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.080]   But I think that because of the size of the Foxconn employees--
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.680]   And the factory is 750,000 workers, that kind of thing.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.040]   Yeah, they didn't have an abnormal number of suicides.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.680]   There's a lot of people there.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.680]   I don't know.
[00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.680]   This is dark.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.520]   100 million-- yeah, we're going to move on.
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.520]   $100 million.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.240]   Now, Apple remembers worth more than $100 billion.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.240]   So that's not--
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.440]   They have $120 billion in the bank.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.440]   Right.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.440]   Now, not worth.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.440]   Did I say worth?
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.440]   I meant they have cash positions more than $100 billion.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.080]   Yeah, they got the most cash of any corporation in the world right now.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.080]   So $100 million big deal.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.080]   That's chicken feet.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.080]   Chumpt change.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.080]   What do you think it'll be?
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.080]   Mac Pros, iMacs?
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.200]   Maybe something new.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.960]   Here is-- this is--
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.200]   Mac Pros would be the best idea.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:38.400]   Kim Cook talking to Brian Williams on Rock Center.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.880]   This is the smallest video I've ever seen in my life.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.880]   What have you--
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:42.880]   Look at the size of the video.
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:43.880]   It's-- you zoomed in.
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.680]   You know, they say television people are always a lot smaller.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.760]   You know, this-- this iPhone has a matter of fact.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.760]   The engine in here is made in America.
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.760]   And not only--
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.520]   The engines in here made in America, but engines are made in America and are excellent.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.520]   Yeah, here it's the--
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.520]   Wait a minute.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.120]   The iPhone engine is made in America.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.920]   Can you turn up the bleed a little bit so with Mr. Devourek in here?
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.760]   Does he mean the motherboard was the engine?
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.760]   The chip is made.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.760]   The chip is made.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.760]   The CPU.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.080]   It's made by Samsung.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.040]   I think Samsung has a factory in the US.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.760]   The US factory, all right.
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.760]   The phone is made by Kourtney.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.400]   He says the glass on the phone is made by Kourtney and Kentucky.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.400]   We know that.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.400]   The real it was.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.040]   And you wear the thing just in-- you know?
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.040]   Huh?
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.040]   You're wearing a Kentucky thing.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:26.040]   Kentucky.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.040]   So we've been wearing--
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.040]   Kourtney and glass.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.360]   They're a different guy?
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.800]   Isn't Tim notorious a fan of--
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.800]   Auburn.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.800]   Auburn?
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.800]   Why?
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.800]   Because yes, we're going to school.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.800]   Oh, well.
[00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:38.800]   I guess like--
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.800]   What do you say for Auburn?
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.800]   Not roll tide.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.800]   What do you say for Auburn?
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:42.800]   Duck War Eagle.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.800]   He's a War Eagle.
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.800]   Auburn War Eagle.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.680]   What's with all the sport ball references today?
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.680]   I don't know.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.680]   Today is sports day.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.680]   Okay.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:51.680]   War Eagle.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.680]   Sunday.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:53.680]   Sunday.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.680]   Sunday.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.680]   You've seen the roll tide ads.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.680]   ESPN does.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.680]   Anyway, back to Tim Cook.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.720]   It's on doing more and more in the United States.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.720]   Auburn Tigers.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.720]   Tigers.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.720]   That's what it is.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.720]   Yeah, but you say War Eagle.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.720]   You do?
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.720]   If you go up to just say that.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.160]   If you go up to Tim Cook and you say War Eagle, he'll give you the secret handshake.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.000]   I swear to God.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Really?
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.240]   They have a secret handshake, you think?
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.240]   It's a secret.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:37.360]   It's a secret.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.520]   I do.
[00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.160]   Who's the one Jamie Lee Curtis?
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.720]   He looks like Jamie Lee Curtis.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.200]   She has an extra, ex-crum, so many of them.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.120]   Yeah, no, she was a hermaphrodite when she was born.
[00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.120]   That's a fact.
[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.120]   You know, it takes all kinds.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.400]   What I'm going to say though is this is absolute bull crap.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.400]   It really is.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.400]   Dead.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.400]   He's a lesbian?
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.840]   No, she's going to actually raise the tone of the conversation amazingly.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.840]   Oh, I see.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:58.840]   We're all just swallowing people.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.840]   All right, I'm sorry.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.320]   I need an idea that Apple is going to get booted now.
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.320]   You need to get booted now.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.880]   The United States, can we recall for one moment why they're doing that?
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.880]   Why?
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.480]   Because of all the problems.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.480]   In China.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.480]   Other plants.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.480]   Yes.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:16.680]   Because it's profitable for them to look like they care about American manufacturing when
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.160]   it's really costing them money.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.560]   I mean, this is a hundred million dollars worth of PR.
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.560]   That's all it is.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.720]   I had a good column on Friday about this exact topic.
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.720]   Saying the same thing?
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.560]   Well, pretty much what she's just said.
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.320]   But I think what's happened because the Chinese have moved to so many robots that somebody
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.960]   added two and two and said, you know, we could put robots in a factory.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.960]   We could do robots.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.960]   We could do robots.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:37.960]   We could do robots very well.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:42.160]   And it's and Apple still has to pay the American taxes, corporate taxes.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.560]   So you might as well just put some of the money in the country.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.240]   And it makes you look like a good guy.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.240]   The United States.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.000]   Let's say our Constitution was a little different in Barack Obama called you in tomorrow and
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.480]   said, get everybody out of China and do whatever you have to do.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.800]   Make the talk about a crazy hypothetical.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.680]   Oh, Brian Williams.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:05.200]   Let's say let's pretend the president could make you do this.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.200]   Everything you make in the United States.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.200]   Terrible.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.440]   The price of this device.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.880]   Honestly, it's not so much about price.
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.960]   It's about the skills, etc.
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:20.480]   Whoa, now you got to be careful here because he's about to say Chinese workers have more
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.920]   skills than American workers.
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.920]   No, is that the.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:23.920]   No, he's just the other way.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.920]   Is that the implication?
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.920]   It was the other way.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:26.920]   Well, why you make it in China?
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:27.920]   He's lying.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.920]   The reason they make it in China is because it's cheaper.
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:30.920]   Right.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:31.920]   Right.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.920]   Right.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.920]   Chinese can also crank out lots of feed with manufacturing.
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:36.920]   Williams.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:37.920]   Why is he such a hack?
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.440]   He's not asking this guy.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:43.520]   He says the skills needed to make the iPhone have left the US.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.520]   That's what he just said.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.320]   Oh, that's so you were right.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.520]   You've heard this clip before.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.640]   It's not only people that the education system is not producing now.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.640]   That's sad.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:54.640]   How do we get that back?
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.640]   Well, it's a concerted.
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.640]   You know what?
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:57.640]   You're right.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.640]   Now I'm getting angry.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.640]   This is so stupid.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.480]   Now I'm getting angry because because these are the lies that they're telling you to make
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.840]   it okay for you to have these devices that people kill themselves for.
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:07.840]   It's pretty straightforward.
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:08.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:09.840]   It's pretty straightforward.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.200]   They save money by making it in China.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.800]   Let's get my Christmas card all crumbled up.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:17.040]   Well, that's not completely true.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.720]   There are a lot of skills that Chinese have that we simply do not have.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:25.640]   In fact, for the last 20 years, if you talk to anybody about injection molding, they'll
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:30.200]   tell you that the Taiwanese or the world-class leaders, we don't even come close to it.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:34.400]   Most of the injection molding stuff has to be done through Taiwan.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:39.360]   I think other skill sets that they have developed slowly in China that we just don't compete
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.360]   with at all.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.720]   When you say skill sets, do you mean the ability and machinery to do it at mass production
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.720]   scale?
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.720]   Is that what we don't have?
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.720]   There's a couple of things.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.920]   One is that some of the techniques that they've developed we don't have.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.320]   And we can't get.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:56.960]   It's like the Russians have a technique for welding tungsten that we've never been able
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.120]   to achieve.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.480]   The Russians will hint about, you guys still can't weld tungsten.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.440]   Where's the corporate espionage I ask you?
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.920]   I know, you'd think that.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:07.920]   It's hard to believe that there's knowledge.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:08.920]   You can't believe that it's figuring out what you're grabbing.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.920]   I'm doing it cheaper here at home.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:11.920]   With our 14-year-olds.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.680]   I think what happens is they download the stuff just like the Chinese do and they look
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.240]   at it and they go, "Oh my God, we'll never do this.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.080]   This is written in Chinese."
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.760]   It may also have to do with environmental regulations.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.280]   I wouldn't be surprised if that.
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.600]   I think we'll do a lot of violations of that in China as well.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.000]   But they can't have violated.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.840]   They can violate it with impunity.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.840]   I'm surprised to be.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.040]   So remember when Steve Jobs had dinner with Barack Obama a few months before his death,
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:42.640]   he brought up and said, "You've got to relax the regulatory environment in the United States
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.000]   because we can't build plants here."
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.400]   He said it specifically to Obama.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:48.200]   Wasn't he supposed to be some kind of hippie though?
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:53.800]   Well, that was always the interesting paradox of Steve Jobs is he was kind of a hippie, but
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.080]   he was also the hell of a businessman.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:00.720]   And I think he really did not mind the idea that if you want us to build plants here,
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.720]   you've got to relax the regulatory environment.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.920]   Yeah, there are a lot of people who think that's probably the key.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.920]   You know what needs to happen?
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.120]   People need to start paying more money for these things.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.920]   They're worth more than we're paying for them as it is.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:15.520]   So that was, I made fun of it, but that was Brian's real question was how much more would
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.560]   it cost to make a U.S.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.840]   And he refused to answer it.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.840]   He knows the answer.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.080]   There's been studies.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.240]   It's about five bucks more.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.240]   For what?
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.240]   To make an iPhone in the United States.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.240]   Well, how much?
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.240]   Well, what about the United States?
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.240]   It's a lot of money when you consider how many phones they sell.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.240]   That's margin.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.640]   And China and Taiwan aren't they.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.240]   Our computers are all none of them made in the U.S.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.760]   I'm going to see if I can find that.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:38.200]   So somebody on the chat room says I was dead wrong about something twice in a row.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.000]   And I'm trying to figure out what did I say.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.800]   Oh, don't listen to the chat room.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.200]   The chat room is usually, uh, I'm not even observed.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.200]   No, they're great.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.200]   But people come in there just to say things like that.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.200]   Oh, really?
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:53.400]   Uh, let's see, New York Times January 2012.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.400]   How the U.S.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.760]   Lost out on iPhone work.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.880]   When Barack Obama joined Silicon Valley's top luminaries for dinners in California last
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.320]   February, the guest was asked to come with a question for the president.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.680]   Steve Jobs interrupted President Obama with an inquiry of his own.
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.440]   As Steve Jobs as Apple spoke, Obama interrupted him with an inquiry of his own.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.680]   What would it take to make iPhones in the U.S.?
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.240]   Why can't that work come home?
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.240]   Jobs reply was unambiguous.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.320]   Now this is Jobs speaking.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.800]   Those jobs aren't coming back.
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:28.120]   Well, apparently, uh, Tim Cook has things differently.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:32.760]   I think you could do a finals assembly of the Macintosh, especially the Mac Pro in the United
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.760]   States.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.760]   That's what they'll do.
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.840]   In fact, we know they're doing that because we're some iMacs are arriving saying made
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.840]   in the USA.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:39.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.840]   I think it's final assembly.
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:41.840]   Assembles in the USA.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.000]   Um, they haven't helped them customize some things a little bit.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   I don't know.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.600]   It's not going to break the bank.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.760]   Well, someone who's worked on assembly lines when I was a kid.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.520]   You know, wherever you speak, uh, I would say that you were you did a lot of stuff when
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.520]   you were a kid.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:16:59.520]   You were a coal miner.
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.600]   I was you worked in an assembly line.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.200]   No, it's a coal mine.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:07.720]   He just he's mocking me is the only reason that did you work at Ford?
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:08.720]   Where did you work?
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.720]   I worked at Ford.
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:10.960]   I worked at Trailmobile and I worked at International Harvesters.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.400]   I worked in three different assemblies.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.280]   Almost everybody who grew up in Michigan ended up working at Ford at one point or another.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.280]   That was a good job.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.360]   I was raised in Newark.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:21.560]   I'm trying to give you a backstory.
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.960]   Just roll with it.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.960]   When John was a.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.520]   Ford had a plant in Milpitas.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.520]   Yeah, I know.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.520]   I know.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.520]   No, you don't know that.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.520]   I do know that.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:32.520]   You know about the old Oakland car?
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.920]   No, it was because they made the Oakland there?
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.840]   No, the Oakland was made in guess where?
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.840]   Oakland?
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:37.840]   Yes.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.840]   There you go.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.840]   How about that?
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.000]   There was a study and I'm trying to find it and I can't that did say the actual cost,
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.600]   the estimate of what the actual cost would be to make these products.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.880]   And it was a surprisingly small amount.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.880]   I don't remember if it was exactly the cost.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:50.880]   But in aggregate.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:51.880]   Well, you're right.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:52.880]   If you sell 100 million of them.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.880]   It's half a billion dollars.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:59.120]   Apple doesn't want to take that risk.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.720]   This is just big, dumb corporate BS.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.720]   Talking about half a billion, Apple and Google have decided-
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.720]   You're becoming a socialist.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.280]   I've always been a socialist.
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.280]   Really?
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.760]   I registered as a socialist when I was 18.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.600]   Now I've given up on politics since then.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.600]   I just don't care.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.600]   That's what-
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.200]   I don't know if you've ever heard anything, but this kind of thing makes me upset.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.200]   Apple and Google have teamed up.
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.560]   Actually, you know, I wanted a couple more things about Tim Cook.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.760]   He also said they're going to make a TV.
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.120]   This is the first acknowledgement since the Steve Jobs biography.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.480]   Well, let me think back a couple years ago on this very show.
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.480]   I died.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.480]   And yours truly.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.480]   You said so.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.760]   Has going on and on about how they have to make a TV so they have something to sell
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.880]   in the stores, which is the same reason Microsoft's bringing out hardware left and right.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.320]   So they have something to sell in the stores.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.320]   Why is that important?
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.240]   Everybody said, "Oh, they're never going to bring out a TV.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.080]   There's no margins in TV."
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.080]   And everyone went crazy.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:54.600]   Well, in fact, look at the Japanese TV manufacturers who are all in deep trouble.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.600]   Because of that, there aren't any.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:56.600]   They aren't.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.600]   They're going to be in bigger trouble after Apple comes out there.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.600]   Cool TV.
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.520]   Tim Cook tells Brian Webb, "When I go into my living room and turn on the TV, I feel like
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.040]   I've gone backwards in time 20 to 30 years.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.040]   He's still watching.
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.480]   I love Lucy Riemmling, I think.
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.480]   It's an area of intense interest.
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.400]   I can't say more than that.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.200]   That's an implication they're going to get in the TV business some way."
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:18.000]   Well, apparently a lot of suppliers have already, they've already a specked out to
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.400]   think.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.960]   And it's going to be extremely thin.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.880]   And it's going to use that new glass from Corning.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.280]   So the thing's going to be razor thin.
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.280]   It's going to be a thin thing.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.840]   You can probably lift it up hanging on the wall on a hook.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.840]   That would be interesting.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.520]   Which is probably what it's going to be like.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:33.520]   And that's when it's going to be there.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.600]   You're going to bring it out on the floor, the San Francisco show.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.120]   I've got to say, though, hanging on the wall.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.160]   There's nothing Apple could do in hardware that the others couldn't duplicate.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.080]   It's got to be software that Apple's going to...
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.520]   Well, there'll be some cool software too, obviously.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.960]   A new kind of Apple TV, basically.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.280]   And it also has to be content deals.
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.760]   And I think that's the big story is that Apple is going around trying to make content
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.760]   deals.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.240]   Well, I mean, they already have a lot of relationships in place in the entertainment industry for
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.240]   obvious reasons.
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:05.080]   And that's been the biggest hurdle for the newer box manufacturers like Roku, for example.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:07.880]   They have a very hard time doing content deals.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.120]   And same for Netflix and same for Hulu.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.120]   But wouldn't it be easier?
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.160]   Because like, okay, all the people in my generation are younger.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:19.640]   We already feel like turning on the TV is a good 20 or 30 years old, just as a habit.
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:20.640]   We watch television on...
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.160]   You only ask as a young person.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.160]   I'm a young person.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.160]   I'm in my 30s, sir.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.160]   But I am the young person.
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.640]   You're younger than all of us.
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.800]   Yeah, she's in her 30s.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:31.800]   She's a spring chicken.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.800]   Good, that baby out here.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.440]   Are you really doing all of your new 30s?
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.600]   You seem like you're about 24.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.600]   So do you watch cable?
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:40.600]   Oh, no.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:41.600]   No.
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.600]   Do you have a cable?
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:43.600]   She doesn't watch anything.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:44.600]   Look, here's the thing.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.040]   And everybody in my age group would tell you the same thing.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:55.320]   If you can't get it on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon or iTunes, you're going to get it illegally.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.320]   Download it by BitTorrent.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.400]   Because cable is expensive or because it's just a pain in the butt.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.000]   But, and you never really need it.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.600]   You need it for that one show.
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:10.040]   Why would you pay $100 a month or however much you old people pay for your cable to watch?
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:14.160]   Hey, I'm paying $200 a month.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.160]   Here's the--
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.160]   30 Rock.
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.160]   No, it's not 30 Rock.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.160]   They have Hulu deal.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.160]   There's always one show like Downton Abbey or something that you can't get.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.160]   Right.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.160]   But that's what the pyro bait was in there.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.000]   I don't watch those shows.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.640]   Downton Abbey is going to be for people who no longer watch TV.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.880]   And that's like, okay, why are you going to convince people to break a habit that you
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:34.880]   helped start?
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.640]   So I want to correct myself actually.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.440]   Okay, here we go.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:43.720]   Next to the chat room who read further down the article of how the US lost that on iPhone
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.720]   work.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.560]   And the estimate is about 67 bucks more to make an iPhone in the US.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.400]   I'm not buying into that one.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.400]   That sounds like a lot.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.680]   That doesn't sound right.
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:58.640]   That would be wages, that would be complying with environmental regulations that would
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.640]   be, you know, unionized workers.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.640]   Sounds too high.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.640]   What if the--
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.640]   The parts are the same.
[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.640]   Came from here.
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:05.640]   Singin'?
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.840]   If we made all the original materials, if it wasn't just assembly, is that what that is?
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:08.840]   Ah.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:12.960]   It's hard to estimate how much more would cost to build iPhones in the US.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:17.480]   However, various academics and manufacturing analyst estimate, because labor is such a
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:24.240]   small part of technology manufacturing, paying American wages would add up to $65 in each
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.840]   iPhone's expense.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:30.040]   Since Apple's profits are often hundreds of dollars per phone, they'd still get a healthy
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.040]   reward.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.040]   But 65 is not insignificant.
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.040]   It doesn't sound right.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.040]   You think it's too much.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.640]   Yeah, with robots and all.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.520]   I mean, how many of these-- do you think people are putting these phones together by hand?
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.240]   You've seen the pictures of the assembly line there.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.440]   Are people slowly-- yes, there's not robots.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.400]   I'm going to go see the assembly line in person.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.800]   There's-- this guy's a roboted up the butt.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.800]   Well, I mean--
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:49.800]   That sounds painful.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:50.800]   That sounds painful.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.800]   That sounds painful.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:53.800]   That sounds painful, to be honest.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.080]   It depends on, you know, okay, we're not going there.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.080]   Patrick is run by the way.
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:04.040]   Now somebody says iPhones are not ro-- anything that is like these phones has to be robot-made.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.040]   You can't sit there and-- no.
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.040]   I think somebody's soldering this.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:08.040]   I'm soldering you to get that right.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.040]   They may solder this chip in here.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.520]   You want to see some pictures?
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:12.520]   These are the--
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.520]   These are the sides of the one here.
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.800]   This is bean roll from God knows.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.480]   No, no, no, it's not.
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:24.160]   We've seen pictures on iPhones in assembly line pictures because they take pictures on
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.000]   the assembly line of each other.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.640]   You're like, here's an iPhone assembly line.
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.360]   See all the people in bunny suits?
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.360]   That's them.
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.360]   What are they doing?
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.280]   They're putting pieces together.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.280]   Huh?
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.280]   Hey.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.280]   Okay.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.520]   I'll just-- I relent on my robot.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.880]   I don't think they're using robots.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.400]   Well, obviously with all those people, but who knows what they're really doing.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.800]   And that's just in the box complement.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.400]   Do we know that's the Apple line?
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.240]   They might just be doing QA.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:55.240]   There's 275-- or there's-- yeah, 275,000-- or what?
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.240]   No, it's like 750--
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.240]   See, you have the robots and that--
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.600]   --thousand people working at this factory.
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.600]   And she could be right.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.880]   These could be all QA.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.240]   So it was a-- come with us now.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.640]   I'll translate.
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:16.600]   We decided to visit via helicopter the Foxconn plant in Shenzhou, China.
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:22.440]   As you see here, the housing is very-- and fancy.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:30.880]   Here we land the helicopter in the beautiful environs of the Foxconn factory.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:35.320]   Let's just skip ahead.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.320]   There's a person.
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.320]   There's a human.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:45.160]   For those of you just tuning in.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:49.520]   Yeah, the show is going-- it's going to go into the Chinese.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.360]   See what she's doing there?
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.720]   Soldering iron, screwing.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.720]   That's not an iPhone, however.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:57.720]   That's some sort of a gun.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.440]   But I think all of these are done the same way.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:04.840]   Now the reason is it's more expensive to build robots and do it with robots than it is to
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:08.160]   cheap human labor, don't you think?
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:14.320]   When I first visited one of these factories years ago, it was a keyboard factory.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.560]   And everyone's paid at this time, 25 bucks a week.
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:20.480]   And I was told by the plant managers, he says, "We'd love to get rid of these people
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.240]   because robots are better.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.840]   People cannot-- they make mistakes.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.360]   And they were ready to go all robots."
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.640]   And this was like in the '90s.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:32.000]   Well, I don't believe for a minute that there's not a lot of robots in China.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.600]   Mike Wayne are writing in the unofficial Apple weblogs.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:35.600]   You know, Apple's--
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.600]   You know, Apple's--
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:57.860]   --G
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:03.000]   iPhone now, they have to stockpile 10 million of them before they even go on sale.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.280]   And they're in more and more countries day of launch.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.480]   It's really a big production issue.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.520]   And this is where Tim Cook, of course, is his expertise.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:15.800]   I would think that they would-- really, the motivation here is not so much to get it in
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:20.880]   the US, but is to make it more efficient, make it faster, be able to crank out more.
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.120]   The other issue I would bet is leakage.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:27.560]   One of the problems with making in China is that we're finding out what these phones
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:33.260]   are well before we get Apple announcements, because you can't control leaks in China.
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:36.460]   And they probably-- the Chinese and the tourists are overproducing, so then they put the other
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:40.460]   ones in a separate pallet, and they go off and next thing, you know, they're being sold
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.460]   in the black market.
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:42.460]   Right.
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:43.460]   What do you think leakage would be any different in the US?
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:44.460]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.460]   You could control that.
[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:46.460]   How?
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:47.460]   Robots.
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.540]   They never-- they never talk.
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:50.540]   Apple did launch--
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:51.540]   Well, go right into that one.
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:55.940]   -- iTunes in 56 new countries, movies in four new countries.
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:59.580]   The Russian iTunes launched not such a great success.
[00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:08.020]   Apparently, whoever programmed the code used a dummy website, x.x.x.x, dummy IP address
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:14.860]   in the code, but turns out in Russia, x.x.x.x is actually an adult site.
[00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:15.860]   I would think.
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:23.060]   And so right there in the iTunes store, the world's largest 100% free directory of triple
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.060]   X escorts.
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:25.060]   Wow.
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:28.660]   What was that URL again?
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:30.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:35.020]   x.x.x.x.x.x.x.x.
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.020]   And we'll leave that as an exercise.
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:40.260]   I like that Russian reversal in Soviet Russia porn block's apple.
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:46.340]   I think they've probably fixed that, but kind of funny.
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.820]   The baby's back?
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:48.820]   Is he sleeping?
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:49.820]   No, quite.
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:51.380]   Did you give him some Armenia and cognac, I think you were?
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:52.620]   They'll knock him out.
[00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.460]   I think in Armenia, they do that for teething.
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:55.940]   He's down in the ground.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:59.020]   Yes, well, they started with me with Jack Daniels when I was teething.
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:00.020]   Did they?
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.020]   19, I was sober.
[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:02.020]   That's a good point.
[00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:03.780]   Yeah, that's probably not the best way to do it.
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.780]   Well, please, everybody have Peppermint Bark Brownie.
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.820]   And we're going to take a break as we continue.
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:09.820]   Jolio Dell is here.
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.300]   Thank you so much for bringing baked goods.
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.540]   I know you were on a bake who's been flight caught after the buns episode.
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:17.180]   But thank you for forgetting that.
[00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:19.980]   You couldn't turn this into anything filthy.
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.860]   Did you actually just tell me the truth?
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:22.860]   Think about that before you decided.
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:23.860]   I did, yeah.
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:28.420]   My bunnies, Peppermint, you can't make any kind of-- I challenge you.
[00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:30.860]   My reputation precedes me.
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:31.620]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:36.620]   And I will not mock anything in any way, Mr. Lieutenant Barkley or anything like that.
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:39.020]   Also with this Patrick Norton, the sun Tristan.
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.620]   Nice to see you guys.
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:45.500]   I just want to know how that got on the front of the iTunes installation.
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:53.220]   Well, they said that the programmer put a dummy address, XXX, XXX, XXX, and thinking that that IP address, well, that doesn't go anywhere.
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.700]   But apparently it does.
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:55.300]   Whoops.
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.900]   He should have used N's.
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.860]   N's would have been better.
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:00.940]   And John C. Devorak.
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.540]   Channeldevorak.com.
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.500]   Host of No Agenda.
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:05.620]   Now twice a week.
[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:06.860]   Now twice weekly.
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.860]   He said the joke for me.
[00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.940]   I want to talk with you about Joshua Brantano in just a moment.
[00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:15.380]   Did you heard what the-- where G4-- well, let's talk about G4 when we come back.
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.380]   But I first I want to tell you about Stamps.com.
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:20.380]   This is a pro tip for people who do a lot of mailing.
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.380]   Don't go to the post office.
[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:24.380]   Mm, bad idea if you're trying to get stuff done.
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.380]   This is amateur months at the post office.
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:29.380]   When everybody goes in and gets stamps to their Christmas card,
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:33.380]   listing the lines, get along, people tell you, "How much is a stamp?"
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.380]   No.
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:35.380]   You're a pro mailer.
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:36.380]   You're sending out a lot of stuff.
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.380]   You're sending out invoices, bills.
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:40.380]   You're sending packages.
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.380]   You sell on eBay or Amazon.
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.380]   You don't need that.
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.380]   You don't need amateur hour.
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:44.380]   You need the pro tip.
[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.380]   And that is Stamps.com.
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:49.380]   It means you never again will go to the post office.
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:50.380]   You don't need it.
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:53.380]   At Stamps.com, you could print your own postage with your computer,
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:54.380]   your printer.
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:59.380]   It fills out all the forms for international express priority.
[00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.380]   It even sends out emails to the recipients with the tracking and all that.
[00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:06.380]   Automatically pulls the data from your address book, your QuickBooks,
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:10.380]   or if you're on Amazon, eBay, PayPal, Etsy, or for your seller on sites like that,
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:12.380]   it'll get it from there.
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:13.380]   Yeah.
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.380]   He wants us.
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:16.380]   No, you don't get to lick the stamps anymore.
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:21.380]   I'm sorry, Tristan, but the beauty of it is the mail carrier comes and takes it and
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:22.380]   you don't get up from your desk.
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.380]   It's all handled for you.
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:25.380]   Stamps.com.
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:28.380]   Now, we've got a special no risk trial offer for those of you who do use mail a lot.
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:30.380]   When you go to the front page, you'll see an $80 offer.
[00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:32.380]   Please don't take that.
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:35.380]   Even though you may say, "Boy, that's a sweet looking scale."
[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:36.380]   That's a sweet looking scale.
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:40.380]   I think that our scale, even though the picture is of an ugly or scale,
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.380]   I think we get the same scale.
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.380]   I'm sure we do.
[00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:44.580]   Get the radio microphone.
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:45.580]   Watch this.
[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:50.660]   Enter the offer code TWITTWIT, special offer for Stamps.com.
[00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:54.260]   And then that $80 offer turns into a $110 bonus offer.
[00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:58.660]   Yes, it looks like the clunky scale, but I just think they forgot to update that picture.
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:30:59.660]   I got to think that.
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:01.980]   You're going to get the beautiful Streamline new USB scale.
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:06.060]   That's very handy because you just plop the letter or the package on that and it tells
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.540]   you exactly how much postage.
[00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:10.580]   So you never pay more or less than you need.
[00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:12.980]   No more postage due, no more offer payment.
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.980]   You also get $55 and postage coupons.
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:17.620]   $55.
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:21.300]   You get a $5 supply kit and, of course, a four-week trial of Stamps.com.
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.500]   So please do that for me.
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.580]   Stamps.com, click the microphone, use the offer code TWITT.
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:30.660]   It really is the pro tip for people who do a lot of mailing.
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:31.900]   Stamps.com.
[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.700]   So G4.
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.500]   We knew that they were throwing in the towel.
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.780]   They killed the attack of the show.
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:38.780]   They killed X-Play.
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.540]   They've been firing people.
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:44.420]   And then we'd heard that they want to be the GQ of television networks.
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.020]   What does that even mean?
[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.020]   Well, that's what happened was.
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.020]   Literally the Esquirer.
[00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:49.460]   Yeah, well, they went to Conde Nast.
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:50.780]   They negotiated about GQ.
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.780]   But apparently, Hearst made them a better deal.
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:54.220]   They partnered with Hearst.
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:58.060]   It will be the Esquirer channel going forward.
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:00.100]   I mean, it's so funny.
[00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.260]   So it's a major spinning of--
[00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.780]   We don't want to knock that over.
[00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.940]   It's a major spinning of the network.
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:08.180]   They stopped renewing contracts for the talent.
[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:10.220]   I mean, Adam Sessler had been there forever.
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.420]   He's been a better part of 14 years.
[00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:13.220]   He's actually at Revision 3 now.
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:15.980]   Revision 3 is doing a gaming channel, which is great.
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:17.140]   Which, yeah, it's fun to watch.
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.940]   There's some really good people there.
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:20.940]   Yeah.
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:21.220]   It's all right.
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:22.100]   Don't worry about it.
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.380]   Sounds like you're doing Sessler in the channel.
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:27.220]   It's just like Adam Sessler.
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:29.700]   He's going to be crap about that.
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:33.620]   But what was funny is we got our former segment producer, who--
[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:36.380]   I get into the series producer position when it went to G4.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:37.220]   Joshua Brentano.
[00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:38.700]   Joshua Brentano.
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.260]   Brentano sent me an email.
[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:43.100]   And it was an interesting email because the--
[00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:46.020]   so the screen savers was shut down.
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:48.380]   Patrick and I did that show for six years on Tech TV,
[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:51.220]   98 to 2004 when G4 bought--
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:54.060]   when Comcast bought Tech TV and merged it with G4.
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.420]   They fired us because we were too old.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:57.260]   What?
[00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:57.700]   Yeah.
[00:32:57.700 --> 00:32:59.100]   You could have sued them.
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:00.700]   They didn't tell me out loud.
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:01.180]   Oh.
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:01.700]   But they did.
[00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:02.900]   You probably could have sued them.
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:06.420]   Well, I noticed that they only kept the people who were under 30.
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:07.260]   I'm not going to sue them.
[00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:08.220]   Why would I sue them?
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.220]   Money?
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:09.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.140]   There you go.
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:10.540]   There's a good reason.
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:11.540]   You start suing people.
[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:13.420]   And all of a sudden, you're suing people all the time.
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:13.920]   So what?
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:14.420]   It becomes a lifestyle.
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:15.300]   It's a nice living.
[00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:18.420]   You become known as the litigious Leo Laporte.
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:19.420]   As illiterate as that is.
[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:20.420]   Not a bad reputation.
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:21.020]   It's a good thing.
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.060]   You're leaving.
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.020]   What's your superpower?
[00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:26.060]   I litigate.
[00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.580]   So Patrick and I hit the road.
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:29.860]   You went to revision three.
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:31.580]   I started Twit.
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:33.900]   We continued to work together.
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:36.220]   And they went the gaming route.
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:37.980]   And they did the screen savers for walk.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.180]   Kevin stayed there.
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:41.140]   Kevin Rose stayed there with Sarah Lane.
[00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:42.140]   And they did the screen savers.
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:43.580]   But Kevin left early on.
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:44.340]   He was tired of that.
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:45.580]   He wanted to do his own thing.
[00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:47.420]   He wanted to be a billionaire.
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:50.380]   Sarah Lane and Kevin Pereira hosted the show.
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.260]   But they renamed it Attack of the Show.
[00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:53.460]   But it was the screen savers.
[00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:55.820]   It was kind of there's some continuity there, right?
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:56.900]   There's a certain vibe there.
[00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:58.540]   And Joshua still produces it.
[00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:00.780]   So Joshua said, hey, how would you guys
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:04.100]   like to close out the last episode of Attack of the Show?
[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:05.180]   And I'm like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:06.540]   He goes, no, seriously.
[00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:08.140]   Like as hosts of the screen savers.
[00:34:08.140 --> 00:34:08.340]   Yeah.
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:10.340]   Like we're sitting-- well, I don't want to--
[00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.620]   So this is how I want to do it.
[00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:13.420]   Yes, it was talked about the last show.
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.100]   Yeah, but Patrick's actually here now.
[00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:15.500]   Oh, OK.
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.140]   Now you can talk about him doing it.
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:18.340]   Well, no, and this was--
[00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:19.780]   Do you haven't talked to him about this?
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:21.020]   They haven't approached me yet.
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.540]   I'm waiting to hear from it.
[00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:24.020]   Actually, I said, do you want me to talk to you?
[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:24.740]   It's like, yes.
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:26.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.020]   So we want to do a New Heart thing, right?
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.780]   It was all a bad dream.
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:35.060]   Like the end of the New Heart Show, Bob looks at--
[00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:36.780]   what's Mrs. Newhart's name?
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:37.700]   Mrs. Newhart's good.
[00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:40.060]   So it's Ampli-Shett and says--
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:40.700]   Emily, it was--
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:41.180]   Emily.
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:42.660]   That was a terrible dream.
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:43.460]   You know how I know it was Emily?
[00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:44.860]   It was a drinking game.
[00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:47.780]   Every time you said Bob or Emily, you'd drink.
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:48.380]   And that was--
[00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:50.540]   Well, isn't that the end of Lost, too?
[00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:51.740]   I never watched two minutes of it,
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:52.500]   but it wasn't the end of the--
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:53.980]   It feels like it should have been.
[00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.740]   Like, oh, it was all a terrible dream,
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:56.580]   and we were really dead.
[00:34:56.580 --> 00:34:57.460]   It was in Dallas.
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.340]   Remember he was-- Bobby was in the shower?
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.540]   This is not the first time.
[00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:02.060]   Well, anyway, onward.
[00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:03.660]   So I think we should wake up in bed.
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:04.940]   Now they said a coffee shop, but I
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.580]   don't get why we would say what a bad dream.
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:09.740]   I think you and I should be in bed together.
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:10.660]   Very San Francisco.
[00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:11.180]   Yeah.
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:12.180]   Then we look up.
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:14.980]   And you say, god, I just had the worst dream.
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.300]   I said, me, too.
[00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.460]   Was it like there was some other show?
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:19.580]   And you go, yeah.
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:21.300]   And then Steve Porter, our floor director,
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.140]   goes, Patrick, Leo, in five, four.
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:25.860]   And then we simply have to green screen the set on.
[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:27.220]   We jump out of bed and we--
[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.820]   and I think that'd be very funny.
[00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:32.740]   And a nice way to go to G4, they'll never say yes to that.
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:33.460]   Of course not.
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:34.340]   You're insulting them.
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:35.700]   Kevin Roskovian's power.
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:37.300]   Hyper sensitive to these sorts of things.
[00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:37.860]   I agree.
[00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:38.460]   I don't think it'll--
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.700]   I think it's Joshua's idea.
[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:41.900]   I doubt it'll ever happen.
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:42.860]   It's been green less.
[00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:43.620]   You're kidding.
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:43.940]   No.
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:44.900]   Can we be in bed?
[00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:47.620]   They actually-- they're actually--
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:48.940]   can they get Bob Newhart?
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:49.620]   Not going to happen.
[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:50.220]   None of this.
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.060]   Why would they want Bob Newhart when they have Leo LaPour?
[00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:54.460]   I think it'd be funny.
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:56.780]   I think it'd be funny if after we do that, Bob says,
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:35:57.140]   wait a minute.
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:58.860]   That's my bit.
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.700]   I think that'd be funny.
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:01.700]   That would be funny.
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.620]   Nobody, by the way, watch G4 is going
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:05.100]   to get this at all.
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.660]   All they're going to go is Patrick and Leo in bed together.
[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:08.180]   Yeah.
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:09.020]   That's true.
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.300]   Or who are those guys?
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:10.740]   More like--
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:11.620]   That's more likely.
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:12.300]   Who are those guys?
[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:12.860]   And why are they in bed?
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:13.540]   Who are these two idiots?
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:13.660]   Who are these two idiots?
[00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:15.260]   Who are the bald guy and the guy with the badger on his head?
[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:18.740]   But you guys will get it.
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:20.380]   If Olivia Munn could be in bed with us,
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:21.420]   that would be different.
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:21.700]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:22.980]   That works so well with my wife.
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:24.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.020]   And Olivia--
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.180]   I don't think Kristen likes the idea either.
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:29.580]   Yeah.
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:31.740]   Put Kristen in the bed.
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:32.500]   Yeah, there's Jolie.
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:33.420]   Put Jolie in the bed.
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:34.740]   Anyway, we can all be in bed together.
[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:35.900]   How did I get involved in this?
[00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:36.980]   I have nothing to do with this.
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:37.700]   This is a mess.
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.420]   No, it's just this chat room suggestion.
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:41.100]   Life on Mars was a dream, too.
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:43.220]   I didn't see that show.
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:45.220]   It's an interesting idea.
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:45.580]   We'll see.
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.300]   Saying elsewhere ended with a dream sequence?
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:48.340]   Didn't it?
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:50.100]   Kidding me.
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.820]   That's going to bother me all night.
[00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:52.780]   I think it's a funny idea.
[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:54.300]   So they said yes.
[00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.620]   Like, the powers that be at G4 said yes.
[00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:57.980]   They must be pissed off.
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:58.980]   They must be pissed off.
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:36:59.620]   Who cares?
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.780]   They're actually willing to send up a producer and a crew.
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:02.500]   Deal.
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:03.180]   Can we be in bed?
[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.020]   I have a list of dates on my computer.
[00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:06.580]   I really want to be in bed with Patrick.
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:09.140]   Because you can't have a dream in a coffee shop.
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:11.700]   You can have a conversation about a dream in a coffee shop.
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:12.860]   That's a little-- I don't know.
[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:13.540]   I think you should just--
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:13.900]   No, that's lame.
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:15.420]   I don't think you just want to go all the way.
[00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:15.900]   You just want to cuddle.
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:16.820]   I think it'd be funny.
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:17.660]   We don't have to be cuddling.
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.060]   We could be lying looking at cuddles with Leo.
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:20.020]   You want to be cuddling.
[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:20.820]   You should cuddle Leo.
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:21.260]   You should cuddle Leo.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:22.660]   If you're going to be in bed, you got to cuddle.
[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.300]   I think spooning.
[00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:27.020]   Little spoon right here.
[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:28.060]   You think I'm the little spoon?
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:31.340]   You could be the little spoon, yeah.
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:33.380]   And now we're talking.
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:35.100]   Speaking of which, have you been-- have you purchased--
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:36.980]   No, can you hear the laughter, Leo?
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:39.860]   Yeah, I can hear the laughter in my head, not even here,
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:40.340]   apparently.
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:41.860]   OK.
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:42.740]   This is a good question.
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:46.780]   Speaking of spoons, there is one day left to buy the Twit Mugs.
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.620]   And I'm just wondering, because I have a thought about this.
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:50.900]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:54.180]   You just announced these mugs last show I was here.
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:54.700]   I noticed it.
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.900]   We decided to only have it available for a week.
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.420]   Because we want to have them in time for Christmas for people.
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:00.620]   Too late for Hanukkah already.
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:02.580]   But we want to at least get them for Christmas.
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.300]   So these are $20 for two mugs.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:05.500]   You can have two 16s.
[00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:09.540]   But do you like the mug with the spoon and the handle, Jolie?
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.100]   What?
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:12.900]   It's a spoon holder.
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:15.380]   But why would you want to carry the spoon around after you'd
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:16.620]   already stirred your beverage?
[00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:17.500]   I agree.
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:18.260]   I think it's for storage.
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:18.820]   But I think it's--
[00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:19.340]   Get away, man.
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.180]   --it also prevents you from holding the cup.
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:23.580]   We have to bring up another point.
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:23.940]   What?
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:28.460]   You made the point strongly that women like the spoon
[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:29.020]   and hold her.
[00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:30.020]   That's why I was doing a test.
[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:30.860]   I don't count, though.
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:31.860]   I'm more logical.
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:32.860]   I'm not a student.
[00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:36.220]   I was doing a test because we asked everybody in the studio,
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.900]   all our employees, and all the women loved the spoon cup.
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:41.660]   And the guys thought that's dumb.
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:43.500]   A cup is a perfect spoon holder.
[00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:45.020]   Is it a tiny spoon?
[00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:47.980]   Because if it's a tiny spoon, my entire theory on this
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:48.500]   has changed.
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:49.740]   It's a matching tiny spoon.
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.420]   Well, if it's really small, like the ones you get at the
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:56.380]   Japanese Yen 100 yen store, then that is amazing.
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:57.020]   And I want to.
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.780]   It doesn't look that tiny to me.
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:38:59.300]   Shh.
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.300]   Shh.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.300]   I can't.
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:02.300]   It's the size of the cup.
[00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:03.300]   It's actually taller.
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:04.300]   It's a small cup.
[00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:05.300]   Here comes-- here we come.
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:06.940]   Here we come with a demo.
[00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.580]   Is that tiny enough for you?
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:09.580]   No.
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:10.580]   That's not the last--
[00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:11.580]   That looks like a Chinese--
[00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:12.580]   So here's the problem.
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:13.580]   You can't--
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:14.580]   You can't see it.
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:15.740]   The spoon, you can't pick up the mug.
[00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.860]   It is a design flaw.
[00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.940]   No, but apparently some people love it.
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:20.940]   Nobody loves it.
[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:21.940]   Who?
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:25.300]   See, to me, you've already got a spoon holder.
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.300]   It's called the mug.
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:27.940]   It goes-- it fits perfectly.
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:28.940]   And you can still drink.
[00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:29.940]   And then--
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:30.940]   But here, you put this in.
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:35.980]   And then the spoon hits you and it's dripping tea and coffee all down it.
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:36.980]   Yeah.
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:37.980]   No, it's for storage.
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:39.340]   I think it's for putting on the shelf.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:41.100]   Because the spoon matches, see.
[00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:42.100]   It's idiotic.
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:44.980]   And then you could break the spoon because it's also ceramic, right?
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:45.980]   Yes, dumb.
[00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:46.980]   OK.
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:48.980]   So you don't have to buy the spoon mug, but you could get two, 16-spugs.
[00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:49.980]   I have the other mug, y'all.
[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:51.420]   But you get two mugs for 20 bucks.
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:53.380]   You get your choice, mix and match.
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:58.020]   And this is your last chance because it goes off sale in one day and two hours.
[00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:04.860]   And if you're listening to this tomorrow-- I'm sorry-- T-spring, T-double-e-spring.com/twitmugs.
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:05.860]   We have already sold.
[00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:11.060]   Get this 1,481 sets at 20 bucks per.
[00:40:11.060 --> 00:40:13.780]   Am I-- you know where I learned this from?
[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:14.780]   You.
[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:15.780]   No agenda.
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:16.780]   You didn't learn that from me.
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:17.780]   You're better than I am.
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:18.780]   Good at marketing, dude.
[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:19.940]   You get people to pay.
[00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:21.540]   How much is it to be a producer?
[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:23.220]   A gold level producer.
[00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.220]   $333 minimum.
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:25.220]   And what do you get?
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:26.220]   You're an idiot.
[00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:31.260]   You get a title as a producer of the show and you can use it on your stationery.
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:35.220]   You can put it on your IMDB.
[00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:36.220]   Moving along.
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.860]   The Daily is dead.
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:39.980]   Long live the Daily.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:41.980]   Rupert Murdoch remembers-- Oh, this is hilarious.
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:42.980]   Yeah, Rupert Murdoch.
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.620]   This thing was a turkey from the get-go.
[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:45.620]   It really was.
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:46.620]   And nobody subscribed.
[00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:48.780]   They said they got 100,000 subscribers.
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:49.780]   Do you believe that?
[00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:50.780]   I think it's a lie.
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:55.660]   This was an iPad-only daily newspaper that Rupert Murdoch created.
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:58.580]   He hired 100 people for the newsroom.
[00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:00.380]   Their burn rate was huge.
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:05.660]   They estimated that they'd have to get half a million subscribers just to break even.
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:06.820]   They never got more than 100,000.
[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:07.820]   I find it hard to believe on.
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:08.820]   I find it hard to believe on.
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:09.820]   I find it hard to believe on.
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:10.820]   I find it hard to believe on.
[00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:11.820]   I find it hard to believe on.
[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:12.820]   Because that is ridiculous.
[00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:13.820]   Yes.
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:17.860]   As somebody who has been doing digital journalism for low these many years, you got 100 people,
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:22.440]   you better be cranking out the equivalent of several daily newspapers worth of content.
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:24.300]   How many people are at VentureBeat?
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.300]   In our newsroom?
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:26.300]   I don't know.
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:27.900]   But we're scattered all over the country.
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.740]   It's not more than a dozen.
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:31.980]   It might be a little bit more than a dozen now.
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:32.980]   We've been hiring a lot.
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:33.980]   But no.
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:34.980]   Mashable.
[00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:35.980]   How many people were at MasterBeat?
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:38.260]   When I was there, I don't think we had more than 50.
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:41.500]   And we were already putting out so much content.
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.020]   Much more than a daily newspaper.
[00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:45.020]   That's the irony.
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:46.060]   I mean, this didn't even ship.
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:47.620]   This didn't have updates all the time.
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:48.620]   I know.
[00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:49.620]   That's the day.
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:50.620]   It was a giant download.
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:51.620]   Hey, welcome to the 21st century.
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:53.300]   We're not going to update every five minutes.
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:59.660]   The Atlantic, interestingly enough, had a very insightful piece on why the daily didn't work
[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:00.660]   and it involved.
[00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:05.140]   If you're going to put things behind a paywall and people can't share them because it's all
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:06.140]   stuck in this thing path.
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:07.900]   That was my problem with it.
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:08.900]   The way--
[00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:09.900]   Sharing content is the way--
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:10.900]   Yes, it's huge.
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:13.780]   I mean, if you know anything about digital publishing, sharing content is the only way
[00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:18.980]   you're going to survive to get enough eyeballs to sell enough ads to make your big turkey
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:21.020]   sale the seas of, you know--
[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:22.780]   Does anybody know what this description rate was for that?
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:23.780]   That was the price?
[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:26.580]   It was 99 cents a week.
[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:27.580]   So it was cheap.
[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:28.580]   About $50 a year.
[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:29.580]   $42 a year.
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:30.580]   That would work.
[00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:35.420]   That would have worked, actually, you know, where that would work really, really well.
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:36.420]   Asia.
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:40.060]   In Japan and in China, people are really, really used to paying small amounts of money on a
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:44.980]   regular basis for new content, guess where people are not used to that.
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.140]   You're America.
[00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:48.140]   So of course, it wasn't going to work here.
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.140]   Also--
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.140]   Also from that Atlantic article.
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:51.140]   On the iPad.
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:52.140]   And that's not great.
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:53.140]   This is why they did it.
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:57.140]   If you look at this graph from the Atlantic article, this is where you spend your attention
[00:42:57.140 --> 00:42:59.060]   to blue places where you spend your attention.
[00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:01.220]   7% print.
[00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:05.500]   But this is where at advertising dollars, 25% advertising dollars.
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:08.980]   Internet 26% of your time, but only 22% of the advertising dollars.
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:13.980]   And mobile, which is where the daily was aimed, 10% of your time, 1% of the ad dollars.
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:14.980]   Yikes.
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:17.980]   There's a problem.
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:22.940]   The second error he says, and by the way, this is Derek Thompson writing, says the second
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:24.580]   error is subtle.
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:28.300]   The daily doubled down on the mobile trend of the expense of the sharing trend, as you
[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:29.300]   said.
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.500]   The social web is on the web.
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:32.500]   The daily isn't.
[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:33.740]   That was my big problem.
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:36.660]   Well, that's funny because this book disagrees with this.
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:38.100]   Social media, you find that book.
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:40.020]   I'm going to interview that guy.
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:41.020]   Social media is BS.
[00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:42.020]   I can't even--
[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:43.020]   That guy pitched us.
[00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:50.860]   He's kind of in the Andrew King vein.
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:53.220]   I can't say it on the air, but you can watch it.
[00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:56.100]   You can see the word.
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:58.460]   I wonder if his mother knows.
[00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:00.100]   So anyways.
[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:01.420]   It was also very expensive.
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:02.980]   I mean, the economic--
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:03.980]   It was $2199.
[00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:04.980]   It wasn't that high.
[00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:08.460]   Not the book, the daily.
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:12.300]   I don't see any way for them to get half a million subscribers.
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:13.300]   All right.
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:14.300]   Anyway.
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.300]   It's a great idea.
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:19.580]   And media types love to criticize when, oh, they didn't do well.
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:20.580]   They failed.
[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:22.620]   And we all love to say, I told you so.
[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:27.820]   But I mean, really, who's figured how to do tablet content well and profitably?
[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:29.540]   Like, Flipboard does it well.
[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:30.540]   But do they make money?
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:34.580]   You know, when I was talking to them the other day, they're trying to find really great,
[00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:36.060]   interesting ways to make money.
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:37.420]   And it's not really around content.
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:38.420]   It's around products.
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:42.140]   And all the other Flipboard-like products that are coming out, they're like, OK,
[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:44.580]   OK, how can we bring retailers in?
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.060]   Because we need a way to subsidize all this content.
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:49.740]   But subsidizing content has always been a problem with media.
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:52.140]   That's why we have a news hole and then advertisers.
[00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:53.140]   I'm going off.
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:56.060]   It's interesting that you should mention Flipboard because almost invariably when I say the daily
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.860]   fail, people said, yeah, Flipboard killed it.
[00:44:57.860 --> 00:44:59.540]   It's free.
[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:00.820]   It's a much more varied source.
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:01.820]   And it has sharing.
[00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:02.900]   And it, by the way, looks better.
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.420]   And it works.
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:07.100]   John Gruber said the daily failed simply because it was a lousy app.
[00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:08.820]   It took forever to download each episode.
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:09.820]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:13.300]   And it certainly had to download the entire thing just to read one little article.
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:14.300]   Yeah.
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.300]   That's so good.
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:16.300]   Flipboard is always up to date.
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:17.300]   It takes no time to download.
[00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:23.180]   I think the idea of it is rather charming that remember when the newspaper was the cool
[00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:26.580]   thing and you could sit down with the Washington Post or the New York Times or whatever.
[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:32.100]   And you could drink your coffee and spoon with your man friend and, you know, get the
[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:36.980]   news of the day in a relaxed environment where it's not all coming at you every 30 minutes.
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:40.540]   And distracting you from your day's work when you could sit down with the newspaper.
[00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:42.100]   You can still do that if you want to.
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.340]   I sit down with Flipboard, but it's not as aesthetic.
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:46.500]   I have the New York Times subscription.
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:47.500]   I do that.
[00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:48.500]   No, I do.
[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:49.500]   And I get it.
[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:50.500]   And here's the problem.
[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:51.500]   For one thing, it piles up.
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:54.500]   If you have guilty about all the papers and you only read about one or two a week.
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:57.340]   And you can't use your iPad as kindling no matter what you could.
[00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:58.340]   No, you can use this.
[00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:01.820]   You can soak at these New York Times and kerosene and they're pretty good to start a
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:03.380]   fire, but that's about it.
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:07.100]   On the other hand, if you look at Flipboard, the signal noise ratio is not as good as say
[00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:10.020]   something like a curated newspaper or magazine or the daily.
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:12.020]   Well, have you seen a circa?
[00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:13.020]   What's circa?
[00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.020]   Oh, you guys.
[00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.020]   Can I see this?
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:16.020]   You guys and you think you know your new media.
[00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:17.020]   All right.
[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:18.020]   So Matt Galligan.
[00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:19.020]   We never said that.
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:23.500]   Matt Galligan is this nifty startup guy originally from the Boulder scene.
[00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:26.820]   And he came back and he was like, yeah, Flipboard is really cool, but we need curation.
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:32.140]   So I'm going to hire all these editors who are smart and who have great sources to go
[00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:36.100]   around and find the best, most interesting news and then we're going to categorize it
[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:37.100]   and whatever.
[00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:43.380]   And it's kind of a very edited, you know, best of the web version of Flipboard where
[00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:44.980]   it's not just robots.
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:46.900]   It's also smart people.
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:47.900]   You know, one of the ways--
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.900]   And I think curation is one of the best things about the modern--
[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:50.900]   Absolutely.
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:54.300]   And one of the ways I try to make Flipboard be more curated is by the Twitter list that
[00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.660]   I follow and stuff, but there's still a lot of junk in there.
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:47:01.820]   Unfortunately, circa is iPhone only, so I won't be able to put it on my Galaxy Note.
[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:03.060]   How do you like that note?
[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:04.500]   This phone is dynamite.
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:05.500]   I love it.
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:06.700]   Selling like hotcakes, by the way.
[00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:07.900]   Yeah, I know, I know.
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:08.900]   So what's this?
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:09.900]   Can you guys for that?
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.900]   That's the Samsung official Samsung case.
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:13.900]   There's an official case?
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:14.900]   Well, that's the one that--
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:15.900]   It comes with it.
[00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:16.900]   Yeah, it comes with it.
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:17.900]   Oh, you had to buy this.
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:18.900]   It's you buy it.
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:19.900]   And then you slip it behind the thingy.
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:23.820]   It's because it has a removable back cover, so you can change the battery, nice feature.
[00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:26.940]   By the way, I understand you're going to stop doing that.
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:27.940]   Some phones are doing it.
[00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:29.580]   The new HTC 8X does not.
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:30.580]   The Lumia does not.
[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:31.580]   I think that's a mistake.
[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:35.740]   I'm telling that menacingly, John.
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:37.260]   I think that's a nice cover.
[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:38.260]   Don't you think it's a very elegant--
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:41.620]   Yeah, so the problem is that when you flip it around, like just to actually talk on the
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:43.060]   phone is kind of funny feeling.
[00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:46.420]   You know, so funny, I realized one of the reasons I like the Galaxy Note 2 is because
[00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:47.420]   I don't use it as a phone.
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:48.660]   It's a computer for me.
[00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:51.340]   I very rarely-- if I do talk on the phone, it'll be Bluetooth or--
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:52.340]   Hello, mom.
[00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:54.340]   Yeah, I don't do that.
[00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:56.100]   I don't make it-- well, you don't even have a cell phone.
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:57.100]   No, I have one now.
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:58.100]   You do?
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:47:59.100]   Yeah, I got it because--
[00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:00.100]   People mock you.
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:01.500]   My husband kept getting mad at me.
[00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:04.660]   Oh, no, it's because I got the dog and I wanted to take pictures of him when I was
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:05.660]   out.
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:06.660]   That's the reason most people get phones.
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:07.660]   Yeah, for their children or their--
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:08.900]   So you're not using it on a phone either?
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:12.060]   You're using it as a camera and so Aaron can reach you whenever he needs to.
[00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:13.060]   Really?
[00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:14.060]   Yeah, those two reasons.
[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:15.060]   What did you end up getting?
[00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:18.460]   I just used the one that I found at Google I/O last year.
[00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:19.460]   I'm sure that--
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:20.460]   It's an exes.
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:22.180]   Yeah, well, I have to give it back.
[00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:24.380]   But I just found it because it was sitting in a drawer--
[00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:25.380]   I just find it.
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:26.380]   --a newsroom.
[00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:30.060]   We have a drawer in the newsroom full of devices and there was the Lumia that was in there.
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:33.300]   And we've got a really old Nokia candy bar.
[00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:35.260]   And I have an old blackberry in there too.
[00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:37.380]   The newsroom drawer of dead devices.
[00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:38.380]   It's a whole thing.
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:42.620]   So I pulled the Lumia out and I was going to use that because I thought, oh, Windows
[00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:43.620]   is dead.
[00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:44.620]   It's the Google phones.
[00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:45.620]   Yeah.
[00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:46.620]   Well, the Lumia one had a battery to shoot.
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:49.700]   Remember where they would power down all the way and then you couldn't get them back
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:50.700]   on again?
[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:51.700]   The Lumia button.
[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:52.700]   Oh, I heard about this.
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:54.700]   If one all the way dead, you can never--
[00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:55.700]   It happened.
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.220]   It happened to me.
[00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:59.940]   And then I was like, oh, you know, I'm a technologist.
[00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:01.740]   I have a neck beard husband.
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:03.740]   We can get around this, right?
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:05.740]   Aaron's going, look at he's going.
[00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:06.740]   What are you talking about?
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:07.740]   Hell?
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:08.740]   Throw it beard.
[00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:09.740]   What do you mean?
[00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:10.740]   No, he actually shaves his hand.
[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:13.940]   And by the way, this poor guy is an honorific.
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:16.060]   Who's lucky to be married to her.
[00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:17.060]   Yes.
[00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:18.540]   But he does the dishes.
[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:20.540]   Well, I would too if I were married to Jolie.
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:21.540]   Look at this.
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:22.540]   I would do anything she wanted to.
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:23.540]   I put every day.
[00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:24.540]   Right.
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:25.540]   You cook, he cleans.
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:26.740]   It's fair.
[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:27.740]   That's fair.
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:28.740]   He cooks.
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:30.740]   He cooks, doesn't have to do the dishes.
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:31.740]   Sometimes he's doing it.
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:32.740]   Sometimes he's doing it.
[00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:34.540]   That's always been my theory.
[00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:35.540]   Do you like Google now?
[00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:37.540]   Do you have the Google now thing?
[00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:38.540]   Do you like this Google now?
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:39.540]   I do like Google now.
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:40.540]   Yeah, so--
[00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:41.540]   What?
[00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:43.540]   Is it Google now a thing or is this just-- do you like Google?
[00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:44.540]   No, it's a thing called Google.
[00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:47.140]   Yeah, because it tells me how far away I'm from home.
[00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:48.140]   Pretty sure, Joe.
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:49.140]   How long is it going to take me to get home?
[00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:51.540]   Oh, my gosh, John, the robots have taken me to--
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:53.540]   Yes, it's very much like that where Google knows--
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:54.540]   No, it doesn't.
[00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:55.540]   --based on what you search for.
[00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:58.540]   It tells me the football score that I didn't even know I needed to know.
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:00.540]   But you didn't need to know it.
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:02.540]   Apparently, but now I found out they did need to know it.
[00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:06.540]   So it puts up cards of things like I know the Niners are winning in the last two minutes.
[00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:07.540]   It was a short ball.
[00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:08.540]   It was 27-13.
[00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:10.540]   Because it knows I want to know about the Niners.
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:11.540]   That was six years terrible.
[00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:12.540]   I know.
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:13.540]   You can customate it.
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:14.540]   You can customate it.
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:18.540]   Here's packages that were shipped, which is great so you can see--
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:20.540]   Well, I don't have that card.
[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:21.540]   That's a nice card.
[00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:22.540]   What's it called?
[00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:23.540]   I don't know.
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:24.540]   I didn't add it.
[00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:25.540]   It just adds its own taste.
[00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:27.540]   Yeah, because it goes through my mail just to see.
[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:32.540]   It goes through your mail, checks all your searches.
[00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:33.540]   Here's my favorite one.
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:35.540]   This really annoy you.
[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:39.540]   You say, "I think I'm going to go to some place in Modesto."
[00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:43.540]   And you look it up at home on your big machine or your laptop, whatever.
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:46.540]   Just to see how far it is, if it's going to take you forever.
[00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:48.540]   So you say, "Okay, I'm going to go tomorrow."
[00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:53.540]   The next day when you boot up your phone, the phone has the directions already for you.
[00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:54.540]   That's amazing.
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:58.540]   You're going to go to this place assuming that you are going to go there.
[00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:00.540]   Amazing is one word for it.
[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:01.540]   It's creepy.
[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:02.540]   It's not creepy.
[00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:03.540]   It's so creepy.
[00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:04.540]   Why is it creepy?
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:06.540]   Because they're selling that adum-dom.
[00:51:06.540 --> 00:51:07.540]   To whom?
[00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:08.540]   Who cares?
[00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:11.540]   Who is buying that I like the 49ers?
[00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:16.540]   Ads of restaurants or the Starbucks in Modesto, like wherever you are.
[00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:17.540]   There's no ads in here.
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:18.540]   Anytime, well, there's going to be--
[00:51:18.540 --> 00:51:20.540]   What about when you go to Google search from that phone?
[00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:22.540]   It's going to show you relevant.
[00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:23.540]   Come on.
[00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:25.540]   It's going to show me ads no matter what, right?
[00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:26.540]   Yeah.
[00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:29.540]   Shouldn't I see ads that are more germane to what I care about?
[00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:31.540]   No, I disagree with that thesis.
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:32.540]   But I don't think--
[00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:33.540]   Something wrong with it.
[00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:34.540]   I'm going to see the ads whether they're germane.
[00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:36.540]   I think that's the real point.
[00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:39.540]   You're going to see ads whether you like it or not, whether germane or not.
[00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:40.540]   You're going to be stuck to the ads.
[00:51:40.540 --> 00:51:42.540]   Somebody's going to pay for it.
[00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:45.540]   And they're going to violate your privacy as much as they can.
[00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:46.540]   It's not violating my privacy.
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:47.540]   Oh, yeah, it is.
[00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:50.540]   If I was in a sassan and I could get the access to the--
[00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:52.540]   Nobody's lying to a sassan.
[00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:53.540]   It's right.
[00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:54.540]   Assassans.
[00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:56.540]   You have to consider these people.
[00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:59.540]   You know, if you're using a cell phone and you're using the internet, forget it.
[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:00.540]   You should be using a set phone.
[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:04.540]   If you don't-- if you don't-- if you use credit cards, if you use all of these things,
[00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:06.540]   assassins are following you anyway.
[00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.540]   I keep my trash and it's in full packet under my mouth.
[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:09.540]   That's the only choice.
[00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:10.540]   And your mama told me.
[00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:13.540]   So you might as well enjoy it because you're going down anyway.
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:16.540]   So at least I'll have directions to the nearest Applebee's.
[00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:17.540]   And that's--
[00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:19.540]   We won't need that.
[00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:22.540]   We won't need an assassin if you go to those places.
[00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:24.540]   When we were-- believe it or not, I was in Australia.
[00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:29.540]   And it's noted how I was moving around and said, "It'll be five minutes to a year.
[00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:30.540]   The traffic's light."
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:31.540]   Here's the thing that bothers me.
[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:34.540]   It's not that the assassins are all this other stuff.
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:37.540]   It's that at some point, the insurance companies get ahold of all this stuff.
[00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:39.540]   And it's like the black box is going in the car.
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:40.540]   And I mean, what--
[00:52:40.540 --> 00:52:43.540]   They're going to be giving you speeding tickets based on this data.
[00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:46.540]   You're going to be-- it's going to be a bunch of crap that you're going to have to pay the government.
[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:48.540]   This is all part of a scheme to get your money.
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:53.540]   On a simpler level, it takes all the joy and mystery out of life.
[00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:55.540]   I don't want to know if it's going to take five minutes.
[00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:56.540]   I'll get there when I get there.
[00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:57.540]   I don't want to know.
[00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:58.540]   I want the joy and mystery of traffic jams.
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:00.540]   If Starbucks has a sale, I want to know what it's going on.
[00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:02.540]   What are you not the joy and mystery of traffic jams?
[00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:04.540]   See, I know that it's person Tony's birthday.
[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:06.540]   The joy was something else.
[00:53:06.540 --> 00:53:07.540]   The mystery was how long it's been.
[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:11.540]   And then if I don't-- if I'm done, I swipe it off and it removes it.
[00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:12.540]   Okay.
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:13.540]   Okay, I saw that package.
[00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:14.540]   I saw that package.
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:15.540]   Oh, my-- oh, that's good.
[00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:18.540]   My double barrel marshmallow shooter is arriving soon.
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:19.540]   Oh, cool.
[00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:20.540]   That's great.
[00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:21.540]   The marshmallow is white that off.
[00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:22.540]   Yeah.
[00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:23.540]   And you can--
[00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:26.540]   And see, look, and there it shows you the weather, which is all a lie.
[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:28.540]   Anyhow, meteorology is as bad as a life.
[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:29.540]   I could say--
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:30.540]   As bad as a life.
[00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:33.540]   --card appears, I could say how often always in the morning or in the evening.
[00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:35.540]   John, John didn't pick up on that.
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:36.540]   I can say--
[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:37.540]   No, I missed that.
[00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:40.540]   I could say it's a time on the fourth day watching at a time when I'm there.
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:42.540]   Where I am for upcoming trips.
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:46.540]   I could say-- and then is there a notification or not?
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:47.540]   This is all.
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:48.540]   When do you get to stop thinking?
[00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:50.540]   When is this device thinking for you?
[00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:52.540]   Well, and that's, I think, a reasonable goal.
[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:55.540]   Is it if I should know what I want ahead of time and tell me what I need to know?
[00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:58.540]   Yeah, and then tell you how to vote and tell you what to buy and where to go.
[00:53:58.540 --> 00:53:59.540]   What if you didn't ask me?
[00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:00.540]   I can tell you how to vote.
[00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:02.540]   If it does, I will ignore it.
[00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:03.540]   So you're not the apocalypse.
[00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:04.540]   Not if it tells you--
[00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:05.540]   How are you going to make your way to the public?
[00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:06.540]   I'm going to need another brownie.
[00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:08.540]   You don't make your vote the way you're already about people.
[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:10.540]   So it's a nervous Nellies.
[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:12.540]   So anyway, it's coming to Chrome.
[00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:13.540]   It's coming to Chrome.
[00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:14.540]   Oh, it's coming to Chrome.
[00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:15.540]   It's going to be in Chrome.
[00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:16.540]   Thank you.
[00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:21.540]   It looks like Chrome users, not just Android users, will get access to Google now, according
[00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:23.540]   to Stephen Shanklin writing for CNET.
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:27.540]   The Search Giants technology for bringing weather reports, trip departure reminders, birthday alerts,
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:30.540]   nearby restaurant reviews, and more to Android users.
[00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:32.540]   Google Chrome has added a skeleton for now.
[00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:34.540]   So here's the problem I have with it.
[00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:37.540]   So we were driving around the middle of nowhere.
[00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:39.540]   And I booted this thing.
[00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:42.540]   It was in the southern part of Washington state.
[00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:47.540]   And so I booted this thing, and it started giving me recommendations for nearby restaurants
[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:48.540]   and what I should go check out.
[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:49.540]   That's probably an ad, right?
[00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:51.540]   No, no, there's a whole slew of them.
[00:54:51.540 --> 00:54:52.540]   No, they were all in the area.
[00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:53.540]   That's a lot of us.
[00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:54.540]   It was pretty good.
[00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:55.540]   No, it's smart.
[00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:56.540]   It does a good job.
[00:54:56.540 --> 00:54:57.540]   Yeah, it does a good job.
[00:54:57.540 --> 00:55:02.540]   But these restaurants, because you could cross-reference them to Yelp, these were places you would never want to go to in a million years.
[00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:03.540]   But you knew that.
[00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:04.540]   Well, that's--
[00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:05.540]   Does it cross-reference them to Yelp?
[00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:06.540]   Yeah.
[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:07.540]   Sorry, I'm eating much.
[00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:08.540]   Yeah, I'm noticing that this is a very--
[00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:14.540]   How long before Google-- how long before Google allows me to opt out of having the suggestions in maps?
[00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:15.540]   Oh, you can opt out now.
[00:55:15.540 --> 00:55:16.540]   Yeah, you can opt out.
[00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:18.540]   You don't have to have this stuff running.
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:23.540]   Just use a feature phone and ask for directions from the creepy guy at the gas station man.
[00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:24.540]   So, um--
[00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:28.540]   You'll be living near when you're raising your children in the mountains.
[00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:29.540]   You're right up in the mountains.
[00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:30.540]   No teeth.
[00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:31.540]   No need.
[00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:32.540]   I do have to say.
[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:34.540]   Now, I don't-- people are going to say, "Oh, you're a Google fan boy."
[00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:36.540]   You're not a Google fan boy.
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:37.540]   I'm not.
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:38.540]   You're pretty neutral.
[00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:39.540]   I can be critical.
[00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:43.540]   You go from device to device to device-- you know what you are if anything else is fickle.
[00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:44.540]   I may be fickle.
[00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:45.540]   Yeah, you're very fickle.
[00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:47.540]   But I think the Google now is useful.
[00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:51.540]   And I have to say, for a long time, I've been saying Google plus, they blew it.
[00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:52.540]   It's dead.
[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:53.540]   Nobody's using it.
[00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:55.540]   They just had a feature that may completely bring it back to life.
[00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:56.540]   Tell me.
[00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:57.540]   Communities thing.
[00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:58.540]   Yeah.
[00:55:58.540 --> 00:55:59.540]   Let's take a break and we'll talk about communities when we come back.
[00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:02.540]   Also, why Vic Gundotra is no longer allowed to tweet.
[00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:05.540]   How about that for a tease?
[00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:10.540]   But first, a word from our friends at Citrix do-- in business, you probably have meetings,
[00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:11.540]   don't you?
[00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:12.540]   You got it.
[00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:13.540]   Everybody does.
[00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:14.540]   They're kind of the thing people don't like.
[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:18.540]   But if you're going to have meetings, I can tell you, they're much more compelling, much more
[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:19.540]   interesting when you use Go to Meeting.
[00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:21.540]   First of all, you get screen sharing.
[00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:23.540]   So you can see-- you can all be on the same page literally.
[00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:28.540]   You can see what the other person in the meeting wants to show you whether it is, you know,
[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:32.540]   PowerPoint presentation, drawings, documents you're collaborating on.
[00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:33.540]   It's great for training.
[00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:37.540]   But you can also see them with this new HD faces, which I really, really like.
[00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:40.540]   It makes meetings much more personal.
[00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:46.540]   Go to Meeting is easy to set up, easy to use, works across all platforms.
[00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:50.540]   Back PC, you can attend meetings on an iPhone, an iPad, an Android device.
[00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:53.540]   You can even present and share from an iPad.
[00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:57.540]   In fact, if you have an iPad, it'll use the camera on the iPad, the microphone on the iPad,
[00:56:57.540 --> 00:56:59.540]   the microphone on the iPad, you can turn the audio off.
[00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:00.540]   I don't need that.
[00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:05.540]   The microphone on the iPad, the earphones on the iPad, and you can have a meeting in the park.
[00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:10.540]   It really gives you the flexibility to go where you want, do what you want, and still
[00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:13.540]   participate in company meetings and so forth.
[00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:17.540]   If you do use meetings in business and, you know, I thought we could get away with it.
[00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:18.540]   You know how much I hated meetings.
[00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:23.540]   I would go to the ScreenSavers editorial meetings every day and I just hated it.
[00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:25.540]   No, you're just sitting in the corner, certainly.
[00:57:25.540 --> 00:57:27.540]   I'm playing Tetris and grumpy.
[00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:31.540]   Go to meeting means that even though you've got to have meetings, I thought we could get
[00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:33.540]   right over them in the in the in the Twit.
[00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:37.540]   No, you have to have meetings, so we still have them, but it makes them a whole lot easier,
[00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:40.540]   a lot more fun, more engaging, and more efficient and effective too.
[00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:41.540]   I want you to try it free.
[00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:45.540]   If you visit go to meeting.com, here's what you do.
[00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:49.540]   You click the try it free button and use the promo code TWIT and you can have 30 days free.
[00:57:49.540 --> 00:57:52.540]   The apps are free on all the devices.
[00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:56.540]   Throw some meetings and I think you will see they really are much better now.
[00:57:56.540 --> 00:58:00.540]   I want to give you if you don't, this is a nice opportunity to win an iPad, so you can
[00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:02.540]   try go to meeting on your iPad.
[00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:06.540]   Where in the world, this is, we're going to ask you to tweet this, okay?
[00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:07.540]   So make a note of this.
[00:58:07.540 --> 00:58:10.540]   We're going to do a random drawing of all the people who tweet.
[00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:13.540]   Where in the world would you meet from?
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:15.540]   Think about this, Patrick.
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:16.540]   I'm thinking.
[00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:19.540]   And why this holiday season if you had go to meeting on the iPad?
[00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:26.820]   If you share your story on Twitter using the hashtag #twitfree iPad, that's #twitfree
[00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:29.540]   iPad, we'll collate all of the tweets.
[00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:32.540]   We won't base it on the quality of the tweet.
[00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:35.540]   But we will be reading your tweet on the air if you win.
[00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:39.540]   And then I think next week we will announce the winner will pick randomly from all of the
[00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:40.540]   tweets we get.
[00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:43.540]   US only, I'm sorry to say that's...
[00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:44.540]   Don't blame us.
[00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:47.540]   Blame your local authorities.
[00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:48.540]   I'm afraid it's not our fault.
[00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:50.540]   Blame the United Nations.
[00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:54.540]   The laws are so complicated that we can't, you know.
[00:58:54.540 --> 00:59:00.540]   Go to meeting.com, click the try-free button, use a promo code tweet and if you would like
[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:02.540]   to win a free iPad, tweet.
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:05.540]   Where in the world you would meet from?
[00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:06.540]   Paris.
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:07.540]   Yeah.
[00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:08.540]   It's funny that you should say it.
[00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:09.540]   Probably Saul.
[00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:10.540]   Provence.
[00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:11.540]   Provence.
[00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:13.540]   And why this holiday season and who?
[00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:14.540]   The food.
[00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:17.540]   The family or my wife will kill me.
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:18.540]   We're here.
[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:21.540]   Don't you wish you were.
[00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:22.540]   So that's it.
[00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:26.540]   And then you used to add Twitter free iPad and your good hashtag Twitter free iPad.
[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:27.540]   Good luck.
[00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:28.540]   We'll announce the winner.
[00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:30.540]   I think we'll announce it next week, chat, or two weeks.
[00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:31.540]   Do we know?
[00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:32.540]   I'm unsure.
[00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:33.540]   Sometime.
[00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:34.540]   It doesn't say in here.
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:36.540]   All the rules are online though.
[00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:37.540]   Somewhere.
[00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:41.540]   I think it's on the inside to a blog, right?
[00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:43.540]   We obviously didn't read the rules, but you can.
[00:59:43.540 --> 00:59:44.540]   Yeah.
[00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:45.540]   I don't need to.
[00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:47.540]   I can't win.
[00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:50.540]   So I don't have to read the rules.
[00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:51.540]   What was I?
[00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:53.540]   We were going to talk about a couple of things.
[00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:54.540]   Oh, communities.
[00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:55.540]   I love communities.
[00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:56.540]   Now, what do you think of communities?
[00:59:56.540 --> 01:00:01.540]   I think this is actually going to revitalize Google+.
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:06.540]   Because, so for instance, I joined an espresso community, Mark Prince of CoffeeGeek.com.
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:08.540]   Has an espresso community.
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:11.540]   And what you do is it's kind of like Google groups, except it's because it's Google+.
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:13.540]   It's much more feature rich.
[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:15.540]   You create discussions.
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:18.540]   He has one on photos of espresso.
[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:19.540]   Can you put it on the screen?
[01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:20.540]   Yeah.
[01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:21.540]   Can you put it on the screen?
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:22.540]   It's beautiful.
[01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:25.540]   How is this any different from Facebook groups which went so well?
[01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:26.540]   Yeah.
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.540]   I don't know why Facebook groups didn't take off.
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:28.540]   I think I have to say...
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:29.540]   Right.
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:30.540]   So if Facebook...
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:31.540]   Plus it looks like a Tumblr blog.
[01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:32.540]   Well, no, that's just...
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:36.540]   If Facebook couldn't do it, how is Google, which is much less adapted?
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.540]   Social technology is going to be able to do it.
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:42.540]   Because I think the software on this is far improved.
[01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:44.540]   It integrates with events and hangouts.
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:45.540]   I just think it's much...
[01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:48.540]   Hangouts is the one thing Google+ has going for.
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:49.540]   Pretty good.
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:50.540]   And events is pretty good.
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:51.540]   What do you like about hangouts?
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:53.540]   It's easier than Skype for most people.
[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:54.540]   I think that's what...
[01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:55.540]   It's good for parties.
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:56.540]   No one likes about it.
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:57.540]   Really?
[01:00:57.540 --> 01:00:59.540]   What kind of parties are you having, sir?
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:00.540]   Very nerdy.
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:01.540]   Mmm.
[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:02.540]   Deeply.
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:03.540]   Ingress.
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:04.540]   Ingress, United.
[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:05.540]   I'm trying to get into ingress.
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:07.540]   If you're one of the developers of ingress...
[01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:09.540]   I can give you my code, Leo.
[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:10.540]   He's got it.
[01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:11.540]   What?
[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:12.540]   I didn't know you needed one.
[01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:13.540]   What?
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:16.540]   What do you want to get to the ingress thing going for?
[01:01:16.540 --> 01:01:17.540]   Well, it's okay.
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:18.540]   What is ingress?
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:20.540]   It's a game with an augmented reality game.
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:22.540]   To me, it's a database management system.
[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:23.540]   No, not ingress.
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:26.540]   Ingress, like coming in ingress, like an egress ingress.
[01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:29.540]   So it's a game you play on your Android phone.
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:32.540]   You open the ingress game and it's augmented reality.
[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:35.540]   So you're looking at the world through your camera, but there's stuff superimposed on it.
[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:36.540]   No, no, no.
[01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:37.540]   So it's not...
[01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:40.540]   There may be augmented reality aspects later, but it's reality...
[01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:41.540]   Maps.
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:48.540]   So there's a big map, and then you walk around the world collecting sort of like XP orbs,
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:50.540]   and then you can hack these portals, which are normally...
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:52.540]   This is that Android game.
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:53.540]   Yes.
[01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:54.540]   Oh, you know what this is all about.
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:58.540]   I'm actually borrowing an Android just because I got an invite for that.
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:00.540]   You got an invite too?
[01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:02.540]   Don't you guys realize you're being duped by this game?
[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:03.540]   Oh, come on.
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:05.540]   What are the insurance companies going to steal our information?
[01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:07.540]   Well, there's that possibility.
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:11.540]   But the real use of this game is for Google to further improve their mapping.
[01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:14.540]   So you just encourage to take pictures of everything.
[01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:15.540]   Is that right, Chad?
[01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:16.540]   Is that what you're doing?
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:17.540]   You can.
[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:24.540]   So I haven't gotten far past the tutorial level, but one of the things that they might do in the future is like we need information.
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:29.540]   So go to this place, and then you like type in what time the business opens and closes.
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:30.540]   Is it again?
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:31.540]   So it's now in Google Maps.
[01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:33.540]   So you don't think Four Square is doing that?
[01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:35.540]   This is like, yeah, but they're doing it for Google.
[01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:36.540]   Google's what they make.
[01:02:36.540 --> 01:02:39.540]   There's a county making billions of dollars, and they're too cheap to do this themselves.
[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:40.540]   They want you to do it for free.
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:42.540]   No, this is actually like a scam.
[01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:50.540]   This is like a Bruce Sterling short story of the idea where you took social networking and then elevated in intelligence to manage interactions on the social network.
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:56.540]   And you could actually have some really fascinating things like practical jokes that involve 15 people or cracking into places.
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:58.540]   And everybody did a component.
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:02:59.540]   They did their component.
[01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:00.540]   They got more points.
[01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:01.540]   They got their status raised.
[01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:05.540]   And then you had this amazing untraceable group of people working on projects.
[01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:06.540]   Well, this is similar.
[01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:09.540]   And I guess at the end of the day, you get a badge.
[01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:10.540]   Oh boy.
[01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:11.540]   It's just like, "I'm a square.
[01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:12.540]   You obviously never did Four Square."
[01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:13.540]   You get a badge, actually.
[01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:14.540]   Oh my gosh.
[01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:15.540]   Let's do it right now, John.
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:17.540]   I'm very proud of my Four Square badges.
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:18.540]   I got crunked.
[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:19.540]   Unbelievable.
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:22.540]   That is so cool to get a badge.
[01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:23.540]   Play a please.
[01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:24.540]   I got play a please.
[01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:28.540]   That's if you check in to a bar with four or more women.
[01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:29.540]   But what if you're gay?
[01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:30.540]   Then it wouldn't.
[01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:31.540]   That has always been my problem.
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:32.540]   Is it?
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:33.540]   Play a please badge.
[01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:34.540]   It's only.
[01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:36.900]   You only get it if you have opposite.
[01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:37.900]   What if you're gay, man?
[01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:38.900]   That's a good point.
[01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:40.900]   And you don't need the ladies and you're not really having any kind of movies.
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:41.900]   That's an interesting point.
[01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:42.900]   I never thought of that.
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:43.900]   I never thought of that.
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:46.900]   I actually put somebody to a Google search, gay badges on Four Square or Question Mark.
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:47.900]   Yeah.
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:48.900]   I want to know.
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:50.900]   I want a bear badge.
[01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:51.900]   Bears?
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:52.900]   I want a leather daddy badge.
[01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:53.900]   No, I do want to do that.
[01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:54.900]   I can introduce you to my dog walker.
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:57.460]   He can give you all the leather daddy badge where you need.
[01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:59.260]   He was Mr. Hey, this is going downhill.
[01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:01.540]   I don't even know what you guys are talking about.
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:04.980]   But there's like eight people in the audience that have turned pink and fallen off their
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:06.860]   chairs laughing.
[01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:07.860]   I wish.
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:09.260]   No, no, and they're trust me.
[01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:10.420]   See all the badges?
[01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:13.460]   I got 56 badges on Four Square.
[01:04:13.460 --> 01:04:15.220]   Now that is so cool.
[01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:17.740]   Players club shut a bug back to school.
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:18.740]   Trip a play fresh fruit.
[01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:19.740]   What's the rat?
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:20.740]   That's mall rat.
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:22.740]   Where's the badge you get for staying at home all the time?
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:23.940]   I got that one.
[01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:25.140]   I wouldn't know.
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:26.140]   Why no?
[01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:28.340]   Jet Setter, train spotter, Pete Ciolo.
[01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:29.340]   Is that beekeeping?
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:30.340]   Beekeeping.
[01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:31.340]   No, it's a super swarm.
[01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:32.340]   It's a super swarm Sunday.
[01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:33.340]   Oh, thank you.
[01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:34.340]   Oh, cool.
[01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:35.500]   Yeah, that was last super bowl.
[01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:36.900]   Last week's last year's Super Bowl.
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:38.740]   So what is Four Square's business model?
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:41.420]   I don't know, but I have a feeling it's nothing to do with badges.
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:42.420]   Engrest.
[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:43.660]   It's the same idea.
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:46.460]   They get you to go around and log in to do work for them.
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:50.820]   Basically, all these badges are just like nicer ways of calling you a drunk or a skank,
[01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:51.820]   right?
[01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:52.820]   Or Jim Rat.
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:53.820]   Or Jim Rat.
[01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:54.820]   A drunk or a superstar?
[01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:55.820]   I'm a super star.
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:56.820]   I'm a super star.
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:57.820]   I'm a super star.
[01:04:57.820 --> 01:04:58.820]   What's a skank badge look like?
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:04:59.820]   Play a please.
[01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:00.820]   Play a please.
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:01.820]   Here's Eve 2011.
[01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:02.820]   Loub.
[01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:03.820]   Okay, we're done.
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:04.820]   Let's go.
[01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:05.820]   I'm just getting back to you.
[01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:07.220]   So you got a pass to Engrest, huh?
[01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:09.620]   Yeah, I'm forwarding it to you right now.
[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:10.780]   So is that all I need?
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:12.220]   Like you can invite somebody else?
[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:14.820]   Well, no, I actually got a show to do here, people.
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:15.820]   I got two of them.
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:18.420]   So it's a code that you put into your app.
[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:19.420]   I did my part.
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:20.420]   Your app.
[01:05:20.420 --> 01:05:21.420]   Oh, good.
[01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:22.420]   Cause I, uh, good lord.
[01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:23.420]   This is.
[01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:26.660]   We don't need those thinking badges is what the John says.
[01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:28.820]   Let me be better than waggling, waggling, menacing.
[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:31.420]   So, but I've been, I've seen them all seriousness.
[01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:33.740]   John, you act so incensed by this.
[01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:34.740]   I am.
[01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:35.740]   What if it's a fun game?
[01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:37.100]   I'm enjoying what I'm doing.
[01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:38.100]   Here's, here's the develops.
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.100]   This is like.
[01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:40.580]   The road to hell is paved with fun games.
[01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:42.020]   No, you guys are such like.
[01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:43.020]   Exactly.
[01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:44.020]   She's right.
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:45.020]   Nervous hellies.
[01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:47.860]   That's why you have us here together so that we can gang up on you and tell you that,
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:50.820]   you know, you have to think about all the other angles of this.
[01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:54.660]   You're, you're gathering information on businesses and people and locations.
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:55.660]   You're doing it for free.
[01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.220]   You're not even getting paid as a spy.
[01:05:57.220 --> 01:05:59.220]   Where did you put the activation code?
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:00.220]   Oh, please.
[01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:01.660]   Just what, what other news is them?
[01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:03.460]   Don't you have another ad to do?
[01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:05.420]   I think you're falling behind.
[01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:06.660]   Look, that, what is that, Chad?
[01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:07.660]   So this is Petaluma.
[01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:08.660]   Let me find.
[01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:09.660]   Are you in play?
[01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:10.660]   Are there other people playing in Petaluma?
[01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:11.660]   So there's other things.
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:12.660]   Where am I?
[01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:14.820]   And suddenly I'm in the mission impossible.
[01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:15.820]   Do you do?
[01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:16.820]   There we are.
[01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:19.940]   So in Petaluma, there's a few nodes that you can get.
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:24.580]   There's, once it loads in this, this is ingress.com/intel.
[01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:30.300]   So this is sort of a portal to look at the rest of the game.
[01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:34.220]   These right here are these nodes that you can capture and hack.
[01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:36.820]   And once you hear some more that are loading in.
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:39.060]   So there's sort of two factions in the game.
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:41.180]   There's the enlightened and then there's the resistance.
[01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:44.580]   And each of them are battling over these nodes.
[01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:48.660]   And when you connect them up, it gives you land, land mass.
[01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:51.060]   Did they totally steal that from Firefly or what?
[01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:52.460]   This is the worst or wow?
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:54.340]   This sounds like the worst game.
[01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:55.340]   Ever.
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:58.860]   So stop fudging around and send me my gosh darn it.
[01:06:58.860 --> 01:06:59.860]   Okay, okay, here we go.
[01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:00.860]   Here we go.
[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:04.460]   I got to jump back into my inbox to send that to you.
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:05.860]   I want to play.
[01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:08.220]   See how they make it something you really want to do by making it.
[01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:09.220]   You know, you have to get a.
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:12.100]   I think she's got the right idea.
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:13.900]   Baked goods.
[01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:16.540]   Is it better use of your time than this kind of thing?
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:17.700]   There's a badge for that, John.
[01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.220]   And I'm sure there is.
[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:23.220]   That's what Jennifer told me when I was doing that, you know, we rule all the time.
[01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:24.220]   And she said, what are you doing?
[01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:25.220]   They're farming.
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:26.880]   So why don't you actually plant some real fish.
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:30.980]   Yeah, why don't you go in the backyard and dig up some turf and put some seeds.
[01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:31.980]   I said it's soothing.
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:32.980]   I said it's like knitting.
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:35.660]   She said if you were knitting, we'd have socks.
[01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:36.660]   In other words, I think.
[01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:38.860]   Have you considered a tech shop membership?
[01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:40.420]   Yeah, that would be at least something.
[01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:41.420]   No, you wouldn't know.
[01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:42.420]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:44.900]   You hang out with all those earthy crunchy maker kids.
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:45.900]   Tech shop.
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:47.460]   I don't I don't like doing physical.
[01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:49.940]   It would be too fingered Leo and he'd be relearning how to type.
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:52.460]   Yeah, I don't like physical.
[01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:53.460]   I like the.
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:55.340]   And where should he be done with a laser?
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:56.340]   My hand.
[01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:59.020]   At least we cauterized.
[01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:05.980]   So Vic Gundotre, who is the guy who put together Google+, stopped tweeting when Google+ launched.
[01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:09.900]   And everybody thought, oh, well, he's just showing that he really is all in on Google+.
[01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:12.060]   Turns out he was told to stop tweeting.
[01:08:12.060 --> 01:08:18.700]   He had tweeted when the Microsoft and Nokia announced they were doing a strategic alliance.
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:22.620]   He tweeted, two turkeys do not an eagle make.
[01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:27.820]   And he was he was he was told that I think you better stop tweeting now.
[01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:29.300]   That's not even terribly clever.
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:31.100]   I would tell you to stop tweeting.
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:32.100]   Who cares?
[01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:33.460]   What is it?
[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:36.620]   This is the Google executives telling him to stop to be his boss.
[01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:37.620]   That's terrible.
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:38.620]   What boss?
[01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:39.620]   What's his name?
[01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:40.620]   We shouldn't say.
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:44.100]   Well, I mean, if you look at corporate communications from Google, they take a lot of care to not speak
[01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:46.540]   really openly about what their competitors are doing.
[01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:50.460]   I mean, that's just corporate PR and just boss Larry Page.
[01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:53.060]   He's personally told to stop tweeting.
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.060]   Yeah.
[01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:55.060]   Huh.
[01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:56.660]   I find that to be peculiar.
[01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:58.060]   He probably was probably a suggestion.
[01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:02.860]   It was like, you know, maybe if you stop tweeting, you still have a job.
[01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:03.860]   That's the real question.
[01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:06.500]   Does he get sassy over on Google+?
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:08.860]   Apparently, no one's watching to find out.
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:09.860]   It's Vic.
[01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:10.860]   Maybe you want to.
[01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:11.860]   Yeah.
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:12.860]   Oh, the sound.
[01:09:12.860 --> 01:09:20.060]   You know, Vic, it might be a good idea not for you to use Twitter anymore.
[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:24.060]   Twitter and Instagram have had a little falling out.
[01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:25.060]   What do you think of this, Jolie?
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.460]   Are you writing about this adventure?
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:27.460]   Oh, girl.
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:28.460]   It's Facebook.
[01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:33.460]   I don't know why everybody is not like hitting the tail on the donkey here.
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:39.460]   So the reason Twitter and Instagram are having a problem is because Instagram is owned by
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:40.460]   Facebook.
[01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:41.460]   Right.
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:42.460]   That's pretty straightforward.
[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:45.260]   And I think anybody who would look at the situation would have seen that coming.
[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:47.460]   I don't know, like a billion months ago.
[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:49.260]   So Instagram was purchased by Facebook.
[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:52.860]   Their CEO's Kevin's system said, "Don't worry, it's not going to change Instagram at all."
[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:53.860]   That is BS.
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:54.860]   Yeah.
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:10:00.700]   But all of a sudden, Instagram has better integrations with Facebook now, unless I'm hallucinating.
[01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:04.700]   And no integrations with Twitter because what did you expect?
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:05.700]   Right.
[01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:07.740]   Who really listens to CEOs and says, "Oh, okay, sure.
[01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:09.220]   Yeah, that sounds good."
[01:10:09.220 --> 01:10:13.220]   You know, Tim Cook or Kevin's system or whomever, they say what they need to say in the moment
[01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:15.300]   to make themselves and their companies look good.
[01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:18.820]   But in reality, they do what's profitable for the business and it doesn't make sense
[01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:23.180]   for a Facebook product to play nicely with Twitter.
[01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:24.180]   Except for users.
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:25.740]   You make me sound so angry.
[01:10:25.740 --> 01:10:26.940]   Remember users, right?
[01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:28.940]   What about them?
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:29.940]   Well, I would like--
[01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:30.940]   They don't pay for anything.
[01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:31.940]   They're not going to stop using it.
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:32.940]   They're not going to stop using it.
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:37.340]   Was this-- they were supporting the Twitter cards, which is what Twitter wants everybody
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:38.340]   to do.
[01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:39.340]   What?
[01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:40.340]   Twitter has an API.
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:43.620]   They want content that is going to be on Twitter.
[01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:48.660]   In this case, so I take a picture of you eating a fine brownie.
[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:52.980]   And I post it on my Instagram and I check the box that says cross post to Twitter.
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:56.100]   So then there'll be a tweet from me with a link to the Instagram thing.
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:59.660]   If you're using the Twitter client or an appropriately configured Twitter client, third
[01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:06.140]   party client, the picture will show up in line with the tweet in an appropriate way because
[01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:10.100]   Instagram was supporting this API that Twitter has published about how to publish photos
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:13.140]   so that they show up Instagram just disabled that.
[01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:16.860]   So now you're going to get something haphazard or maybe not an image at all, but just a link.
[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:19.900]   Well, initially you were basically getting broken images or missing links.
[01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:23.700]   So is there any-- I mean, there's really legitimacy to what a lot of places, including
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:27.540]   Twitter, are doing, where they're trying to get people to not use third party clients
[01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:29.540]   or basically to be forced.
[01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:32.780]   Instagram says, hey, we want everybody to come back to Instagram so we get the data
[01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:34.700]   so we have the advertising opportunity.
[01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:35.700]   They want you to go.
[01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:38.380]   So what they want is that you'll click the link and go to the Instagram page.
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:40.020]   Instagram doesn't have ads, though.
[01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:41.020]   Instagram basically--
[01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:43.220]   Instagram basically says they're going to stay standalone.
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:44.220]   And at some point, in theory, right?
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:48.220]   Well, they don't have a business model of their own anymore because they're a wholly owned
[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:49.220]   entity of Facebook.
[01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:50.220]   I'm not arguing.
[01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:51.220]   Yeah.
[01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:54.980]   And I do believe there's a puppet hand from Facebook that's telling Instagram what to
[01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:59.380]   do, but is there any legitimacy to other actions by social media companies where they are trying
[01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:02.100]   to claim that they want people to come to their site to get the product?
[01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:06.860]   No, actually, I worked or talked with Twitter a lot, a lot, a lot about the whole-- then
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:09.220]   pulling back the API.
[01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:11.060]   And it really wasn't anything like this.
[01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:14.940]   I think they're actually trying to get people to use Twitter cards in the same way that
[01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:17.500]   Twitter is trying to get people to use Open Graph and Timeline.
[01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:18.500]   Right.
[01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:21.140]   I don't think they're discouraging that at all.
[01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:24.700]   Twitter is discouraging people from making Twitter clients, which Instagram--
[01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:29.020]   I mean, Twitter is discouraging people from making good Twitter clients because they make
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:30.860]   enough ad internal clients.
[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:35.540]   Anything with more than 100,000 users is not-- well, yeah, that would be a good Twitter
[01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:36.540]   client.
[01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:40.580]   But I mean, it's frustrating because they've either made it expensive to make a Twitter
[01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:45.100]   client or expensive to have any kind of a large group of Twitter-- it seems like every
[01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:49.220]   Twitter client that Twitter has bought has been lessened and made less useful.
[01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:50.220]   Absolutely.
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:51.220]   Absolutely.
[01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:52.220]   Tweet that.
[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:53.220]   Tweet that.
[01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:54.580]   Yeah, they just damaged them.
[01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:57.220]   Because what Twitter really wants is you to use their web page.
[01:12:57.220 --> 01:13:01.820]   And by the way, the web page is where these cards-- these Twitter cards work.
[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:04.940]   And Instagram saying, no, we want you to go to our web page, not Twitter's web page.
[01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:09.420]   So it's a little spiff fight between-- a little tiff between the two social media giants.
[01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:12.700]   But I loved the chatter.
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:17.340]   And I don't have his handle who said, gee, social media should not be this exhausting.
[01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:18.980]   Web 5089, I agree with you.
[01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:20.260]   Well, it's not even social media.
[01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:21.260]   It's just--
[01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:22.260]   It should be fun.
[01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:23.260]   It's business that we're talking about.
[01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:24.260]   That's the problem.
[01:13:24.260 --> 01:13:26.300]   We're not talking about social for your media.
[01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:27.300]   They've turned it into business.
[01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:28.300]   It's always been--
[01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:29.980]   Is it smart business or stupid business?
[01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:30.980]   Well, that's the problem.
[01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:32.860]   If you're going to do it, it should be fun.
[01:13:32.860 --> 01:13:34.020]   It should embrace users.
[01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:35.820]   It should be something users like.
[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:39.820]   And you shouldn't be sacrificing your users to your business interests.
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:43.300]   Because in the long run, that's a short term way of doing it.
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:47.820]   What if we all learned to pay for what we use on the internet back in 1993?
[01:13:47.820 --> 01:13:49.460]   Well, but see, I paid for AvgotNet.
[01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:50.460]   Then what would be having this problem?
[01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:52.700]   50 bucks, the idea was is a paid Twitter.
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:54.460]   And you'll have a higher level of conversation.
[01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:55.460]   Who made that one?
[01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:56.460]   Was that the Evan guy?
[01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:57.460]   No, that was the other one.
[01:13:57.460 --> 01:13:58.460]   Okay, no.
[01:13:58.460 --> 01:13:59.460]   No.
[01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:02.100]   AvgotNet is-- oh, his name escapes me.
[01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:03.100]   Okay.
[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:04.100]   But--
[01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:05.100]   So you paid for that?
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:06.100]   50 bucks, not so great.
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:11.180]   Well, I mean, if you look at the diaspora guys and the Evan who made the Evan.
[01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:14.140]   I paid for diaspora, too.
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:16.540]   It never will work.
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:17.540]   Why not?
[01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:18.540]   Because--
[01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:19.540]   Dalton Caldwell, thank you.
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:20.540]   Dalton Caldwell.
[01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:21.540]   He's here.
[01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:22.540]   Yeah.
[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:24.860]   It's an ad-free network.
[01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:26.580]   Now they've got it down to $5 a month.
[01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:28.140]   So that's only 60 bucks.
[01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:29.660]   Wait a minute.
[01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:31.980]   $36 for a year.
[01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:36.420]   And I like the idea-- you know, TapBot's did a great app for iPhone for it.
[01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:41.340]   It's basically TweetBot with app.net in addition.
[01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:44.340]   But it's just not compelling because you really want to be on the network where all your friends
[01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:45.340]   are, right?
[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:48.060]   And none of your friends are smart enough to do that and they're not going to pay them
[01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:49.060]   money to do that.
[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:49.900]   No one's going to pay 36 bucks for a year.
[01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:52.500]   Your grandma isn't going to sit around and set up all this--
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:53.500]   It's just not that useful.
[01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:55.700]   --yes, open source, hippie-dippy crap.
[01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:56.700]   Exactly.
[01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:58.780]   They're going to go and sign up for a Facebook-- well, you're going to sign them up for a
[01:14:58.780 --> 01:14:59.980]   Facebook account, but still.
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:01.420]   Hey, good news for Kodak.
[01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:05.020]   Remember Kodak, Chapter 11, not doing so well.
[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:09.020]   They thought maybe they could get a Savior, an angel, if they sold their patents, they
[01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:10.020]   have a buyer.
[01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:16.420]   Google and Apple are teaming up to offer half a million dollars for Kodak's patents.
[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:17.420]   Half a million.
[01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:18.420]   Half a billion.
[01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:19.420]   Did I say half a million?
[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:20.420]   Half a billion.
[01:15:20.420 --> 01:15:21.420]   I can't.
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:22.420]   It's more like it.
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:23.420]   So why are they working together?
[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:25.220]   Well, that's really strange because Google and Apple are here.
[01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:29.020]   I mean, don't they want these patents to defend against each other?
[01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:32.580]   Well, apparently, in this case, they're going to use it to defend against Microsoft or somebody
[01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:33.580]   else.
[01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:34.580]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:35.980]   This is a bunch of people, or maybe Samsung.
[01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:37.740]   I mean, this is a bunch of--
[01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:40.500]   Google is a Samsung partner in Apple.
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:41.500]   That's true.
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.500]   Apple and Samsung, that's a whole other story.
[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:44.500]   I mean, the whole thing is--
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:47.980]   I don't understand why they're teaming up on this because Apple and Google have--
[01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:48.980]   Get this.
[01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:51.980]   --all the Apple has been sideways kind of attacking Google and patent--
[01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:52.980]   Not even sideways.
[01:15:52.980 --> 01:15:55.500]   I wouldn't even call it court for years.
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:56.500]   Get this.
[01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:58.980]   They previously tried to do it with a Microsoft.
[01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:01.180]   It's an intellectual ventures.
[01:16:01.180 --> 01:16:02.180]   Apple, Microsoft intellectual ventures.
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:05.220]   Is it an intellectual ventures, that patent troll firm?
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:06.220]   Yes.
[01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:07.220]   Yes.
[01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:08.220]   Isn't--
[01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:09.220]   That's the spin-off.
[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:10.220]   It was Paul Allen's.
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:11.220]   No, it's not Allen's.
[01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:12.220]   It's what's his name.
[01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:13.220]   It's Nathan Mirvold?
[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:15.660]   Is that a Mirvold's operation?
[01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:21.500]   I thought it was Paul Allen's spin-off of-- it's a private company notable for being one
[01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:23.540]   of the top five owners of US patents.
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:24.540]   Yes, Mirvold.
[01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:25.540]   Yeah.
[01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:32.540]   He found that by Nathan Mirvold and Edward Young of Microsoft later joined by--
[01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:35.540]   He wanted to go up there and have lunch with him and I never do it.
[01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:38.540]   Well, you would say-- and Mirvold is one of the smartest guys out there, right?
[01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:39.540]   Yeah, yeah, he's very smart.
[01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:40.540]   He's very sharp.
[01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:41.540]   He's got a good-- and he's a nice guy.
[01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:43.540]   He just turns out he's a bond evil villain.
[01:16:43.540 --> 01:16:45.820]   Well, that's what it looks like, but I don't think so.
[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:48.860]   I think he just plays one with this--
[01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:51.740]   Is he saying there's so much money, I can't ignore this?
[01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:54.500]   Originally, he said, "No, what we're going to do is we're going to support people by
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:55.500]   owning these patents.
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.340]   We're going to make it easier to innovate."
[01:16:57.340 --> 01:16:58.340]   And now what he's apparently doing is--
[01:16:58.340 --> 01:17:00.340]   Pat is our like the opposite of making--
[01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:01.340]   I think so.
[01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:06.420]   Vince Surf was speaking at a recent thing that I was at.
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:10.300]   It was at Google and he said, "You know, the best thing you could do for innovation is
[01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:13.060]   to round up all the patent lawyers and like shoot them."
[01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:14.580]   I think Shakespeare said that first.
[01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:18.900]   No, he said this specifically about patent law and innovation and cell phones and patent
[01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:19.900]   data.
[01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:20.900]   Yeah, yeah, as Shakespeare said, "All lawyers."
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:21.900]   Kill all the lawyers.
[01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:22.900]   First thing we do is kill all lawyers.
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:23.900]   Well, he said the patent lawyers.
[01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:27.140]   I think Vint would want to keep-- I don't know the three-piece suit lawyers.
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:28.140]   He's the one that has US--
[01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:29.140]   I don't know if the patent lawyers are the problem.
[01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:30.700]   I think the patent system is the problem.
[01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:35.420]   See the so-called Steve Jobs patent, the multi-touch patent, was just invalidated by
[01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:36.420]   the USPTO.
[01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:37.420]   No, there you go.
[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:42.020]   But the level at which it's been invalidated is kind of like it's not real.
[01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:46.180]   It's going to go through multiple rounds of quote validation, unquote.
[01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:50.020]   It's a tentative ruling that it is an invalid patent.
[01:17:50.020 --> 01:17:55.540]   But apparently it's quite normal for stuff to be called invalid at this level and then
[01:17:55.540 --> 01:18:00.580]   at the more serious levels to be validated in terms of patent decisions.
[01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:02.940]   It can be appealed.
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:03.940]   It will be appealed.
[01:18:03.940 --> 01:18:08.700]   This is patent 949, which was one of the relevant patents in the Samsung Apple case.
[01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:14.660]   All 20 claims were ruled invalid, which means Apple, according to Florian Miller and Fos
[01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:17.380]   patents, will have to make an unusually strong case.
[01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:19.220]   Okay, you can't listen to Florian.
[01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:20.220]   He is paid by...
[01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:21.220]   He works for Google.
[01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:23.220]   No, no, it wasn't even Google.
[01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:28.980]   It was Microsoft because I remember I was covering the Oracle Google case and some Florian
[01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:31.380]   Miller as a comment to an analyst.
[01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:33.500]   I'm sorry, I interviewed him one time.
[01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:37.500]   And I got a call from my sources at Google and they said, "You know he's paid by Microsoft.
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:39.140]   Maybe you should talk more neutrally."
[01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:45.140]   Well, I think that's unfair because what he was paid for was a very kind of a lip.
[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:47.140]   He was like, "John's been paid for as an expert with this.
[01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:48.140]   It was that kind of...
[01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:51.460]   He didn't disclose that and I think that's where...
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:53.340]   Google was close to it, which was funny.
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:54.340]   Yeah.
[01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:56.340]   Well, it was even before that.
[01:18:56.340 --> 01:19:03.820]   No, he was known as a paid Microsoft contractor type person before that whole...
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:04.820]   Well, in this case...
[01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:05.700]   With paid bloggers, they came out.
[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.660]   In this case, it's Apple and it's multi-touch.
[01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:10.180]   I don't know if we have to...
[01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:14.220]   If he has a dog in this particular hunt.
[01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:16.420]   I want a dog, always a dog.
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:21.340]   I cannot take anybody seriously once I know that they've been paid by a corporation.
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:22.820]   Apple, by the way.
[01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:23.820]   Who pays you?
[01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:24.820]   Venture Beat.
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:25.820]   And their corporation?
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:26.820]   I don't know.
[01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:28.900]   We might be in LLP.
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:32.180]   Is there advertising on Venture Beat?
[01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:33.180]   Is there advertising?
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:34.180]   It's a good question.
[01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:35.180]   No, yeah, there is.
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:36.180]   It's weird.
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:37.180]   I know.
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:38.180]   I know.
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:39.180]   It's totally corrupt.
[01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:40.180]   I'm super...
[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:41.180]   I'm super...
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:42.180]   I know a gender show, by the way.
[01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:43.180]   No agenda.
[01:19:43.180 --> 01:19:44.180]   I'm super corrupt.
[01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:45.180]   I'll say this is not...
[01:19:45.180 --> 01:19:47.320]   - On the show when that's the Berkeley page.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:48.460]   - Cooks, let's see.
[01:19:48.460 --> 01:19:50.260]   I can think of like four or five magazines
[01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:51.680]   or websites that are completely useful.
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:52.760]   - Cooks, I like cooks for that reason.
[01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:53.800]   - What's cooks?
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:55.840]   - It's a great cooking magazine where they take no ads.
[01:19:55.840 --> 01:19:57.200]   - Oh yeah, cooks.
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:58.040]   - I love that guy.
[01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:59.520]   - Oh didn't miss used to take no ads
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:02.580]   because the only ads they were get for tampons and stuff
[01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:06.480]   and they wanted cars and watches, and okay.
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:07.880]   I thought I'd talk about football
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:09.220]   and then it's about the whole game.
[01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:12.680]   - I've turned down tampon ads for years on Twit.
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:15.840]   - Oh, I thank you Chad, I am now using ingress.
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:18.480]   - Oh, Andrew and I getting back on this stupid thing again.
[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:19.320]   (laughing)
[01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:20.380]   - I'll take a break.
[01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:21.720]   While I play ingress.
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:23.680]   - The rest of us.
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:25.200]   - Yeah isn't Tom Merritt back there somewhere?
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:26.480]   Waitin' to come on the air?
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:28.800]   - Tom is, what's comin' up in the week ahead?
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:31.480]   He's not apparently.
[01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:32.560]   Catch his mom, Gary.
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.080]   - He moved to LA.
[01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.640]   - Some of the stories will be keepin' an eye.
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:37.200]   - I believe it was go ahead on Tech News today.
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:40.520]   - On Monday December 10th, it's your last chance to vote
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:43.920]   on Facebook's rule changes, which get rid of your ability
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:45.960]   to vote on Facebook rule changes.
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:48.560]   Tuesday December 11th, companies who want to participate
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:51.000]   in the 4G spectrum auction in the UK
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.480]   must have their submissions into off-com.
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:57.920]   Wednesday December 12th, the Pope starts tweeting @PontFX.
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:01.640]   Thursday December 13th Panasonic Lumix GH3 launches.
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:03.400]   Friday December 14th is busy.
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.440]   China gets the iPhone 5.
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:08.800]   Support for the messages beta app on Lion will be pulled.
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:11.000]   And it's the last day of that
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:14.120]   International Telecommunications Union Conference in Dubai.
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:16.440]   And of course, we keepin' an eye on that all week long.
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:19.720]   Saturday December 15th, the daily shuts down.
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:21.920]   That's the iPad only newspaper.
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:25.920]   And Verizon Video Service is shut down as well,
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:29.680]   probably an anticipation of launching Red Box Instant.
[01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:32.200]   So look at the week ahead, back to you, Leo.
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:34.280]   - So it says, what?
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:38.360]   - Well, Tom just ran off so I can't talk to him.
[01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:41.200]   But he wasn't this more of like the week ahead
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:43.800]   and he would talk about swap meets and these kinds of things.
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:45.280]   This is more of a news run down.
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:46.880]   - Yeah, we're kinda giving you like the stories
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.480]   that we will be covering this in the week.
[01:21:48.480 --> 01:21:50.080]   - In the week, but that's not the same as it used to be.
[01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:51.520]   It used to be like swap meets?
[01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:53.880]   - This week we're gonna have a swap meet
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:55.680]   in the Samitale County Fair.
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:57.120]   - The farmer port used to do that too.
[01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:59.680]   Corn prices, I used to do the farmer port, you know.
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:01.600]   - No, I started on radio, I read the farmer port.
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:04.640]   Corn prices are down $1.30 a bushel this week.
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:06.880]   - So what's the reason for the switch over?
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.640]   - This is like his tech news report.
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:09.480]   Doesn't seem like--
[01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:11.440]   - Decided that it would be better
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:14.400]   if tech news today were be about tech news
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:15.680]   instead of farmer port.
[01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:16.520]   - Unprecedented.
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:17.400]   - Unprecedented.
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:18.760]   - When I missed out on it, you used to say
[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:21.560]   whether it was gonna be a big convention in Vegas.
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.200]   The NAB's this week, you'd say something like that.
[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:26.440]   - NAB, no, actually the big deal is $7 bottles of Bordeaux
[01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:29.200]   at Costco this week under the Kirkland brand name.
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:30.040]   - I heard that.
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:30.880]   - Yeah.
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.200]   - Yeah, well everybody in the chat room knows about it.
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:33.120]   - Run out and get it.
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:35.000]   Any Costco anywhere in the nation?
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.200]   - I've checked three Costco's and they all have it.
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:39.000]   And all you have to do is go to the wine guy.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.520]   There's usually a floating around there.
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:41.520]   - So where's my Kirkland Bordeaux?
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:44.160]   - And you say, where's the cheap $7 Bordeaux?
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:46.440]   And they always say down there, it's with the bulk wines.
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:47.760]   It's not with the main wines.
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:49.560]   - Is there a picture of the Chateau Kirkland?
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:50.400]   - No, there's not.
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:51.400]   I think this is the problem.
[01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:52.840]   I think this is bad marketing.
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:54.720]   If they could put a Kirkland label
[01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.280]   and making something fancy looking
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:59.000]   instead of that cheap looking Costco label.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.280]   - 'Cause Kirkland's their house brand.
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:01.120]   - Yeah, it's their house brand.
[01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:02.960]   - So is this grown in Washington State?
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:03.880]   - No, no, it's a Bordeaux.
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:05.640]   They bought some, the Chateau production
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:08.000]   of some Chateau and Bordeaux, some superior.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:08.840]   - Bottle that sucker up.
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:10.200]   - It's onto the mirror probably.
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:13.040]   Bottle her up, moved it out and--
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:13.880]   - It's good, you're saying.
[01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:15.120]   - It is, it's actually very good.
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:16.120]   Yeah, it's quite good.
[01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:17.800]   - This crap with the Kirkland thing.
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:19.120]   Why are we talking about this?
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:19.960]   I have no idea what's going on.
[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:22.160]   - It's 20 to no, that's a Carnera, you know.
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:23.000]   But they have that as well.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.080]   - But it's the same similar label.
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:25.360]   - Same thing, the Kirkland brand, yeah.
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:26.240]   - It's hideous.
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:27.080]   - So I mean, I'm--
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:27.920]   - You haven't tasted that one.
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:29.240]   - I'm signing into Ingrid.
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:31.200]   - No, not of what you speak.
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:36.200]   - I think you'll like this, John.
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:38.200]   - I have Marshall McLuhan right here.
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:39.200]   I'm sorry, go on.
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:40.200]   - I love that.
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:43.200]   I have, this is the login for Ingrid's.
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:45.200]   Warning, I'm gonna confirm my participation.
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:46.200]   - Why would it have been a better topic?
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:47.200]   - Saving the world is dangerous.
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:48.200]   If you do not want to assume this risk,
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:49.200]   now is your chance to close this app
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:50.200]   and go back to your normal life.
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:51.200]   - Close it.
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.200]   - There you go.
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:53.200]   - There's more.
[01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:54.200]   - There's something you can do.
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:55.200]   - Your location will be collected by Google
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:57.200]   and shared with other users of the product.
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:58.200]   - There you have it.
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:01.200]   - Read the full terms of service before.
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:02.200]   - Are you reading the terms?
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:03.200]   - Accepting.
[01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:04.200]   - Thank God.
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:05.200]   - Do you read the terms?
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:07.200]   Go ahead, would you read the terms for me?
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:08.200]   - Yeah.
[01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:09.200]   - Thank you.
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:11.200]   - Privacy, you have none.
[01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:13.200]   Your code name and location will be shared
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:15.200]   with all other users when you--
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:16.200]   - Of course, you can't play a game.
[01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:17.200]   - You don't even have to check in.
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:18.200]   When you visit a location,
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:20.200]   your location will be shared.
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:21.200]   - Is that true, Chad?
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:22.200]   - Is that true, Chad?
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:23.200]   I'm gonna follow you around like a dog.
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:25.200]   - There is no checking in on the service.
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:26.200]   - You don't have to check in it
[01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:27.200]   because when you go--
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:28.200]   - No, no, no.
[01:24:28.200 --> 01:24:29.200]   You have to hack a node,
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:30.200]   and when you hack a node,
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:32.200]   it will say this user is hacking a node.
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:34.200]   - So is it stalker enabling?
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:35.200]   - Yep.
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:36.200]   - Or is there a entity?
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:38.200]   - There tend to not be nodes at your house.
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:39.200]   They're big public events,
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:42.200]   so the post office is a node.
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:44.200]   - Is it a public event?
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:45.200]   - A big event?
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:46.200]   What?
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:47.200]   - Not a public event, but like a big public venue.
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:48.200]   - You have millennials and your people.
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:49.200]   - Public events.
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:50.200]   - Public venue.
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:52.200]   - We all go drink at the post office after the show.
[01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:53.200]   It's a big deal.
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:55.200]   - No, I'm gonna show you that in the 7-Eleven anymore.
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:56.200]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:58.200]   - So it might be a statue.
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:24:59.200]   - You guys are such killjoys.
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:01.200]   I just wanna have a good time.
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:02.200]   - You shouldn't invite us on.
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:03.200]   - Bring it, Leo.
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.200]   - So get ready to--
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:05.200]   - Let's see a Scrabble.
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:07.200]   - The thing is you gotta be ready to walk.
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.200]   - Just let it play Scrabble.
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:09.200]   - But if you play Scrabble,
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:10.200]   they collect your words,
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:11.200]   and then they sell you ads,
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:12.200]   and they send you a personality.
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:14.200]   - No, but let the flaxes go on the table.
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:15.200]   - They collect your soul.
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:16.200]   - You can never say those words again.
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:17.200]   - Oh, those squabbles.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:18.200]   - Physical squabble.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:19.200]   - Yeah.
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:22.200]   - Our show today brought to you by squarespace.com.
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:23.200]   Kind of great email from Keith.
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:25.200]   I'm gonna read it again if I can find it.
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:28.200]   He is a new squarespace user.
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:33.200]   And he-- I guess he uses his squarespace site.
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:35.200]   He's a DJ, and he uses his squarespace site
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:37.200]   in his work in some way.
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:41.200]   I'm not sure exactly how it is.
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:44.200]   But he said he was a little concerned
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:47.200]   when Hurricane Sandy was heading towards the east coast,
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:49.200]   'cause he was afraid his site would go down.
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:51.200]   So he offloaded all the images on his site.
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:52.200]   He knew he would need it.
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:54.200]   You'd all read it, actually.
[01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:57.200]   Says, "Dear Leo, I've been using squarespace
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:58.200]   since June of this year.
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:00.200]   When the hurricane hit New York City,
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:02.200]   I, like others, got the email saying
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:06.200]   that Pier 1, squarespace's colo, had been hit hard.
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:08.200]   I remembered that day you saying,
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:09.200]   "Over and over in your podcast,
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.200]   that squarespace site's never go down."
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:13.200]   I watched and even took the precaution of moving
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:15.200]   over 5,000 graphics from my squarespace site
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:16.200]   to photobook it.
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:19.200]   I run an online radio station and virtual night club
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:21.200]   and rely on these graphics heavily.
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:24.200]   We kept an eye on things and suffered only 35 seconds
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:26.200]   of downtime for the entire time
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:28.200]   that Pier 1 had a flooded basement.
[01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:30.200]   See, the generators were in the basement at Pier 1.
[01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:32.200]   There was one lone generator on the roof,
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:35.200]   and Anthony Castellain, the CEO of Squarespace
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:36.200]   and other Squarespace employees,
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:39.200]   basically created an old-fashioned bucket brigade
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:41.200]   to move fuel from the basement to the roof
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.200]   to keep the emergency generators running.
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:46.200]   "I have never seen," Keith goes on to say,
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:50.200]   "such determination to keep a data center online in my life."
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:53.200]   This one act of putting the customers first
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:55.200]   will keep me as a Squarespace member
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:57.200]   for as long as I run a website.
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:59.200]   I recently added Squarespace 6 to the site,
[01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:01.200]   and I love how they don't charge me a penny more
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:03.200]   to basically have two websites in one.
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:05.200]   I use Hover for my domain registration.
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:07.200]   I'm very pleased with that service as well.
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:09.200]   I just want to thank you for recommending a great service
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:10.200]   like Squarespace,
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:11.200]   and wanted all the Twitter listeners to know
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:14.200]   there's nothing like a Squarespace site.
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:16.200]   Squarespace is the best hosting.
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:17.200]   No doubt about it.
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:19.200]   You cannot bring a Squarespace site down,
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:21.200]   but it's more than that because on top of it
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.200]   is the best content management system out there.
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:25.200]   It is fast, it is easy, it's beautiful.
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:28.200]   In fact, if you're an artist, a photographer,
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:31.200]   a designer, a Squarespace site is a great way
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:36.200]   to show off your portfolio because it's going to look as good as you do.
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:38.200]   You're an aesthetic person.
[01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:40.200]   You want an aesthetic-looking site.
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:41.200]   Squarespace is so great.
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:44.200]   No mobile site necessary because all of their sites
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:45.200]   look great on all screens.
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:46.200]   They do a lot of work.
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:50.200]   It's called Mobile Ready Responsive Design.
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:52.200]   That's the industry term.
[01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:58.200]   HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, all the whiz-bang features
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:01.200]   of great modern websites, but you don't have to know any of that.
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:02.200]   It'll do it all automatically.
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:05.200]   Now, if you do, they have a fantastic developer platform.
[01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:07.200]   So you can do all the coding you want.
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:10.200]   They have syntax-colored coding and all of that.
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:12.200]   Your neckbeard boy will love that.
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:14.200]   Squares?
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:15.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:16.200]   Aaron's gone.
[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:18.200]   He's shaking his head.
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:20.200]   Squarespace also integrates beautifully with your social media.
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:23.200]   You can publish two and from social media with a few clicks.
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:25.200]   300 fonts using Google Fonts.
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:27.200]   That's kind of a nice feature.
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:28.200]   You like Google Fonts, right, Aaron?
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:29.200]   Isn't that cool?
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:32.200]   The ability to use real fonts on a website?
[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:34.200]   Just fantastic.
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:35.200]   I want you to try it.
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:36.200]   Here's the deal.
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:39.200]   You don't even need our name or code or anything to try it free for two weeks.
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:40.200]   Don't need a credit card.
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:42.200]   Just go to squarespace.com.
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:45.200]   Click the button that says, "Give it a try."
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:49.200]   After two weeks, if you decide to buy, I want you to see offer code, "Twit 12."
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:51.200]   You'll save 10% off your first purchase.
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:57.200]   Now, let me just talk briefly about squarespace pricing because they have simplified this.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:58.200]   They used to have many different plans.
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:00.200]   It's really simple now.
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:02.200]   There's basically two plans.
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:05.200]   There's the standard plan and the unlimited plan.
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:09.200]   When you buy a year, it's $8 a month for standard, 16 a month for unlimited.
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:10.200]   That's the one I recommend.
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:11.200]   Here's why.
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:13.840]   Unlimited pages, galleries, and blogs.
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:15.640]   That's what Keith was talking about.
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:19.200]   You can have as many websites as you want on one account, basically.
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:20.960]   Unlimited bandwidth.
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:25.760]   That means even if suddenly you become the hottest thing since sliced bread, not could
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:26.760]   cost you more.
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:28.760]   No bills for bandwidth.
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:30.560]   Unlimited storage.
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:31.560]   That's great for photography.
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.280]   You can upload as many pictures as you want.
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:35.720]   Each of your clients can have a different site on squarespace.
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:37.880]   I mean, just send unlimited contributors.
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:41.600]   When you sign up for the year plan on either of these plans, they will give you a domain
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:43.720]   name for free and they'll hook it up.
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:45.760]   I just think this is such a great deal.
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:49.200]   By the way, if you use the offer code, 12, it's an even better deal because you get 10%
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:50.200]   off.
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:52.840]   That's why it's best to go for your plan because it's get the most savings.
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:58.520]   Twit 12, the offer code, it's hip to be squarespace.com.
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:00.320]   We used that Squarespace.
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:01.320]   For no agenda?
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.160]   Yeah, no agenda show.com is squarespace.
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:04.160]   Really?
[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:05.160]   Yeah.
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:06.160]   You don't do advertisers.
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:07.160]   We don't do advertisers.
[01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:09.160]   What's so-- no, we refuse to take donations.
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:10.160]   It's all donations.
[01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:11.160]   Yes.
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:13.320]   And you're doing pretty well.
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:17.160]   We're aching out a living.
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:18.160]   That sounds like it.
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:20.880]   That sounds like it's you're doing really well and you don't want anybody to know.
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:22.600]   No, we're aching out a living.
[01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:23.600]   Depends on what a living is to you.
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:24.760]   The Koch brother sponsor them.
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:25.760]   Yeah, I wish.
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:26.760]   Frought to you by.
[01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:29.480]   Hey, we got an award by the way.
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:30.480]   Thank you, Stitcher.
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:31.480]   I forgot.
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:32.480]   Bring the award out.
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:34.720]   John, could you bring me the Stitcher award that we got?
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:36.480]   Whatever was it for?
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:37.480]   It was Tech Show.
[01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:39.680]   The reason I thought of that is because I was talking to Mark Merrin.
[01:30:39.680 --> 01:30:40.680]   He was there.
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:43.280]   He won best episode for his show with WFTF, which is his-- he is--
[01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:44.280]   Unbelievably funny.
[01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:45.280]   Very funny.
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:46.960]   Profane as hell, but very funny.
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:49.920]   I saw him, Jadyn Grofflow and Henry Rollins in one night.
[01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:50.920]   Oh, hell, I would just--
[01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:51.920]   Must have been awesome.
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:52.920]   Painfully funny.
[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:53.920]   He's really talented at the comic.
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:54.920]   And he interviews great people.
[01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:56.560]   It was the best podcast episode of the year.
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:59.120]   It was his interview with Tenacious D.
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:01.680]   But Mark was there and I was talking with him.
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:02.680]   I know.
[01:31:02.680 --> 01:31:03.680]   You got to download that episode.
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:06.440]   I was talking with him and he says, you know, I can make him living doing this.
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:07.440]   Podcasting, one show.
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:08.440]   I think--
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:09.440]   He only does one show?
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:10.680]   He does one show a week.
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:12.240]   Oh, one show a week.
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:13.680]   And I said, are you still gigging?
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:14.680]   He said, yeah.
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:16.600]   But he said, but no, but this is a good business.
[01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:19.200]   And they do advertising, but he said, that's a good business.
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:20.200]   And then they do other thing.
[01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:21.840]   You know, they also like you.
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:22.840]   It's-- oh, I'm sorry.
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:27.080]   John, it's on the shelf-- on the top shelf on the right, behind my desk.
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:28.600]   Where the brandy usually is.
[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:29.600]   Right by the--
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:30.600]   Where the cognac that he took home used to be.
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:33.240]   Next to the-- next to the look humble picture.
[01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:34.240]   There.
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:35.240]   That's my motto.
[01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:36.240]   Look humble.
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:37.640]   I'm-- I look that way.
[01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:38.800]   I'm a humble looking man.
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:39.840]   So we're worth the stitcher.
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:40.840]   Yeah.
[01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:43.200]   2012 Stitcher Awards Best Tech This Week in Tech.
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:44.200]   Let's see.
[01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:45.200]   I was very happy to win that.
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:48.640]   Stitcher, you know, is that app that lets you download podcasts.
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:49.640]   It's kind of--
[01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:50.640]   Well, congratulations.
[01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:51.640]   No, it stands up by itself.
[01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:52.920]   Barely.
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:56.040]   I felt bad the guy who hosted the skeptic podcast broke his.
[01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:57.040]   Aw.
[01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:58.520]   Spam out of glass is very breakable.
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:00.040]   Yeah, it's pretty--
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:01.040]   They're right there.
[01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:02.040]   --carefully.
[01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:03.840]   Hopefully, though.
[01:32:03.840 --> 01:32:04.840]   What were we talking about?
[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:05.840]   Oh, tech news.
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:08.240]   Let's get back to the tech news.
[01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:09.640]   You know, a few minutes left.
[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:10.640]   Are we running?
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:12.440]   Oh, man, we're now running out of time.
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:15.640]   Office 2013 rolled out to business customers.
[01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:20.320]   If you're not a business customer, you're going to have to wait till 2013.
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:22.080]   Does anybody played with this yet?
[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:23.080]   I have.
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:24.080]   OK.
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:25.080]   Like it?
[01:32:25.080 --> 01:32:26.080]   You do?
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:27.080]   Why?
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:28.080]   It's very cloudy.
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:29.080]   I mean, oh, it's very cloudy.
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:30.080]   It's very cloudy.
[01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:33.320]   Is there anything that makes it easier to do business?
[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:34.320]   No.
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:39.800]   But I like the idea-- and I know you're skeptical of this, but I like the idea that my documents
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:42.640]   are stored in the cloud, and I can get to them anywhere.
[01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:47.320]   Well, for a business, that makes a lot of sense because, you know, devices can be interchangeable
[01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:51.680]   and you don't want local document storage for a lot of things.
[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:56.240]   So it's nice that Microsoft is catching up to Google and Dropbox and every other company
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:58.600]   that Google now is charging for Google Apps.
[01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:00.000]   Even people who had it for free.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.080]   I couldn't believe-- I know at least four people who are rapidly pissed because they
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:06.680]   run all their family URLs through that.
[01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:07.680]   It's free.
[01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:08.680]   It was.
[01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:14.600]   And they're grandmathered in as long as they don't add any new accounts.
[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:15.600]   Oh.
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:16.600]   So that--
[01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:18.160]   I appreciate your switching up the gender on that.
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:20.760]   Why are they grandmathered instead of grandfathered in just twice?
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:21.760]   They're grandmathered in.
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:22.760]   Is that what he says for you?
[01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:23.760]   For the business.
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:24.760]   He's very politically correct.
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:25.760]   They're grandmathered.
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:28.120]   So explain to me because Google Apps for business--
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:30.200]   So there's Google Docs, which is still free.
[01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:31.200]   Yes.
[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:35.040]   Is what compared to Google Docs?
[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:37.000]   It's just Google Docs and steroids.
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.200]   Google Docs for groups, essentially.
[01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:41.200]   And they had a free version and a paid version.
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:45.240]   The paid version was what you wanted to run a business on and a lot of smaller businesses
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:50.120]   and families and people who just wanted to run URLs with email and such were running
[01:33:50.120 --> 01:33:51.600]   them on the free version.
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:53.040]   We use Google Apps as a business.
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:58.440]   So if you go to mail.twit.tv, what you'll get is a Gmail that is a Google Apps account.
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:01.640]   It's a Twitch Google Apps account.
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:05.800]   Actually, it's funny because Chad, don't we still use our free Google Apps account for
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:07.480]   the rundowns and stuff that we share?
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:09.920]   Or is that on our-- I don't think that's on the apps domain.
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:10.920]   No, that is.
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:11.920]   Oh, OK.
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:14.840]   Because every time I invite someone outside of the apps, it goes, you sure?
[01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:15.840]   Oh, OK, good.
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:17.240]   So we're paying for that.
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:21.080]   But so there was a mini version of this that used to be free?
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:23.080]   Not anymore.
[01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:24.280]   You're going to have to pay for it.
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:26.280]   50 bucks a head per year.
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:27.280]   That's pretty high.
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:28.280]   That's the business cost.
[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:29.280]   Giving you a break, huh?
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:30.280]   Uh-oh.
[01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:32.280]   Oh, Tristan's unhappy at Google.
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:36.560]   Yeah, after hearing that price, I would be too.
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:38.160]   I was almost going to make that noise.
[01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:42.920]   What makes it also interesting is that Outlook is now becoming essentially the Google Docs
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:48.400]   of Microsoft with the online storage and multiple applications.
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:51.640]   And Office 365 is not free, but it's fairly cheap.
[01:34:51.640 --> 01:34:53.800]   What does that mean?
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:55.920]   Five bucks a month, four bucks a month, something like that.
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:56.920]   60 bucks a year.
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:57.920]   So it's the same, I guess.
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:34:58.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:34:59.920]   Yeah.
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:02.520]   It just seems cheaper because you pay them by the month.
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:04.480]   Yeah, that's the idea.
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:07.320]   Did you see now, I want to know what you think of this.
[01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:11.200]   So Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix.
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:15.120]   In June, Netflix hits a billion streams.
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:17.680]   This is very controversial.
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:21.480]   He is now, he puts this out on his Facebook page.
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:24.000]   He has 200,000 subscribers on his Facebook page.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.240]   So he just does a status message.
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:29.440]   For the first time, we streamed a billion hours in June.
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:30.440]   Right.
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:34.040]   SEC has filed a Wells notice saying we're going to prosecute.
[01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:35.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:40.040]   Because this is material information that should have been published to stockholders
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:42.400]   in an official way or a press release.
[01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:43.400]   Channels, yeah.
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:45.240]   Or counts as a press release because you know.
[01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:46.240]   That's a press release.
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:47.240]   No, no.
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:50.240]   Because the media ended up covering it the same way they were with the press release.
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:51.240]   Sure they did.
[01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:53.600]   They, there's an out that he could have got out of.
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:58.480]   There's a process that you could have done the next day which would include doing the
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:00.720]   press, official press release because you have to do these things through channels.
[01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:02.600]   It's just one of the rules.
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:04.120]   And they've refused, they didn't do that.
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:05.160]   That's the real screw up.
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:07.920]   They had 24 hours to fix this problem.
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:12.400]   And so what they did was they let the media itself create an unofficial press release which
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:17.160]   wasn't a press release because I as an investor do not have access to his Facebook account.
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:18.160]   Yes, you do.
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:19.160]   It's public.
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:20.160]   Well, I don't use Facebook.
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:21.160]   Ah, okay.
[01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:24.960]   I don't even expect to be finding, even though most smart investors, they got Twitter accounts,
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:27.280]   they got Facebook account, they're looking at everything.
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:31.760]   And they got, but officially the channel is, it's not an accepted channel from the, as
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:32.960]   far as the SEC is concerned.
[01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:36.040]   So he actually, this violation is going to be a fine.
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:39.600]   He says there was a, there was press coverage as there are many reporters and bloggers among
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:40.680]   you, my public followers.
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:41.680]   Yeah.
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:42.840]   Some of you reposted again.
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:46.280]   We did not issue a press release or file an 8K as required.
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:47.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:48.840]   Or you had to file an 8K the next day.
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:49.840]   Then it would have been good.
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:50.840]   Right.
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:55.640]   The rule is designed to ensure that individual investors, this is read writing on Facebook,
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:59.240]   have equal access to information as large institutional investors, which I support.
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:02.280]   You don't, you don't want secret, you know, missives from the CEO.
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:06.360]   No, curiously though, if you go to these analyst meetings, there's nothing that bothers
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:07.360]   me.
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:08.360]   It happens all the time.
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:11.080]   It happens with Facebook quote unquote analyst meetings.
[01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:16.160]   And so if you're not invited to the analyst meeting, when they get all this insights dope,
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:18.040]   you know, and then they get to distribute it anyway.
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:21.800]   This before the Facebook IPO, we're secretly warned by Mark Zuckerberg and other Facebook
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:24.440]   executives that they were not going to have a good quarter.
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:26.440]   They didn't publish that publicly.
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:27.640]   It happens all the time.
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:31.680]   Meanwhile, Reed Hastings, who first of all is not that material they had already told
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:34.080]   investors were probably going to hit a billions hours.
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:35.080]   Right.
[01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:36.080]   What's a surprise?
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:37.080]   Wasn't a big surprise.
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:40.200]   Post posted for 200,000 people and he's going to get a fine.
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:43.240]   Well, because there's, they had, they're very rules.
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:44.240]   They're rules.
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:45.240]   There's rules.
[01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:47.280]   You know, who should get fine is their lawyer because obviously they should have known
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:48.280]   that, right?
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:51.600]   Well, there's somebody, it's a PR people in the company.
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:56.140]   They know there's usually some expert that there's usually investor relations is not
[01:37:56.140 --> 01:37:57.140]   normal PR.
[01:37:57.140 --> 01:37:58.140]   Some people should be paying attention.
[01:37:58.140 --> 01:38:00.200]   And they're always dogging this stuff, supposedly.
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:03.480]   Now the SEC points out the stock price went up after this.
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:05.280]   A lot.
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:06.280]   He says, well...
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:09.200]   It's just a coincidence.
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:12.120]   The stock price was driven by a city group research report.
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:13.120]   That's bogus.
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:14.120]   No way.
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:17.600]   I have to say, if the stock price goes up because of something you say on a social network and
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:23.080]   not in a legal forum in a way that you're supposed to, it could maybe, I don't know.
[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:24.080]   Price goes down.
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:25.080]   It's the same thing.
[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:27.080]   One of them is basically what Fiddy sent in with his Twitter account.
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:28.080]   Yeah, why isn't Fiddy sent in jail?
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:29.320]   Yeah, this is bothers me too.
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:30.320]   I don't know what to deal with.
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:31.320]   He made millions.
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:32.320]   He made millions.
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:33.320]   Advice, financial advice from Fiddy sent in jail.
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:35.800]   He was essentially a pump and dump.
[01:38:35.800 --> 01:38:38.400]   He said buy a stock in my, what, water company?
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:39.400]   Yeah.
[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:40.400]   And it's got to rocket it.
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:43.480]   It's skyrocketed because everybody follows Fiddy on Twitter.
[01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:47.360]   And these poor people, probably people like my son is a Fiddy fan, spent his last dollar.
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:48.520]   His tweets are hilarious though.
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:51.400]   He treats stuff like, my grandma asked me to take out the trash.
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:52.400]   What the hell?
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:53.400]   I'm rich.
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:54.400]   I shouldn't have to do this.
[01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:55.400]   It's really great.
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:56.400]   It's good stuff.
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:57.400]   And then the pump and dump.
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:58.400]   Henry says, Hank says Fiddy's very smart.
[01:38:58.400 --> 01:38:59.400]   Is he very smart?
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:01.560]   Depends whether he goes to jail or not.
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:02.560]   I don't know.
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:03.560]   He's not.
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:05.200]   No, he didn't get in trouble.
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:06.200]   So I guess he is smart.
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:08.240]   He got in no trouble for that.
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:10.040]   To me, that's- I find that peculiar.
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:11.040]   I know.
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:12.640]   That he didn't get in trouble or that he's smart.
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:16.480]   Whether he's smart or not, I have no idea.
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:17.480]   I'm a follower.
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:19.520]   He's obviously not a dummy.
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:20.960]   Fiddy sent.
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:22.680]   I say it right, by the way.
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:23.680]   That's how the kids say it.
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:24.680]   You know what?
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:25.680]   I thought it was 50.
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:28.000]   He asked people to say 50.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.600]   I used to say 50 cents.
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:31.600]   50 cents.
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:33.280]   Just to drive my kids crazy.
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:38.760]   Oh yeah, I got to do that.
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:42.600]   I don't know if his tweets are that good.
[01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:44.480]   I'm on it like she on it.
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:45.480]   LOL.
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:46.480]   Instagram.
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:47.480]   Okay, so what's the picture?
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:49.240]   But you have to click through now to find out.
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:50.240]   Right, I don't see it.
[01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:51.240]   I'm on the website.
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:52.240]   It's on the theme.
[01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:53.920]   And it used to be that you'd see the picture right there.
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:56.520]   But now you have to actually click and go to the Instagram site.
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:59.320]   Please don't show this screen until we've- Oh good, all right.
[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:00.320]   Yes, that's great.
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:01.320]   That is great.
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:04.840]   Chad has taken a big chance.
[01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:09.400]   Fiddy beast mode.
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:12.280]   I've been taking more people off of who I follow.
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:14.880]   Who posts a four square thing.
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:15.880]   Done.
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:18.080]   That's why you don't follow me anymore.
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:22.400]   No, I only post it when I get a badge like crunk.
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:23.400]   The badges.
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:24.400]   That's another thing.
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:25.400]   I see these guys posting.
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:27.040]   You still sometimes reading Twitter though.
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:29.160]   I just got- I do.
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:30.840]   I just got a badge.
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:32.880]   No, because I have, I use it as a message.
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:37.800]   My motto on Twitter is be fast to follow, but just as fast if not faster to drop.
[01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:38.800]   Because that's really what you're doing.
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:39.800]   You're cultivating your creating.
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:40.800]   Spinning the pump and dump.
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:42.800]   Yeah, I'll pump it up anybody on Twitter.
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:43.800]   What?
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:49.840]   We'll be back in a moment with Moira with John C. de Vorek of No Agenda Show.
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:53.040]   Patrick Norton and Tristan who's sleeping.
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:54.040]   Nice boy.
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:55.280]   How did you get him to sleep?
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:57.520]   You put a thing over his head and walked around.
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:40:58.520]   And a little Armaniac.
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:40:59.600]   That's a joke, by the way.
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:01.160]   Is Armaniac from Armenia?
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:02.160]   No.
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:03.160]   Okay.
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:04.160]   Just checking.
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:05.160]   Arminiac.
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:06.160]   It's Arminiac.
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:07.160]   Arminiac.
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:08.640]   Not Armaniac.
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:10.360]   You drink this stuff.
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:11.360]   I did.
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:12.360]   I ordered some Armaniac.
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:13.360]   Thanks to you.
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:14.360]   Which one?
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:15.360]   No, it was actually not the Armaniac.
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:16.360]   It was the cognac.
[01:41:16.360 --> 01:41:17.360]   It was the cognac.
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:18.360]   It was bottled.
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:19.360]   They have.
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:20.360]   We just opened a nice, I don't know what you're going about.
[01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:22.360]   Can I have some more Cuaranto trace?
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:23.800]   Yeah, this stuff is great.
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:25.080]   That's good stuff.
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:26.720]   Also here, Jolio Del from Venture Beat.
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:28.280]   What are you covering these days?
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:31.480]   Oh, these days I cover Facebook, Google, Twitter.
[01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:33.840]   They're putting me on the Yahoo Beat.
[01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:35.000]   Now that's an interesting one.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.840]   Is Marissa Meyer going to turn Yahoo around?
[01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:37.840]   What's going on over there?
[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:40.400]   I don't know, but I'm just so anxious to find out.
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:41.400]   She's fascinating.
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:42.400]   I think she is.
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:45.040]   And I think Yahoo is kind of a, it's a sad tale.
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:48.200]   It's almost a morality tale for the modern internet.
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:50.120]   Here was a company that was on top of the world.
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:51.120]   I don't know.
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:54.720]   They still got some really great technologists, really clever people working on a really
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:55.720]   great project.
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:57.240]   How do you say that?
[01:41:57.240 --> 01:41:59.200]   Change the name, I guess.
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:01.720]   Get rid of the big Y. Fix everything.
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:04.320]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:09.040]   I want to talk a little bit about getting rid of your gadgets with Gazelle.
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:12.120]   We got a box going together now because I realize this is ridiculous.
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:17.040]   I have thousands of dollars of cell phones and iPods in my drawer.
[01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:20.000]   Gazelle, the whole idea is you've got money.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:23.240]   There's gold in them, they're desk drawers.
[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:28.840]   Everybody I know, every geek I know has a gadget drawer or closet or a room full of
[01:42:28.840 --> 01:42:32.840]   old gadgets and just too much trouble to figure out what to do with it handed off to
[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:34.040]   family and friends.
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:43.040]   You should be going to gaz.com and get cash for that smartphone iPad or iMac.
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:45.440]   Cash so you can get the new stuff.
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:47.760]   Why let this stuff just, you know, freighter away there?
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:51.560]   You got an iPhone 4s just lying around the house.
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:54.760]   You're saying, oh man, I just, I, let's see.
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:55.760]   What is it?
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:57.960]   Is it a 32 gig unlocked AT&T?
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:00.000]   210 bucks.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:01.000]   Bam.
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:02.100]   210 bucks.
[01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:03.100]   That's what they'll pay you for.
[01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:04.100]   What else you got?
[01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:06.040]   You got a third generation iPad.
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:09.280]   Mine around you'd like to, you'd like to buy the new one?
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:10.280]   Sure.
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:13.280]   AT&T, 32 gigabytes.
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:15.000]   300 dollars.
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:20.640]   Now these are guaranteed for 30 days and they paid the shipping on anything worth more
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:21.640]   than a buck.
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:25.360]   So what you do is you say, you add all this to your cart and then you say, okay, send me
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:26.360]   a box.
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:28.920]   You get this nice box with the mailing label of shipping all prepaid.
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:30.440]   Throw this stuff in there.
[01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:37.100]   Package it up, send it off and they will send you a PayPal credit, a check or my advice
[01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:38.180]   to you.
[01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:44.700]   Get the Amazon gift card because they'll bump at 5% if you get an Amazon gift card.
[01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:47.700]   I guess they're rebating the affiliate fee or something like that.
[01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:48.700]   Nice.
[01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:49.700]   Yeah.
[01:43:49.700 --> 01:43:50.700]   This is a nice run company.
[01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:55.180]   Now no wonder they've paid almost $50 million to over 400,000 customers.
[01:43:55.180 --> 01:43:57.300]   I just want you to remember.
[01:43:57.300 --> 01:44:03.900]   When you put your Christmas tree out on the curb and the Cub Scouts come and get it, you
[01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:08.300]   could also be putting a box out there full of cell phones and the Cub Scouts would come
[01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:14.220]   and get it and give you nothing or gazelle and give you hundreds and hundreds of dollars.
[01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:18.020]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, gazelle.com.
[01:44:18.020 --> 01:44:20.580]   If you were smart, actually I think they used to do this.
[01:44:20.580 --> 01:44:22.060]   They used to, I don't know if they still do.
[01:44:22.060 --> 01:44:27.100]   They do like charity things where you could put together a gazelle drive, a gadget drive.
[01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:29.460]   I don't know if they still do that.
[01:44:29.460 --> 01:44:33.740]   One million gadgets traded.
[01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:34.740]   Where's my phone?
[01:44:34.740 --> 01:44:35.740]   I want to play ingress.
[01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:36.740]   Oh, here we go.
[01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:39.140]   You know, I'm looking over the Google Web fonts.

[01:54:23.980 --> 01:54:24.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:24.980 --> 01:54:25.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:25.980 --> 01:54:26.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:26.980 --> 01:54:27.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:27.980 --> 01:54:28.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:28.980 --> 01:54:29.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:29.980 --> 01:54:30.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:31.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:31.980 --> 01:54:32.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:32.980 --> 01:54:33.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:33.980 --> 01:54:34.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:34.980 --> 01:54:35.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:35.980 --> 01:54:36.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:36.980 --> 01:54:37.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:38.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:38.980 --> 01:54:39.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:39.980 --> 01:54:40.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:40.980 --> 01:54:41.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:41.980 --> 01:54:42.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:42.980 --> 01:54:43.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:43.980 --> 01:54:44.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:45.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:45.980 --> 01:54:46.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:46.980 --> 01:54:47.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:47.980 --> 01:54:48.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:49.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:49.980 --> 01:54:50.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:50.980 --> 01:54:51.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:51.980 --> 01:54:52.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:52.980 --> 01:54:53.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:53.980 --> 01:54:54.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:55.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:55.980 --> 01:54:56.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:54:56.980 --> 01:54:57.980]   And then you'd have to do it.

[01:55:00.980 --> 01:55:01.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:55:01.980 --> 01:55:02.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:03.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:55:03.980 --> 01:55:04.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:55:04.980 --> 01:55:05.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:55:05.980 --> 01:55:06.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:55:06.980 --> 01:55:07.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:55:07.980 --> 01:55:08.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:55:08.980 --> 01:55:09.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:10.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:55:10.980 --> 01:55:11.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:55:11.980 --> 01:55:12.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:13.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:14.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:55:14.980 --> 01:55:15.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:55:15.980 --> 01:55:16.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:55:16.980 --> 01:55:17.980]   And then you'd have to do it.
[01:55:18.980 --> 01:55:19.980]   It sounds like you've been there actually.
[01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:20.980]   Sounds like...
[01:55:20.980 --> 01:55:21.980]   Yes, yes I have.
[01:55:21.980 --> 01:55:22.980]   Yeah.
[01:55:22.980 --> 01:55:23.980]   It's actually more like 136th Street.
[01:55:23.980 --> 01:55:25.980]   Ah, great at neighborhood.
[01:55:25.980 --> 01:55:28.980]   Now John knows why I can go back in the subway.
[01:55:28.980 --> 01:55:33.980]   Verizon is going to start targeted advertising this week.
[01:55:33.980 --> 01:55:34.980]   You're going to love this one.
[01:55:34.980 --> 01:55:36.980]   If you're customer of Verizon,
[01:55:36.980 --> 01:55:40.980]   watch for an email text message or notification mentioning
[01:55:40.980 --> 01:55:43.980]   their new Verizon Selects program.
[01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:46.980]   In exchange for sharing your data usage, such as location,
[01:55:46.980 --> 01:55:50.980]   this is on your smartphone, web browsing, and mobile app usage data,
[01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:53.980]   you'll get targeted advertisements delivered to you by email,
[01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:57.980]   text messaging or other form of mobile advertising.
[01:55:57.980 --> 01:56:00.980]   So in exchange for your data, you get ads that sounds like a lose-lose.
[01:56:00.980 --> 01:56:02.980]   Does it sound like you're getting any benefit?
[01:56:02.980 --> 01:56:03.980]   Like gee.
[01:56:03.980 --> 01:56:06.980]   You can opt out by saying no.
[01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:08.980]   Opting a way, here's your reward.
[01:56:08.980 --> 01:56:09.980]   You don't get to opt in.
[01:56:09.980 --> 01:56:10.980]   You have to opt out.
[01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:11.980]   You have to opt out.
[01:56:11.980 --> 01:56:12.980]   Oh boy.
[01:56:12.980 --> 01:56:14.980]   If you don't opt out, you will get a coupon.
[01:56:14.980 --> 01:56:16.980]   Oh, cool.
[01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:18.980]   That's better than a badge.
[01:56:18.980 --> 01:56:23.980]   Or some other, quote, some other form of reward from Verizon.
[01:56:23.980 --> 01:56:25.980]   Oh, so maybe a badge after all.
[01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:26.980]   Knock on wood, a cross.
[01:56:26.980 --> 01:56:27.980]   A sticker.
[01:56:27.980 --> 01:56:30.980]   A sticker that says Verizon.
[01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:33.980]   Well, if you're a Verizon customer, just look for that email any day now.
[01:56:33.980 --> 01:56:35.980]   Just a lame-o badge.
[01:56:35.980 --> 01:56:36.980]   Isn't that funny?
[01:56:36.980 --> 01:56:37.980]   Everybody's going to do this.
[01:56:37.980 --> 01:56:38.980]   You know what's annoying?
[01:56:38.980 --> 01:56:41.980]   I got a Panasonic Vira television.
[01:56:41.980 --> 01:56:43.980]   It's expensive television.
[01:56:43.980 --> 01:56:45.980]   $3,000 televisions.
[01:56:45.980 --> 01:56:46.980]   HD display.
[01:56:46.980 --> 01:56:47.980]   Was it a--
[01:56:47.980 --> 01:56:48.980]   When I turn up--
[01:56:48.980 --> 01:56:49.980]   Is that a plasma or is that a plasma?
[01:56:49.980 --> 01:56:50.980]   Yeah, it's a plasma.
[01:56:50.980 --> 01:56:51.980]   When I turn up--
[01:56:51.980 --> 01:56:52.980]   It's beautiful.
[01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:53.980]   It is.
[01:56:53.980 --> 01:56:54.980]   It's beautiful.
[01:56:54.980 --> 01:56:56.980]   But when I turn up the volume, I get an ad for Capital One credit cards.
[01:56:56.980 --> 01:56:57.980]   What?
[01:56:57.980 --> 01:56:58.980]   I kid you not.
[01:56:58.980 --> 01:56:59.980]   You turn the volume up.
[01:56:59.980 --> 01:57:03.980]   There's the volume slider pops up and then below it an ad.
[01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:04.980]   A banner ad.
[01:57:04.980 --> 01:57:05.980]   Really?
[01:57:05.980 --> 01:57:06.980]   While I'm watching TV.
[01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:07.980]   On the volume--
[01:57:07.980 --> 01:57:08.980]   On the volume?
[01:57:08.980 --> 01:57:09.980]   Doesn't that--
[01:57:09.980 --> 01:57:11.980]   Like I didn't pay enough money for this TV.
[01:57:11.980 --> 01:57:13.980]   We got to make a little extra.
[01:57:13.980 --> 01:57:16.980]   I'll have a spare room for you and my cabin in the woods.
[01:57:16.980 --> 01:57:17.980]   Okay, up in the mountains.
[01:57:17.980 --> 01:57:18.980]   Raising my children's headphones.
[01:57:18.980 --> 01:57:19.980]   Isn't that offensive?
[01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:22.980]   Almost as offensive as ballparks having advertising on them.
[01:57:22.980 --> 01:57:23.980]   Everybody.
[01:57:23.980 --> 01:57:24.980]   You know what's happening?
[01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:25.980]   It's Philip D. Dickland.
[01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:30.980]   It was those crappy minor leagueparks that were all covered with ads.
[01:57:30.980 --> 01:57:33.980]   And you always said, "Wow, those things are really rinky dink."
[01:57:33.980 --> 01:57:36.980]   And the major leagueparks never had these ads everywhere.
[01:57:36.980 --> 01:57:37.980]   They never did.
[01:57:37.980 --> 01:57:39.980]   Now somebody started doing it.
[01:57:39.980 --> 01:57:42.980]   The next thing you know now you go to a giant park.
[01:57:42.980 --> 01:57:43.980]   It's all ads.
[01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:44.980]   The whole place is crawling with them.
[01:57:44.980 --> 01:57:46.980]   Simple 3.12 says I'm sounding like Andy Rooney.
[01:57:46.980 --> 01:57:49.980]   What's all this about ads on my volume control?
[01:57:49.980 --> 01:57:51.980]   You do sound a little like him anyway.
[01:57:51.980 --> 01:57:54.980]   Well, but I don't think I should have to see an ad when I want to turn up the TV volume.
[01:57:54.980 --> 01:57:55.980]   That's ridiculous.
[01:57:55.980 --> 01:57:57.980]   And that'll just be $5 a month.
[01:57:57.980 --> 01:57:58.980]   Yeah.
[01:57:58.980 --> 01:58:05.980]   Now I understand when you go to the Panasonic, I guess, Vira Connects or whatever.
[01:58:05.980 --> 01:58:06.980]   There's smart apps.
[01:58:06.980 --> 01:58:07.980]   There's lots of ads.
[01:58:07.980 --> 01:58:08.980]   There's actually video ads.
[01:58:08.980 --> 01:58:09.980]   It starts playing in the corner.
[01:58:09.980 --> 01:58:10.980]   There's a banner ad below.
[01:58:10.980 --> 01:58:12.980]   That's how you get to Netflix or whatever.
[01:58:12.980 --> 01:58:13.980]   You have to-- there's an ad.
[01:58:13.980 --> 01:58:14.980]   There's audio.
[01:58:14.980 --> 01:58:15.980]   An ad going.
[01:58:15.980 --> 01:58:17.980]   Well, what about visual tune out?
[01:58:17.980 --> 01:58:22.980]   When do advertisers realize that the more they annoy us, the more we ignore them?
[01:58:22.980 --> 01:58:23.980]   Exactly.
[01:58:23.980 --> 01:58:26.980]   I mean, when do they realize that these ads on-- and name a social network, name a website,
[01:58:26.980 --> 01:58:27.980]   are completely ineffective.
[01:58:27.980 --> 01:58:28.980]   The click-through rates are in the--
[01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:29.980]   And the more you see--
[01:58:29.980 --> 01:58:31.980]   The conversion rates are even lower.
[01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:32.980]   Social media is as a book set.
[01:58:32.980 --> 01:58:36.980]   What's the conversion rate on an ad on the volume control on a TV set?
[01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:39.980]   And how would you even measure it?
[01:58:39.980 --> 01:58:40.980]   John says--
[01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:41.980]   The book tells me--
[01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:42.980]   I know.
[01:58:42.980 --> 01:58:46.980]   --it sounds like there's somebody's-- some sharp operator sold the idea to these guys.
[01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:48.980]   Merry Christmas, everybody.
[01:58:48.980 --> 01:58:49.980]   Jeez.
[01:58:49.980 --> 01:58:50.980]   Kind of hard to believe.
[01:58:50.980 --> 01:58:51.980]   Bah, I'm back.
[01:58:51.980 --> 01:58:52.980]   I know, right?
[01:58:52.980 --> 01:58:53.980]   Move on.
[01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:55.980]   So, Jolie is more of a emergent than I am.
[01:58:55.980 --> 01:58:56.980]   Oh, much more.
[01:58:56.980 --> 01:58:57.980]   Really?
[01:58:57.980 --> 01:58:58.980]   She is grumpy.
[01:58:58.980 --> 01:58:59.980]   Yeah.
[01:58:59.980 --> 01:59:01.980]   And what am I going to do in this cabin in the woods, by the way?
[01:59:01.980 --> 01:59:02.980]   Why are you--
[01:59:02.980 --> 01:59:03.980]   Well, we're going to play Yazzi.
[01:59:03.980 --> 01:59:05.980]   There's this great game called "Men in Night Madness."
[01:59:05.980 --> 01:59:06.980]   It's part--
[01:59:06.980 --> 01:59:07.980]   It's part of--
[01:59:07.980 --> 01:59:08.980]   Men in Night Madness.
[01:59:08.980 --> 01:59:11.980]   You get paper and a-- yeah, the neck beard's sister and brother-in-law taught it to be--
[01:59:11.980 --> 01:59:13.980]   Now, he's referred to as the neck beard.
[01:59:13.980 --> 01:59:16.980]   Aaron, I dump this later in minute, if I--
[01:59:16.980 --> 01:59:20.980]   Aaron, don't do the dishes and make a sleep on the couch.
[01:59:20.980 --> 01:59:22.980]   What is "Men in Night Madness"?
[01:59:22.980 --> 01:59:23.980]   Okay, "Men in Night Madness."
[01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:25.980]   Oh, you're-- wait, first of all, do you have "Men in Night" relatives?
[01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:26.980]   No.
[01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:31.980]   He grew up in this really amish part of Pennsylvania, though, so to tease him, I call him a Mormon.
[01:59:31.980 --> 01:59:32.980]   But anyways--
[01:59:32.980 --> 01:59:33.980]   That makes sense.
[01:59:33.980 --> 01:59:34.980]   It doesn't, though.
[01:59:34.980 --> 01:59:35.980]   That's the great thing about coming with me.
[01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:36.980]   Oh, I get it.
[01:59:36.980 --> 01:59:37.980]   No, I get it.
[01:59:37.980 --> 01:59:40.980]   He's actually-- he's much more of a tech lover than you are.
[01:59:40.980 --> 01:59:42.980]   You're the-- you're the Luddite in the family.
[01:59:42.980 --> 01:59:43.980]   Well, I balance this out.
[01:59:43.980 --> 01:59:44.980]   You know, he's an entrepreneur.
[01:59:44.980 --> 01:59:47.980]   He's a founder, so I haven't even really seen him since we got married.
[01:59:47.980 --> 01:59:48.980]   I just bake.
[01:59:48.980 --> 01:59:49.980]   When are you launching?
[01:59:49.980 --> 01:59:51.980]   January, come back.
[01:59:51.980 --> 01:59:52.980]   Tell us all about it.
[01:59:52.980 --> 01:59:53.980]   Is it stealth?
[01:59:53.980 --> 01:59:54.980]   He's in stealth for--
[01:59:54.980 --> 01:59:55.980]   Ish, he got coming on the--
[01:59:55.980 --> 01:59:56.980]   What's it got to do with, though?
[01:59:56.980 --> 01:59:57.980]   Is it--
[01:59:57.980 --> 01:59:58.980]   Is it--
[01:59:58.980 --> 01:59:59.980]   He's got coverage?
[01:59:59.980 --> 02:00:00.980]   Mm-hmm.
[02:00:00.980 --> 02:00:01.980]   Where?
[02:00:01.980 --> 02:00:02.980]   Internet.
[02:00:02.980 --> 02:00:05.980]   What is a Mennonite madness?
[02:00:05.980 --> 02:00:06.980]   So, okay.
[02:00:06.980 --> 02:00:09.980]   It's the stupidest game, but it's hilarious when you get people together.
[02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:12.980]   You get a pencil, one pencil, and everyone gets a sheet of paper.
[02:00:12.980 --> 02:00:13.980]   Yeah.
[02:00:13.980 --> 02:00:16.980]   And you write down numbers one to 100 as fast as you can.
[02:00:16.980 --> 02:00:17.980]   Yeah.
[02:00:17.980 --> 02:00:18.980]   But how does it work?
[02:00:18.980 --> 02:00:22.980]   Someone has to throw the pencil in the middle of the table when someone's done counting the--
[02:00:22.980 --> 02:00:23.980]   I don't know.
[02:00:23.980 --> 02:00:24.980]   It's like spit.
[02:00:24.980 --> 02:00:25.980]   Take out an eye.
[02:00:25.980 --> 02:00:26.980]   It makes sense when you have no electricity.
[02:00:26.980 --> 02:00:27.980]   Exactly.
[02:00:27.980 --> 02:00:30.980]   Among these groups of people, there are a lot of games where you slap, spit, yell, scream,
[02:00:30.980 --> 02:00:32.980]   throw things.
[02:00:32.980 --> 02:00:34.980]   It's, I think, a kind of deep-rooted unhappiness that they're just expressing.
[02:00:34.980 --> 02:00:36.980]   Yeah, I'm agreeing with you on this.
[02:00:36.980 --> 02:00:37.980]   Yeah.
[02:00:37.980 --> 02:00:38.980]   Yeah.
[02:00:38.980 --> 02:00:39.980]   Yeah.
[02:00:39.980 --> 02:00:40.980]   Yeah.
[02:00:40.980 --> 02:00:41.980]   Yeah.
[02:00:41.980 --> 02:00:42.980]   Yeah.
[02:00:42.980 --> 02:00:43.980]   Why don't you go take your little--
[02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:44.980]   You ever play spit?
[02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:49.980]   Progress and go have a good time with your neighbors here, friends and neighbors and friends.
[02:00:49.980 --> 02:00:50.980]   I'm going--
[02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:51.980]   I'm going--
[02:00:51.980 --> 02:00:52.980]   I'm going--
[02:00:52.980 --> 02:00:53.980]   I'm going--
[02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:54.980]   I'm going--
[02:00:54.980 --> 02:00:55.980]   I'm going--
[02:00:55.980 --> 02:00:56.980]   I'm going--
[02:00:56.980 --> 02:00:57.980]   I'm going--
[02:00:57.980 --> 02:00:58.980]   Sharing your location--
[02:00:58.980 --> 02:00:59.980]   --and everything.
[02:00:59.980 --> 02:01:00.980]   --on to it.
[02:01:00.980 --> 02:01:01.980]   Know how.
[02:01:01.980 --> 02:01:03.980]   We're going to show you how to rip DVDs.
[02:01:03.980 --> 02:01:05.980]   It doesn't everybody know how.
[02:01:05.980 --> 02:01:06.980]   But this is more than just ripping.
[02:01:06.980 --> 02:01:07.980]   More than just that.
[02:01:07.980 --> 02:01:08.980]   Putting them on your Apple TV.
[02:01:08.980 --> 02:01:10.980]   Well, you're holding the Apple TV right there.
[02:01:10.980 --> 02:01:11.980]   I got a DVD over here.
[02:01:11.980 --> 02:01:14.980]   If you notice something, Apple TVs don't have optical drives.
[02:01:14.980 --> 02:01:15.980]   So this is going to be--
[02:01:15.980 --> 02:01:16.980]   I can't confirm.
[02:01:16.980 --> 02:01:20.980]   Not as easy as it should be, but kind of make things complex because it's a lot more fun.
[02:01:20.980 --> 02:01:21.980]   This week in Google.
[02:01:21.980 --> 02:01:24.980]   You know, I'm friends with Vic and Dr., who's, you know, the senior VP.
[02:01:24.980 --> 02:01:28.980]   So I sent him an email about two weeks ago and I was like, you know, I know YouTube and
[02:01:28.980 --> 02:01:30.980]   Google+ are starting to do this merge.
[02:01:30.980 --> 02:01:32.980]   I said, there's going to be some backlash.
[02:01:32.980 --> 02:01:36.980]   You need to, you know, talk to some YouTube people about this.
[02:01:36.980 --> 02:01:39.980]   And he wrote me back and was like, what backlash?
[02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:41.980]   YouTube partners are-- they love this idea.
[02:01:41.980 --> 02:01:42.980]   They're all on board.
[02:01:42.980 --> 02:01:46.980]   And I was like, someone is protecting you from the new victory.
[02:01:46.980 --> 02:01:47.980]   That's true.
[02:01:47.980 --> 02:01:48.980]   That's true.
[02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:49.980]   This is not true.
[02:01:49.980 --> 02:01:50.980]   Frame rate.
[02:01:50.980 --> 02:01:51.980]   Baby metal.
[02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:54.980]   If you're not familiar with baby metal, I'm a full grown man rapidly approaching my 40s.
[02:01:54.980 --> 02:01:59.980]   And I'm in love with this fusion of Japanese pop and death metal.
[02:01:59.980 --> 02:02:00.980]   Gizwiz.
[02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:09.980]   This part of the tie has the tube that you drink the liquid from that you put in the bladder that you consider.
[02:02:09.980 --> 02:02:14.980]   Now presumably, you would want to go in a private while you're doing this.
[02:02:14.980 --> 02:02:18.980]   You know, I just pick up your socks and start sucking from it.
[02:02:18.980 --> 02:02:19.980]   Twit.
[02:02:19.980 --> 02:02:20.980]   Test drive one today.
[02:02:20.980 --> 02:02:22.980]   Two, tie, sucking.
[02:02:22.980 --> 02:02:23.980]   Son of a gun.
[02:02:23.980 --> 02:02:24.980]   Hey, you know what, Leo?
[02:02:24.980 --> 02:02:25.980]   What?
[02:02:25.980 --> 02:02:27.980]   I love these house ads.
[02:02:27.980 --> 02:02:28.980]   It's so funny.
[02:02:28.980 --> 02:02:35.980]   Now apparently, I'm being told about some sort of-- this is ingress.
[02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:41.980]   Apparently-- aren't they dramatizing this thing a little bit too much?
[02:02:41.980 --> 02:02:45.980]   Well, what's funny is if it is merely just a way to mine location and made--
[02:02:45.980 --> 02:02:46.980]   Yeah, data mining.
[02:02:46.980 --> 02:02:47.980]   It's really kind of funny that it's--
[02:02:47.980 --> 02:02:48.980]   It's really kind of funny that it's--
[02:02:48.980 --> 02:02:50.980]   And coming message from Ada.
[02:02:50.980 --> 02:02:51.980]   I'll play it later.
[02:02:51.980 --> 02:02:52.980]   This is so sad.
[02:02:52.980 --> 02:02:53.980]   Oh, I can't wait.
[02:02:53.980 --> 02:02:54.980]   I'm excited.
[02:02:54.980 --> 02:02:55.980]   I'm a dying thank you, Jeff.
[02:02:55.980 --> 02:02:56.980]   I'm a dying, thank you, Jeff.
[02:02:56.980 --> 02:02:58.980]   I'm having everyone's secret desire to work in international intelligence.
[02:02:58.980 --> 02:02:59.980]   I want to be a spy.
[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:01.980]   Apparently, this wouldn't seem so.
[02:03:01.980 --> 02:03:04.980]   In reality, we don't know enough languages or have good enough credit, and that's the truth.
[02:03:04.980 --> 02:03:09.980]   And what is by far the greatest DMCA mess we've ever witnessed?
[02:03:09.980 --> 02:03:10.980]   Right, it's torrent freak.
[02:03:10.980 --> 02:03:16.980]   Several major movie studios have seemingly asked Google to take down legitimate copies of their own films.
[02:03:16.980 --> 02:03:21.980]   Through an agent the studios further request the search agent to remove their official Facebook pages
[02:03:21.980 --> 02:03:26.980]   and Wikipedia entries as well as movie reviews and prominent newspapers.
[02:03:26.980 --> 02:03:29.980]   People just don't understand how Google works.
[02:03:29.980 --> 02:03:30.980]   Apparently.
[02:03:30.980 --> 02:03:31.980]   It's stunning to me.
[02:03:31.980 --> 02:03:32.980]   It's amazing.
[02:03:32.980 --> 02:03:33.980]   Yeah.
[02:03:33.980 --> 02:03:34.980]   I'm always amazing.
[02:03:34.980 --> 02:03:41.980]   Lionsgate sent a DMCA notice to Google saying remove links to copies of Cabin in the Woods,
[02:03:41.980 --> 02:03:43.980]   including to the official website.
[02:03:43.980 --> 02:03:44.980]   These are all on a generator.
[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:45.980]   It's automatic.
[02:03:45.980 --> 02:03:46.980]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[02:03:46.980 --> 02:03:50.980]   Oh, we've seen movie review shows with stuff.
[02:03:50.980 --> 02:03:53.980]   It's been sent out by the theaters get season-desists ordered.
[02:03:53.980 --> 02:03:54.980]   Right.
[02:03:54.980 --> 02:03:55.980]   Take down notices.
[02:03:55.980 --> 02:03:57.980]   Well, routinely we'll get shows this weekend enterprise.
[02:03:57.980 --> 02:03:58.980]   A better script.
[02:03:58.980 --> 02:03:59.980]   Oh, somebody woke up.
[02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:04.980]   This weekend enterprise tech got a take down on YouTube this week or a couple of weeks ago,
[02:04:04.980 --> 02:04:09.980]   because apparently they had some content from a Brazilian movie company, which of course they didn't.
[02:04:09.980 --> 02:04:12.980]   But the appeal processes are cane.
[02:04:12.980 --> 02:04:13.980]   It's just ridiculous.
[02:04:13.980 --> 02:04:16.980]   And they take you down immediately.
[02:04:16.980 --> 02:04:17.980]   Yeah.
[02:04:17.980 --> 02:04:21.980]   Well, it's just easier to do that and then not worry about it.
[02:04:21.980 --> 02:04:22.980]   It's just a crapshoot.
[02:04:22.980 --> 02:04:26.980]   If I was Google, I'd just take it down and let it stay down.
[02:04:26.980 --> 02:04:27.980]   Yeah.
[02:04:27.980 --> 02:04:28.980]   Why should they get in trouble with that?
[02:04:28.980 --> 02:04:33.980]   Well, no, because then the people who are trying to get them in trouble end up losing a bunch.
[02:04:33.980 --> 02:04:34.980]   Business.
[02:04:34.980 --> 02:04:35.980]   They lose business.
[02:04:35.980 --> 02:04:36.980]   All right.
[02:04:36.980 --> 02:04:37.980]   Look closely at this.
[02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:39.980]   Is that Steve Jobs or Ashton Kutcher?
[02:04:39.980 --> 02:04:40.980]   That's Ashton Kutcher.
[02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:41.980]   Playing Steve Jobs.
[02:04:41.980 --> 02:04:43.980]   My vision is excellent.
[02:04:43.980 --> 02:04:48.980]   We're going to see this at Sundance in January.
[02:04:48.980 --> 02:04:55.980]   The new biopic of Steve Jobs starring Ashton Kutcher covers 30 years of Jobs' life from 1971 to 2000.
[02:04:55.980 --> 02:04:58.980]   This is not the movie based on the Isaacson book.
[02:04:58.980 --> 02:05:00.980]   Sony is making that one.
[02:05:00.980 --> 02:05:05.980]   And that one, Aaron Sorkin, who's writing the script for that one, apparently it's all going
[02:05:05.980 --> 02:05:06.980]   to be flashback.
[02:05:06.980 --> 02:05:07.980]   That's how he did the social network.
[02:05:07.980 --> 02:05:12.980]   And it's going to be based around, it's going to be Steve Jobs backstage at three big Apple announcements.
[02:05:12.980 --> 02:05:14.980]   It's the whole movie.
[02:05:14.980 --> 02:05:15.980]   Fascinating.
[02:05:15.980 --> 02:05:16.980]   Can't wait.
[02:05:16.980 --> 02:05:17.980]   I can.
[02:05:17.980 --> 02:05:22.980]   This is just 10 years extra from where Pirates of Silicon Valley left off.
[02:05:22.980 --> 02:05:23.980]   Right.
[02:05:23.980 --> 02:05:24.980]   I agree.
[02:05:24.980 --> 02:05:25.980]   No, while it should be done.
[02:05:25.980 --> 02:05:26.980]   Oh, I like it.
[02:05:26.980 --> 02:05:27.980]   Interesting part.
[02:05:27.980 --> 02:05:30.980]   After the iPod and the iPhone, why did they leave the cool bits out?
[02:05:30.980 --> 02:05:32.980]   Because that's what we know him for now.
[02:05:32.980 --> 02:05:33.980]   I know.
[02:05:33.980 --> 02:05:34.980]   And I'm not even an Apple fan.
[02:05:34.980 --> 02:05:38.980]   I hate all that crap, but that's the good part of the story I would think.
[02:05:38.980 --> 02:05:40.980]   But you can tell that's Ashton Kutcher.
[02:05:40.980 --> 02:05:43.980]   If anybody with a beard, I would probably, you could pose as Steve Jobs, if I had the beard
[02:05:43.980 --> 02:05:44.980]   and the hair.
[02:05:44.980 --> 02:05:45.980]   Would you like to?
[02:05:45.980 --> 02:05:46.980]   And we're 40 pounds.
[02:05:46.980 --> 02:05:48.980]   You want to do this 50 years younger?
[02:05:48.980 --> 02:05:50.980]   I got time.
[02:05:50.980 --> 02:05:53.980]   You got some beard with you?
[02:05:53.980 --> 02:05:54.980]   Yeah.
[02:05:54.980 --> 02:05:55.980]   In the suitcase?
[02:05:55.980 --> 02:05:56.980]   Oh, can I borrow Aaron's beard?
[02:05:56.980 --> 02:05:57.980]   Yeah.
[02:05:57.980 --> 02:05:58.980]   Alright.
[02:05:58.980 --> 02:05:59.980]   That was right off.
[02:05:59.980 --> 02:06:00.980]   Is it Menonite beard?
[02:06:00.980 --> 02:06:01.980]   She just makes him wear it.
[02:06:01.980 --> 02:06:03.980]   No, I think we've got a Sharpie in here somewhere.
[02:06:03.980 --> 02:06:04.980]   Oh, just draw it on.
[02:06:04.980 --> 02:06:05.980]   I'm a Sharpie.
[02:06:05.980 --> 02:06:06.980]   That's easy.
[02:06:06.980 --> 02:06:07.980]   No, she loves beard.
[02:06:07.980 --> 02:06:08.980]   She said it on show one.
[02:06:08.980 --> 02:06:13.980]   You could, actually, if Aaron died his beard and hair, and wore black turtleneck and a t-shirt.
[02:06:13.980 --> 02:06:14.980]   Yeah.
[02:06:14.980 --> 02:06:15.980]   Yeah.
[02:06:15.980 --> 02:06:17.980]   Alright, I'm going to shut this.
[02:06:17.980 --> 02:06:18.980]   I'm going to shut this puppy down.
[02:06:18.980 --> 02:06:19.980]   It's about time.
[02:06:19.980 --> 02:06:21.980]   It's really gone on way too long.
[02:06:21.980 --> 02:06:22.980]   Yeah, no.
[02:06:22.980 --> 02:06:23.980]   It's over.
[02:06:23.980 --> 02:06:24.980]   The show should be an hour and a half.
[02:06:24.980 --> 02:06:25.980]   It should be.
[02:06:25.980 --> 02:06:26.980]   Yeah.
[02:06:26.980 --> 02:06:27.980]   We've got to figure our way to do that.
[02:06:27.980 --> 02:06:29.980]   Well, why don't I just speed it up?
[02:06:29.980 --> 02:06:32.980]   I'm going to speed it up 25% to be an hour and a half.
[02:06:32.980 --> 02:06:33.980]   You could.
[02:06:33.980 --> 02:06:34.980]   You could.
[02:06:34.980 --> 02:06:35.980]   You could.
[02:06:35.980 --> 02:06:37.980]   If we all talk like his or a friend.
[02:06:37.980 --> 02:06:38.980]   Yeah.
[02:06:38.980 --> 02:06:39.980]   You have a staccato kind of.
[02:06:39.980 --> 02:06:41.980]   Yeah, and then over.
[02:06:41.980 --> 02:06:42.980]   It's done.
[02:06:42.980 --> 02:06:43.980]   Joly, thank you.
[02:06:43.980 --> 02:06:44.980]   We ate half the brownies.
[02:06:44.980 --> 02:06:46.980]   Well, you can take the other half homes.
[02:06:46.980 --> 02:06:47.980]   Oh, not me.
[02:06:47.980 --> 02:06:48.980]   Oh, no.
[02:06:48.980 --> 02:06:49.980]   John.
[02:06:49.980 --> 02:06:50.980]   Yeah, I'll take them.
[02:06:50.980 --> 02:06:51.980]   Okay, great.
[02:06:51.980 --> 02:06:53.980]   You should, Kevro says you should be in a new movie.
[02:06:53.980 --> 02:06:54.980]   Calm and calmer.
[02:06:54.980 --> 02:06:55.980]   I like it.
[02:06:55.980 --> 02:06:56.980]   You're very calming.
[02:06:56.980 --> 02:06:57.980]   I'm soothing.
[02:06:57.980 --> 02:06:58.980]   Relaxing.
[02:06:58.980 --> 02:06:59.980]   Oh.
[02:06:59.980 --> 02:07:00.980]   She's relaxed.
[02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:01.980]   You're relaxed.
[02:07:01.980 --> 02:07:02.980]   Okay.
[02:07:02.980 --> 02:07:03.980]   Okay.
[02:07:03.980 --> 02:07:05.980]   Would you put your finger on my lip when you do that?
[02:07:05.980 --> 02:07:06.980]   She'd go, "Hey, hey, hey, let's get this over here."
[02:07:06.980 --> 02:07:08.980]   She's getting a little too much here.
[02:07:08.980 --> 02:07:10.980]   She's going to just bugging me.
[02:07:10.980 --> 02:07:14.980]   Don't you ever, don't you ever, you know, you go, "Oh, they do this in the ads now."
[02:07:14.980 --> 02:07:15.980]   Yeah, I know.
[02:07:15.980 --> 02:07:17.980]   No, no, no, no, no.
[02:07:17.980 --> 02:07:19.980]   Yeah, it's a bit cliched.
[02:07:19.980 --> 02:07:20.980]   I know.
[02:07:20.980 --> 02:07:21.980]   It's way overused.
[02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:23.980]   By the way, I'll never know.
[02:07:23.980 --> 02:07:24.980]   We'll talk about it later.
[02:07:24.980 --> 02:07:26.980]   John C. Devorak, not way overused.
[02:07:26.980 --> 02:07:28.980]   Just wrote hard and put away what.
[02:07:28.980 --> 02:07:32.980]   He is the star of No Agenda Show, No Agenda Show.com.
[02:07:32.980 --> 02:07:34.980]   Is that Ashton Kutcher?
[02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:36.980]   Ashton Kutcher is his I.C.E.O.
[02:07:36.980 --> 02:07:38.980]   Patrick Norton and the baby Tristan.
[02:07:38.980 --> 02:07:40.980]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:07:40.980 --> 02:07:45.980]   So, things going well at TechSilla, the revision three folks in Discovery have merged in Harmony.
[02:07:45.980 --> 02:07:46.980]   Yes.
[02:07:46.980 --> 02:07:47.980]   Yes.
[02:07:47.980 --> 02:07:48.980]   Look at that.

[02:07:49.980 --> 02:07:51.980]   Tristan loves Steve Jobs.
[02:07:51.980 --> 02:07:52.980]   Look at that.
[02:07:52.980 --> 02:07:54.980]   We get a little I.B.A.A.I. baby in the make-up here.
[02:07:54.980 --> 02:07:55.980]   Steve Jobs.
[02:07:55.980 --> 02:07:57.980]   I'm Steve Jobs.
[02:07:57.980 --> 02:07:59.980]   He's got knees just like everybody else.
[02:07:59.980 --> 02:08:01.980]   I'm an excellent person.
[02:08:01.980 --> 02:08:04.980]   I make computers and I'm Steve Jobs.
[02:08:04.980 --> 02:08:06.980]   His nose is getting bigger, Tristan.
[02:08:06.980 --> 02:08:08.980]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:08:08.980 --> 02:08:10.980]   Thanks for joining us.
