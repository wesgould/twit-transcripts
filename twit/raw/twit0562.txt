[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   It's time for Twit this week at Tech, the show where we talk about the week's tech news.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   It's going to be a big week ahead and we've got a great panel to discuss it.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   The week behind and the week ahead starting with Steve Kovac joining us from what used to be a business insider.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Now it's the special Tech Insider publication within business insider Tech Insider.io. Steve, great to have you.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Hey, thanks for having me back. Techinsider.io. Is it fair to say that that is inside?
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Business Insider. It's the first spin-off site that the company has done so it's a totally separate publication.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   It's really outside business inside. It's outside but I still work in the same newsroom as all the other business insider folks.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   So it's same company. I love this.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Why Minecraft is so incredible and there's a picture of a battleship and a harbor.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   People do crazy stuff in Minecraft.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   They do. It's so much fun. I should show you somebody else show you the Twit Minecraft build.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   It's a whole gorgeous city and there are ships in the harbor and all sorts of stuff.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   I've become a Minecraft fanatic and now we started playing it in VR and it's really fun.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   The mine con is in California this year.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Is it? Your son probably told you that.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   My son wanted very badly to go. They sold them in two batches of 6,000 each batch went in a minute.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   What? Yeah.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   That's by the way Denise Howell of course from this weekend law always a thrill to have Denise on Twit.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   You can see her every week every Thursday on Thursday or Friday.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Friday. Friday. Sorry.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I know it's on my day off because I listen. I sit in my jammies and I listen to this weekend law.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   There's some law to talk about. Big, big case going on Google versus Oracle.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   It's back in court and we're starting to hear arguments and it's kind of mind boggling.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Also joining us I'm thrilled to have a guy who hasn't been on Twit in quite some time
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   but a man I've always admired going back to the 90s when he was a Silicon Valley reporter
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   for the San Jose Mercury News and one of the best journalists in technology.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   He's now at the Cronkite School of Journalism at Arizona State University
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   and also writes for a number of publications. Dan Kilmore great to have you back on Twit.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   It's great to be back. Thanks for joining us.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I want to start. You wrote an article actually Dan that I think we can use to kick off
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   on your column on Slate, your future tense column. Why? It's so funny.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Republicans are upset with Facebook for censoring news.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   First of all, I think there is a certain amount of, I don't believe this story coming from these
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   anonymous curators that were brought in to work at Facebook. I mean last week the same
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   anonymous people or person said, oh yeah Facebook was just using us to polish their algorithm
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   and blah, blah, blah. Now they're saying Facebook actually censored conservative news.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   First of all, do you believe that's true Dan?
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Well, in the first or second paragraph I did not write that headline.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   I said, that's a good headline. We should be really cautious about believing this because
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   it's based on anonymous sources.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   And by the way as you point out from Gawker Media which makes even less reasonable to stress.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Another interesting thing. So I had a lot of doubts to start.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   But the thing about it that's really intriguing to me is that Republicans, even if this is not
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   true there's a really good and interesting point there which is that Facebook has unprecedented
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   control over what news is at this point. And it's charming to watch Republicans suddenly realize
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   that a big company has a lot of power. But they should have realized that a long time ago.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And if I were in charge of any policy right now I would have the antitrust people looking
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   incredibly hard at Facebook because what the power they're getting is again unprecedented
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   and I think dangerous.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   There would be a kind of a bitter irony if a party that championed the free market was
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   bit by a company that used the free market to dominate news.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   It is true I think that, and I know one of the things you teach at Arizona State at the
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Rockefeller Market School is media literacy. It is true. Is it not that Facebook is the
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   source of news for a vast majority of Americans? Like the primary source.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Yeah, and it's dangerous that there's such, that there's one company with this kind of
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   power.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Is it more dangerous that it's, I mean, isn't Google doesn't Google have similar power?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   I think Google should be under intense scrutiny all the time because of the power that they
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   have in search. And I don't think they're under sufficient amount of scrutiny at this point.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Although Europe is doing a lot at the same time what they're doing is kind of weird so
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   that's a problem.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   That seems to be more about Android than it does about control of...
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Yeah, I can't quite figure out what Europe thinks it's doing with this. But we really
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   have to start acknowledging as a society that Silicon Valley companies are, or tech,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   or at large, has enormous influence that is not something that we've thought too much
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   about beyond, well, look at what they can do. And they have the power to shut down speech.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   The first amendment if you use Facebook is not relevant. It's the terms of service that
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   are relevant. Right.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Denise, let me... I'm curious whether you think A, that Facebook is landing the news.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Wouldn't... I mean, it would be who's them to be as careful as they can to look balanced?
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Yeah, I've got to confess that until this story came around, I never looked at the trending
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   topics over on the right. I didn't even know it was there.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Well, that's easy. That's easy because there's so much crap on the Facebook page.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Right.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   You know, Facebook groups, what? They have groups? Oh, yeah, it's right here on the left.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Well, who knew? So I understand that.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Does the extent... Yeah, so, you know, I wonder if I'm alone in that or not.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   I'm sure there are many people who religiously go to it for their news.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   I just am not one of those people. And I imagine I'm not alone in that regard.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Where I get my news via Facebook, and I think it's important to recognize we're talking about
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Facebook as a source of news, but all they're really doing is pointing you to other sources.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Right.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Based on whatever their editors are putting in the trending topics.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   And based on what each individual editor is putting in their feed.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   And that's where I get my news. I get my news from the people that I follow on Facebook.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   And yes, that leads to... I realize that leads to an echo chamber.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   And I see a certain kind of news based on the kinds of people I follow.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   But that's not Facebook's responsibility. I do think it's good that this was brought to Facebook's attention.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   I don't know if they were conscious that this was happening.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   And I'm... You know, if you read what Zuckerberg has to say, he's anxious to make sure that
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   over there in that right-hand trending topics column that they have, and even handed editorial approach to what they're presenting.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Well, but there's also the algorithm, right? So what you see on Facebook, and I think most normal people have no idea of this,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   is very carefully modified by computer algorithm.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   You don't see everything that Aunt Judy posts.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   You don't see everything that your friend posts.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   You may see more of something that somebody you don't know posts, but you follow.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   And that's where I think... Do you think, Dan, that's the case that that's where Facebook could
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   inadvertently or inadvertently very much influence what people see.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Well, when we say that an algorithm is making decisions, we're one step or several steps removed from the actual decision maker,
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   which is the programmer who wrote the algorithm.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Right.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   And so there are editors at every level of how Facebook does news, whether it's in your feed or in the trending area.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   And among those editors is the user, but there's a complete lack of transparency about what actually goes on.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   And that's, you know, Facebook says, "Well, you know, we don't show our algorithm as Google says the same thing."
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   And so we're basically relying on a company that is without precedent and its size and reach,
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   making decisions that are editorial decisions, whether they're made by a programmer or an editor.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   And I'm actually glad to see they're using both.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   But we have this fundamental issue of not knowing exactly what is going on.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   I will say one thing about there.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   They did put out after the Guardian published part of it pretty much their full guidelines for their human editors.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   And there's some redactions as to how governmental there's...
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   But I thought it was interesting because it showed to me that they've actually put a lot more thought into this.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   What aggregation, etc., means then almost any news organization you can name.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   This is also a time when Facebook is actively courting the news media to put content on Facebook using instant articles.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   And now with Facebook Live video, at least a few outlets, not the big networks, but at least a few outlets are starting to do Facebook Live.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   I know the Activision folks are going to do a daily live video to push e-sports.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   Everybody's jumping on this bandwagon because Facebook is the one place you can go on the Internet where you know almost everybody's going to see it.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Or at least there's a chance for everybody to see it.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   We don't know exactly how that part works.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   And you're just describing, again, you're describing another element of Facebook's power over the news.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   If news organizations feel absolutely no alternative, but to be part of that, I think that's amazingly short-sighted of news organizations to basically pour their futures into a company that in the end is their biggest competitor for advertising.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   But when has the news industry ever thought past next week?
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   I don't remember that ever happening.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   So again, I'm glad to see people starting to think and talk about that.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   But Emily Bell, who teaches at Columbia University, did a wonderful piece called Facebook, is eating the news or eating the Internet.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   And I think we really have to, I don't mean to be a broken record on this, but I desperately want people to pay attention to this and other re-centralizing factors that are taking the power that we had as individuals and putting it back in the center instead of at the edges where we are.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Well, was that a brief moment in time where news was democratized and everybody had a voice and then never mind.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   And the problem is, is you see something like Facebook that does wield such potential power.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   This is what I fear, Dan, when you say we need to keep an eye on this is that everybody is a stakeholder and everybody's going to want a sub-born Facebook to do what they want to do.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   The government's going to do that.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   The Republicans are going to want to do that.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   The Democrats are going to want to do that.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   And everybody's going to get as active as they can.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   But unfortunately, it's not going to be to protect us, the people.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   It's going to be to use Facebook as best they can against us.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Let me ask Steve, do you guys, either a business writer or a tech insider, you must look at Facebook and there must be meetings saying, well, should we post our content on Facebook?
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Should we use instant articles?
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   What do we do?
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   All the time.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   Maybe it's about a year ago, Facebook told Rico that that trending topic section was completely by algorithm.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   And then it comes out a couple of weeks ago, which is a lie.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   It was actually a lie.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   So first of all, they're lying about how this product works.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   It's a bad sign.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   And like Dan was just saying, they have all this power over the content we see and they're lying about how that content gets used.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   So that's my first big problem.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   And then it comes out, oh, we do have these editors.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   And by the way, here are guidelines and they're humans and so forth.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   Whether or not there's editors or censoring, that's almost besides the point right now.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   I mean, just the fact that they're lying about how this product works.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   At the same time, I don't think the trending module matters that much because it exists.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   Most of it in the desktop version, most people use Facebook on mobile and that trending thing is just buried in the app.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   You never see it.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   The algorithm and the news feed is built to keep you addicted and scrolling through as much as possible.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   So it's going to give you stuff that thinks you like.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   If you're a liberal, you're going to get a lot of democratic liberal news.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   I get a lot of, that's what my feed looks like.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   It looks like a lot of business insider, a lot of tech insider, a lot of WSH and New York Times articles.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   I don't get a lot of, you know, break barts and things like that in my feed just because Facebook over time has learned the content I'm going to want to see and want to keep scrolling through.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   So that's another part.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   There is a built-in bias into the algorithm, which is to keep the individual happy and scrolling through.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   So it's-
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   That's in their long-run business interest is getting you-
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Exactly.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   ...is more Facebook not slamming the news.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   Right.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   And then as for media companies like Business Insider and Tech Insider, of course, every new media company or own media company, the Times is doing it too, is constantly talking about-
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   I mean, we're shifting our strategy, you know, year by year based on what Facebook thinks is hot.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   A year ago or a year and a half ago, they went all in on video.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   So we started pumping out tons of video natively to Facebook.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   Then it's instant articles that's been kind of lukewarm so far.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   And now it's all about Facebook Live where they're literally paying media companies, not Business Insider yet, but that might be happening.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   They're literally paying media companies to post live video and you get a bunch of garbage.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   You get a Washington Post columnist eating his own column.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   You get, you know, an exploding watermelon.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   That's journalism.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   I mean, it just stunts.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   So I think we really have to like kind of take a step back when we talk about as journalists the kind of stuff we're posting to Facebook and whether or not that's useful to the beer-ship or if it's just to get eyeballs for fun.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   And that's something we're constantly talking about.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   That video of Dana Milbank eating his column was good video.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   I mean, that was worth seeing.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   He had predicted that Donald Trump would not get the Republican nomination and said, "I will eat my column if he does."
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   And he did.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   But I mean, it was a stock.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   It's a stunt.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   It is a stunt.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   It's not news.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   I think some Canadian publication, they're eating cheese.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Mike.com.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   They tied helium balloons to a dollhouse.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   They could fly like, "What are we watching?"
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   But that's why Facebook probably wants to put more real news in there.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Why they're working so hard to put more substance in your feed, right?
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   But that's the result of these media partnerships.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   That's the result of Facebook paying Mike to put this content in your feed.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   So Facebook wants to put more news in your feed, but you get people eating cheese.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   It's not working right now.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   So I did an interesting experiment on Facebook.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   I followed all the candidates for President, Republican, Democrat, even Gary Johnson, the libertarian, one of the libertarian candidates.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   And I'm still getting mostly dogs playing with lemons.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   I have a good solution for you, Leah.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   What's that?
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   I have a good friend, just one of my best friends.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   And she is as politically opposite for me as she could be.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Oh, follow her.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Yeah, follow your best friend who is completely the other end of the political spectrum and put them in your close friends category.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   And then you'll see all their stuff.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   But aren't most people going to do the exact opposite, which is unfriend, unfollow, and concentrate the stuff on stuff they want to see?
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   So I don't think people, even though they admit they're getting their news from Facebook, they don't see it as a news source.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   That's the real risk of Facebook, is that we are getting all of this material kind of unconsciously.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Right.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   I saw some study come across my Twitter feed and, of course, in a click it, I just read the headline.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   But that's the other problem, by the way.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   But the stat was right there in the headline and it was a significant portion of people don't know where their news is coming from.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   Like if they see it, right, it's a business insider article, a slate article.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   No, we don't know.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   Facebook is pushing this content to me.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   I don't know where it comes from.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   I'm just like scrolling through Facebook.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   And so that's a problem too.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   There's no brand identity.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   If you're a new publication like Tech Insider is not even a year old yet and we're trying to build a brand identity and relying on Facebook to do that, it's kind of tough because people don't realize, or a lot of people don't realize those articles are coming from Tech Insider or New York Times or wherever.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   It's Facebook and that's great for Facebook.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Not so great for the media companies.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   So why do the media companies keep pouring all their stuff into Facebook?
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   They're desperate.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   The unfortunate truth is we need viewership and Facebook controls all that and the unfortunate thing is, yeah, you kind of have to bend to what's hot on Facebook at the time.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   And I know that's maybe not the best long term, but it's what you need right now to grow.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   It's the new media landscape is intensely competitive and we're seeing the littler guys die off and consolidate.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   But even among the big guys, you got to bend to what Facebook's doing.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   Facebook's a media company, right?
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   I mean, do we agree now?
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   It's not a social network.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   That's the old days.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   It's a media company.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   They don't see themselves as a media company.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Oh, they don't want it.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Well, they're a little of everything, but it's the extent that people are creating media using Facebook, of course, they're a media company.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   They're certainly a media company because they're selling advertising.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   That's what media companies generally do.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   And so there are some standards, the second biggest media company in the world after Google.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   I have a question for Dan before we leave this topic if that's okay, Leah.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Yeah, of course, please.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   Dan, I'm wondering, you're talking about wanting to keep a close eye on Google from the search standpoint to make sure that when people get results, that they're getting what's relevant and things aren't getting filtered out.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   And that perhaps we should be taking the same kind of approach to Facebook.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   But how do you foresee that looking?
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Is it the job of lawmakers and policymakers to figure that one out?
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   Or what's your proposal there?
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   I don't have a good one, but when a company achieves this kind of dominance, traditionally, this has triggered antitrust review.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   It's not illegal to be in a monopoly.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   It's illegal to abuse one.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   And what I'd like to see in general, and this would not just be trying to regulate.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   I don't like regulation.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   I'd rather avoid that if possible.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   I'd like to see a lot of different people, including government, think about how do we inject more competition, re-inject competition into this world that was massively distributed and decentralized, but is becoming radically centralized again?
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   How do we do something about that?
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   I don't know if government wants to.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   I think government kind of likes it when there are these choke points that it can apply pressure to itself.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   But that's what I really want to see is for politicians and others.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   It's why I'm happy Republicans suddenly realized they were getting -- that they might be under the control of one media company.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   The solution to these things is the best solution is always competition rather than regulation, but I don't see much of either being done.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   And that's really what worries me.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   I also wonder if this is not just inevitable.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   I mean, Tim Wu in the Master Switch kind of predicted that this would happen.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   When companies are small and businesses are small and they're new, there's a lot of ferment, a lot of creativity, a lot of competition.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   But then money starts pouring in.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   The incumbents move in.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   New companies become incumbents like Facebook.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   And we're right back to the old way of doing things.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Isn't that kind of what's happened?
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   To a degree, yes, and there are some real advantages to centralization.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   I'm not diswinding that.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Yes, but the economy is scale.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   But the fact that we're -- well, it's -- I'm not sure that scale is the right word for the economy here, but there's things that can be done better.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   But look what happened.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   When you even point this out in your article, as Facebook got bigger, all it did is it just swooped up all the little -- it starts scooping them in.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   Anybody who could be a competitor, if it's WhatsApp, got it, Instagram, got it, they just swoop in.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   I mean, they try to get Snapchat.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   They haven't been able to get it yet.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   So that by itself suggests that something that there needs to be -- if, if, for example, Facebook announced tomorrow that it was buying Slack, I would hope that people at the antitrust division would awaken from there.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Van Winkle sleep and say, "Oh, okay, this is too much."
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   That is a false hope.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   You know that.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   It's never going to happen.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   Well, and if they're asleep during democratic administrations, they're going to be put to sleep in republican administrations.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   We are talking about Facebook and the news.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   We're going to talk a little bit about the Google Oracle case that's on right now.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   I'm glad Denise Howell is here. She can help us understand how you could possibly copyright an API.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   And a whole lot more.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   Steve Kovac is also here from techinsider.io.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   Are you going to Google I/O?
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   No, I'm in New York.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   My colleagues at West are going to be covering it.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   We'll be doing coverage, of course, our own coverage of Google I/O.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   Jason Howell of all about Android is going to be there.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Jeff Jarvis from this week in Google and Father Robert Ballisare from know-how and Twiatt will all three be at the keynote.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   We'll be covering the keynote streaming it live as we always do on Wednesday starting at 10 a.m. Pacific 1 p.m. Eastern time, 1700 UTC.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   You can, of course, watch Google stream, but it's so much more fun to watch us snark about Google stream behind the scenes.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   I hope you join us for that.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   Special this week in Google at 2 p.m. Pacific and Jeff and Jason will be joining us.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   I think we've got a space inside of the Googleplex to stream them from.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   So I think this is going to be some interesting stuff.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   We'll talk about what we're expecting at Google I/O also a little later on the show.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   Our show today brought to you by Blue Apron this week in tech sponsored by this week in cooking.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   I love Blue Apron.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Blue Apron solves the problem of what to eat for dinner.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   Yeah, you could go to the fast food restaurant or you could just take what's in the refrigerator.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   I don't think there's much I can do with mustard and peanut butter, but I'll find a way or Blue Apron Day.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   I love coming home and finding the Blue Apron box on the porch.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   There's three separate meals in there.
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Always interesting too.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   I mean, it's really about unusual ingredients, amazing recipes that you wouldn't think of buying.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   I don't have to go to the grocery store because they've done all the shopping for me exactly what I want.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   There's no waste.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   If it calls for one rib of celery, that's what's in there.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   There's always exactly what you need to make the recipe.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   It's all fresh from local farms, sustainably produced.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   Seafood is sourced sustainably.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   Beef is raised humanely.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   Chickens are free range.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   The pork is natural.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   And always fresh, never frozen, which I really like.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   They use regenerative farming practices for produce.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   And you're going to find some unusual ingredients you've never cooked before.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Let's see what's on the menu this week.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   Crispy, cod, and cabbage slaw tacos with Peepita, pineapple, and avocado sauce.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   See, I don't know what Peepita is, but see, once you've used it, you go, "Oh, I'm going to use more Peepita."
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   Whatever.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   That's good stuff.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   I love that Peepita.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   How about crispy catfish?
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   And what is that?
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Yuzu Koshu Udon.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   I know Udon's noodles.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   And the thing is, you can make this.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   You can make it in half an hour to 45 minutes.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   Your family's going to go, "Wow, catfish for dinner."
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   Pan-seared pork chops with two cheese mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   They have plants for couples.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Great for date night.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   It's really nice for day night.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   But they also have family plans with kid-friendly ingredients.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   And what a great way to get the kids cooking.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   Blue-Aper delivers right to your door 99% of the continental United States.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   They support healthy families.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   In fact, Blue Apron families cook three times more often.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   So, you know, I know the kids are going to say, "Peepita tonight again?
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   No, we're cooking tonight."
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   Blue Apron.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   I want you to try your first two meals free and free shipping by going to Blue Apron.com/Twit.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   You'll love how good it feels, how great it tastes.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   The house fills with this amazing aroma.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   The kids say, "Oh, what's for dinner?
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   This is good."
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   It's hard to do this at my mouth always waters because I started thinking about my Blue Apron.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   Blue Apron.com/Twit.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   Your first two meals are free.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Whiz-free shipping.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   Thank you for their support of this week in Tech.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Dan Gilmore is here from the Walter Cronkite School for Mass Communication and Media.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   He teaches media literacy to young people.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Aren't they media literate?
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   Well, they're getting a lot better at it.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.160]   I actually did a massive online course that was mostly older people, which was even more
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.000]   fun in some ways.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   I remember talking to, oh, what was his name?
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   Richard Hart.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Remember, he used to do Next Step and he was on CNET.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:22.560]   And Richard's now teaching technology and journalism to school in San Francisco Academy
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:23.560]   Art.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.560]   I said, "Oh, must be great, Richard, to work with young people who are so technical."
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.920]   He literally said, "No, they know less than we do, Leo, because we grew up.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.640]   We had to figure this stuff out.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:36.560]   They just were handed it on a platter and they have no idea how anything works."
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:41.840]   Well, we could say the same about our generation and cars.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:42.840]   That's right.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:43.840]   Because we were just given cars.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:44.840]   We don't have to fix them.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:46.840]   Yeah.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.160]   I learned to change the oil and that was a victory.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.760]   I learned to change the oil and tune it up and set the timing.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:55.360]   And then they made it so you couldn't do that anymore.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:31:01.080]   That's true and now you can't even in any place plug your own stuff in because it's going
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.920]   to violate copyright law.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:08.360]   Anyway, I think it must be interesting to work with young people.
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:12.880]   And I find it ironic that this internet generation, see, I'm starting to think this whole idea
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:18.000]   of the internet natives, oh, wait a leg yet, grow up, they grow up with the internet.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.520]   They're going to know how to, they're going to have it appreciated.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.160]   I used to say this, oh, it's going to, you don't know what this medium is going to turn
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.920]   out to be until people who've grown up with it get to work on it.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:30.440]   Now I'm wondering, you know, they're really pretty savvy about media.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:31.440]   Good.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.440]   I hope so.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:38.520]   I think I said earlier to you that the, I think it's healthy that they basically don't
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:44.000]   trust anything that they see anymore, except their friends who they should trust a little
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.440]   bit less.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:54.080]   But it's a progress to me that they're intensely skeptical of what they see in the media.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.520]   Yeah.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:58.720]   But he's a kind of, I hope it's not a cynicism either.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:05.240]   I mean, young people should not be cynical yet.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:08.080]   It borders on cynicism in many cases.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.800]   And I agree with you, that's a problem.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:15.680]   It's perhaps it would be worse if they were just trusting it.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:16.680]   Yeah.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:20.920]   Denise, your son is a how old?
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:21.920]   He's 12.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:22.920]   Yeah.
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:23.920]   He's right at that age.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.160]   We have a 13 year old at home.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.800]   And I watch and I don't, you know, I don't, Michael doesn't use Facebook yet.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:33.280]   He doesn't even have a Facebook account because you're supposed to be 13.
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.440]   And there's not a lot of pressure to create a Facebook account.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:39.440]   I remember when my kids got to that age, they were really one of that Facebook account.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.600]   Not so much anymore.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:46.880]   But Michael gets all his entertainment, all his news, everything from YouTube period.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:47.880]   Yep.
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.240]   That's the truth, yours is.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.240]   Well, I'm sure.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.840]   Yes, it is.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.120]   He's not dying for Facebook.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.600]   He's dying for Instagram.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:55.600]   Instagram.
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.600]   Yes.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.600]   That makes sense.
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.600]   Ready to go there.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:01.800]   There's too much text and prose on Facebook.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.680]   Give me a picture.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:07.920]   So maybe we don't have to worry about Facebook at all.
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:14.040]   Maybe that's a problem for our generation and not for theirs.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:21.040]   Minecraft Con is in Anaheim, September 24th, MineCon.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.280]   Why does your son want to go to MineCon?
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.720]   It's 160 bucks, by the way.
[00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.200]   Yeah, it is.
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:32.880]   We were talking at the top of the show as you were introducing Steve about how much you
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.360]   can do with Minecraft.
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.960]   And that explains why he's still engaged in it.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.600]   He's used it for years.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:48.520]   He'll do a camp this summer that's all about exploring and being creative with Minecraft.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:55.040]   But one of the reasons it's so powerful is that it's such an open system.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.640]   There's so much you can do with it.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:01.480]   No one has ever Mojang and now Microsoft following the same path.
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:08.800]   As said, here are the building blocks, build what you want and really aren't asserting
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.640]   ownership at all in what people build.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:16.720]   So you can, there are all these various, probably thousands and thousands of servers out there
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.560]   where you can do different things on Minecraft.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.400]   And one of the things my son is really into is playing factions.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:28.800]   So it's basically video games built on the platform where you can go in and play a game
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.080]   that someone invented.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.160]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:39.040]   So much prefer to see him playing that than Call of Duty or Heaven forbid Grand Theft Auto.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.960]   Because it's like Lego.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.480]   And it gets kids into computers in an interesting way.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:47.900]   I really think that the Minecraft universe and the building blocks of Minecraft universe
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:53.120]   actually prepare people better than we might think for engineering jobs, for technology
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:54.760]   jobs.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:59.680]   There's something about it that really fosters this sense.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:06.120]   You're learning how pieces fit together, the consequences of different actions.
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.600]   I find it fascinating.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.880]   We ended up setting up our own Minecraft server.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.480]   Actually three of them in my house.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.840]   And I even kind of got sucked into it for a while.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:20.720]   I would stay up till three in the morning building stuff.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:25.160]   And then you start running software in Python and it's kind of the sky's the limit on this.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:30.360]   You know what I love is that Microsoft never did what probably was very tempting, which
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:33.560]   is to a raise the price in Minecraft or better yet give it.
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:39.880]   It's only 27 bucks, but give it away and then charge for textures and bit maps.
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:42.280]   You know, do the in-app purchase thing.
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.320]   I'm sure that must have been tempting.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.320]   I'm sure there was.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.320]   Right.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.320]   And they let other people do that.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.320]   Right.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:51.880]   And I'm not sure if you're a server where you, you know, you've created this whole world.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.240]   And yeah, you can charge for the weapons and all that stuff.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.240]   So they're letting people build their own businesses.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:59.160]   Yeah, it's very interesting.
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:06.280]   All right, let's talk about Google versus Oracle.
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:10.840]   And I'm very curious what you all think of this.
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.160]   And correct me if I'm wrong because I'm going to try to give you the timeline.
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:16.960]   And I'm sure you'll fix it if I screw it up.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:23.080]   I interviewed James Gosling about three weeks ago, the guy who wrote Java.
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:30.760]   And Sun, which was a company he was working for, that owned Java, made Java open.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.240]   People could develop for Java.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:37.160]   They even said you could, I guess, write your own JAVAs.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:42.360]   Of course, at one point, they, Google came to them or maybe it was Andy Rubin before.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:48.840]   It probably was Andy Rubin before Android was sold to Google and said, I want to put
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:52.960]   Android on, I want to make it a Java based operating system.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:53.960]   Can we license it?
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.120]   They talked, there was no license deal.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:01.360]   But Andy decided he didn't need to do a license deal because it was an open platform, created
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:10.680]   his own Java virtual machine called Dalvik, Google bought Android, Oracle bought Sun.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:14.200]   And the interesting thing is Gosling told me this.
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:20.360]   He said, we saw Google's code and we felt like it was a little slimy that Google didn't
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:24.720]   just kind of do clean room development of Dalvik.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.840]   They, it looked like some of our code was in their code.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:32.440]   It felt like we saw bits of our piece, bits of pieces of our stuff in their code.
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:36.800]   It probably wasn't clean room, but we wasn't the point where we were going to sue them.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:41.920]   It's like, that's slimy, but we weren't upset, but we couldn't, we didn't plan on doing
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.440]   anything about it.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:49.000]   He says, but when the negotiations between Oracle and Sun began in earnest and he was
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.840]   in the room talking about this, he said, I saw the Oracle lawyers eyes light up.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:38:01.360]   They knew they had something and they knew there could be a big payday at the end of
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.360]   the line.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.960]   Oracle ended up suing Google.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:10.400]   He said, the thing I really disagree with is that they didn't sue them over stealing the
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.880]   code.
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:17.200]   He said, the lawyers apparently decided that that wasn't a winnable case.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:26.680]   They copyrighted the API and then went after them for stealing the API, which is really
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.360]   kind of antithetical to the way the whole computer industry works.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:34.640]   I mean, because of APIs, everything had talked to everything.
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:42.080]   We wouldn't have the PC industry if you hadn't been able to copy the interface to IBM's BIOS
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:45.600]   so that you could make IBM compatible computers.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.440]   That just wouldn't have happened.
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:53.160]   So everything from then on really relies on this idea that APIs are free and open and
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:55.120]   can be duplicated.
[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:59.760]   Oracle lost, now I'm not sure the timeline on this.
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:09.000]   They lost the case, the case was appealed, turned down, appealed, again turned down.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.080]   Finally, Oracle appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, which decided we're not going
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:13.800]   to hear the case.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.440]   Not just yet.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:16.600]   Tell me about that.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:22.400]   They tried to get the Supreme Court involved before the entire case had been resolved.
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:29.720]   It got sent back down for trial, which is what is going to retrial on a particular issue.
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:34.520]   The fair use question, which is going to end a couple of other things are going to happen
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.600]   next week.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:42.160]   So the Supreme Court just declined to get involved at an early juncture.
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:45.120]   It could still get involved later on.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:48.960]   Once there's been a trial and we have a final determination from the trial court, I'm sure
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.640]   there will be another appeal.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:56.520]   Whoever wins or loses because the stakes are so high on both sides here.
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:40:00.920]   At that point, the Supreme Court could say, "Okay, we think this is an important issue
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:02.560]   and get involved," but it's up to them.
[00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.600]   I'll tell you how high the stakes are.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.960]   Oracle's suing for, I used to say for $9 billion.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.120]   It's actually $9.3 billion.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:12.640]   I realize when you talk about $0.3 billion at that level, it's $300 million, so we're
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:16.920]   not going to leave that part out.
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:20.120]   $9.3 billion.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:25.000]   I think there's testimony, so I think the trial has begun.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.840]   In court this week, Jonathan Schwartz, the last CEO at Sun, testifying really on Google's
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.800]   behalf along with Eric Schmidt.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:35.200]   Right, I'm sorry, I'm a week off.
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.280]   Yes, it was started this week.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:44.360]   In front of the judge, William Alsup, who we celebrated, so he was the judge before and
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.600]   ruled in Google's favor.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:53.320]   We celebrated him because we thought finally a judge who knows something about this, he
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:57.240]   studied, he was a math major, but he said he taught himself Java so that he could rule
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:59.040]   on this case.
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:02.600]   I think he even said, "Last night I wrote a bubble source or something."
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.320]   I can't remember the exact thing.
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:08.240]   Anyway, we thought, "Wow, this guy's good."
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.520]   It's back in front of him.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:13.000]   Basically, the court said it back to him.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.720]   It's a jury trial now, which is a little nerve-wracking.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:24.480]   As a jury of 10 people, apparently there was at 1.1 person potentially on the jury who
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:27.000]   knew about technology and was bumped off by Oracle.
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:36.240]   So there's basically 10 normal people who don't know anything about this subject at hand.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:40.880]   I don't feel like, Steve, these are people who are capable of ruling on something like
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:41.880]   a...
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.640]   Do they even know what an API is?
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.800]   I think that's what that motherboard piece really focuses on.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.560]   I mean, this is such...
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:55.120]   Like you just said about what the importance of what an API is and how it...
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:58.760]   We wouldn't be talking over Skype right now.
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:05.120]   So the fact that people who don't even clearly grasp what that is and they bump the one person
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:13.040]   who does grasp what that is off the jury, that's dangerous almost.
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.280]   I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:15.280]   I don't know how they're arguing.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.520]   I haven't listened to any of the testimony on anything.
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:23.960]   Hopefully, the lawyers are phrasing everything such that the jury can understand it and distill
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:29.560]   it down so they can understand the true importance of what this means for the computing industry
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.680]   in general.
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.400]   It's really worrying actually that...
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:36.080]   I mean, that motherboard article is scary.
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:38.440]   But they're not talking about the API.
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.440]   The purposes of this trial...
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:40.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:45.440]   Because of this trial, they don't have to decide whether APIs are copyrightable or not.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.560]   That's already been determined.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.800]   And now they're determining whether Google has a defense.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.360]   Whether they violated the copyright.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.360]   Yeah.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:52.360]   And Google...
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.360]   Right.
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.360]   Whether...
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:55.860]   Where the very use supplies.
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:43:01.680]   The reading I did on the first few days of this and not being there, this is by definition
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.440]   superficial.
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:09.840]   It sure sounded like Google played fast and loose in a lot of ways and the internal emails
[00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.880]   were that they kept pulling out were horrible.
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:18.680]   But I do want to come back to this idea that the APIs can be copyrighted.
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:21.480]   That's catastrophic for technology.
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.840]   You tweeted it could be the end of the...
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:24.840]   Let me read the tweet.
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:29.920]   If the open web dies oracle will be one of its killers, thanks to the terrible horrible
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:31.520]   API case.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:37.200]   And you're quoting a very good article in ours, Technica, by Joe Mullen about this.
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:43.840]   But the contempt I'm feeling for oracle right now is pretty enormous.
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:48.560]   Boy, you know, all right, I don't want to...
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.160]   Larry Allison is not my favorite person in the world.
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:53.960]   Let's say, let's put it that way.
[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:55.480]   So I think I got this a little bit wrong.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:59.320]   So the judge said that APIs should not be eligible for copyright.
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:00.480]   That was the right thing.
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:01.480]   Right.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:02.480]   Then...
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.480]   And there was an appeal.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:09.520]   Oracle appealed to the US Court of Appeals, which said they are creative works and should
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.760]   be copyrighted.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:15.600]   And that's when the Supreme Court said, well, we're not going to...
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:16.600]   We're not going to...
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.600]   Exactly.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:19.600]   We're not touching that yet.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.800]   We're going to let this run its course.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:23.800]   And...
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:28.480]   So what could happen here then is that the jury could say, oh yeah, it's not fair use.
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:32.120]   9.3 billion dollars to Google.
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:34.600]   Would Google then try to appeal that ruling?
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:37.680]   Or would they go back to the Supreme Court about this whole notion of whether you can
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:38.680]   copyright an API?
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:39.680]   Because that's...
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:42.040]   I don't care about 9.3 billion dollars for Google.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:43.320]   That's one thing.
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.240]   I care about copywriting APIs.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:48.880]   That seems like a very dangerous precedent.
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:49.880]   Right.
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:53.520]   And once there's been a trial and we determine, you know, the appellate court has already said,
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:56.280]   okay, we think APIs are copyrightable.
[00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:00.640]   You need to finish up your trial, which you didn't do the first time trial court because
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.240]   you decided they weren't copyrightable.
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.440]   He threw it out.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.440]   Yes.
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:09.560]   So you need to go back and have a trial on that issue and see if Google's fair use defense
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:15.040]   flies before a jury and they'll go through applying the fair use analysis and see how
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:16.640]   Google fairs there.
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:21.280]   And then once there's a final decision on that point, they once again, they can't go
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.280]   straight to the Supreme Court.
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:26.440]   They have to appeal to the Ninth Circuit and let the trial...
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:27.440]   You know, we already...
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:31.360]   The Ninth Circuit has already spoken on that one substantive issue that is so important
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.400]   to you, Leo.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:37.960]   So if they say the same thing again, at that point, Google can knock on the Supreme Court's
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:40.320]   door and try and involve them.
[00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.600]   But again, that's purely up to the Supreme Court.
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.640]   They don't have to take cases.
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:47.760]   Wasn't it the Ninth Circuit, though?
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:48.760]   Wasn't it the...
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:51.360]   The DC court of the deals.
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:54.080]   That loves everything that has intellectual property.
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:59.440]   They went to the Federal Circuit, according to Joe, because there was a patent.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.840]   They hear all patent appeals.
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.160]   And Google prevailed on the patent claims.
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:08.520]   Oracle did not appeal the patent claims, but because the patent claim was in there, it
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:11.040]   went to Federal Circuit.
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:18.040]   And actually, I think the Ninth Circuit is, I would guess, a little more sophisticated
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:22.720]   and maybe perhaps more sympathetic to Google, yes or no.
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.320]   Yeah, you're probably right.
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:27.160]   I was thinking Ninth Circuit because they're back in trial in San Francisco.
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:28.160]   But you're absolutely right.
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.800]   No, no, went to the Federal Circuit.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.840]   The Ninth Circuit, I think, would probably...
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:38.680]   They're much more tech savvy, partially partially because they're location.
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.680]   And so one would...
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:42.080]   But again, this is...
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:46.760]   What really scares me is this seems to be in the hands of people who have a fairly thin
[00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:51.120]   grasp of what it all means.
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:56.360]   And maybe I'm giving too much weight to Sarah Zhang's motherboard article because she quotes
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:57.520]   from some of the testimony.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:02.800]   It was kind of a little chilling that her headline is, "In Oracle versus Google, a nerd
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:06.280]   subculture is on trial."
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:13.440]   And her point, at least her analysis of this, is that the jury is trying to wrap its head
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:20.320]   around things like free software in the sense of open source, liberated software.
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:26.400]   And at one point, a part of the problem is that you've got Jonathan Schwartz, who's trying
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:33.520]   to explain what an API is by talking about hamburgers on breakfast menus and restaurants,
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:36.800]   which even the judge said, "I don't understand one word of..."
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:39.440]   He says, "I don't know what the witness just said.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:42.080]   The thing about breakfast menu makes no sense."
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:43.080]   Oh boy.
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:44.080]   Right.
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:49.520]   Well, there are, I mean, there are, I think, a couple of ways that Google could pull this
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:50.520]   out ultimately.
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:55.720]   I mean, right now it has to live with this determination that APIs and this particular
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:56.720]   API is copyrightable.
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:58.200]   They can't dispute that.
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.200]   That's already been decided.
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.680]   Yeah, that's been decided for purposes of this trial.
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:06.120]   But ultimately, hopefully, they'll get to take another whack at that one.
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:08.320]   So this is a fair use case?
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:14.280]   Yeah, because they now have to argue that, okay, if it's subject to copyright, we get
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.480]   to use it anyway.
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:20.920]   I'm hoping that somewhere in here, and I like Dan, not there at trial, haven't read the
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:26.760]   briefs, et cetera, but I'm hoping that an implied license argument is being made as well
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:32.120]   because they didn't have an express license anywhere, but maybe the way that the parties
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:37.840]   conducted themselves and what Google was led to believe, you know, you can't just sort
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:44.360]   of take back making something open simply because there's been a change of management
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:47.640]   and lawyers with a gleam in their eye.
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:53.120]   So hopefully they do have some blaches and a stople argument.
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:59.720]   Those are ways of saying you waited too long and you let us to believe that, you know,
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:08.320]   you let us down the primrose path and let us to build things in reliance on what we reasonably
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:09.320]   believed.
[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:13.520]   Do you think it's a case that the jury could handle this?
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:18.560]   This is not a technical argument.
[00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:19.560]   I think so.
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.560]   I mean, it's very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
