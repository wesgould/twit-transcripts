[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.520]   It's gonna be a good panel.
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.080]   Brandon Wu is here from Rebellion Pack.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.680]   Carl Bodie, longtime tech reporter from Tech Dirt,
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.720]   motherboard, even the founder of DSL reports.

[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.200]   Apple's victory in the Apple versus Epic trial.
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.360]   Is it a victory?
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.920]   Epic doesn't think so.
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.600]   We'll also talk about proton mail
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.560]   and why they think they've solved the problem.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.280]   And all has to do with your advisory board.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.920]   It's all coming up next on Twit.

[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.240]   But we always, there's people we just love to bring back again.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.480]   And again, Brianna Wu is one of those,
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.000]   director of Rebellion Pack, former candidate for Congress
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.600]   in Massachusetts, game developer
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.240]   and Porsche restore pinball game wizard.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.000]   I can go on and on.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.840]   Hi, Brianna.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.680]   Nice to see you.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.520]   Thanks for having me.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.120]   Nice to see you.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.280]   I wish people could see the computer that you're on.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.880]   It's one of those builds with lots of LEDs and a clear case.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.880]   It's embarrassing.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.280]   It's so embarrassing.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.040]   It's like a teenager came and created my computer.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.160]   I literally got like, Razer has a thing.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.440]   It will let you add additional addressable RGB strips to it.
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.280]   Oh Lord.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.960]   And I'm just like, more, more, more.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.760]   No, I must have two boxes until it's just like,
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.000]   makes the whole office glow at night.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.360]   That's how tacky I am.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.640]   No, you're not.
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.920]   In fact, the Laport household has a few of those.
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.280]   OK.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.680]   The other day I was driving up and I thought,
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.160]   what is that glow coming from my office?
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.720]   Then I realized that for some reason,
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.960]   the Alienware had gone into some sort of weird cycle mode.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.520]   And it looked like a hot tub from the '70s.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.520]   It was just--
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.520]   --was going.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.840]   And then Michael's got a Republic of Gaming desktop
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.160]   that also has extensive LED coverage.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.560]   It's crazy.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.560]   It is.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.360]   It is.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.560]   You know, I keep telling Frank, I need an adult
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.440]   to come decorate my house at some point.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.440]   No, you don't want big.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.760]   It's like comic-con that's flooded.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.800]   No, you know what, big.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.720]   I need something.
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.680]   I don't know.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.960]   Well, coming back from CNET, we haven't seen her in a while.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.680]   I don't know why.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.360]   It's my fault.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.720]   I'm sorry, Lisa, at a Chico.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.400]   It's good to see you.
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.440]   It's great to be back.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.880]   Thank you so much for having me.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.600]   We won't keep it so long in the future.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.360]   What are you covering these days at CNET?
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.040]   Do you have a beat or is it everything?
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.960]   Yeah, I do have a beat.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.720]   So I'm covering mobile devices, but I'll probably
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.880]   be contributing to a little bit of everything as I normally do.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.360]   Well, we might.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.520]   But yeah, mobile devices is my beat for now.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.520]   You might have a little to talk about this when you're
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.120]   kind of mobile.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.040]   Just a little bit.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.240]   On the mobile device front.
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.120]   It's great to have you.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.680]   Are you in San Francisco?
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.080]   No, I'm in New York, actually.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.160]   New York.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.480]   All right, we got two East Coasters,
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.200]   and then we're going to go to the Pacific Northwest
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.440]   to welcome for the first time on this show.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.600]   I'm thrilled to have him Carl Bodie, who is kind of a legend.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.200]   Your name comes up all the time.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.720]   We're always quoting your articles and tech, dirt, and vice
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.960]   and other places.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.000]   It's nice to see you, Carl.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.320]   I really appreciate you having me here.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.680]   I've been a fan of yours since the screen savers day.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.400]   So it's great.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.320]   Yeah, I'm really years ago.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.400]   I used to be on TV.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.240]   I used to do Manhattan IT law firm work,
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.200]   and I used to--
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.680]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.480]   We should probably mention this is for people who are in Manhattan.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.480]   This is a very powerful-- all over the country,
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.840]   really, a very powerful weekend.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.520]   Did you go to any of the memorials, Lisa, at the 9/11
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.440]   memorial or anything like that?
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.480]   Not this weekend, no.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.360]   I've been to it in the past, but I didn't go this weekend.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.080]   Yeah, it's hard.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.600]   You know, I was born in New York City,
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.560]   so I don't know why, but I feel like that's home in many ways,
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.760]   even though I didn't live there very long.
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:22.320]   And I was flew back on October 20, 2001,
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.160]   to do a TV show back there.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.160]   Again, nobody would go.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.440]   So I was the only guy they could get for life with Regis
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.280]   and Kelly.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.400]   They said, well, you fly us at shore.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.800]   But I wanted to go out there because I
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.920]   wanted to visit ground zero and see-- and I'll never forget
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:41.320]   the fire department there and all of the flyers on the fences.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.280]   And it just was really dramatic.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.920]   And since my wife and I have gone back
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.840]   to visit the memorial, which is beautiful,
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.120]   and then when the museum opened, which
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.200]   is right next to the memorial at ground zero, we went.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.800]   And I'm sobbing.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.040]   It is so moving that museum.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.280]   If you're in New York City, it's kind of you
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.200]   have to go to ground zero and visit it
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.080]   because it's a beautiful memorial.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.800]   And then the museum really, really brings it home.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.760]   It's being able to see the frames of the old buildings
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.320]   underneath there.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.320]   Exactly.
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.480]   That alone is pretty amazing.
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.560]   Yeah, the basement was there.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.440]   I was there that day.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.480]   And I remember it all very well.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.280]   Oh, you were still working there?
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.560]   I moved out of New York City about six months after that.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.360]   And I remember watching, marching across the Queensborough
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.920]   bridge with millions of just dumbfounded people
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.880]   and the cell phone networked weren't working.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.800]   So you didn't know if your friends were alive.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.640]   And you're staring down at Southern Manhattan,
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.960]   watching the giant plume race.
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.440]   And it's terrifying.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.680]   I get a little frustrated with the never forget rhetoric
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.280]   because it's just not--
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:45.800]   Don't worry.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.240]   Don't forget.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.800]   Yeah, don't worry.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.360]   Those of us who live through it will not.
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:50.840]   Exactly.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.360]   We'll talk with Jeff on Wednesday.
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.320]   Jeff Jarvis, who was on the path train coming in from New
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.320]   Jersey, when it hit.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.000]   And so that station--
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.960]   I was on the seventh train.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.960]   I was on the seventh train.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.080]   I saw the first plume of smoke go up.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.080]   And when you climb up out of the subway into Manhattan,
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.720]   there was just this electric energy in the air,
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.440]   the terror of it.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.000]   It really sounds--
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.360]   He still thinks he has health problems
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.400]   because he was covered with dust and breathed it.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.680]   I mean, there was nowhere in the city.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.800]   You could go where you didn't smell the burning plastic
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.280]   for just weeks.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.920]   Even out in Queens in a story where I was,
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.040]   you could smell it for a very long time.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.920]   The thing that most moved me at that museum
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.280]   was the fire truck.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.720]   For some reason, that always really gets me.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.080]   Of course, the people who died in the incident.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.840]   But there's the first responders who, while everybody's
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.520]   running away, are running towards--
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.080]   and there's a fire truck in the museum that's basically melted.
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.000]   It's just the remnants because it was sitting right there.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.600]   And that's where I lose it every time.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.600]   It's just very--
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.040]   Plus they're playing the old voicemails
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.840]   when you go into that museum, I think.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.360]   I remember--
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.840]   Oh, you're right.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.400]   The radio calls the voicemails.
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.640]   That brings it right back.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.640]   Very present.
[00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.960]   Anyway, don't worry.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.800]   No one's forgetting.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.480]   It was a very powerful time.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.640]   To be honest, it's kind of traumatizing.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.920]   Just sitting here talking.
[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:18.440]   Yeah, sorry.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.120]   No, no, no.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:20.440]   I'm saying it's--
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.640]   I'm right there with you, Carl.
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.280]   There's no way you could forget it.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.760]   I had just moved to DC as a very young woman
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.480]   to start a career in politics.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.600]   And the Pentagon got hit that day.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.640]   So it was absolutely crazy.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.000]   Yeah, here's the--
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.480]   this is the basement of the museum.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.600]   So they're actually--
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.440]   this is the structure of the building.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.080]   And there's the plinth.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.080]   Just-- wow.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.040]   I don't know if you guys have ever been to the news
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.880]   am in Washington, DC.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.160]   I don't know if it's still around,
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.840]   but they also have a 9/11 exhibit that was really, really
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.400]   moving and very frankly difficult to get through
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.520]   where they show what media coverage was like on the day.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.640]   And just the videos of reporters barely being
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.720]   able to hold it together on air and everything
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.240]   was just so powerful and--
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.760]   like I said, really hard to get through.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.440]   I think they closed the museum, didn't they?
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.480]   I think they did close it.
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.880]   So sad.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.440]   I know.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:23.880]   I loved it.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.280]   I spent like hours in there.
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:25.960]   I would have to.
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.960]   It's a great museum.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.760]   Yeah, it closed, unfortunately, I think.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.200]   They lost a lot of money or something.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.000]   The one text story that's tied to this
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.200]   is a lot of the sites that were created at the time
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:44.040]   were done in flash and can no longer be run.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.320]   So there's a huge swath of content
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.120]   that's gone because it was in flash.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.200]   There'll be flash.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.360]   I hope somebody's doing their best to preserve it,
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.120]   maybe the internet archives.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.000]   On tech TV, I remember going in and of course,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.680]   we were doing-- we suspended our shows.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.320]   The screen savers took a couple of weeks off.
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.400]   And I remember vividly the night we came back
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.840]   and we had lit candles.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.600]   But I also remember vividly the day of.
[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:15.280]   And I'm anchoring with Erica Williams, right?
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.720]   What's her up?
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.760]   And she was, of course, a New Yorker.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.280]   And she was such a pro.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.960]   But she would burst into tears every commercial break.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.200]   She was like, I have to leave.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:36.480]   I have to take a moment because it was very, very visceral.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.960]   Erica Hill-- I'm sorry, Erica.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.920]   I should remember your name.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:39.920]   I apologize.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.480]   And she's still on CNN, I think.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.640]   All right, now we've mentioned it.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.080]   We can move on.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.960]   I wasn't going to, but it's kind of hard not to.
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.360]   And since we have people from New York on the show,
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.280]   I thought I should probably bring it up.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:59.000]   The big story of the week is Apple versus Epic.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.560]   And I'm really-- I've been kind of very interested
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.720]   in getting to this show and finding out
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.200]   what you all think of this.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.160]   Because Apple basically said we lost.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.280]   I mean, we won.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.560]   Epic said we lost.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.880]   But I think it's more complicated than that.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.760]   And I think it's fascinating.
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.080]   And by the way, Epic has now appealed.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.400]   So that kind of goes along with the we lost.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.440]   Where they lost was Apple-- the judge
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.600]   was unwilling to call Apple a monopoly.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.960]   Judge Yvonne Contales Rogers ruled Friday,
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:37.440]   Epic should pay damages to Apple for violating rules,
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:43.000]   but was-- and was unwilling to call Apple a monopoly.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.800]   Both companies will bear the costs of their own cases.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:53.120]   But I don't think it's exactly a loss,
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.000]   because the judge also said to Apple,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.160]   you need to make some changes in your app store.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.160]   And maybe it's fair to say this is the least Apple could
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:09.200]   have expected, or this has been what's coming all along.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:12.400]   But it could have cost Apple billions of dollars.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:18.840]   The judge says you have to let iOS apps use quote buttons,
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.080]   external links, or other calls to action
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.720]   that direct customers to purchasing methods other
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.560]   than Apple's payment system.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.760]   And it strikes me that Apple may have won this battle,
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.560]   but they've lost the war.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.800]   You agree?
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.880]   Brianna?
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.040]   I don't know if I would go as far as say, lost the war.
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.280]   I think big tech lost overall here.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:49.560]   So I think if you are skeptical about the amount of power,
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.800]   unchecked power, large technology companies have,
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.320]   you kind of won with this.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.080]   I thought it was very interesting that the judge noted
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.960]   that being very, very successful does not
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.960]   make you a monopoly, which the Apple store certainly is.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.120]   But I think the part of it I'm most worried about
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.840]   is it seems like this is opening up apps to all kinds
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.880]   of payment systems.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.680]   I mean, if I want to put out a video game that
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.720]   has in-app purchases with a Dogecoin, can I do that now?
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.640]   Because from my reading of this, I think I could.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.760]   I really kind of worry about the scams that could come up
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.160]   with payment systems now.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.920]   Apple also was sure what it means.
[00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.440]   They said it's too early to determine how or when exactly
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.480]   the changes will be implemented.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.000]   They have three months.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.960]   They said, we want to have conversations with the judge
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.000]   to find out what she means.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.760]   But it's not even clear that it says,
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.360]   allow third party payment systems.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:53.440]   But you just-- the least aggressive interpretation
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.280]   would be, say, in the Kindle app, which you've
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:00.840]   been prohibited from linking to Amazon's website to buy a book.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.320]   They could now link to Amazon's website to buy a book.
[00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.400]   That would bypass Apple's 30%.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.280]   Apple has prohibited that in the past.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.400]   Lisa, you cover mobile.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.960]   Yes.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.960]   Apple said this is a victory.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.160]   The court is affirmed, but we've known it all along.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.880]   The app store is not in violation of antitrust law.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.520]   And success is not illegal.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.160]   It's a resounding victory, is it?
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.480]   You know, I don't think it's that simple.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.200]   I think it's a little bit of both.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.160]   I think the outcome definitely could have been a lot worse
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.200]   for Apple.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:35.880]   I think if they were ordered to maybe change the fee that they
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:39.000]   charge and lower it, maybe that would have been a worse outcome.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.200]   But I do think we are going to see some ramifications from this
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.240]   because don't forget, Apple makes a lot of money
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.200]   from the app store.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.240]   I think-- I might have to check this,
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.280]   but I think it's their second largest business
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:52.800]   after the iPhone.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.760]   So it's a big deal.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.400]   And I don't know exactly how much money
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.640]   makes from the app store.
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.400]   They don't break out that specific information.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.080]   But I can probably only assume it's a lot because a lot of other--
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.560]   We know it's billions.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.600]   Yeah, I mean, it's that.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.440]   And iCloud subscriptions, I would imagine,
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.640]   especially considering a lot of their other services
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.920]   are still new.
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:18.040]   So this is a big deal for them.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.480]   But I'm also curious about--
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.920]   you mentioned we don't know how Apple is going to implement this yet.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.280]   And I think that's a big deal because if it's something
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.600]   that's cumbersome for developers to put into their apps,
[00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.600]   or if there are specific rules about where the call to action
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:38.120]   can be placed or how big it is, consumers might not use it anyway.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.600]   And then they're still using in-app purchasing
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.000]   because a lot of this depends on how the consumer decides
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   to purchase something through the app.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.240]   So I think there's a lot of questions that are still up in the air
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.240]   about this for sure.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.240]   Carl, did Apple breathe a sigh of relief?
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.600]   I guess they did.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.440]   Yeah, I think like you guys said, it's kind of a mixed bag.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.000]   They could have had it much worse.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.040]   The court basically said that they could be a monopoly,
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.960]   but that Epic really didn't prove that in the case.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.240]   So the door is open here.
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.960]   And you still have all these other lawsuits against Google,
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.840]   for example.
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.400]   And some of that-- I don't know if you saw the unredacted
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.960]   Epic complaint against Google, but that
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.880]   includes some very interesting, more pointed--
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.200]   sorry about that.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.280]   It's OK.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.880]   The unredacted Google complaint can
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.120]   say some information showing how they were actually
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.920]   paying wireless carriers.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.240]   And game developers.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.920]   Yeah, they were paying wireless carriers something like 25%
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.080]   of the commission.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.600]   And that was right around 2010 when Google was starting
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:46.160]   to kind of drift away from its original founding vision,
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.840]   like it used to support net neutrality.
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.360]   And around 2010, you saw them kind of shift away from that.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.880]   And the unredacted complaint Epic file
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.360]   showed that Google is basically throwing money
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.080]   in their direction, billions of dollars to not try.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.960]   So I think as you see more of these cases coming out
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.440]   and more of the antitrust inquiries
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.680]   with the Linnacon at the FTC, it's
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.880]   going to get complicated.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.640]   Google, for instance, at one point
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.400]   thought about buying Epic.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.160]   They were so worried.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.040]   Exactly.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.240]   They paid top game developers, including Activision Blizzard,
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.480]   not to leave the Google platform.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.440]   And they were paying phone makers not to include competing
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.160]   app stores on the phone.
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.520]   But that's the interesting point in this,
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.240]   is that unlike the iPhone, there is a setting on Android
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.440]   devices that say use third party app stores.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.400]   So you don't have to use Google.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.440]   And I think Google probably doesn't worry about it so much
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.360]   because people just do what's easy.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.000]   And I'm sure that's why Apple's not too worried about this.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   In fact, it makes you wonder why Apple fought so hard.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.800]   Because people are just going to use Apple Pay.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.440]   It's just easier.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.520]   Yeah, it works well.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.800]   I don't know what it sounds like though.
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.360]   No, go ahead.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.120]   Sorry.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:00.200]   Finish going on.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.240]   The system works well, and it's already set up
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.560]   to give them a bunch of advantages.
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.520]   So I think a lot of people are going to still
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.440]   continue to use them.
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:07.400]   And I don't know.
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.960]   Plus, we're entering this phase now where they're
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.440]   going to debate about the definition of a button for six
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:11.800]   months.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.880]   And then we have to see if people actually enforce anything.
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.280]   So they've got a lot of runway here to tinker with them.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.400]   Analysts don't know, and they won't say how much
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.120]   is Dakota cost?
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.720]   Billions.
[00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:29.920]   But how much is billions according to a sensor tower?
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:34.720]   Apple, from games alone, and mostly from in app purchases,
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.200]   made $3.8 billion in 2020.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:42.200]   But Brianna, you think that that's at risk or not?
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.080]   I think a really good question to ask yourself
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.800]   with almost anything in technology is, hey,
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.680]   how would Fortune use this?
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.520]   So I would really encourage you to ask yourself--
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.160]   You know that from bitter experience
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.120]   that you should ask the question.
[00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.400]   So we're all assuming here rational actors.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.520]   We're thinking about our use case.
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.080]   Of course, I get the modal dialogue that comes up
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.600]   when I get an iPhone.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.920]   I put in my credit card.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:10.960]   Apple Pay is easy.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.120]   That's what I go to.
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:17.040]   How would someone really deranged operate
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.360]   to exploit this rule?
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:22.360]   And I would encourage you guys to take a closer look
[00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:25.280]   at children's games on iOS.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.720]   Because I know it all started with that $99
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.000]   smurfberry thing.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.480]   It did not stop there.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.200]   It was calling me now on Skype.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:34.800]   Oh my gosh.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.360]   When you say deranged, you don't mean Tim Sweeney.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:40.760]   You mean other-- even more deranged people
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:43.520]   than the head of Epic.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.360]   Yeah, I think that it's going to be interesting.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.000]   Let's say you're in the Kindle app or the Netflix app.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.240]   And you say, I want to subscribe.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:56.600]   I imagine what you'll see now is pay with Apple Pay.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.440]   Pay on the Netflix site, maybe equal sized buttons.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.600]   It depends how Apple allows them.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.200]   But I think this is the spirit of the ruling.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.880]   If it's 30% less, or maybe even only 15% less
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:11.040]   to pay on the Netflix website, maybe people will do that.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.800]   But I think it's just so easy to go.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.880]   You pay with Apple.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.000]   That's the face recognition.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   It's done.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.240]   I'm sure Apple's assuming the vast majority of people--
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.880]   this won't be a change.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.720]   I think that's right.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.960]   And Epic called it a loss.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.520]   But it's not-- when you consider this is probably
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.440]   the biggest change to be implemented in the Apple store.
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.160]   And I don't know.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.240]   It's history, perhaps.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.600]   I think that's something.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.360]   It's not exactly like that's nothing.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.520]   And it may be worse coming.
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.840]   I mean, South Korea is making Apple put other app stores
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.360]   on the phone in South Korea.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.840]   The same thing may happen in other countries.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.880]   It's on the table in many countries.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.400]   So Apple--
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.040]   And then you layer on these other antitrust inquiries.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.920]   And I think there's a real sea change happening here.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.920]   I don't know if it'll result in anything,
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.040]   but it's moving that direction.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:56.680]   Well, that's true.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.400]   Yeah, and I think that's-- oh, sorry to you.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.280]   I'm just going to say, Carl, I think
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.920]   that's what makes this so interesting, too,
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.920]   is because this is really one of the first times
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.520]   that we are seeing the type of action
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.840]   that would be taken in an antitrust case like this.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.360]   Like you were saying, there's a lot of concerns right now
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:17.280]   and a lot of different lawsuits and issues that are being raised.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.840]   And I feel like this is kind of like our first peak
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:29.120]   into how the country is thinking about the modern antitrust
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.320]   situation in big tech today.
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.320]   And I think that's really interesting.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.040]   I mean, you consider that first decade from 2000 to 2010.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.440]   It was all about innovation and how
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.680]   miraculous and amazing all the technologies were.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.560]   And then right around the 2010 point,
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.280]   people started to think a little more deeply
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.680]   about some of this stuff.
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:48.440]   Like, how do I moderate content at scale?
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.960]   What does the gatekeeper power on the phone device actually
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:51.480]   mean?
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.800]   People started to actually notice.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.200]   And I think we've finally just in the last maybe year or two
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:00.760]   started to see some actual action in terms of even the GOP
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.320]   and both parties being interested in kind of rating
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.160]   and some big tech stuff.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.440]   But remember, I think you've covered this.
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:11.600]   How much money, big tech, telecoms, pay Congress
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.520]   to keep them in check.
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:18.880]   I mean, that's suspicious about anything significant happening
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.040]   from Congress.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.880]   I mean, that's the problem with antitrust reform,
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.200]   is it's so broad an impact.
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.640]   So many companies that you get just
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.480]   this massive coalition of companies across industries
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.920]   all funneling all their money towards one thing,
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.880]   which is not any expansion of existing antitrust law.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:34.840]   And it's hard to beat that.
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.520]   If you're-- the opponents in that case
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.880]   are going to be consumer groups and activists and academics,
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.800]   and they're outgunned, they're outfunded.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.360]   So it's going to be hard.
[00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.040]   I think there is a sea change here,
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.920]   but whether it actually ends in any meaningful antitrust
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.360]   reform is really clear.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.720]   It seems more likely to happen in the EU
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.280]   than it does in the US.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.840]   I don't know, Brianna, you looked into this
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.440]   when you were running for Congress.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.320]   Mm-hmm.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.840]   As long as congressional campaigns are heavily funded
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.160]   by the companies they're trying to regulate,
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.640]   I wonder how much regulation can be done.
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.440]   I unfortunately have to agree, or just how curious
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.920]   they are about these issues.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.680]   It seems to be very, very low.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.040]   I would encourage you to go to open secrets
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:20.360]   and look at how much, say, AT&T donates
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.800]   to people on the science, space, and technology
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:23.800]   committee in Congress.
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.720]   It is a ridiculously low amount for the legislation
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.960]   that get passed.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.600]   Don't confuse all the sound and fury,
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.320]   which politicians do for the base.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.440]   Oh, we're not going to let them censor our politicians
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.600]   with actual action.
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.600]   100%.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.840]   Yeah, although I have to say both Texas and Florida
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.320]   have passed bills that prevent social media companies
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:51.080]   from blocking politicians because of what they say.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.120]   I don't know how constitutional those would be.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:56.800]   The Florida bill, I think a judge already
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.800]   issued an injunction, a temporary restraining order on.
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:01.360]   And the Texas bill just got passed,
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.200]   so we'll see what happens there.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.240]   Leo, I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.880]   but sometimes politicians do things for show
[00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.360]   because they got an election coming up.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:11.480]   I'm sorry to tell you.
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.200]   Oh, no.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.640]   I'm disillusioned.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:16.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.840]   How could you say that?
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.520]   America is a country that we like monopolies.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.960]   You look at the airline industry.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.080]   You look at the banking industry.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.600]   You look at insurance and telecom.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.480]   And the last two years has been heavily focused on big tech.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.080]   But it's everywhere when you look at it,
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.560]   when you really step back.
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.600]   Yeah, and as Apple said, the judge
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.320]   affirmed success is not illegal.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.760]   And by the way, nobody's asserting
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:43.920]   that any of these companies are somehow flawed.
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.120]   Well, mostly nobody's asserting somehow these companies
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.000]   are flawed by being successful.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   They're flawed by being monopolistic,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.960]   by using their success in the marketplace
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.960]   to dominate other companies and to put them out of business
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.840]   and to prevent other companies from coming in
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.200]   and taking business away from them.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.720]   Well, that consumer welfare standard that all the antitrust
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.160]   focus is always focused on is basically saying,
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.120]   if the prices are low and consumers are happy,
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.760]   then there's no real problem here.
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.800]   That's kind of an overarching logic
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.280]   that's gone through antitrust reform.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.000]   But like, you know, Linnacon at the FTC
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.040]   was came to fame by just saying, you know,
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.080]   if there's more going on here than just whether consumers
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.080]   are happy, are you impacting other businesses?
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:20.800]   Right.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.880]   You create a gatekeeper gardens.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:25.200]   In the long run, consumers won't be happy
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.600]   if there's only one place you can buy something
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:31.040]   online, only one place you can buy a smartphone.
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:34.600]   That is not in the long run going to make consumers happy
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.240]   or keep prices low.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.960]   They're only low until there's no competition.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.920]   Yeah, and specifically with this, you know,
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.440]   app store debate that we've been seeing play out recently
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.560]   and in the EPIC trial, you know, I'm really curious to see
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.640]   if some developers do lower the prices of their apps
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.600]   or their subscriptions if they don't have to go through Apple.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.960]   Because remember, I think Spotify was the one that kind of,
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.680]   you know, stepped out and said this.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:01.680]   Maybe last year in 2019, I forget, you know, the CEO said,
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.880]   hey, you know, we have to inflate our prices because,
[00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:08.200]   you know, we have to pay this, you know, 30% concession to Apple
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.400]   and then we don't have a choice.
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.480]   And you know, Apple does not have to do that with Apple music.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.960]   So it's a different situation.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:18.000]   So now I'm curious to see if there really is an impact on prices
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.720]   the way, you know, we've kind of been led to believe.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.880]   Oh, no, the cynic in me is going to say, no, of course,
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.280]   you know better than that.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.320]   (laughing)
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.360]   - Pass those savings on to us.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:29.560]   - Pass those savings on to the consumer.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:30.400]   - That's right.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.400]   - Moving on to our CEO.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.920]   He needs more compensation.
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:37.440]   - If I could just say, I feel like we're focusing on Apple here
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.320]   and Apple is obviously the most, the more interesting
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.480]   of the two companies.
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.080]   But I think looking at EPIC,
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.440]   I think this has gone really under examined.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.880]   I mean, EPIC in some ways took a really big risk.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:54.680]   Yeah, did some very expensive litigation in an effort.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.960]   I'm so torn here though,
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.360]   because Unreal Engine is amazing.
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.400]   That's why I built my career on.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.440]   But, you know, EPIC had this really big scandal
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.560]   just a few weeks ago.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.360]   Leo, I don't know if you heard about this,
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:11.960]   but there's a really big indie game called Among Us.
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.080]   And basically you have a bunch of players
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:16.400]   who try to figure out who the imposter is
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.360]   and the imposter is going around secretly murdering people,
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.280]   trying to evade game caught as long as possible.
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.360]   - It's AOC's favorite game, I know.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:24.400]   - It's a great game.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.600]   - It's wonderful.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:29.480]   So EPIC took Fortnite and copied--
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.320]   - Oh Lord.
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.200]   - Literally every single bit of this indie game
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.880]   that broke out, they called it imposter.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.160]   You know, they used the same lexicon.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.440]   And you obviously can't patent gameplay,
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.560]   in order to want that.
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.000]   But this was a very big ripoff
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.320]   when they could have just partnered with the studio.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.920]   So as much as like through this,
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.840]   I'm like, I want to give EPIC kudos
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:56.320]   for picking a really big legal fight with a giant
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:00.440]   when there really wasn't that much win in it for them.
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.520]   On the other hand, I'm like,
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.960]   it's kind of undercuts their credibility
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.760]   when they've gone through a Fortnite
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:10.720]   and have stolen the game design, basically.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.560]   PUBG and Among Us and others
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.840]   to basically get a piece of the pie.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.200]   So it really undermines their credibility
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.840]   as standing up for the little guy.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:23.640]   I think a lot of us have said on various shows
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.760]   that it's a good lawsuit,
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:28.520]   but it's a terrible company to be making in the lawsuit.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.800]   That it's great to call Apple to the carpet,
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:33.720]   but maybe EPIC isn't the champion that you really want.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:37.280]   By the way, Call of Duty also has a double agent mode
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:38.760]   that is a copy of Among Us.
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.200]   But that doesn't happen all the time
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.040]   if the game is successful.
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.760]   - Yeah, I mean, I could give you a hundred examples.
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.360]   - I mean, really, Among Us is werewolf.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.640]   - Right.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.680]   - Yeah, you can go back that way,
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.320]   but there's a different thing than taking a hit indie game
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.960]   and using the exact same terminology.
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:58.800]   - I guess, yeah.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.480]   - It's just to me that's not impossible.
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.320]   - Yeah.
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.760]   - Yeah, like agent or something.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:05.960]   - Yeah, secret agent.
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:09.680]   Yeah, I'm completely with you.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:14.680]   And by the way, Fortnite does not get back on the iOS platform
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.280]   just because of this ruling.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.840]   They're still not, they asked Apple,
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:22.000]   give us back our developer credentials
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:22.880]   and Apple said no.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.560]   So it doesn't--
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.680]   - And the judge agreed that they have violated their contract.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.560]   - Yeah, yeah, they're not back on that.
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.440]   - They have to pay a fine.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.400]   So I guess, yeah, in balance,
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.960]   Apple knew it was gonna have to give up a little bit.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.400]   That's what they gave up.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.240]   The big one that they didn't wanna give up,
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.560]   they get to keep.
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:41.640]   And I think they probably aren't gonna lose a lot of money.
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.160]   I think most users are gonna go with whatever the easiest thing
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.960]   is and you know Apple's gonna do everything they can
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:49.120]   and make it easier to pay through Apple than anything else,
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.920]   no matter how many other links there are.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.120]   - I disagree with you, Leah.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.280]   I think we're gonna see some scams coming up.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.280]   I think it's a good point.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:57.120]   - Scams is a good point.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.760]   - And actually that was one of the,
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.400]   one of, in fact, that was a little offended
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:05.440]   'cause was it any queue came on and said,
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.760]   yeah, you know, Mac OS is so insecure because we allow this.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.400]   We don't ever wanna allow this on iOS.
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.520]   And it's like what?
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.520]   (laughs)
[00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:18.440]   That's your defenses to throw Mac OS under the bus.
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.600]   Okay.
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.200]   (laughs)
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:26.520]   The judge, by the way, did not buy that argument at all.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.480]   All right, let's take a little break.
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.080]   Take a breath, relax.
[00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:29.840]   It's great to have you.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:33.480]   Brianna Wu is here from Rebellion Pack.
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.160]   So nice to see you and your red beret.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.200]   Have you joined, have you joined the,
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:42.320]   what was the name of that vigilante group in New York City?
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.360]   The red beret, the war, the red berets.
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.880]   - No, there's a Curtis Sleever.
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.720]   - Any crew?
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:49.600]   - Oh yeah, Curtis Sleever, yeah, where's that?
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:53.280]   - Then Curtis, he ran for mayor, I think.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.120]   - He did, yeah.
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.080]   - He's still wearing a red beret.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.280]   - Yeah, that guy's amazing.
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.120]   He just keeps on going.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.880]   He got shot 12 times by the mob
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.520]   and he just continues on his very way.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.800]   - The Guardian Angels.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:03.800]   - Guardian, yeah, that's it.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.040]   - The Guardian Angels.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:08.000]   Is that your Guardian Angel, Red beret?
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   - Honestly, I just, I figured out
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.480]   I don't always have to do my hair if I'm wearing a white.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.320]   - Oh.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.120]   - I'm like, you know, on TV and Zoom.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.160]   That's literally my thinking process behind it.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.400]   - I got a giant cowboy hat for that.
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.640]   (laughing)
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.720]   - Well, I know you're there with your Dyson air route
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:27.560]   before the show, you know?
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.480]   - Actually, I do all that.
[00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.400]   I do it all, man.
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:33.440]   I gotta get the curls in and all of that, you bet, you bet.
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.080]   Also with us Carl Bodie, who's now having second thoughts,
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.000]   Carl, of course, long time tech reporter.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.560]   I didn't know this, one of the founders of DSL reports,
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.680]   which I have long plugged.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.760]   - Yeah, it was a good job on that.
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.680]   And we see him all the time now in tech dirt.
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.560]   In fact, I'm gonna talk to you about an article
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.240]   you posted on tech dirt recently.
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.720]   And a couple of vice articles, too,
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:58.400]   we got on the rent down from you.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.480]   It's a busy guy.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:02.120]   And from CNET senior editor Lisa Etta Chico,
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:03.960]   great to see you and your purple hair.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.040]   It's so wonderful. - Thank you.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:05.880]   - Is it purple?
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.400]   - Is that right or pink?
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.080]   - It's kind of more of like a magenta pink kind of color.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.240]   - Gotta get it right.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.400]   - It kind of changes a lot.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.240]   - I love it.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.080]   No, it's great.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.000]   - Yeah, thank you.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:16.840]   Thank you.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.760]   - Everybody needs a trademark, right?
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.600]   - Exactly.
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:25.000]   - Yeah, our show today brought to you by Zip Recruiter.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.480]   Okay, I love this.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.320]   According to Forbes, gyms, nail salons,
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:32.040]   what are these businesses having common?
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.400]   Mom and pop stores and restaurants.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.560]   They're all, you can't go to a restaurant these days
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.920]   without a help wanted sign in the window.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:41.560]   They're all on an epic hiring spree.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.920]   Don't put a help wanted sign in the window.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.720]   Hire smart with Zip Recruiter.
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:50.200]   All these businesses reopening means millions of jobs
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.680]   need to be filled and the best way,
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:54.560]   and I can tell you from actual experience.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.880]   The best way to fill these positions is with Zip Recruiter.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:58.840]   Why, well, I'll tell you.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.400]   First thing, you post your job on Zip Recruiter.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.960]   It automatically posts to more than 100 other job boards.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.400]   You're casting the widest possible net.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.720]   Plus Twitter and Facebook and all the social networks.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:13.120]   You're gonna get your job posting in front of the most people.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:17.200]   That means the most likely, the right person will see it.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:20.000]   But then Zip Recruiter has something unique that's fantastic.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.400]   They're matching technology.
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.800]   It scans resumes across its network
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.200]   of millions of job seekers.
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:31.200]   It looks for someone that matches your qualifications
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:34.720]   and then proactively presents them to you.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:38.440]   And by the way, evidence shows that when you invite somebody
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:42.920]   to apply, you're gonna get more candidates and better candidates.
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.520]   You can easily review the recommendations before you invite.
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:47.960]   You invite the top choices to apply for your job.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.040]   That means you're gonna apply faster.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.720]   According to Zip Recruiter internal data,
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:55.080]   jobs where employers invite candidates to apply
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:58.160]   will get two and a half times more candidates.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.200]   And I have to tell you from my own experience,
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.160]   again, better candidates.
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.000]   People you really wanna hire.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.720]   Zip Recruiter's technology is so effective.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:08.560]   Four out of five employers who post on Zip Recruiter
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.560]   get a quality candidate within the first day.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:14.560]   When we use it, often we'll get a quality candidate
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.040]   within an hour.
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.800]   Like that fast, it's amazing.

[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:46.720]   It's really great.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.200]   I can't go anywhere in Petaloma without seeing help
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.480]   wanted, help wanted, help wanted.
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:53.160]   It's a good time to be looking for work.
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:54.560]   All right, let's move on.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.280]   I'm sorry, we're gonna be talking a lot about Apple.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.640]   There is a lot of Apple news.
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:59.120]   And it will be that way next week too
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.640]   because the invitations have gone out.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:06.640]   Apple is having an event on Tuesday, California streaming,
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:10.240]   which is a nice little play on the mamas
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.200]   and the papa song.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:14.600]   And there was a picture of a lake and a floating Apple.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:19.120]   Lisa, do you go through the annual parsing
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:21.360]   of the invitation at CNET?
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.240]   Is there a lot of time spent on what does this mean?
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:27.880]   - You know, honestly, I never read too much into it.
[00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:30.720]   I mean, it's kind of fun, I guess, to look at it.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.200]   But it's kind of, I don't know,
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.840]   I don't feel like you get too much out of it.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.720]   I mean, every year it seems like Apple has like some kind
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:41.600]   of like augmented reality Easter egg in these invites now
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.560]   and it doesn't really amount too much.
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.880]   - It usually doesn't, does it after all of that.
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:48.880]   - This one is-- - It had some puns
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.160]   in there, like last year I think it was time flies
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.480]   and like the Anvells, the Apple watch like, okay,
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.800]   but we were expecting that anyway.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.640]   So.
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.080]   - Yeah, this was gonna, well, yeah,
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.200]   you're gonna be streaming the event.
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.680]   Anything else to say about that?
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:02.920]   - We pretty much know this is an iPhone of anime
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.680]   and this is the time.
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:05.520]   - Yes.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.200]   - You wrote an interesting piece where you said,
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.400]   if they make a mini, this might be the last mini.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.360]   - Yeah, I mean, of course, we won't really know for sure
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:17.080]   until Apple and Vals, whatever it's gonna unveil.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:21.200]   But yeah, there have been some reports that in 2022,
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.080]   Apple could pivot towards actually, you know,
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:27.080]   getting rid of the mini and instead releasing another
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.160]   version of the Pro Max, since that seems to be
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:32.600]   one of the more popular models.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:36.040]   - So they didn't sell that well this year, right?
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:37.520]   - No, it doesn't seem that way.
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.680]   I mean, I've seen like, you know,
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:42.080]   of course Apple doesn't specify by model,
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.080]   which one sold well and which ones didn't,
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.320]   but, and they would never say something didn't sell well
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.240]   anyway, but there's been like quite a few reports
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:52.280]   that I believe are based on like, you know,
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:55.040]   channel checks at carriers and whatnot,
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:58.480]   from, you know, market research companies that have,
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:01.880]   you know, indicated that the 12 mini didn't sell well.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.000]   And I think that was a little surprising at first,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.880]   because whenever there's, you know, a new iPhone size,
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.760]   people are usually really excited about it.
[00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.360]   And for years, there's been this shift
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.880]   to bigger and bigger screens.
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:15.360]   So I think there was some expectation that
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.520]   some people might be kind of sick of that
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.960]   and looking for something smaller,
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:22.120]   especially after the iPhone SE did pretty well.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:25.240]   But yeah, it turned out that wasn't really the case.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:29.120]   Because of an Apple MagSafe filing with the FCC,
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:32.920]   we do, I think, know that they mentioned eight different
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:36.400]   models for legacy models and four new models,
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.440]   models numbers we hadn't seen before.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.440]   So I think we do know that Tuesday,
[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.480]   Apple will announce four new iPhones.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:43.320]   Is that right?
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.480]   Is that fair to say?
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.440]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.280]   I mean, that's about all of the reports
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:50.240]   that we've seen leading up to this event are indicating.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.440]   So, you know, and again, this is usually the time of year
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.440]   when Apple announces its new iPhones.
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.720]   Last year, I think, was a little bit of an exception
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:58.560]   to the rules.
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.680]   So, but yeah, I mean, I think it's been every September
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:04.360]   since like 2012 or something like that,
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.320]   Apple's been announcing new iPhones.
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:10.520]   So yeah, I feel like almost certain at this point, for sure.
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.360]   - And--
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:12.400]   - I feel so guilty.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.680]   I'm part of the problem that I want the mini to do now.
[00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:18.320]   And that's about the max.
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.520]   I'm rooting for the mini.
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:21.080]   - You want the extra--
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:22.920]   - It's so funny because so many of the people
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:26.000]   on our shows said, "Oh, I can't wait.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.040]   The mini's gonna be great.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.240]   The mini's gonna be great."
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.080]   But I think you're right.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.480]   You go for the extra cameras.
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:33.280]   You go for the bigger screen, the better screen,
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.960]   the better processor.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.800]   - And also don't forget--
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.640]   - You can not have like--
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.480]   - Oh, go ahead.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.320]   - No.
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.480]   - Oh, sorry, no, I was gonna say the mini also isn't
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.840]   that much cheaper than the regular iPhone 12.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.120]   So I think that's part of it too.
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.120]   It wasn't as cheap as it could have been.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:50.000]   And also 6.1 inches is not like the big phone these days.
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:50.840]   - Yeah.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:51.680]   - Yeah.
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:52.520]   - Exactly.
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:53.480]   - They weren't positioning it.
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.120]   They were still positioning it as a premium.
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:56.200]   It was just a smaller phone.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.880]   It wasn't an SE.
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:58.720]   - That's right.
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.640]   - And I wonder if the fourth phone might be an SE
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.960]   this year because it's been two years.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.600]   I think that sold very well.
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.640]   In fact, I recommend the SE to a lot of people
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:11.760]   because it's a less expensive but late model iPhone.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:14.120]   - Yeah, that's easy to say.
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:15.640]   - Oh, sorry, go ahead Brianna.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.240]   - Yeah, yes, you were talking.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.240]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.280]   No, I was just gonna say,
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:23.040]   I wish they put out a mini with a better camera on it.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.640]   Like the reason I always go for the Pro and the Macs,
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:26.640]   it's the camera.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:30.560]   Like once you have that zoom function and that quality,
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.440]   it just comes in handy all the time.
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:37.640]   So, you know, put that form factor in the mini and I buy it
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:41.920]   is that they, I think they assume that the person
[00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:45.400]   that wants the mini is also going to want a bargain.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.880]   And I don't agree with that.
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.640]   Like we're about the old enough to remember
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:51.480]   when smaller tech was actually more expensive
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.040]   because you had to mini, you have to mini,
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.480]   you know, miniaturize all the parts inside of it.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.880]   If you can do that, I will take a battery hit.
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.800]   I just, I want a really well done small phone
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.560]   and they will produce that.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.320]   - We'll be planning spending plenty of time.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:11.080]   All next week talking about whatever Apple does announce
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:13.680]   the live stream, Mike Sergeant will join me
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.720]   10 a.m. Pacific one p.m. Eastern on Tuesday.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.280]   We take our life in our hands and restream apples,
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.880]   a stream with our commentary behind it.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:24.920]   So you can watch that or you can watch the original Apple
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.080]   content and then Mac break weekly immediately after.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:30.400]   So, iOS day will start a little bit early on Tuesday
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.560]   so that we can do that.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:35.360]   Probably there'll be no AirPods.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:38.320]   Probably there will be a new Apple Watch.
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.920]   Some or all of this stuff will be in short supply
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.840]   because of chip shortages.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.440]   Apple's less hit by chip shortages than a lot of companies,
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.200]   but they still use legacy, what they call legacy nodes.
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.600]   And some of those are still hard to get.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:55.200]   In particular, the rumor is that the Apple Series 7 watch
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:57.760]   will be hard to get, but not because of shortages,
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.880]   but because it's hard to make that new big screen
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:01.160]   that they're gonna put on it.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.800]   One millimeter bigger.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:06.560]   One silly little millimeter bigger.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:09.760]   Anyway, all the coverage really begins Tuesday
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.920]   and we'll continue until you're sick of it.
[00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.040]   I thought the most interesting thing,
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.080]   and I really hope this happens.
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:19.400]   Google released a teaser for its Pixel 6
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:23.240]   that got people talking
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:28.240]   'cause it looked like they might be showing some dates in there.
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:32.520]   Let me show you and see what you think
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:36.840]   of the new Pixel 6 trailer.
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.640]   'Cause I may have a positive when we get to some.
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.720]   Okay, so what if, there it is,
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.920]   what was that?
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:44.920]   No. What was that?
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:47.320]   What was that? It says 9.30.
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.320]   Yeah. Okay.
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.320]   Well, maybe it's gonna be September 30th
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.760]   or is it 9.30 in the morning?
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.120]   I don't know. Keep playing, keep playing.
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.840]   The smartphones were just, wait a minute,
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:56.680]   wait a minute, what was that?
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:59.240]   Monday, oh two.
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:00.640]   Are they messing with us, Lisa?
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:03.520]   Is this just, they're just messing with us now.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:04.840]   They might be, I mean, like we said,
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:07.360]   reading into these things, you know,
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.440]   I feel like companies know that we're gonna read
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.520]   into this to some degree.
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:13.600]   So they try to maybe throw some Easter eggs in there
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:15.520]   or maybe just try to throw us off their scent.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:17.440]   There's at least four dates in this.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.000]   Okay, there's the 21st.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.400]   There was a rumor for a long time
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.800]   that it was gonna be tomorrow.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.040]   It was gonna be on the 13th, but everybody says,
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.000]   oh, you wouldn't announce a phone the day before Apple.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.640]   Oh gosh, I hope not.
[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.320]   But the whole thing Google needs to do
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:33.440]   is to get people talking.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.640]   And this teaser certainly people talking.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:37.480]   I would-
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:39.360]   Yeah, and if you, you know, it's interesting
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.840]   that they're doing this like for this specific pixel model
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.360]   because, you know, as you can see,
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.040]   just based on the new design
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:48.280]   and the way they're kind of positioning this,
[00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:51.000]   you know, they're kind of trying to rebrand pixel
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.600]   as being, you know, a really premium phone again
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:57.200]   after a couple of years of the A-series being more popular
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.840]   than the regular phone.
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:43:59.840]   So it's interesting.
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.480]   And I think, you know, it was a while ago.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:03.760]   So I might not be remembering correctly,
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.880]   but I think they pulled off like a similar stunt
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:10.080]   when the original pixel was announced back in 2016.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.760]   Like they did something around the same time
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:14.880]   as like the new iPhone launch, I think.
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:15.880]   And you know.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.000]   We all thought they got so badly burnt by that
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.680]   that they said never again.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:24.280]   But, you know, you gotta get attention however you can.
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:26.680]   You gotta get the Lisa at a Chico's of the world ago.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:28.320]   Oh, there's a new phone.
[00:44:28.320 --> 00:44:30.160]   (laughing)
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:31.840]   We oughta cover that.
[00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.480]   I think you're about reading it wrong.
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:37.720]   I think these are, this is a lost series of numbers.
[00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:40.240]   Like the six of lost.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:42.680]   Four, eight, 15, 16, what was it?
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:43.680]   32.
[00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.720]   These are magical numbers.
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:47.560]   Do something.
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:49.440]   So let's write them all down.
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:53.280]   Well, Google would not be unheard of for Google
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.360]   to do something crazy like that, right?
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:56.200]   (laughing)
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:59.000]   To just, you know, oh yeah, that's the Fibonacci sequence.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.280]   And if you were carefully observing,
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:05.160]   we left out the numbers five and seven or something like that.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.320]   (laughing)
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:08.400]   I wouldn't put it past them at all.
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.520]   So I don't know.
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.920]   It's, you know, they're clearly throwing those numbers
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:14.240]   in just to get us.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:15.400]   It will be an interesting phone.
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:16.880]   It's gonna have Google Silicon.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.400]   There's gonna be more and more,
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:21.160]   I hear more and more rumors about this phone being
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:24.900]   kind of massively powerful, especially machine learning.
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:30.320]   It's about time Google kind of took last year off.
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:33.440]   I don't know.
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:37.520]   Well, I'm actually rooting for them to announce it tomorrow.
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.720]   And we'll all have to scramble.
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:40.560]   (laughing)
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:42.280]   - And even busier week for us, yes.
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:44.480]   - Jason and I have to be running in.
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:46.120]   You'll have to go quick.
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.120]   Who do we have on the Google front?
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:49.960]   Yeah, it'll be great.
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.760]   - Jumping back just a little bit.
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:53.920]   I mean, speaking really honestly,
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.720]   are you rooting for the chip shortage
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.560]   with like a small part of your mind?
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:02.480]   Because for me, it's like, I look at what this is done
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:05.520]   for the car industry and used cars.
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.600]   - It's killed the car industry.
[00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.640]   - It's killed the new car industry.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:12.240]   But it's also like older cars.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.080]   - Oh, I know.
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:16.280]   - Like people are ringing more life out of their cars
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:17.560]   and they're maintaining them.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:18.400]   And it's like--
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.680]   - And they're ringing more money out of used car buyers
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:21.520]   at the same time.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.360]   - Fair, fair.
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:23.920]   Oh my, I'm biased.
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.760]   My cars have all gone up and bought.
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:26.600]   (laughing)
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.520]   But at the same time, it's like,
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:31.960]   none of us need a new phone every single year.
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:33.080]   Like we all participate
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:35.520]   'cause we're in the tech industry to various degrees.
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:39.320]   But do you think that like, maybe this is the moment
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.480]   we take a collective breath and say,
[00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:44.880]   "Do we really need to get on this upgrade cycle every year?"
[00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:47.160]   'Cause I think it could be good.
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:48.920]   - Yeah, I think that's already kind of faded.
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.720]   Oh, sorry, go ahead Carl.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.680]   - I'm off for slowing the hype cycle a little bit,
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:55.440]   especially as somebody who covers the right to repair
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:56.360]   be quite a bit.
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.440]   And how much more and better we could be doing
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:01.560]   in terms of sustainability and reusing and repairing devices.
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:02.400]   - I bought--
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.960]   - And then for me that slows it down just a little bit.
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.200]   I mean, I like gadgets too, but we could slow it down
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.600]   by maybe at least 10% hop and maybe--
[00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.440]   - Plus, this is purely personal,
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:13.840]   but September is so damn expensive.
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:14.680]   - Yeah.
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:17.080]   - I gotta buy so much crap.
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:17.920]   And it's not just for me.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:19.760]   - I got it Jason, how all needs some stuff,
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:21.040]   Mike needs some stuff.
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.880]   I bought the framework laptop, Carl,
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:26.080]   'cause I wanted to see if you could make a repairable
[00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:28.840]   laptop and I love it unreasonably.
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:31.360]   It's actually the best laptop I've got now.
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:33.560]   I'm really a fan.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:36.160]   You can open it up, everything's QR coded.
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.640]   Many of the parts are stock,
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:41.280]   so you could easily add memory, replace memory and storage.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:42.960]   You can replace the battery easily.
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.000]   You're kind of dependent on framework to make
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.080]   motherboards and batteries, you know,
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:49.040]   some of the custom components.
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:51.240]   But I like the idea and it makes me think
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:52.720]   you could do the same thing with a phone.
[00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.880]   I hope somebody will make a repairable phone.
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:57.480]   - There was a push there, I don't know,
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:58.480]   most of them didn't go anywhere,
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.440]   but there was a push there for all the modular devices
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:03.040]   where you could repair, pull out a part and replace a part
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:05.240]   and make it so you could be more sustainable.
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:06.840]   But every time I see one of those announced,
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:08.680]   it seems to just disappear completely.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:09.520]   - What was it, the Google?
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.360]   - Yeah, that's true.
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:12.760]   - You wanna roll a try to do that, right?
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:13.600]   - Yeah.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:14.600]   - And Google R, right?
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:16.080]   - Yeah, there was a couple
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:17.520]   and they never seemed to really go anywhere
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:18.600]   and I wish they would.
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:20.480]   And I actually, you know, I have a Google phone
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:24.120]   and I was perfectly, I used to join the $1000 upgrade
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:26.040]   cycle in last year because of the chip shortage.
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:27.880]   I bought this, you know, one of the first pixels
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.920]   that they had with 5G and I've been like perfectly
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:31.600]   satisfied with every aspect of it.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:36.360]   - I sat out last year, I still have the X4 XL.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:39.360]   - I'm curious, do you think people outside of, you know,
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:42.800]   like the tech industry and tech journalism upgrade every year?
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:43.640]   - I know where you're going.
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.320]   - No, they absolutely don't.
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:46.160]   - No.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.560]   - I think once phones became like, once the price
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:52.360]   for like the new iPhone or whatever jumped up to $1000,
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:53.960]   I think that's when people were like,
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:55.200]   I'm not gonna do that.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.040]   Not every year.
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:59.200]   - I got a call from a woman today on the radio show
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:01.280]   'cause the radio show's where I talked to normals.
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:04.000]   And I got a call from the one on the radio show
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.240]   who said, my husband and I have Pixel's iPhone 6s
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:11.000]   and we just found out that iOS is on iOS 14
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.720]   and we, you know, we're on 12.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:16.840]   So we're gonna get a new one is the 10R any good.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:20.000]   And I said, yeah, it's great.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.280]   It's three years old now, but it's, yeah,
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:24.320]   it was very nice in 2019.
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:26.600]   I highly recommend it.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.240]   - Well, it's funny 'cause like the iPhone 11
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:31.160]   is still so popular and I think that's part of why
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:35.080]   the 12 mini also didn't do well because theoretically,
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:37.480]   if people are shopping for like whatever
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:39.280]   the less expensive iPhones are,
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:42.000]   you could get a really good phone in the iPhone 11
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.080]   that does almost everything the 12 can do,
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:47.600]   but you know, certainly enough for the everyday average person.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:48.960]   - And I think for a lot of people,
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.760]   it's very smart to wait for the A pixels,
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:55.920]   not the Pixel 5 but the 5A or the 4A
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:59.000]   or because those are pretty much just as good
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.240]   for a lot less money.
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.000]   - Oh yeah.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.440]   And also like the, their flagship phones in recent years,
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:08.400]   I feel like just haven't been doing very well,
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.040]   like, you know, reception wise,
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.960]   like I feel like a lot of their reviewers were like,
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:14.320]   hey, this is a good phone, but it's just too expensive
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:16.000]   and doesn't have everything.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.400]   It should have for a flagship phone or it has too much
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:21.480]   like with the Pixel 4, I think is the one
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:24.480]   that had the gesture recognition that I don't,
[00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:25.880]   I don't think people really used.
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:27.720]   And yeah, the solely sensor exactly.
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:30.160]   And then they kind of got rid of that with the next model.
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.360]   - Yeah.
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:33.240]   Well, well, look, phone companies have,
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:36.600]   I mean, phone manufacturers have to come up with something
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.040]   to get you to buy.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:41.400]   And look what Microsoft has done with Windows.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:44.600]   They completely made up a new version of Windows
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.840]   that's basically rounded corners in a centered,
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:49.480]   centered start menu and said, it's new, it's Windows 11.
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:52.280]   - Just to get people to buy. - You've got HDR
[00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.680]   for games, so you've got HDR games.
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:55.960]   - Okay, okay.
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:56.880]   Really is that gonna make a bit,
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.320]   and you have to have a card that supports it.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:00.240]   Is this FSR, what is HDR?
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.640]   - Auto HDR, so basically-
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:03.480]   - It's the auto HDR.
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:05.600]   - Okay. - Old games look good.
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.120]   No, I'm right there with you.
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:09.920]   I just think, I, maybe this is-
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.520]   - I think will you be able to get auto HDR on 10
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:14.840]   or you'll have to get 11 to get that.
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:15.840]   - I think it's- - I think they offered it
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:18.800]   on 10, a Reg, is a DirectX capability.
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.440]   - They had some features for it as I-
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:22.880]   - Oh, okay. - But it will be universal.
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.400]   - Especially if they just want people
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.880]   to buy a new computer and they know they won't,
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:28.840]   just like they won't buy a new phone,
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:30.440]   unless they give them a reason.
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:33.520]   - I just, I think slowing it,
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:35.440]   like I personally am pessimistic.
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:38.360]   I think the chip shortage is gonna affect the auto industry
[00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:40.040]   for a long time personally,
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:42.880]   and I think it's gonna affect the tech
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.240]   and the wider tech industry for a while.
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:50.240]   And I don't know, I just think like us taking a breath
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:53.360]   and thinking how many years we can get out of a Mac,
[00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:56.600]   or if we can like start designing things
[00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:57.800]   that are more upgradable.
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:59.400]   I just think at a certain point,
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:02.400]   we're gonna have to have an adult conversation about that.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:06.440]   - Or just go down in flames.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.480]   - Yeah, if you have one or the other.
[00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:09.480]   One or the other.
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:10.600]   - You have your choice.
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:12.120]   There's a choice.
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:13.080]   All right, let's take a little break.
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:18.080]   This podcast today supported by AT&T,
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:19.880]   if there are friends and family members
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.000]   you haven't talked to in a while,
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.160]   or it's never too late to reconnect
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:27.480]   to help AT&T as offering deals on the latest smartphones.
[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:28.840]   Wonder what those could be.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.120]   It's not complicated.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.400]   Everyone deserves something new,
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:35.560]   so AT&T is giving new and existing customers their best deals
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:38.760]   on every smartphone, even the latest ones.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.880]   Restrictions and exceptions may apply.

[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:47.240]   Thank you AT&T for supporting this week in tech.
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:52.520]   There was something you brought up I wanted to follow up on.
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.360]   I have the mind of a sieve.
[00:52:55.360 --> 00:53:03.400]   Golly, we can talk about proton mail.
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:04.640]   That's an interesting story,
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:08.960]   because I was always a little hesitant with proton mail.
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:12.600]   Carl, you have a story on motherboard
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:16.960]   because proton mail shared the IP address,
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:20.320]   location information with French authorities
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:22.040]   of a climate activist.
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:26.040]   Even though they advertised for a long time,
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.320]   we don't log your IP address.
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:29.480]   How did that happen?
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:32.440]   Were they actually logging IP addresses?
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:34.720]   Well, from what I remember they weren't at the time,
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:37.400]   but they still, well, being in Switzerland
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:39.880]   allows them some protection from certain requests.
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:42.600]   They still have to adhere to Swiss law.
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:45.240]   And of course, the French authorities just went through
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:48.160]   a Europol who then communicated with the Swiss court
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:50.320]   and said, "You pretty much have to do this."
[00:53:50.320 --> 00:53:53.280]   And I mean, they had no choice.
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:54.560]   They really didn't have much leeway.
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:56.400]   The problem is you noted is that the marketing
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.080]   for these services always kind of frames these services
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:03.600]   if there's some kind of super heroic privacy miracle cure.
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:06.280]   We're in Switzerland, which means people really
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:08.560]   would never get to see your email and it's just not true.
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:10.400]   Except it's not true.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.400]   And I've always said email was never designed
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:13.960]   to be private or secure.
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:15.320]   It's not, that's not.
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:18.200]   And it's almost impossible to make it so unless you
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:21.200]   encrypt the data and you arrange ahead of time
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:24.680]   to get the other guy's public key so that he can,
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:26.200]   you know, and all of that.
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:28.920]   Yeah, like pro-town mail provides good secure service.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:30.920]   The problem is that email just is inherently
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:32.560]   not the most secure thing in the world.
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:36.040]   If you're sending from pro-town mail to another email service,
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:37.560]   it's not always going to be secure.
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:39.960]   So if you're an activist who really is very concerned
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:41.960]   about hiding your identity,
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:43.680]   really don't talk to people on email.
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.800]   It's an encrypted messaging service.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:47.480]   You know, that's basically the lesson of the equipment.
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:48.720]   You signal, yeah.
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:52.520]   And it really underscores how valuable metadata is
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:55.760]   because there's no evidence in this that they
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:57.520]   handed over the contents of messages.
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:00.280]   In fact, they asserted, no, no, your message is still private.
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:01.520]   Still, they got the guy, right?
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:04.840]   They arrested him based on IP address information
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:07.240]   and device details, both of which they had
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:08.880]   because they log that stuff.
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:11.320]   And their transparency reports had previously been saying,
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:13.000]   you know, that happens sometimes,
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.600]   but only in the most extreme cases
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:16.200]   and we're in Switzerland again, remember,
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:18.000]   so everything's pretty safe, you know?
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.520]   But then, to see this happen and then how quickly
[00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:24.120]   they had to change all of their website information
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.080]   and kind of water down their promises.
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:28.440]   You see that a lot too in VPN services.
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:31.200]   You know, VPN services are often treated like
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:33.840]   just there inherently some kind of magic security bullet.
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:35.480]   And I think people who don't know any better
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:37.280]   get one thinking that they're impervious
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:38.960]   to any kind of outside surveillance.
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.800]   And that's just not the case.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:44.280]   - You don't know what they're collecting.
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:46.640]   You don't know if the company's reputable, you know?
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:50.120]   - If you're a target, it would behoove you
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:53.880]   not to listen to marketing promises from anybody,
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:55.680]   including Apple, by the way.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.760]   'Cause we now know with the NSO groups,
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:02.400]   Pegasus, that Apple, people aren't somehow magically protected.
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:04.680]   Brianna, do you have any OPSEC advice?
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:09.000]   Do you pursue any OPSEC protocols?
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.440]   - Well, I do.
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:12.800]   I wanna say when I was running for Congress,
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:16.280]   we looked at the email protocol quite a bit.
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:20.000]   I would encourage people to go look at the Wikipedia page
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.800]   for how email is sent.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:25.280]   I mean, it really is a system from the 80s,
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:26.960]   built on top of another system,
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:28.880]   built on top of another system,
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:31.560]   pray to God our server-side encryption,
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:33.640]   holds and send it out there.
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:37.320]   I mean, it's a product, if you were designing it today,
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.120]   it would look very different.
[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:42.040]   I do think overall though,
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:45.000]   I feel like we're kind of giving proton mail a pass,
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:49.840]   and I'm not, I feel at the bare minimum,
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:54.680]   their messaging on this to the public has been a disaster.
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:57.600]   And a more cynical view is that they're not really gonna
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:59.240]   have their users' backs.
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:04.240]   So I can tell you this really obviated any instinct
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:06.720]   I might have to use their service.
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:10.440]   We, Steve Gibson always mocked proton mail
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:13.720]   because on their webpage, they've changed it a little bit,
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:17.760]   but they would show the matter horn and say,
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:22.400]   our data is securely stored inside a Swiss mountain.
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.480]   So you know you're safe.
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:28.120]   And I think we all realized that that has become
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:31.840]   kind of a meaningless claim.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:36.000]   Yeah, email is just not inherently secure, period.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:36.840]   Are you great?
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:37.680]   Are you great?
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:40.680]   And anybody who says it is probably selling you something.
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:43.200]   And the problem is PGP,
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:46.360]   which is one way to kind of sort of send secure email
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:47.680]   is a pain in the air.
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:49.000]   I use it, but it's a pain in the air.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:49.840]   Somebody wants to use it.
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:51.280]   Nobody knows how to use it.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:53.480]   I've had a PGP, I published my PGP key
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:55.800]   and I've been doing so for 20 years.
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:59.280]   I have yet to receive anything except people saying,
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.440]   testing my PGP key, can you read this?
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:03.000]   (laughing)
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.280]   The only thing I ever get, and by the way,
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:06.440]   you're welcome to send me those,
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:10.240]   but I guess if we ever had to, we could.
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.760]   But then the metadata is still problematic.
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:15.640]   Yeah, I think like the big takeaway,
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:17.120]   I mean, this isn't really a takeaway
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:19.000]   because it's been very obvious for a long time,
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.280]   but it's just another reminder that
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:24.160]   there really is no such thing as true privacy,
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:26.880]   at least not, you know, certainly not with email,
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:30.040]   but I feel like you could say that about
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:32.800]   almost anything that you're doing online
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:34.560]   or through your phone or whatever.
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:36.760]   It's just impossible.
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:39.480]   I mean, I use, you know,
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:41.680]   when people ask for private communications,
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:43.880]   I'll give them my signal.
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:44.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:46.040]   I'll give that out.
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:48.640]   And I'm sure, you know, I think that
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:51.120]   was Open Whisper Foundation, they're good
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:54.200]   and I know Moxie Marlon spiked us everything he can
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:57.560]   to make it secure, but if you put it on the internet,
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:00.000]   Steve Gibson, our security guy always says,
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.400]   "Really, you're only safe.
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:05.040]   If you go out half naked in the middle of a field,
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:07.720]   cover yourself with a blanket and talk one on one."
[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:09.760]   That's the only time.
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:12.280]   I mean, that I think, even that's probably not it.
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:14.720]   You probably should sweep the field for bugs before you do.
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:17.920]   But just because something isn't perfect
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:19.600]   doesn't mean it's not worthwhile.
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:22.480]   And I do think there's a conversation you'd be had.
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:25.160]   Like, look, let's just level with people.
[00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:26.960]   Email, generally speaking,
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:30.000]   is where the adults are having conversations, right?
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.720]   Like, that is the workhorse.
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:33.840]   It's always been the workhorse.
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:37.520]   And I don't think it's crazy for us to want a better standard.
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:42.680]   Something I find really disturbing is iCloud and Gmail
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:45.440]   or two very, very popular email systems,
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:48.320]   but they're built on these proprietary backends.
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:51.280]   And they may have an IMAP service or POP service,
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:54.000]   but, you know, ultimately, they're doing things
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.560]   their way on their own end.
[00:59:55.560 --> 01:00:00.080]   I think it's long past time for industry to come together
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:03.000]   and rethink email from the very beginning
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.600]   and come up with something at the very least
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:10.160]   that is, even if you're hiding the PGP key from people,
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:12.800]   like have pair key encryption on it, right?
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:16.160]   Like, let's come up with something truly secure
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.160]   that even the metadata gets leaked.
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:21.440]   Like the message itself can't be leaked.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.960]   I just, I think this is a really strong priority
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:24.800]   for our industry.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:27.960]   You can have the ideal, like, oh, you signal.
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:28.600]   I'm sorry.
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:31.000]   Sometimes I have to send my lawyer something
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.360]   and I would like a more secure way to do that.
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:37.440]   Actually, I mean, if you're going to talk that way,
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.360]   (laughs)
[01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:41.440]   I've been reading more and more articles
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.760]   about people saying, you know,
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:46.920]   the entire industry's computing infrastructure
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:51.840]   is based on C and C++ written years ago
[01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:54.360]   by people who are no longer around,
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.040]   no longer maintaining it.
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:58.480]   No one really understands how it works.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.280]   As long as we're reinventing email,
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:02.240]   we probably should just reinvent the whole damn thing.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.360]   Rewrite it all.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.640]   Yeah, and it's all running on telecom infrastructure
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.680]   that also has all kinds of stable vulnerability.
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:09.240]   Yeah, that's all on SS7,
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:12.160]   which hasn't been fixed in generations.
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.320]   Or satellite broadband systems have all kinds
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.520]   of inherently terrible security vulnerabilities.
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.560]   And, you know, the GAO will issue a reporter,
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.840]   somebody saying that these networks need to be secured
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.320]   and we'll just ignore them repeatedly.
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:26.000]   I was stunned and I learned this lesson many years ago
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.280]   when Wozniak, Steve Wozniak told me,
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:31.240]   one of his hobbies was to listen in on satellite
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:32.960]   phone conversations.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.640]   (laughs)
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:37.200]   He said, "Oh, no, no, it's not secure."
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.760]   So, you know, I mean, he just would like a good evening
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.600]   and turn on the radio and just listen
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.760]   to what people are talking about.
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:46.280]   And, you know, I think part of the problem too
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:48.920]   goes back to what you were saying, Leo, about things,
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:51.520]   you know, services that are more secure,
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.160]   not being as convenient.
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:56.640]   And, you know, not to say that there shouldn't be options
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.160]   for people who need extra privacy,
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.640]   like Breanne is absolutely right,
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:03.600]   like as users of these services, we deserve to have that.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.960]   And we should be expecting more.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:09.200]   But, you know, what concerns me is that I wonder, you know,
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:12.800]   I feel like consumers, at least the mass market, you know,
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.760]   the general public tends to go for the easiest
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:18.240]   and most convenient option most of the time.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.280]   And usually that option is also the one
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.080]   that's the least secure and where you're giving up
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:25.920]   a lot more of your, you know, personal privacy
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:26.920]   and information.
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:29.360]   I mean, you know, it's probably the same reason
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.160]   why a lot of people would use, you know,
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:34.200]   something like Google Chrome over DuckDuckGo.
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.200]   It's just convenient.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.720]   Everything's there if you are like a Google user.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:40.800]   So, you know, I'm wondering, I hope that companies
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.800]   are still incentivized to build products
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:47.480]   that have that extra, you know, in-depth layer of security.
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:49.360]   Like what, you know, we would hope to get out
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:51.800]   of something like Proton mail, you know,
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:55.080]   even if it's unsure how big the market for something like that
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.400]   might eventually be.
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.520]   - Yeah.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:07.640]   I think probably 99% of users don't care about anything
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.720]   we've talked about for the last hour.
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:13.040]   Just give me my phone.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:16.280]   Let me press the phone. - Which is why, yeah.
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:18.400]   - Which is why you need to bake this stuff inherently
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:21.400]   into the systems of the building, just from the ground up.
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:22.760]   - Yeah, for sure.
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.840]   - 'Cause we've entered this phase where privacy
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:26.840]   is sometimes framed as a luxury option.
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:28.520]   You know, I know telecoms kind of do that.
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.120]   You know, if you pay $5 more a month
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.800]   to get a little bit more security or privacy.
[01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.200]   And I don't like that whole shift, you know,
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:37.320]   just build it in from the base up and work from there.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:39.920]   Because yeah, consumers just, I mean,
[01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.360]   especially during a pandemic who has time.
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:45.720]   - Isn't there something in like Apple's new iCloud tier
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:48.360]   or whatever that I'm like hazy on the details
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:50.040]   but it was something that they announced just,
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:54.400]   I think at WWDC where you can pay to have
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.040]   some kind of extra security feature.
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:03:57.880]   - Oh yeah, if you have an app.
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.080]   - I'm doing a horrible job at explaining this.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:00.240]   - I will back you up.
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:04.600]   If you buy Apple One, which is there all in one package,
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:07.200]   I think 30 bucks some bucks where you get everything.
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.960]   One of the things you get is essentially
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:12.800]   a relay service on iCloud.
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:15.080]   It's basically a VPN.
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:18.160]   And sort of like a VPN.
[01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.720]   - I think it's called iCloud Relay.
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:22.520]   And I don't know if this is gonna come out this week
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:26.760]   with the iOS 15, but iCloud private relay,
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:29.200]   but you have to have an iCloud plus account.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:30.440]   - Yes, that's what I was thinking about.
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.520]   - Yeah, I think a lot of people who pay for iCloud,
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:34.760]   I get it with Apple One,
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:36.080]   but I think a lot of people pay for iCloud.
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.160]   I think everybody will get it automatically.
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:41.680]   Yeah, not exactly a VPN.
[01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:46.160]   It's a relay, it's kind of more like a tour kind of.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:48.480]   Because it hides your IP address
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.920]   because it's routed through.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:50.760]   It's really the case.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.440]   Unless Apple or Google does it,
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:56.080]   you know, no very few individuals,
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.440]   except people are highly motivated.
[01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.960]   Like, you know, if you're running for Congress, Brianna,
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:03.040]   most people, you were using the Google Titan keys
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:04.040]   and all of that, right?
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.040]   - Right, I still do.
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:05.880]   I still do.
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:07.240]   They're on the shelf right behind me.
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:09.680]   I just, I think, I feel so strongly
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:14.040]   that like we don't ask Americans to keep themselves safe
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:16.440]   the same way we do with tech.
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:17.280]   Like, okay. - Oh, come on.
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.840]   We can't even get them to wear masks.
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.480]   What are you talking about?
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:23.360]   - I mean, Americans don't want to be safe.
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:25.840]   - Look at like kids pajamas.
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.640]   Look at children's pajamas, right?
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.080]   They're all fireproof, period.
[01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:34.000]   We don't ask parents to go understand the materials
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.040]   and what the fire stuff is
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:38.160]   for every single set of children's clothes.
[01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:39.720]   We just mandated.
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:41.400]   And I think it's so unfortunate
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:45.640]   that this kind of government desire, inherent desire
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:47.200]   of all governments, not just ours,
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.880]   to kind of keep tabs on the people and prosecute crimes
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:54.360]   is very much at odds with keeping us safe from hackers
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:55.800]   and scams and things like that.
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:57.360]   It's just, it's so frustrating
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:01.080]   'cause we don't have any apparatus doing the bare minimum.
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:02.800]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:05.880]   We don't even have a privacy law for the internet era.
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:06.720]   You know, we--
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:07.560]   - Oh, it's crazy.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.120]   - We don't, we don't care.
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:11.080]   I mean, it hasn't been a priority.
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:13.200]   I see government report after government report
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.560]   showing how these things aren't secure.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:15.920]   And only in the last two years
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:18.200]   if people started to take a lot of it seriously.
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.560]   So yeah, I agree 100% in that.
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:21.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:26.720]   - So whose responsibility is it government's responsibility
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:30.680]   to mandate, as we do with pajamas, safe computing?
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:33.400]   - You know, at this point, I don't know.
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:35.520]   Congress gets obsessed with one privacy issue
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:37.520]   for about six months and then forgets about it
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.960]   three months later, you know?
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:40.960]   So I don't know what the answer is to that.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:42.480]   And mandating, you know, what's happening now
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:45.080]   is the federal apathy on privacy and security
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.520]   has created state by state laws like California
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.880]   coming in and passing its own internet privacy law.
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:51.920]   But that comes with its own issues, you know?
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:54.440]   And it doesn't help somebody in Tennessee
[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.440]   or it doesn't help somebody in any number of states
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:58.440]   that aren't gonna follow California's league.
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.200]   So we need more federal leadership.
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:02.720]   We need somebody, you know, we need, we need, you know,
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:05.160]   hungry or more tech savvy lawmakers.
[01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:06.960]   And that comes down really to the,
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.760]   that comes down to the voter to vote them in
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:10.360]   and stop voting in people who have
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.760]   absolutely no idea what that is.
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.240]   - And people like Breanna to run.
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.160]   - I agree with that.
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:15.960]   - Yes, definitely agree with that.
[01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:20.480]   - I'll get to run again just to the event.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:23.360]   - So you didn't even get to, you got to the primary,
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:27.040]   but you were running against a strong incumbent
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:27.880]   in the same party.
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:30.680]   - Well, here in my district, whoever wins the primary
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:31.760]   wins the general.
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:32.760]   - It's a very democratic district.
[01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:35.440]   - Because the other party just isn't here.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:38.320]   But yeah, I feel very strongly about that.
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:39.160]   So.
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:40.960]   - It's not gonna be a battle, but this is the problem
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:45.080]   is that people love their personal congress member.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:49.120]   It's very hard to get an incumbent at office.
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:52.120]   And even if they're horrible to the rest of the country,
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:55.760]   people still elect him 'cause they love him.
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:56.600]   That's my guy.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:08:00.320]   He's getting the, he got the plant built down the road.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:01.960]   - Yep, exactly right.
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:03.000]   - Oh my goodness.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.400]   (laughing)
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:06.680]   - You know what?
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:11.240]   You can't be a perfectionist.
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:14.040]   Certainly not in politics, but I think just in general
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:18.760]   in life, you can't say, well, it should be so much better.
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:20.200]   'Cause it's messy.
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:21.440]   This stuff is all messy.
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:23.520]   We just do the best we can, right?
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.640]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:25.680]   - It's nice. - It's nice.
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:28.320]   Children's pajamas don't burst into flames anymore.
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:29.800]   That's good. (laughing)
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:31.520]   People drive around with seat belts.
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.360]   That's good.
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:34.040]   We save a lot of lives that way.
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.600]   Can't get people to wear masks, but,
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.960]   you know, we'll work it on it.
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:42.600]   - There were some news this week about vaccine mandates.
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:43.960]   I was very excited about it.
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:48.960]   - But, you know, you saw the strong pushback.
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.960]   I wonder what's gonna happen.
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.680]   I mean, there are gonna be now
[01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:55.320]   interminable court cases over this.
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:56.480]   - Yeah.
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:59.520]   - I think it's, look, I'm in favor of it.
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:02.440]   I think it's showing leadership from the White House,
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:07.440]   but I wonder in the long run, if it's gonna happen.
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:09.400]   It's such a strong pushback.
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:11.960]   - What to say with SCOTUS, but my point is,
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:15.480]   I think federal leadership is what solves problems like this.
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:17.240]   And I think the individual approach
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:18.320]   just isn't gonna work.
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.160]   - Not local.
[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:20.000]   You got it because--
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.840]   - For stuff that is nationwide,
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:26.240]   no, even California's privacy law doesn't,
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:27.600]   I mean, doesn't it have an impact though?
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.400]   I mean, doesn't it help?
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:31.960]   - You know, so I think they get too ambitious
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:32.920]   with some of these laws.
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:35.360]   They're so convoluted and there's so many loopholes
[01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:38.360]   and strange caveats that I think they're not helpful.
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:40.560]   I think it would be great if federal lawmakers
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:44.400]   could just pass a basic, clean, simple privacy law.
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:46.440]   Start simple, like you suggest.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:48.240]   A law that basically says,
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:50.200]   you have to be transparent about what you're collecting
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:53.040]   and selling and give the consumer the ability to opt out.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.640]   Tell them to be honest with people,
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:57.160]   give them the ability to opt out.
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:59.480]   - Maybe incrementalism is a good idea.
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:02.320]   - Yeah, because we're not doing anything else.
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:04.720]   I mean, it's ridiculous you have all these ad tech
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:07.040]   middlemen brokers and telecoms and app makers
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:10.000]   and everybody's just hoovering up every shred of data they can
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.280]   and failing to secure it at like T-Mobile's
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:13.280]   a reputable company.
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.120]   - I can't--
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:15.120]   - It's a good stuff.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:17.440]   - I had to five times in the last--
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:19.680]   - I had to go to, and it turns out I didn't know,
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:21.920]   there are now five credit reporting agencies.
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:24.120]   I had to go to all, I'm a T-Mobile customer.
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:27.280]   I had to go to all five of them to freeze my credit account.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:30.680]   - What I love about those is every time
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:33.400]   that one of those hacks happens is you get free credit reporting
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:35.400]   as if you hadn't gotten free credit reporting
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:36.600]   when Equifax was hacked.
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.080]   - Oh, wasn't that nice of you?
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:39.240]   - Yeah.
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:41.880]   Like I've got 17 instances of free credit reporting
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:43.240]   and it's not really helping me.
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.760]   I mean, the onus has to be on the company
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:46.560]   to do a better job securing their stuff.
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.560]   - So just since I mentioned it and I know people
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:53.560]   are gonna ask me, besides Equifax, Experian and TransUnion,
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:59.880]   there's also Inovis, I-N-O-V-I-S, I never heard of them.
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:01.640]   And I think checks, what is it,
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:05.960]   I think it's checks, CHEX, something like that.
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:08.600]   There are now at least five credit reporting agencies
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:10.720]   and these other ones go under the radar,
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.160]   but you have to, absolutely.
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.760]   And of course, that's where the bad guys are gonna go.
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:18.880]   - I will go for whatever credit reporting agency
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:21.640]   knows how to update their Apache server
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:22.800]   with the company that's hacked.
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.640]   So it doesn't look good out.
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:26.440]   - Well, you know, just make that the tackle.
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:28.840]   We will patch Apache.
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:31.480]   - By the way, because these companies hate credit freezes
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:33.680]   'cause they make money selling your information
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:35.760]   to credit card betters.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:39.520]   So as soon as I signed up with all five of them
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:41.800]   for credit freeze, I started getting immense amounts
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:42.880]   of email from them.
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:44.640]   'Cause in order to sign up, what do you have to do?
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.080]   Give them your email address.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:49.640]   So now I'm getting all sorts of solicitations from them
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:51.960]   'cause they're desperately trying to make up
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:53.720]   for the lost revenue.
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:56.720]   They basically see this as an opportunity to mind me.
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:02.400]   - Chex systems is the other one.
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:05.280]   And there's probably more than those five.
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:06.840]   Yeah.
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:09.960]   I figure though, maybe Carl, it's safe to say,
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:11.760]   everybody knows everything about everybody.
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:14.800]   Like, what am I doing protecting my social security number?
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:17.120]   I'm sure it's out there, right?
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:20.200]   - Well, I mean, yeah, at this point,
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:21.040]   there's been so many weeks.
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.480]   - At this point, the thing that's funny
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:26.040]   is they always promise that your data's anonymized.
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:27.720]   You know, a lot of their, a lot of companies.
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:28.560]   - Sure.
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:29.400]   - Oh, it's anonymized.
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:30.400]   Nothing bad can happen to you.
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:31.240]   - Right.
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.760]   - You know, you have so many, you have so many sections,
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.800]   so many leaks and so many hacks and so many data.
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:37.280]   - You just cross reference.
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:39.000]   - You just cross reference it.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.680]   - I've lost track of the amount of studies
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.440]   that have shown that like it takes two seconds
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.760]   to compare data from this group
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:45.800]   and data to the other.
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:46.640]   - Right.
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:47.480]   - It's, it's, it's.
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:50.560]   - By the way, ProtonMail did what everybody now does.
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:51.520]   Zoom did this.
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:53.600]   As soon as they were accused of security issues,
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.960]   while you get some big security people on your board,
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:13:00.080]   ProtonMail has added Sir Tim, Sir Tim Berners-Lee,
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:01.640]   the inventor of the World Wide Web,
[01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:02.800]   to its advisory board.
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.640]   Oh, well now it's okay.
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:05.480]   (laughing)
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:08.680]   Thanks, Sir Tim says, "Well, I am a firm supporter of privacy."
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:10.240]   Thank you, Sir Tim.
[01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:11.840]   And I hope the check clears.
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:14.720]   Okay.
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:18.560]   I'm no, I don't, I'm trying not to be a security nihilist,
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.000]   a privacy nihilist.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.560]   That's a term I think Bruce Schneier coined
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.400]   for people who just give it, they just throw up your hands.
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.840]   It's like, I give up, I give up.
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:29.520]   What are you gonna do?
[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:30.880]   It's pretty easy to do.
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:36.960]   Carl Bodie has, it's Bodie, right?
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:37.800]   - Yeah.
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:39.880]   - Not Tom Bodette.
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:41.720]   Carl Bodie wrote an article saying,
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:42.800]   "This is great news.
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:45.880]   "More communities are building their own broadband."
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.480]   Why?
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:48.720]   Because of COVID?
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:51.520]   How is that happening?
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:53.080]   - Well, you know, everybody,
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:55.520]   most people don't like their regional telecom giant,
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.160]   whether it's Comcast or whoever it is.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:01.560]   And most people only have the choice of the 83 million Americans.
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:02.560]   - It's about 83 million Americans.
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:03.400]   - Yeah.
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:06.200]   83 million Americans live under a broadband monopoly.
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:09.880]   Here in Seattle, which is Silicon Valley North,
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:12.100]   I have the choice of one provider,
[01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:13.720]   cost that terrible.
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:15.600]   It's awful.
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:18.200]   And this has been going on for 25 years literally.
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:20.400]   We've thrown billions and billions and billions of dollars
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:21.240]   at this problem.
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:23.560]   And it just, so I think a lot of these local towns
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.520]   and cities have just gotten incredibly frustrated.
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:28.760]   So there's about a thousand different communities
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:32.600]   that have in the last decade or two built their own broadband
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:34.480]   access that routinely winds up being cheaper,
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:35.960]   faster, more reliable.
[01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:39.280]   The money that the local spend on this service
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.880]   goes back into the community.
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.680]   The people who work for these providers
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.520]   tend to live in the communities they serve.
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:48.200]   So unlike a lot of these regional monopolies,
[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:49.560]   the money is staying there
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:52.080]   and they're more accountable to the local.
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:57.080]   - I'm surprised because I know that when Philadelphia tried this,
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:59.640]   that they were immediately sued
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:02.640]   and state legislatures across the country
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:03.960]   started passing bills,
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:07.000]   prohibiting municipal broadband.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.360]   This is despite those bills.
[01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:12.640]   - Yeah, there's 17 states that currently have passed laws
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:16.120]   restricting towns and cities from getting into the broadband
[01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:18.480]   business or building their own broadband networks
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:19.920]   or expanding those networks.
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:24.360]   But I think COVID really showcased when you saw toddlers
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:25.760]   like sitting on the sidewalk,
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:26.600]   - Oh, outside of the top. - Talk about it.
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:27.960]   - Talk about it all. - Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:29.560]   - Try and get online for class.
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.600]   You know, this has always been a problem,
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:33.000]   but COVID really accelerated, you know, the awareness
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.400]   so it really is driven action.
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.240]   - Good.
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.120]   - And so those 17 states forget it.
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:42.200]   - It depends, each state has a different variation.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:44.400]   Sometimes they'll be an outright ban
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:45.760]   on building your own local network
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:47.360]   and sometimes it'll be worded
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:49.640]   in a very convoluted way to make it as difficult
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:52.600]   as possible to raise funds or to expand
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.240]   or you can't mark it in this zone
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:55.720]   or you can only, if it's like,
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:56.920]   a lot of these networks are built
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.920]   on the back of the local power utility.
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:00.880]   And so what-- - Chan New Year's did that, right?
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:02.360]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:04.760]   One of the fastest and cheapest fiber providers
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.520]   in the nation. - They have gig at one.
[01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.200]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:11.080]   But what a lot will sometimes do is say you can't expand,
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:12.800]   you can't expand this network outside
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:14.960]   of the local utility footprint.
[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:16.680]   You know, some of the laws will say something like that.
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:18.800]   And there's no real reason for it outside of the fact
[01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:21.520]   that the regional telecom monopolies
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:23.840]   who literally ghost-right most of these laws
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:25.360]   just told the state representatives
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:26.720]   that they didn't want that to happen.
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:29.000]   And there's no, the stuff is super popular,
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.040]   it's bipartisan, there's no excuse for the failure
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:33.920]   that I've seen in all over the years.
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:36.160]   - And the ideological argument is that,
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:38.600]   well, you wouldn't want government
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:40.480]   to compete with private industry.
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:43.200]   - Yeah, but the counter argument is that,
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:45.200]   you know, a lot of these companies have had 20 years
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.120]   to wire these areas
[01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:47.720]   and they don't want to because the return
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:49.240]   on their investment is low.
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:51.640]   But at the same time, they don't want anybody else
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:53.120]   building their own broadband networks
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:55.040]   because they might want to go back there someday.
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:56.600]   - Yeah, we may someday, yeah.
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:58.400]   - It's a very, it's a very cake-and-eat-it-two
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:16:59.680]   kind of thing for these companies.
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:01.280]   - Oh, what a surprise.
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:02.120]   - Yeah.
[01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:03.960]   - I'm just thinking about when I ran for Congress,
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:06.320]   I got to know so much about local budgeting,
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:08.480]   like more than I ever would have thought.
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:11.120]   And I'd like here in Dettum,
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:14.520]   where a friend of the show, Paul Thoreau,
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:15.880]   used to live here too.
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:18.400]   We canceled our trail this year,
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.840]   like a just walking trail
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:22.720]   because COVID has destroyed our municipal budget.
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:26.480]   If you go over to poor areas of Massachusetts,
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:28.320]   like Brockton, I can promise you,
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.720]   the Brockton tax base is not, you know,
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:34.360]   gonna like go for a bunch of broadband development right now.
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:39.360]   So I kind of, I'm for you, I'm with you in principle.
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:42.480]   But I'm also thinking about the people that need it most
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:44.120]   and thinking about towns like Whitman,
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:45.120]   where they're like, hey,
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:48.160]   we're just gonna have our library open for three days a week
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:49.760]   'cause we have no money.
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:52.640]   You know, we're gonna have a four day a week police department.
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:55.800]   And, you know, I'm thinking about like,
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:18:00.000]   is it really a feasible thing all through the United States?
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.680]   Like COVID affects our local revenues for years.
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.440]   - Yeah, it's not like a silver bullet
[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:07.040]   where you could just do this in every nation.
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:09.320]   And there's also like multiple varieties
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:12.000]   of different types of ISPs that are built out of this model.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.160]   You know, some will be on the back
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.360]   of the local power utility.
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:15.960]   They won't use taxpayer money at all.
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:19.120]   Some will be a private, public partnership
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:20.920]   that, you know, just works with a local provider
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:23.800]   like Google Fiber or somebody to deploy to the area.
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:27.960]   So it's not all, it's not all just tax base driven models.
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:29.800]   I mean, there's a wide variety of models that can exist.
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:33.640]   - Here in this little town of Petaluma, about 60,000 people,
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.520]   there was a big initiative about five years ago
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:37.280]   to put in community wifi.
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:39.880]   Initially Comcast was gonna help,
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:41.280]   but then they bowed out.
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:43.840]   Then another provider was gonna help they bowed out
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:45.640]   that put some stuff up, but it didn't work.
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:46.480]   It's gone.
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:50.440]   And I think it's just a hard thing to do.
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:53.560]   And there isn't a lot of support from the incumbents,
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:54.920]   of course.
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:56.600]   So you really have to have a leader,
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:19:00.480]   a civic leader who's gonna really push it through.
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:02.320]   - Yeah, it's like any, you know, I mean,
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.000]   one of the things that telecom companies will do
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.880]   is they'll just say that these are automatic
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:08.080]   taxpayer boondoggles and you should never try it.
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:10.040]   But I mean, they're just like any other business plan
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:12.440]   and they require a good leader and a sound plan.
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:16.720]   And look at Chattanooga that built its own fiber network
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:19.040]   when Comcast refused to.
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:20.600]   They've been ranked consistently
[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:23.080]   one of the most affordable, fastest internet providers
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:23.920]   in the country.
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:25.400]   - Well, the other good reason to do it
[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:28.480]   is evidence shows everywhere that incumbents
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:29.720]   were challenged by fiber,
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:31.800]   whether it was Google Fiber or others,
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:35.800]   that prices went down, that speeds went up.
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:38.800]   And even in some communities where there's fiber
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:42.400]   up to this road, you could see the prices go up
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:44.080]   as soon as the fiber from the other companies
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:44.920]   is not available.
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:46.560]   It's like no competition, great.
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:48.360]   We're gonna raise the prices.
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:52.920]   - And the thing that's frustrating is like, you know,
[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:55.400]   the approach to ban these entirely,
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:58.320]   we've spent literally about 25 years with the US.
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:59.640]   Ever since we broke up Ma Bell,
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:01.920]   the US telecom policy has basically been to do
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:05.560]   whatever the dominant regional monopolies want.
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:07.640]   I mean, with some exceptions occasionally,
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:09.600]   you know, like net neutrality was an effort to say,
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:12.000]   okay, maybe we should apply some very basic rules
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.240]   to these companies.
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:15.080]   And anytime anybody tries to do that,
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:17.040]   the companies get Congress to freak out.
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:18.240]   You know, trying something different
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:20.200]   will destroy the internet, you know.
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:21.400]   You know, that's basically their line.
[01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:24.200]   - But good news is we live in this great country,
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:27.720]   we have the best internet in the world, right?
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:28.560]   - Incorrect.
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.320]   (laughing)
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:31.240]   - Afraid.
[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:33.560]   I'm afraid we rank pretty much mediocre
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:35.680]   on every metric that matters whether you're looking at--
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:37.760]   - The country that invented the internet,
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:42.120]   14th place globally in speed.
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:44.320]   - Yeah.
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:46.720]   We're both 14th in fixed line broadband
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:47.880]   and 14th in wireless.
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:48.720]   And I think the--
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:50.280]   - At least we're consistently.
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:53.480]   - We actually got a little worse in fixed line broadband
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:54.840]   despite a lot of fiber.
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:21:00.880]   - Wow, we're slower than Canada, Italy, Saudi Arabia.
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:03.480]   The argument I hear when I mention this is,
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:07.520]   well, those countries have federally supported
[01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:11.880]   or federally owned, government owned internet companies
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:13.080]   or telecom companies.
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:14.720]   Is that always the case?
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:17.080]   - No, I don't think Canada has too many of those.
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:17.920]   I mean, well--
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:19.400]   - No, Canada's got the worst tele,
[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:22.680]   it's funny 'cause Canada's got the worst telecom companies.
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:23.960]   - Yeah, they're very similar.
[01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:25.440]   - They're all more. - They're very similar to us.
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:27.320]   The regional monopolies that have been allowed
[01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:30.200]   to write laws for literally 20 years
[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:32.520]   and then people stand around with the silly look
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:34.400]   in their face wondering why things are spotty
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.640]   and expensive and slow.
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:38.560]   - Okay, I really support just anything.
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:41.440]   It seems logical to allow these little niche solutions
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:43.360]   to thrive so that we can have any kind of--
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.600]   - Competition. - Creative solution.
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:46.320]   - Yes, 100% of common sense.
[01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:49.800]   - And hey, at least we may only be 14th in terms of speed
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:52.600]   but we are the least expensive, right, Carl?
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:54.120]   - No, very much so.
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:56.320]   One of the most expensive countries
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.720]   for both wireless and wired.
[01:21:57.720 --> 01:22:00.400]   - You're telling me we pay more and get less?
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:03.440]   - Yeah, and then there's that customer service
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:05.160]   which is-- - Oh God, I love them.
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:06.160]   (laughs)
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:07.760]   - I think I saw a survey once,
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:09.080]   people would rather have a heart attack
[01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:11.000]   than call Comcast customer service.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.600]   - These companies are literally, yeah, yeah.
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:15.320]   These companies are literally ranked worst
[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:16.920]   in customer satisfaction and service
[01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:18.640]   than pretty much any industry in America.
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:20.800]   And when you think about the fact that that includes--
[01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:22.720]   That includes banks, that includes insurance,
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:25.800]   that includes airlines, I mean, that's a feat
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:26.960]   and it's been pretty consistent.
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:28.640]   There's been some minor improvements
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:30.520]   from some of these companies in the last few years
[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:32.040]   but it's not great.
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:34.920]   - You could argue that maybe there's something flawed
[01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:38.520]   in our democracy 'cause actually it's not just broadband,
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:39.760]   it's also medical.
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:45.040]   - This is a lot of areas where we should be number one.
[01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:48.840]   - I look at education.
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:51.000]   - When I spent a lot of time covering these companies,
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.520]   I would look at the way the success they had writing bills
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:56.840]   and there's literally some of these companies
[01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:59.360]   effectively control state legislatures.
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.560]   They can get the bills passed.
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:03.200]   Any telecom laws that are passed are written by them,
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:04.560]   ghosts written by them.
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:06.880]   And that's, I've started learning that.
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.000]   And then you, yeah, like you said,
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.520]   you start looking around at healthcare and other industries
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:11.680]   and it's pretty much the same.
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:14.640]   - I just thank goodness we're really strong
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:16.280]   on women's reproductive right.
[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:18.240]   (laughing)
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:19.080]   Just for that.
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:21.720]   - Just-- - I can start drinking on this show.
[01:23:21.720 --> 01:23:22.720]   - No, no, no.
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:24.360]   We're gonna get up, we're gonna get up.
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:25.920]   Let's take a little break.
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:28.000]   - I really do think it's a positive change
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.160]   that these communities are taking--
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:30.000]   - No, I agree.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.080]   I've been a long time supporter of municipal broadband.
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:33.000]   I think it's brilliant.
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.520]   I think it's right.
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:35.560]   We really ought to do it.
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:37.880]   And every community ought to look at it.
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:39.840]   In fact, good friend of mine was an activist
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:43.240]   would go around helping cities set this up.
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:45.240]   I really think it's the right thing to do.
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:46.600]   And it helps everybody.
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:48.000]   It's good for the economy.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.640]   And frankly, it helps these incumbents
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:52.880]   because they're gonna do a better job
[01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:55.600]   because they're getting competition finally.
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:57.760]   They can't just rest on their laurels or whatever.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:58.600]   - Yeah, it makes them take some--
[01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:00.880]   - Like now that all of our jobs are on Zoom.
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:01.880]   I've taken more things.
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:02.720]   - We need it.
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:03.560]   Yeah, we need it.
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:05.520]   - In the last month, then my entire life--
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:08.600]   - Is Starlink gonna be the solution for this?
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:09.800]   Is it gonna--
[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:10.960]   - I think anything that applies
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:12.440]   a little pressure on these companies are good.
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:15.120]   The problem with Starlink is gonna be a capacity one.
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:18.000]   When you figure there's somewhere between 20 and 40 million
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.760]   Americans that have no access
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:23.880]   and another 83 million have a monopoly that live under a monopoly.
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:26.800]   And Starlink, I think, with their initial load of satellites
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:30.080]   is gonna reach about 500 to 800,000 customers.
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:33.600]   - They did just ask the FCC for approval
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:35.920]   for a total of 30,000 satellites.
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:37.400]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:40.680]   With a maximum capacity of 42,000 satellites,
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:43.760]   they should be able to reach about 6 million potential customers.
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:44.920]   - So it's still very limited.
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:46.920]   I didn't realize it was good at that limited.
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:50.000]   - I mean, come on, you've read the verge piece on this.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.280]   Like looking at Starlink, what the promises are
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:55.000]   and what the reality is.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.520]   It's not good.
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:58.000]   - Yes, it's terrible.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.520]   - Neelah Patel writes, "Broadband dreams fall to earth."
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:05.520]   - Oh, if you love reading meme reviews of products--
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:06.520]   - Neelah is great on this stuff.
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:08.400]   - And I do, please read this.
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:11.720]   It is so, it's a disaster.
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:15.640]   - Yeah, he actually ordered it and talks about his experience.
[01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:18.440]   I actually, because after reading this, I wanted to try it.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:23.160]   So I'm on the waiting list for $500 in satellite equipment
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.800]   and $100 a month in service.
[01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:27.320]   But I just want to, at some point,
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.600]   I want to be able to just put it on my back
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:32.040]   and travel and stuff, but I don't know.
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:34.760]   - I mean, if your only option is satellite broadband
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:36.120]   or not-- - This is better than anything.
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:37.120]   It's gonna be a big thing.
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:38.960]   - Better than it's seed, better than wild blue.
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:40.480]   But yeah, yeah, it's the best.
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:42.200]   - The problem is there's limited slots
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:44.440]   and I think Elon Musk fans are gonna gobble up
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:47.880]   a lot of those to put satellites on their cyber trucks
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:49.040]   and stuff, you know.
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:51.880]   (laughing)
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:54.680]   - That thing is as ridiculous as that sentence sounds,
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:57.840]   it's actually pretty believable and it's true.
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:59.400]   - I think it is.
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:01.400]   The other major-- - I feel attacked
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:03.000]   because that was my plan.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.240]   That was gonna be my sixth car.
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:06.600]   It was a cyber truck.
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:09.200]   - Oh. - With flags, it'd be nice.
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.160]   - What's going on with the cyber truck?
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:12.560]   I feel like I haven't heard anything about that.
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:14.000]   - I think they changed the design a little bit.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.880]   Like he backed down a little bit on the design.
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:18.200]   - I'm not sure. - I think they delayed again.
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:20.600]   Yeah, I remember reading another delay.
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:22.120]   The other problem with Starlink is that,
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:23.400]   you know, the affordability thing,
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:26.040]   like $100 a month plus a $500 charge
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:27.800]   is not exactly appealing to somebody
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:29.920]   who's struggling in rural Wisconsin, you know.
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:33.680]   Like they need service tiers at around $40 a month.
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:36.880]   So it's not really helping those people.
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:39.240]   I mean, if they can afford it maybe.
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:41.320]   And then there's the debate about the light pollution
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:43.760]   in the night sky, which is a whole other layer that--
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:44.840]   - Yeah. - There we go.
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:46.360]   - As Neil Eiffetel says,
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:48.600]   people so desperate for good internet that they say,
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:49.960]   F telescopes.
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:51.720]   (laughing)
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:53.680]   - It's from, yeah.
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:56.560]   - Yeah, they're delaying the Cybertruck to late 2022.
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:00.080]   He says, "It will be a glitch in the Matrix."
[01:27:00.080 --> 01:27:00.920]   - Oh, okay.
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:01.760]   (laughing)
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:03.560]   - No, I'm stunned.
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:06.880]   A company that didn't ship their Tesla Roadster on time,
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:11.160]   the Model 3 on time, and now the Cybertruck is delayed.
[01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:13.160]   I am stunned, Leo.
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:15.240]   - I just want my robot, you know,
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:17.800]   the baby robot that was actually a person
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:19.400]   in a suit dancing.
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:20.560]   - Oh, and I know.
[01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:22.000]   - God.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.640]   And nevertheless, I'm in a crazy line in a little bit.
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:25.480]   We're gonna take a break,
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:26.480]   but I'm gonna praise Elon a little bit
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:28.200]   because there is something going on this week
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:30.000]   that's pretty inspirational that Elon's up to.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.520]   But first, we'll take a break.
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:34.960]   Our show today brought to you by ITProTV.
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:36.760]   I know a lot of you, because you listen to the show,
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.440]   I know you're geeks.
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:40.680]   You might be in IT, a lot of you are,
[01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:43.520]   and a lot of you interested in a career in IT.
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:45.160]   A lot of jobs disappearing.
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:47.400]   One job is not going away.
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:50.040]   The person who knows how the network works.
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:51.960]   The person who knows how the server is run.
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:54.200]   The person who can keep it all secure.
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:56.960]   A career in IT is a great idea.
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:01.720]   And the best way to learn all those skills, ITProTV.
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:03.040]   Keep your certs up to date.
[01:28:03.040 --> 01:28:04.800]   Get those certs in the first place.
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:08.480]   They have seven studios running Monday through Friday all day,
[01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:12.760]   5,800 hours of on-demand IT training.
[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:15.280]   The perfect environment for you to learn IT.
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:18.720]   This month, it's Microsoft month at ITProTV.
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:20.000]   They've been doing theme months lately,
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.040]   which is great.
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:25.280]   More than 800 hours of Microsoft content,
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:28.960]   including next weekend, their free weekend,
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.760]   September 18th and 19th.
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:33.680]   They'll be courses in PowerShell, Azure training.
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:35.280]   Just a great way to take,
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:38.560]   just taste test of ITProTV.
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.000]   They're the Microsoft experts.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:40.960]   They can make you one too.
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:43.680]   They've got courses on MTA, Windows operating system.
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:47.680]   Fundamentals, that's 98-349 MTA.
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:51.160]   Security Fundamentals, 98-367.
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:55.400]   Microsoft Azure, AZ500, so many more.
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:57.360]   ITProTV is great because it's entertaining.
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:58.200]   It's fun.
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:00.840]   In fact, they call their instructors edutainers.
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:04.240]   Experts in the field, but also really expert at communicating
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:06.280]   and making IT interesting.
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:08.840]   And I love ITProTV because you can watch it anywhere.
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:11.800]   It's on your computer, stream it via the web.
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:13.840]   They have iOS and Android apps.
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:17.120]   You can get ITProTV on your Chromecast, on your Roku,
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:18.200]   on your Apple TV.
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:20.000]   So you watch anywhere, listen anywhere,
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.640]   and learn all the time.
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:23.520]   They divide the courses up into small chunks,
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:26.400]   20 and 30 minutes, easy to digest during your lunch break.
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:30.160]   Or binge, go on, just enjoy it.
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:32.320]   All the edutainers are staff members.
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:35.840]   So they're there, if you need assistance all day, every day.
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:38.000]   You'll be learning from your own home on your own schedule,
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.760]   but you will be learning.
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.440]   And if you're interested in a career in IT,
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:43.520]   there's no better way to do this.
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:46.280]   They've just, I'm really proud of these guys.
[01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:50.440]   Tim and Don have just taken off with ITProTV.
[01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:53.640]   It's really become the place to learn.
[01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:56.600]   If you want a career in IT or you have a career
[01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:59.200]   and you want to kind of up your skills,
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:01.240]   or if you have a team, an IT team
[01:30:01.240 --> 01:30:03.240]   and you want to keep them up skilled,
[01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:05.880]   there's nowhere better than ITProTV.

[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:40.520]   Thank you, ITProTV.
[01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:42.160]   I do want to give some credit to Elon
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:45.800]   because SpaceX is doing something this week that's pretty cool.
[01:30:45.800 --> 01:30:48.720]   The first all civilian mission to orbit,
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:53.720]   if it's scheduled to launch Inspiration4 this Wednesday.
[01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:55.040]   And what's cool about this,
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:58.200]   this is the Crew Dragon that Elon's used already
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:01.280]   to send astronauts to the space station.
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:02.880]   But what's cool about this one is kind of,
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:04.880]   it's for charity.
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:09.880]   The person who bought this for millions of dollars,
[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:14.480]   Jared Isaacman is a founder of a payment system
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:19.480]   has made lots of money so he can afford to buy this trip.
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:22.280]   He's also an avid pilot.
[01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:25.560]   In fact, at one point I was told he owns something
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:30.560]   like 40 fighter jets and has kind of like a fighter jet
[01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:34.800]   air show that he finances.
[01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:35.880]   He's kind of an amazing guy,
[01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:37.960]   6,000 hours in the air.
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:39.920]   He's an accomplished jet pilot.
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:43.160]   He's rated a fly military aircraft.
[01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:45.480]   But he's also a private citizen.
[01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:48.520]   So he'll be, Jared Isaacman will be going up.
[01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:52.240]   He bought the mission and then they invited others
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:57.240]   to go on with them including this medical assistant.
[01:31:57.240 --> 01:32:02.000]   She's, she won a contest, Haley Arsono.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:06.040]   When she was 10 years old, she found out she suffered
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:09.040]   from a rare form of cancer osteosarcoma.
[01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:14.720]   And she was treated at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital.
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:19.720]   She had a prosthetic femur put in and chemotherapy.
[01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:21.600]   She's fine, she's great.
[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:25.240]   She has her physician assistants degree
[01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:27.600]   and she works at St. Jude, which is cool.
[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:29.480]   She will be going up when they called her.
[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:31.960]   There's a documentary on Netflix which I have to watch
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:34.600]   because they show all of the passengers being called
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:36.920]   and told they get to go on, they won.
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:38.960]   And she said, are we going to the moon?
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:41.440]   No, just to orbit for three days.
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:45.520]   But still real orbit Chris Sembraski,
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:50.520]   who is a space advocate served in the Air Force,
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:55.600]   maintained the Minuteman Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles
[01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:58.920]   before leaving for active duty in Iraq.
[01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:05.640]   He is also, has a BS in Aeronautics.
[01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:07.040]   And so he'll be going up.
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:11.480]   When you look at the crew, I feel like he's the red shirt guy.
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:12.840]   Like, don't go on a...
[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:14.080]   (laughing)
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:15.240]   He would be the guy would say,
[01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:19.680]   no, I'm not going to go down on the planetary landing mission.
[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:21.120]   They won't be doing that, I don't believe.
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:24.720]   And then Dr. Sean Proctor, Sean is a geoscientist,
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:30.520]   wanted to be in astronaut, has followed this for a long time.
[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:32.960]   So she's going to go up, she's also black, which is great.
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:34.920]   And she's in her 50s, which is also great.
[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:38.760]   So this is a really interesting crew.
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:40.320]   Now that's inspiring, right?
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:42.400]   Now it's not like Elon's paying for it.
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:44.520]   They're raising money for St. Jude.
[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:48.640]   I'll be watching on Wednesday, this is exciting.
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:52.880]   Anything to say about that, right?
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:53.720]   - Yeah, I think that's true.
[01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:57.560]   I just wish we could do that and also repair our bridges.
[01:33:57.560 --> 01:33:58.480]   - Yeah, let's do that.
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:33:59.320]   Yeah.
[01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:01.440]   - I wish we could do things like this,
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:02.760]   which really is beautiful.
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:05.440]   And I wish we could also repair our infrastructure.
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:06.840]   - What's cool is-- - 100%.
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:09.720]   - These are both, Brianna, I know you're a fan of used cars.
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:11.600]   These are used rockets.
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:15.280]   Both the capsule and the booster have already been used.
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:17.480]   But this is one of the things SpaceX does so well
[01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:21.240]   is recover these refurbishment and send them out again.
[01:34:21.240 --> 01:34:23.160]   - Yeah, well I went down to NASA last time.
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:26.680]   They were showing us the path where the Challenger exploded
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:28.960]   and Tesla was going to buy it.
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:32.640]   So I mentioned they're using that for part of these missions.
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:33.480]   These days.
[01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:36.720]   - Yeah, it's pretty exciting stuff.
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:39.200]   I will be watching.
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:40.920]   I think it's fairly inspirational.
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:41.760]   I'll be watching with interest.
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.120]   - I'm 100%.
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:43.960]   - Yeah.
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:44.800]   - Yeah.
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:45.640]   - Whenever I go down to Florida,
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:47.960]   because my husband and I, we vacation down there
[01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:50.240]   'cause Boston is so cold over the winter,
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:51.920]   it's miserable here.
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:53.600]   So we escaped down to Florida,
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:57.560]   but I always love going like NASA's just every bit of that.
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:02.320]   Like you, I feel like today you look at our government
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:03.440]   and our systems, you're like,
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:05.400]   everything is so dysfunctional.
[01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:07.480]   And you're reading and you're there
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:09.920]   and you're living a moment where we came together
[01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:12.720]   and worked towards a really big goal
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:14.280]   in landing on the moon.
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:15.720]   And it's just so,
[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:19.800]   it gives you something to aim for, right?
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:24.680]   So I think space flight has a huge psychological value
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:26.880]   that we often discount.
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:28.440]   - Yeah, Brianna, I'm glad you brought that up
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:30.160]   because as you were saying that,
[01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:32.640]   I was literally just thinking about the moments
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:34.480]   in the past year when, you know,
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:36.280]   obviously this has been a really difficult
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:38.720]   like year and a half for many, many people around the world.
[01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:41.720]   And yeah, watching space flight on TV,
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:43.920]   watching the SpaceX mission recently,
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:47.280]   like was one of the few times where I feel like
[01:35:47.280 --> 01:35:48.960]   I was excited watching the news.
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:53.040]   And there was just a general like feeling of enthusiasm
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:56.160]   and the optimism, you know, around the news cycle that day.
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:59.000]   And that's something that I feel like you,
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.200]   you know, rarely get today,
[01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:01.920]   especially in the past year and a half though.
[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:04.000]   So I'm totally with you on that.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.760]   - And we can fix the bridge together.
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:06.600]   We could do that too.
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:07.440]   - Yeah, also that.
[01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:08.920]   - Yeah, we could do it all.
[01:36:08.920 --> 01:36:09.760]   Yeah.
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:16.440]   Don't bring your iPhone on a high powered motorcycle.
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:19.480]   - Oh man, there goes my plane.
[01:36:19.480 --> 01:36:20.560]   - Too late.
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:21.800]   - Too late.
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:22.640]   - Too late.
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:26.960]   - Turns out the vibrations can harm the iPhone cameras.
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:29.320]   Apple published a support document,
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:30.800]   warning iPhone users.
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:34.200]   The vibrations could shake loose
[01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:38.200]   the optical image stabilization gyroscope
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:41.160]   and, you know, bad things.
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:42.840]   So yeah.
[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:46.680]   - But it's hard when you're riding a bike to like use,
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:48.280]   do it through the gloves.
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:50.040]   'Cause if you're wearing proper armor,
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:52.560]   it's not gonna, like iPhone won't register.
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:55.240]   It's actually hard to find your way places
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:57.960]   because we all get around with Apple Maps.
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:36:59.600]   So if you're on bike, it's terrible.
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:01.640]   - You probably shouldn't bring it on rocket launches either.
[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:04.080]   I would imagine that's a similar problem.
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:04.880]   - Probably not.
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:06.200]   - Yeah.
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:09.240]   And apparently there are vibration dampening mounts
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:10.080]   that you can get.
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:14.680]   So maybe that's the key to protect your autofocus system.
[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:19.120]   Let's see.
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:20.040]   What else?
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:24.960]   I'm trying to do good stuff, happy stuff, positive stuff.
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:25.800]   - Amazon.
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:27.920]   - I'm talking about something I absolutely love.
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:29.160]   Can I plug something?
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:30.000]   - Plug something.
[01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.440]   - This is my favorite thing ever.
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:34.560]   So Leo, a new game came out.
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:38.240]   We have been waiting for a good aliens game
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:42.800]   for a long time and aliens fire team came out.
[01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:44.920]   I think it was about two weeks ago.
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:48.000]   I am so beyond addicted to this game.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:48.840]   It is.
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:50.840]   - Yeah, I've been enjoying this too.
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:51.680]   - Oh, wow.
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:53.160]   We should, we should friend each other and play.
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:54.000]   Are you on CS5?
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:54.840]   - My chance.
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:55.920]   - Yeah, I'm on PS5.
[01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:56.760]   I'll play with you.
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:59.440]   - Oh my God, we're gonna talk after the show.
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:02.760]   No, it's a co-op three-person game.
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:05.560]   So you have to work really, really, really closely
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:06.400]   with other players.
[01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:08.800]   The problem with online games is you're like shooting
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.640]   each other and killing each other.
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:14.880]   Here you have to really closely cooperate to survive
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:16.640]   and really know your roles.
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:21.000]   And it's 100% loyal to the guns and the atmosphere
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:21.840]   of the universe.
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:23.400]   It is such an adrenaline rush.
[01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:25.160]   I love this game.
[01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:27.080]   - And it's only $40, too.
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:27.920]   - Nice.
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:29.080]   - Yeah, nice.
[01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:33.200]   - Sam Meshkovich said, "Finally, co-op action worthy
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:35.240]   of the franchise.
[01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:38.600]   So can I play Ridley or who, what house is this for?
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:39.440]   - Nope.
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:42.240]   You create your own custom colonial marine
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:44.360]   and we'll have to play as him or her.
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:46.040]   - It's first person?
[01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:47.760]   - No, it's third person over the shoulder
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:48.800]   like Resident Evil.
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:52.120]   - Okay, but you can have two real life friends
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:52.960]   in there with you.
[01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:53.800]   - Yep.
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:54.640]   - Yeah.
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:55.480]   - And if you don't have friends,
[01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:58.240]   they replace you with the white Android.
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:38:59.560]   What do they call it?
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:01.040]   - Alpha and beta.
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:02.040]   - Yeah, alpha and beta.
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:05.080]   - Can you play co-op or is it just online only
[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:07.160]   or like local multiplayer?
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:09.360]   Is it just unfortunately not?
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:10.440]   I'd love to.
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:14.160]   - Lisa, my wife Lisa and your husband Frank
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:16.960]   have been saying, "We wanna just sit on the couch
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:18.880]   and play a game together."
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:20.200]   Those games are gone.
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:23.240]   Those traditional couch co-op games.
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:25.200]   The last one was Golden Eye or something.
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:27.160]   It's been a long time.
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:28.440]   - It's far too rare.
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:29.800]   - Yeah, I don't get it.
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:32.440]   - I guess those go cart Mario cart and stuff
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:33.280]   you can do that with.
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:35.280]   - Wasn't there one that came out a couple of years ago?
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:36.120]   I feel bad.
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:36.960]   I think I actually bought it
[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:39.920]   and then I just somehow never got around to playing it.
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:42.760]   I think a way out maybe, maybe what it's called,
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:46.040]   but that's like a couch multiplayer game.
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:47.800]   But I haven't gotten around to playing it,
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:49.520]   but I always look for games.
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:51.560]   My husband and I like to play games like that together
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:53.720]   and we're always looking for new stuff to try.
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:55.640]   So hopefully one day.
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:58.560]   - This looks pretty much like that and moving out
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:39:59.400]   is like that.
[01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:02.320]   So it's a very cartoonish game.
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:05.240]   So you're trying to go into rooms of an apartment
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:07.320]   and two people are in two different sticks.
[01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:09.240]   You're like trying to move a couch out of the house.
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:10.640]   - Oh, I hate games like that.
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:11.560]   That's frustrating.
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:12.400]   I hate that.
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:13.400]   - You can call it divorce.
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:14.880]   - It's pretty much like real life.
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:16.280]   I don't know.
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:17.120]   I'm not gonna do it.
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:18.800]   I'd rather kill an alien.
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:20.600]   - This looks very dark.
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:23.920]   Like you're dark, scary stuff.
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:25.760]   - It's an adrenaline rush.
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:27.160]   It just never lets up the pressure.
[01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:28.320]   - Are there jumpscares?
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:29.560]   Are they gonna jump out at anything?
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:30.400]   - Yes.
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:31.240]   - Yeah, there's some jumps.
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:32.920]   And it really captures everything from the films
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:35.400]   really well down to like the sound of that machine gun.
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:38.160]   You know, they've really done, they've done a nice job.
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:40.760]   I pretty much only play, I only play co-op now
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:41.600]   for some reason.
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:44.760]   At some point I just got tired of online PVP stuff
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:47.080]   and I mostly just look for co-op games.
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:48.000]   - Same.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.040]   - So the difference is instead of shooting at Brianna,
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:52.880]   you'll be shooting with Brianna at any point.
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:53.800]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:54.640]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:57.280]   - In fact, if you accidentally shoot me, I will die
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:40:58.520]   and we will fail our mission.
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:40:59.360]   - Oh.
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:00.440]   - Because you're not playing well.
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:01.280]   - Yikes.
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:02.120]   They have friendly fire.
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:03.120]   Oh, that's bad.
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:03.960]   - Yeah.
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:05.760]   Well, the base level, there's no friendly fire.
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:08.040]   So as you get better, you pretty much level up
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:10.360]   your character and as the higher levels come in,
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:12.920]   then you start implementing harder scenarios
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:14.080]   where you can actually hurt your team.
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:16.440]   - Do you have to have a PS5 for this?
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:17.280]   - Nope.
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:18.120]   - It's on everything.
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:19.880]   - It's on Xbox, PC, yeah, everything.
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:21.840]   - But you can either play other PS5 people
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:23.320]   if you're a PS5.
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:24.160]   Is that right?
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:26.840]   - I think PS4 people can play with PS5 people.
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:29.000]   - Cross-platform's hard, isn't it?
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.000]   - Yeah, it really is.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.600]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:32.720]   That looks fun.
[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:35.640]   Well, I don't have a PS5, so you guys have fun.
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:38.080]   I'll just be over here on my Xbox.
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:39.640]   My old Xbox.
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:42.840]   - Can't get, I couldn't get either of those.
[01:41:42.840 --> 01:41:43.960]   They're all talking about chips.
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:44.920]   - Really?
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:47.160]   - Yeah, how'd you get a PS5?
[01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:49.760]   - Christina can get literally anything.
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:52.440]   - Christina Warren is like the queen of the,
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.960]   she said, "Oleo, you should have called me."
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:56.600]   I can get you one.
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:57.600]   - Yeah.
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:58.520]   - What is she?
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:41:59.920]   She's some sort of black market context.
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:02.320]   - I don't know if it's mob connections.
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:03.600]   - She's what?
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:07.120]   - She got me an RTX 3090, she got me a PS5,
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:08.720]   she got me an Xbox Series X,
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:11.720]   so Christina's a good friend to have around, Leo.
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:12.560]   You should.
[01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:17.640]   - Christina of course is co-host with Brianna Wu
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:20.960]   and Simone de Roche for of Rocket,
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:23.840]   which is a great show on relay FM.
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:26.320]   And congratulations to relay FM.
[01:42:26.320 --> 01:42:30.800]   They have now raised, is it a million dollars?
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:34.080]   - Mm-hmm, it's over a million I think.
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:37.760]   - Over a million dollars for which charity?
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:38.600]   - St. Jude.
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:39.640]   - St. Jude.
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:41.720]   You guys like St. Jude too?
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:42.560]   - We do.
[01:42:42.560 --> 01:42:43.400]   - Of course.
[01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:46.680]   - St. our co-founder, he had a child
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:48.160]   that nearly died of cancer
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:50.680]   and St. Jude literally saved his life,
[01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:53.520]   so he feels rather indebted to helping them.
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:54.960]   So believe it or not,
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:58.240]   I'm probably gonna be playing aliens fire team with Micah
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:00.240]   for the fundraiser that we're doing
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:01.320]   towards the end of the month.
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:02.160]   - Oh.
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:05.280]   - So you can watch Micah either die or live.
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:06.120]   - I don't know which one you can hear.
[01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:07.880]   - Micah Sergeant, love the guy.
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:10.960]   Of course he's our host of iOS today in Tech News Weekly
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:15.120]   and works with me, he'll be on the Apple event on Tuesday,
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:18.760]   but it doesn't strike me as like a great gamer.
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:23.120]   Like the guy you'd wanna go into an alien cave,
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:25.200]   infested cave with sort of,
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:26.040]   but may not-- - He now broke,
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:27.840]   survived, maybe Micah will.
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:29.720]   I don't know, I'll have to see what happens.
[01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:31.480]   - Okay, I'll be watching that one.
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:33.240]   That sounds like fun.
[01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:34.480]   That sounds awesome.
[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:35.760]   All right, Amazon.
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:38.680]   Lots to talk about.
[01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:43.160]   By the way, Amazon really being pissy about SpaceX.
[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:46.640]   They tell the FCC that,
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:51.560]   well let me just read the quote from this FCC filing,
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:52.600]   'cause they don't want Starlink
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:55.320]   to launch all these satellites.
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:57.480]   Quote, "Whether it's launching satellites
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:43:59.640]   with unlicensed antennas,
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:01.960]   launching rockets without approval,
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:04.080]   building an unapproved launch tower
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:06.840]   or reopening a factory in violation
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:08.480]   of a shelter in place order,
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:11.720]   the conduct of SpaceX and other musculid companies
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:13.280]   makes their view plain.
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:15.360]   Rules are for other people,
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:16.760]   and those who insist upon,
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:18.840]   or even simply request compliance,
[01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:22.920]   are deserving of derision and ad hominem attacks."
[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:26.040]   Wow. - Yeah, the fighting
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:28.200]   between all of them has been pretty funny.
[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:30.480]   Viacin has also been engaged in those filings
[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:31.800]   where they just kind of-- - Yeah, they didn't want
[01:44:31.800 --> 01:44:33.000]   other satellites, but then,
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.360]   but also then it's Amazon seems to be like,
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:37.040]   they're suing Microsoft.
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:40.040]   Oh, you know, they were mad about the Jedi contract,
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:42.200]   and then there's this NSA contract.
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:45.200]   Seems like if you can't compete, go to court.
[01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:46.800]   - Yep. - Yep.
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:48.320]   (sighs)
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:49.160]   All right.
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:54.280]   Amazon, by the way, won the NSA contract,
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:56.320]   so maybe Microsoft's suing them,
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:58.560]   so it goes, what goes around, comes around.
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:00.680]   It's both sides of the matter.
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:04.600]   Why are top streamers leaving Twitch
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:07.520]   as the Washington Post right about this?
[01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:11.280]   They lost, oh my God, Dr. Lupo,
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:13.920]   and Tim the TAT-Man-Batar?
[01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:16.720]   Oh, no.
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:20.040]   Okay, that's not much of a story.
[01:45:20.040 --> 01:45:21.600]   - I'm not a Tim the TAT-Man.
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:23.840]   - I'm sorry. - Yeah, there is a story here.
[01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:28.400]   I mean, Twitch is not paying their really big people
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:29.800]   as much as they used to, so--
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:32.520]   - Hey, this killed Microsoft's mixer.
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:34.000]   Be careful. - That's the new thing.
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.600]   Be careful.
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:37.440]   They're going back to YouTube, huh?
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:38.520]   - They are, they are.
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:40.560]   YouTube is backing up trucks of money
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:43.320]   and handing it to them, and yeah, I realize,
[01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:45.640]   maybe y'all don't watch as much Twitch as I do,
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:49.120]   but this is the AM equivalent of the Zoomer generation.
[01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:52.560]   I mean, you've got some of the talk political shows,
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:55.600]   top political shows around there, like a sun.
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:57.440]   This matters.
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:45:59.280]   - We're on Twitch. - Yeah.
[01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:00.680]   - We're on Twitch.
[01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:01.760]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:04.600]   - When I was playing Valheim, I streamed it on Twitch.
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:06.560]   Actually, my experience was streaming on YouTube
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:09.120]   didn't seem like it was as good as streaming on Twitch.
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:12.640]   I thought Twitch did a better job of quality and so forth,
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:14.760]   but I may be wrong.
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:15.600]   I don't know.
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:19.480]   I'm a Tyro at all this.
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:20.560]   It was fun, though.
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:21.600]   I liked it.
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:24.640]   I'll probably be going back on my Twitch stream,
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:26.840]   twitch.tv/clubtuit,
[01:46:26.840 --> 01:46:29.680]   with my Valheim Prime Time stream,
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:33.240]   because we're getting an update to Valheim on the 16th.
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:35.960]   But it's gonna be so depressing,
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:38.040]   'cause it's mostly new cooking items.
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:40.440]   (laughing)
[01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:44.200]   I'm gonna do a Valheim cooking show.
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:46.680]   It's not, okay, it's not aliens.
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:48.000]   I'm just saying.
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.120]   It's viking since kind of stuff.
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:53.920]   Let's see.
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:56.240]   Amazon is getting in the TV business.
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:46:58.480]   It's not clear who's making these TVs for them,
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:01.760]   but these are very inexpensive.
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:02.600]   Really kind of.
[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:06.240]   I mean, let's be honest, low-end TVs.
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:09.280]   The Amazon Fire TV Omni series.
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:14.080]   That's the expensive one in the value-priced four series.
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:17.200]   Lots of money to be made on data collection.
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:18.040]   Yeah.
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:18.880]   Isn't that the case?
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:21.160]   Actually, the thing that amazes me is I just,
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:23.640]   I went shopping for a TV and I just wanted a dumb TV
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:25.240]   that didn't have any of the smart internals,
[01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:26.720]   and literally it doesn't exist.
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:27.560]   No, you can't.
[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:30.480]   You can't buy a TV that's just like a dumb movie.
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:33.240]   If you did, it would be so expensive.
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:34.440]   Sorry, Lisa.
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:37.360]   Oh, I was gonna say also, I feel like in general,
[01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:38.800]   not from a privacy standpoint,
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:40.400]   but just in terms of usability,
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:44.280]   I feel like it's much easier to use a Roku
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:47.400]   or any kind of device that you add on to a TV
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:50.240]   rather than the built-in software anyway.
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:51.880]   It's just usually not a good experience,
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:56.400]   and it's slow and it's not as easily upgradable.
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:57.240]   So yeah, I don't know.
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:59.600]   I was very anti-smart TVs for a long time, but...
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:01.520]   I feel like it's hard.
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:03.800]   But it's impossible to fight against it.
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:06.960]   No, all you do is just not connect the TV to the internet.
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:08.440]   You're gonna get all that smart stuff,
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:11.000]   but just whatever you do, don't connect it to the internet
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.320]   'cause it's spying on you like crazy.
[01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:14.560]   100%.
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:17.320]   Yeah, I'm already asking for my Wi-Fi all the time,
[01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:19.080]   and I just will not give it to it
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:20.840]   because I don't need anyone now or too much.
[01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:22.280]   Well, that's the downside.
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:23.120]   Yeah.
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:23.960]   24 I watch.
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:25.240]   My high sense from saying,
[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:27.440]   "I'm not connected to the internet."
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:29.880]   What's the matter with you?
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:33.160]   There's some TVs, if you disable the internet functionality,
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:35.040]   you actually lose some other functionality.
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:36.760]   Like if you tell it, you don't wanna be tracked.
[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:37.880]   I forget which TV it was,
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:39.360]   but there was a story a couple years ago
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:40.680]   that if you popped it out of,
[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:42.280]   or if you tried to turn off the internet connection,
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:44.360]   then other important parts of the television
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:45.440]   just wouldn't work anymore.
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:46.880]   This is a larger story.
[01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:51.600]   I think that a lot of apps, a lot of products
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:54.800]   are subsidized by spying on you.
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:57.640]   And so we're demanding lower cost TVs.
[01:48:57.640 --> 01:49:00.040]   For instance, these are very inexpensive TVs,
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:02.680]   but the price you pay is that
[01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:05.400]   they're making up the difference by spying on you.
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:06.240]   Yeah.
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:07.760]   It was like very black mirrorish.
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:10.680]   Like that whole example, I forgot what company it was,
[01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:14.000]   but I feel like I remember what you're talking about.
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.960]   Carl, with the TV that had some of its functionality
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:19.840]   turned off, if you turn off the tracking aspect.
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:22.080]   And yeah, it doesn't kind of sound like black mirror.
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:23.480]   Like wasn't there literally an episode
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:26.760]   where they forced you to watch ads or something like that,
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:28.680]   or else your screen wouldn't work.
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:29.520]   I don't remember.
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:33.840]   But if it doesn't exist, it sounds like it probably would.
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:36.320]   Also, when consumer reports reviews these TVs off
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:37.680]   and they're not very secure either,
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:41.440]   like there was that scandal about Samsung
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:43.560]   collecting microphone audio data
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:44.920]   and then not encrypting it at all
[01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:47.480]   and storing it just openly somewhere.
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:50.160]   So these companies collect that data,
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:52.480]   which is how people make money,
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:54.280]   but at least secure your stuff,
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:55.920]   which they don't really do that either.
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:49:58.480]   So there has to be some kind of improvement there.
[01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:00.200]   I feel like this is a hard story
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:04.680]   because on one hand, I really want the TV industry disrupted.
[01:50:04.680 --> 01:50:08.200]   It is such, I don't know if y'all have bought a TV recently,
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:11.760]   but it is a nightmare of trying to figure it out.
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:13.200]   I mean, all the different sizes,
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:16.080]   just even if you know you want a Samsung
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:18.000]   and you know the number one feature you want
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000]   is low latency for gaming.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:21.640]   Like you're going through SKUs
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:23.440]   and trying to figure out is this year's model
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:25.000]   or last year's model.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.560]   Like the whole thing is just,
[01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:28.600]   it feels like a broken industry.
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:31.320]   So I like Amazon getting into it,
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:35.360]   but they're the worst people to do something like this.
[01:50:35.360 --> 01:50:37.240]   - And that's to mention all the jargon too.
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:40.760]   Like the TV industry, I feel like is infamous more so
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:42.640]   than other aspects of the tech industry
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:45.520]   for throwing in buzzwords that are literally
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:47.720]   just marketing terms that don't mean anything.
[01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:50.000]   And that makes it even harder to buy something.
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:54.840]   Like I think every company has their own marketing term
[01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:57.000]   for like the type of display panel that it is.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.680]   And like if you're trying to buy something,
[01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:01.040]   it's super confusing, it's awful.
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:01.880]   - Oh yeah, good luck.
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:05.520]   I mean, I'm sure convinced Samsung chose QLED
[01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:09.080]   for its LCD TVs because it sounds like OLED.
[01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:09.920]   - Right.
[01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:12.720]   - And people will maybe mistake it.
[01:51:12.720 --> 01:51:16.360]   I should mention that the value TV shootout,
[01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:18.320]   value electronics does this every year
[01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:20.480]   where they bring in the top TVs,
[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:22.080]   usually just a handful of them.
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:25.920]   And then bring in experts to review them.
[01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:26.880]   That's this week.
[01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:30.000]   If actually it's going on today, it's today and tomorrow.
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000]   So at some point,
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:35.480]   now the problem is this doesn't cover the whole waterfront.
[01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:37.520]   On the 4K TVs, they're only four
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:39.520]   because they just kind of rule out anybody
[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:41.560]   who's not gonna be like the Amazon TV.
[01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:44.080]   It's not gonna be in the running.
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:46.920]   This year they'll look at a high sense,
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:50.880]   they have a new technology called Dual Cell LCDs,
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:55.040]   the LG OLED, Samsung OLED and a Sony OLED.
[01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:57.520]   And then they're also gonna look at 8K TVs.
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:51:59.280]   It's the first time they've done that
[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:01.520]   and they'll be LG, Samsung and Sony.
[01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:03.440]   And then so they get all these experts in a room
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:08.000]   looking at the same TV with the same content,
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:11.000]   they're pre-calibrated and then voting on
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:12.600]   what they call the King of TVs.
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:14.960]   This is something every year I pay attention to.
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:16.320]   - Yeah, I went with the LG.
[01:52:16.320 --> 01:52:18.000]   And I think it was the LG CX.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.520]   It was like the beautiful model.
[01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:20.680]   It's just beautiful.
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:21.520]   - That's a good one.
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:22.800]   - Just really beautiful for gaming.
[01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:23.640]   - Yep, yep.
[01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:24.480]   - Really, really beautiful.
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:25.320]   - I try to.
[01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:26.960]   - I try to use it for gaming.
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:28.800]   Oh, could you have a PS5, of course.
[01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:29.640]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:32.880]   It does HDR, it does 30 frames per second.
[01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:34.800]   - Is it 120 frames per second?
[01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:36.200]   Can you go up to that?
[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:38.400]   - I think it's up to 60, but it's 120 Hertz, right?
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:40.560]   I think that's the real big improvement for gaming.
[01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:41.800]   - What's the distinction?
[01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:44.000]   - I think it's beyond my pace.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.160]   - I thought that was the same thing.
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:51.160]   So the PS5 will either do 4K or 120 frames per second,
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:53.800]   although that's, I think, a limitation of the games.
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:55.960]   That may change in time.
[01:52:55.960 --> 01:52:57.040]   - I feel confused.
[01:52:57.040 --> 01:52:58.360]   - I get confused, but--
[01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:00.240]   - The reason I know this, I feel guilty,
[01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:03.600]   'cause we did get a PS5 for Michael, our 18-year-old.
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:07.280]   And I got, I said, "Oh no, you need a 4K TV,
[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:09.760]   "but I got 'em a 60 Hertz."
[01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:12.320]   And I feel guilty, so I have to explain to Michael,
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:14.560]   "Don't worry, 'cause you can't do both four."
[01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:17.360]   But really, what I should've done is get 120 Hertz.
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:19.000]   I was just stupid.
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:19.840]   - So--
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:20.880]   - I've been going the other way
[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:25.400]   and trying to find a really good CRT for speed.
[01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:26.240]   - What?
[01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:28.360]   - I've been obsessed with funding.
[01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:31.560]   So the thing with the CRT is there's zero lag.
[01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:36.560]   You can have the best HDMI component to HDMI converters
[01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:37.640]   in the entire world.
[01:53:37.640 --> 01:53:40.480]   The frame-meister retro-tink makes a great one,
[01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:43.760]   but you're still introducing one to two frames of lag in there
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:46.920]   for you to do the Princess Peach Vine Jump.
[01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:49.440]   It's a three-frame window.
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:51.480]   So that lag really, really matters.
[01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:55.080]   So serious speedrunners for vintage games like me,
[01:53:55.080 --> 01:54:00.040]   we are constantly looking for old CRTs to bring in
[01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:01.000]   and like love.
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:05.520]   So I don't want, I want a PVM from like a radio station.
[01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:06.960]   That's the holy grail,
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:09.960]   is finding like that professional video monitor.
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:13.160]   I actually have hardware that will hook up
[01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:18.160]   the analog is the, it's a modern super Nintendo
[01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:20.040]   slash Nintendo slash Sega.
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:21.960]   They have all these different models of it.
[01:54:21.960 --> 01:54:24.120]   But it's re-engineered for HDMI
[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:27.800]   and they released a product that will reverse engineer
[01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:32.240]   their modern SNES and make it run on a CRT.
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:34.320]   So now that I finally got one of those,
[01:54:34.320 --> 01:54:35.840]   I desperately need to find this.
[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:39.480]   - Are you are still the eighth fastest?
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:41.200]   - I think I've been bumped into ninth.
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:42.200]   - Oh.
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:44.280]   - I've been bumped to ninth,
[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:46.200]   but that's cause I'm working on other games.
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:48.440]   (laughing)
[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:52.640]   - If we hadn't already done this on a recent tweet,
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:53.880]   I would go through the whole thing.
[01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:56.320]   - No, please don't, please don't.
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:54:58.480]   - I just think it's hysterical.
[01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:01.160]   And I was searching for this and I found out you're tweeting,
[01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:02.520]   "How come I can't get a vaccine?
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:04.400]   I am the eighth fastest."
[01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:05.720]   (laughing)
[01:55:05.720 --> 01:55:08.840]   Princess Peach, Mario 2 speed runner.
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:11.120]   How do I get the vaccine, huh?
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:14.880]   - Yeah, we gotta protect our most important assets
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:16.320]   in civilization.
[01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:18.600]   In case something happens,
[01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:22.960]   we should put you in this fallboard speed vault.
[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:24.400]   - Oh, we got it. - No, it's a seed vault,
[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:26.040]   but we could call it the speed runner vault
[01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:27.640]   and put you all in there.
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:29.360]   It's for seeds, but you know.
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:32.120]   I, you know, it's funny,
[01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:34.320]   I don't cover Facebook stories very much anymore
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:35.160]   'cause I'm not on it,
[01:55:35.160 --> 01:55:37.520]   but I guess we should do a couple of Facebook stories.
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:38.360]   We're gonna take a break.
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:40.440]   We will do that in a moment.
[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:42.960]   Speed runner, Princess Peach,
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:48.280]   three frame vine jump expert,
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:50.640]   Brianna Wu is with us.
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:52.360]   She's also the executive director
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:55.360]   of Rebellion Pack at rebellionpack.com.
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:57.160]   So nice to see you.
[01:55:57.160 --> 01:56:00.160]   I hope things go well in the Guardian Angels.
[01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:05.080]   Also, this is Carl Bodie from all over motherboard
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:07.760]   and Tech Dirt and great tech reporters.
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:10.120]   Wonderful to have you on your first time onto it.
[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:13.400]   And already, it just feels like you've been here forever.
[01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:14.600]   I'm glad thrilled to have you.
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:15.720]   Thank you.
[01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:20.240]   And also from CNET senior editor at CNET,
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:23.080]   Lisa Adichiko, it's nice to see you again too.
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:24.080]   - Yeah, it's great to be here again.
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:27.960]   - Finally got you back on our show today brought to you by,
[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:28.960]   I don't know if you've noticed,
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:30.600]   but I'm very well rested today.
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:36.720]   My Casper, I slept like a champ last night.
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:40.520]   Casper, there it is, my Casper mattress.
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:41.800]   We have so many of these.
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:45.520]   The kids, I have them, relatives have them.
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:47.160]   We just keep buying Casper mattress.
[01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:49.560]   It's actually, it's an affordable and nice gift
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:52.280]   because you'll love your tomorrow with Casper,
[01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:54.920]   the new Casper cooling collection.
[01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:58.080]   Oh man, has everything you need to sleep cool all night long,
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:56:59.040]   winter or summer.
[01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:01.360]   You really want to sleep cool, but especially
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:03.600]   during these hot summer nights,
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:07.760]   having the Casper cooling collections just a boon.
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:10.560]   The new mattresses with the snow technology
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:12.920]   they call it the wave hybrid snow mattress
[01:57:12.920 --> 01:57:15.200]   keeps you cool for 12 plus hours.
[01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:18.400]   Actually literally pulls heat away from your body
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:20.200]   for sustained temperature regulation.
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:22.240]   You know if you cold, you feel comfortable
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:25.160]   and there's that nice fresh cool little touch feeling
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:27.520]   and of course your tomorrow's are much improved.
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:29.120]   Better bedding also important.
[01:57:29.120 --> 01:57:31.760]   That's why Casper's hyper light sheets
[01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:34.320]   are designed with an innovative grid weave.
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:38.280]   You can see how cool I am right now.
[01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:41.480]   That lets the air flow through for maximum breathability.
[01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:44.360]   The lightweight duvet gives you optimal temperature control
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:47.400]   without sacrificing plush comfort
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:50.200]   and of course, Casper's breathable mattress protector
[01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:52.600]   improves the coolness of the bed even further
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:57.080]   by allowing air to flow between your body and your mattress.
[01:57:57.080 --> 01:57:58.040]   There's nothing like it.
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:57:59.920]   It's that feeling, that feeling when you first
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:02.080]   put your feet down in the sheets
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:04.080]   and they feel so cool and fresh
[01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:06.120]   or maybe when you flip your pillow over
[01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:06.960]   and it's nice and cool.
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:08.280]   Oh, that's the feeling.
[01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:11.520]   You'll just go, oh, it's so good.
[01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:15.680]   And as always, Casper offers free shipping and free returns.
[01:58:15.680 --> 01:58:18.760]   We love our Casper's when it comes to a better night's sleep.
[01:58:18.760 --> 01:58:21.680]   Casper's new cooling collection as you covered.
[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:23.000]   Focus on tomorrow.
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:26.040]   Let Casper handle the rest, explore Casper products,
[01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:28.960]   mattresses, sheets, pillows and more.
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:30.880]   We have that glow lamp too, I love that.
[01:58:30.880 --> 01:58:35.360]   At Casper.com/twit1, C-A-S-P-E-R,
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:36.760]   not like the ghost,

[01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:54.480]   Thank you Casper for a good night's sleep.
[01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:57.280]   And thank you, dear Twit listener,
[01:58:57.280 --> 01:58:58.720]   for using that special address
[01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:01.960]   so they know you saw it here, Casper.com/twit1.
[01:59:01.960 --> 01:59:07.920]   Do we have the teaser, the trailer,
[01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:09.920]   talking about what a great week this was?
[01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:11.000]   Watch.
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.480]   - Roomba in, well, certain models of Roomba
[01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:15.200]   will now dodge PetPoo
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:17.000]   so he doesn't spread it all over your floor.
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:20.000]   Sorry, just thinking about the ML engineer
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.080]   who had to program the data set for like,
[01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:25.560]   is poo is not poo is poo is not poo.
[01:59:25.560 --> 01:59:28.120]   - Previously on Twit.
[01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:30.080]   This week in Enterprise Tech,
[01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:33.960]   Apple is rolling out the ability to add driver's licenses.
[01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:36.640]   The city is to the Walla app.
[01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:41.640]   - By going to a phone, the Apple Wallet in this case,
[01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:45.640]   what is passed is typically a one-time use token.
[01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:49.760]   Even if it's intercepted, even if it's captured,
[01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:51.200]   it's useless.
[01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:52.560]   - Hands-on photography.
[01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:55.080]   - Tyra picked me out of Instagram
[01:59:55.080 --> 01:59:58.640]   and she explained that I was the first for the magazine
[01:59:58.640 --> 02:00:02.280]   and basically I deserve to be on Vogue.
[02:00:02.280 --> 02:00:06.800]   I deserve all the other great magazines,
[02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:08.120]   Passion Magazine, so.
[02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:09.040]   - Tell it.
[02:00:09.040 --> 02:00:10.240]   - This week in Google.
[02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:13.160]   - Whole Foods is gonna be getting the Amazon
[02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:15.840]   just walk out technology.
[02:00:15.840 --> 02:00:17.200]   - What if my wife and I are gonna shop it?
[02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:19.880]   Nothing that happens 'cause she picks up a disaster
[02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:20.880]   in a grocery store, but
[02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:22.080]   just theoretically.
[02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:24.560]   - I'm a disaster, I'm not allowed to go to the grocery store.
[02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:26.440]   - What do you guys do in this similar role
[02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:27.640]   in place here in the pre-year-round?
[02:00:27.640 --> 02:00:29.440]   - You two, all three of you.
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:31.440]   Why isn't the catch-up next to the tomatoes?
[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:32.800]   It's not logical.
[02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:33.640]   I can't remember why you didn't.
[02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:35.080]   - That's not long.
[02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:37.880]   - Okay, Jeff, your reason is silly.
[02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:39.200]   - Twit.
[02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:40.920]   - Oh, that's cringy.
[02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:46.280]   - Catch-ups of condiment, tomatoes are a vegetable.
[02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:49.240]   That's obvious, I don't understand it.
[02:00:49.240 --> 02:00:52.120]   We also had a great event in Club Twit this week.
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:54.840]   The first, ask me anything.
[02:00:54.840 --> 02:00:57.600]   Our community manager and host of Hands-off Photography
[02:00:57.600 --> 02:01:00.800]   and Pruitt hosted a, asked me anything with,
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:03.640]   Micah Sargent was great, fascinating, wonderful.
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:05.040]   We love Micah.
[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:06.160]   If you are a Club Twit member,

[02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:24.560]   - I think people talking about speed running.
[02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:27.680]   You also get access to our Twit Plus feed,
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:29.920]   which is, there's a lot of conversations
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:31.200]   that happen outside the shows,
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:32.480]   as we get our getting set up.
[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:33.760]   There's stuff off the air.

[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:47.320]   what we're doing, and I appreciate it.
[02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:49.600]   Really, it really makes a big difference for us.
[02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:51.320]   And we're very grateful for this.
[02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:54.440]   Now, I think almost 4,000 Club Twit members.
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:55.960]   That's really nice to have you.
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:01:56.880]   We appreciate it.
[02:01:56.880 --> 02:02:00.080]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:01.440]   You don't have to be a member of Club Twit
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:03.360]   to go to Alaska with us.
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:08.360]   We are still on for Alaska in July.
[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:11.080]   You're all invited.
[02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:14.320]   Cruise.twit.tv will be going on
[02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:16.360]   the Holland America Eurodam,
[02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:19.000]   July of 2022.
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.880]   And I've been just looking at all one of the excursions
[02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:22.720]   I really want to go on.
[02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:24.080]   I'm ready to goes on,
[02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:26.240]   should come with us on the excursions.
[02:02:26.240 --> 02:02:27.840]   Paul Theron will be there too, by the way,
[02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:29.160]   and his wife, along with Lisa,
[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:32.120]   and my wife Lisa and me.
[02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:33.240]   We're going to go there.
[02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:36.120]   You take a helicopter to a glacier
[02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:39.000]   where you will be met by a dog team,
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:42.120]   and you get to mush a dog team across the glacier.
[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:45.880]   I mean, look, if the world's going to melt,
[02:02:45.880 --> 02:02:47.720]   at least I'm going to do this first.
[02:02:47.720 --> 02:02:49.320]   So that's all I'm just saying.
[02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:52.520]   If you want to last chance,
[02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:57.600]   see Glacier Kids, go to cruz.twit.tv.
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:00.680]   And that's all the plugs for the...
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:02.200]   - I did one of those chips that long ago.
[02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:03.360]   That's really beautiful.
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:04.840]   - Oh, it's so beautiful up there.
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:07.760]   Actually, I took one of those puddled,
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:09.320]   one of those small little pontoon planes,
[02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:12.120]   which I know are the safest thing in the world.
[02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:15.040]   But they flew you out over amazing mountains
[02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:15.800]   in the middle of nowhere.
[02:03:15.800 --> 02:03:17.720]   And landed you on a crystal clear lake
[02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:20.200]   and got out and just stood on the pontoon edge of the boat
[02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:22.760]   and looked out at the clear, perfect water.
[02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:27.120]   - You know, I suppose we shouldn't, we should just stay home
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:31.280]   and not drive our cars and not cook with gas
[02:03:31.280 --> 02:03:35.560]   and just like eat rough vegetables that we grow ourselves.
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:38.600]   But I feel like there's so much stuff to see.
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:41.000]   And I don't want to ruin it by going to see it.
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:42.960]   I don't know what to do.
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:46.960]   We buy carbon offsets for all of our trips effect
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:49.320]   for the business as well.
[02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:54.320]   I don't know, maybe is that just a sav to my conscience?
[02:03:54.320 --> 02:03:56.240]   I hope it's doing something good.
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:57.960]   - No, I think it matters.
[02:03:57.960 --> 02:04:00.080]   I think that real action on climate change
[02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:01.360]   has to come from the top.
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:04.200]   So, you know, I think we can admit
[02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:07.960]   that no individual can solve or just, you know,
[02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:10.560]   or blow up this whole situation.
[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:12.240]   - I probably shouldn't take a helicopter
[02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:13.080]   to a glacier though.
[02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:16.040]   - Maybe cancel that.
[02:04:16.040 --> 02:04:17.880]   - Probably shouldn't do that.
[02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:19.600]   - It's so beautiful up there.
[02:04:19.600 --> 02:04:21.040]   It's really beautiful.
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:21.880]   - I'm really conflicted
[02:04:21.880 --> 02:04:24.680]   because I love to travel and want to see it.
[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:26.240]   I don't want to be part of the problem.
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:29.320]   I mean, we do, you know, we have solar panels all over our roof.
[02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:31.160]   We generate as much bar power as we can.
[02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:33.800]   We're getting rid of all the liquid, you know,
[02:04:33.800 --> 02:04:37.120]   LPG and the natural gas stuff in our house
[02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:39.840]   and drive electric vehicles.
[02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:40.680]   But you're right.
[02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:42.040]   I mean, how much can you do?
[02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:43.320]   - Especially when Brianna's driving
[02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:44.840]   or polluting pourshes all over the place.
[02:04:44.840 --> 02:04:46.000]   - Yes, yes.
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:47.480]   - Nothing I can do about that.
[02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:49.800]   (laughing)
[02:04:49.800 --> 02:04:50.720]   - You're with me.
[02:04:50.720 --> 02:04:53.480]   I'm sure you carolot and you want to save the planet.
[02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:55.480]   But I...
[02:04:55.480 --> 02:04:58.040]   - It's, I feel guilty about it.
[02:04:58.040 --> 02:04:59.400]   You know, I really feel,
[02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:03.040]   I feel envious that my dad's generation could go out
[02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:05.200]   and do things like buy a V8 car,
[02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:06.560]   like a V8 Corvette.
[02:05:06.560 --> 02:05:07.560]   - Yeah, but it's because they did.
[02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:08.400]   - Because they did.
[02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:09.240]   - And just don't stress it.
[02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:11.120]   - I know. - And we're...
[02:05:11.120 --> 02:05:14.400]   But to a point, I think that like,
[02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:17.160]   manufacturing emissions play a much larger role
[02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:20.040]   in that, you know, airlines play a huge role.
[02:05:20.040 --> 02:05:21.040]   I mean, it's...
[02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:22.840]   - Deforestation. - The ownership on this.
[02:05:22.840 --> 02:05:24.600]   - 100%. - There's also a lot of stuff.
[02:05:24.600 --> 02:05:27.160]   But everybody should do their part as best we can.
[02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:31.240]   - Oh well, Facebook, let's talk about Facebook.
[02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:32.840]   So much more cheerful.
[02:05:32.840 --> 02:05:35.840]   Sent flawed data to misinformation readers.
[02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:37.320]   - Wow. - Which on the fate researchers.
[02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:38.760]   Which on the face of it seems like
[02:05:38.760 --> 02:05:42.480]   if you're gonna send information, misinformation researchers,
[02:05:42.480 --> 02:05:44.840]   it should be misinformation, but that's not how it works.
[02:05:44.840 --> 02:05:46.380]   More than three years ago,
[02:05:46.380 --> 02:05:50.720]   Facebook trumpeted a plan to share data with researchers
[02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:52.880]   about how people interact with posts
[02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:56.320]   and links on the social network after a lot of criticism,
[02:05:56.320 --> 02:05:58.560]   so that academics could study misinformation
[02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:00.560]   and help Facebook handle it.
[02:06:00.560 --> 02:06:02.440]   They've been using that data for two years
[02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:07.000]   for many studies, turns out, according to internal emails
[02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.080]   and interviews with the researchers,
[02:06:09.080 --> 02:06:12.600]   the data included interactions with only half of Facebook's
[02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:16.600]   US users, the ones who engaged with political pages
[02:06:16.600 --> 02:06:19.640]   enough to make their political leanings clear.
[02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:22.640]   Not all of them, even though the company said it was all of them.
[02:06:22.640 --> 02:06:26.520]   And so researchers are saying things like,
[02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:29.160]   "This undermines the trust we have in Facebook."
[02:06:29.160 --> 02:06:32.880]   You had trust in Facebook?
[02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:34.800]   - I was just gonna say what trust.
[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:36.400]   - Tell me about that. - Yeah.
[02:06:37.320 --> 02:06:40.160]   Facebook says, "We sincerely apologize."
[02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:41.320]   (laughs)
[02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:43.240]   - That's by the way, of course they do.
[02:06:43.240 --> 02:06:45.000]   For the inconveniences may have caused,
[02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.200]   we'd like to offer as much support as possible.
[02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:48.520]   - At least they're sincere, you know?
[02:06:48.520 --> 02:06:51.000]   - They're sincerely apologizing.
[02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:52.560]   - This time we mean it.
[02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:56.680]   - 47 different projects, researchers,
[02:06:56.680 --> 02:06:58.440]   all of whom basically were told,
[02:06:58.440 --> 02:07:02.160]   "Yeah, the data you got, that wasn't good data."
[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:06.600]   So anyway, welcome to the club.
[02:07:06.600 --> 02:07:10.520]   Twitter's been trying a lot of interesting things lately.
[02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:14.920]   - Yeah, I still don't understand how communities work.
[02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:17.000]   I saw you talking about that on one of your other shows.
[02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:20.320]   And whether they're trying to shovel the Reddit model
[02:07:20.320 --> 02:07:22.240]   into an app that really builds--
[02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:25.720]   - Yeah, Reddit or Facebook groups or Google circles
[02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:28.680]   or a lot of examples, and this never seemed like that
[02:07:28.680 --> 02:07:29.960]   was what Twitter was about.
[02:07:29.960 --> 02:07:32.920]   But like I'm not for anything that kind of narrows
[02:07:32.920 --> 02:07:35.120]   the audience down because you always have those collisions
[02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:38.240]   between Aunt Bertha and your punk rock friend from college
[02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:41.000]   and in places like Facebook and anything that allows me
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.120]   to narrow down the people I'm talking to
[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:44.720]   and allow for better conversations.
[02:07:44.720 --> 02:07:48.080]   But I just don't know if Twitter is maybe the right.
[02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:50.520]   - It's so crazy though, like Twitter,
[02:07:50.520 --> 02:07:54.280]   the things people want from Twitter are so darn
[02:07:54.280 --> 02:07:56.920]   like straightforward, editable tweets.
[02:07:56.920 --> 02:07:59.480]   Responding to harassment reports.
[02:07:59.480 --> 02:08:01.240]   Maybe doing something about it.
[02:08:01.240 --> 02:08:02.600]   - No, but we got this for you.
[02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:05.840]   If you're into dogs, weather, sneakers, skincare, astrology,
[02:08:05.840 --> 02:08:07.560]   we've got a group for you.
[02:08:07.560 --> 02:08:09.400]   - Right, it's crazy.
[02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:12.200]   Like do something about the randos with eight digits
[02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:13.280]   after their name.
[02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:16.360]   I've never had a good conversation on Twitter
[02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:19.120]   with someone with eight numbers after their name, ever.
[02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:20.440]   - That's actually--
[02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:22.800]   - It should be able to write a regular expression
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:24.440]   that filters them out.
[02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:25.800]   - Yeah. - Seems simple.
[02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:31.040]   - So, out communities, they are trying a little bit
[02:08:31.040 --> 02:08:36.040]   to give you more control over who you hear from.
[02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:41.120]   There's something they're trying,
[02:08:41.120 --> 02:08:45.120]   they call it a soft block feature.
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:49.240]   You can remove a follower without unfollowing them.
[02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:53.600]   - Kind of like muting them or,
[02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:56.320]   is that similar to muting someone
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:57.520]   if you're removing them?
[02:08:57.520 --> 02:08:59.160]   - Yeah. - You're not following them, I guess.
[02:08:59.160 --> 02:09:01.200]   - So, people who are following,
[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:03.520]   let's say you've got somebody with eight digits after his name.
[02:09:03.520 --> 02:09:04.640]   Actually, in their example,
[02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:07.560]   Twitter only has three digits after his name, but anyway.
[02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:11.400]   So apparently they're aware of this issue.
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:12.640]   And I think you can do this right now.
[02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:14.160]   It's certainly on my timeline you can.
[02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:17.040]   You have to use the official Twitter app, or not app,
[02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:18.200]   but webpage.
[02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:19.920]   You can click the three buttons on the right
[02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:23.560]   and say, remove this person from your followers.
[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:25.640]   That person will not be notified,
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:29.000]   and they can refollow you later.
[02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.120]   But for a little while, until they notice it,
[02:09:31.120 --> 02:09:32.920]   you won't show up in their timeline.
[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:37.200]   Let's call a soft block, I guess.
[02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:39.840]   - Yeah, they seem like-- - They find out,
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:41.040]   they find out eventually?
[02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:42.080]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:09:42.080 --> 02:09:43.080]   - Eventually they say,
[02:09:43.080 --> 02:09:45.640]   I am not seeing Leo's tweets anymore.
[02:09:45.640 --> 02:09:46.480]   Let me see what happened.
[02:09:46.480 --> 02:09:49.400]   Oh, I guess I unfollowed him by accident, refollow him.
[02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:51.000]   - I see. - Yeah.
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:51.960]   There's also a trick you can do.
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:53.080]   It's Twitter, I don't know if it still works.
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:55.240]   If you block somebody and then immediately unblock them,
[02:09:55.240 --> 02:09:58.720]   it will cause them to no longer follow you.
[02:09:58.720 --> 02:09:59.760]   - That's a soft block.
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:00.880]   Yes, that's the same thing.
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:02.160]   Yes. - Yeah.
[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:03.160]   - I guess so they're just basically
[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:04.000]   putting that into a social-- - Oh yeah,
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:05.280]   people seem to like that.
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:06.960]   - So let's put it in, yeah.
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:08.280]   - Yeah.
[02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:10.520]   (laughing)
[02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:13.200]   - You know, I get a corporate-- - Why do you,
[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:14.960]   I ask my wife this all the time,
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:16.840]   why are you on Twitter?
[02:10:16.840 --> 02:10:18.120]   Why don't you just leave it?
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:20.120]   - It's great.
[02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:23.600]   I mean, I get a lot of career connections from there.
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:27.480]   You know, you get to ask your fellow Twitch hosts
[02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:30.400]   when they wanna play Aliens versus an English fire team
[02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:32.080]   with you, which I just did.
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:33.640]   - Okay. - You know?
[02:10:33.640 --> 02:10:36.920]   - I mean, it's got a lot of career value, I think.
[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:39.960]   - And the flow of information on there is so quick.
[02:10:39.960 --> 02:10:42.240]   If you're a journalist or reporter on a beat,
[02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:45.040]   the data you see on there is gonna be there, you know,
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:47.280]   hours before it shows up in any news outlets.
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:48.800]   - Well, then I understand.
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:50.560]   If somebody dies, they immediately go to,
[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:51.960]   or if I've heard that somebody's dead,
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:53.440]   I immediately go to Twitter.
[02:10:53.440 --> 02:10:54.440]   - 'Cause they-- - Like Rihanna,
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:57.280]   I also, most of my connections have come through Twitter.
[02:10:57.280 --> 02:10:58.920]   You know, most of the people that I've worked with,
[02:10:58.920 --> 02:11:01.040]   most of my freelance work has come through Twitter
[02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:03.760]   and talked to people on Twitter and on Twitch and connection.
[02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:05.920]   - But that's kind of what we think about Twitter
[02:11:05.920 --> 02:11:07.400]   is that the journalists love it.
[02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:10.040]   - Yeah, if I wasn't a journalist,
[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:12.480]   I think I would be getting offline a lot more.
[02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:14.880]   I would not be on mostly social media platforms.
[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:18.200]   I'd be out, you know, working at a pet sanctuary
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:20.520]   somewhere because-- (laughing)
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:22.440]   - That's very tech-generationalist dream
[02:11:22.440 --> 02:11:25.960]   is to leave social media and work in a pet sanctuary.
[02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:27.200]   - It's very punishing.
[02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:29.360]   I mean, just even if you're not registering
[02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:30.680]   the headlines you're seeing, you know,
[02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:32.040]   and the conversations you're seeing,
[02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:34.760]   and it's, I find it very oppressive.
[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:37.640]   And I've had to really work with distancing myself from it,
[02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:38.480]   - Yes. - in a bleed,
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:41.120]   but still maintaining connections to people I work with
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:42.160]   and the beat that I cover,
[02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:44.720]   so I'm not losing track of the information stream.
[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:45.840]   And it's a hard balance. - Yeah.
[02:11:45.840 --> 02:11:47.440]   - And there's no real-- - It is really hard balance.
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:49.480]   - It's a good role. - It's terrible.
[02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:50.720]   - But we love TikTok. - I love TikTok.
[02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:52.840]   - But we love TikTok. - Nope.
[02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:55.240]   - Right? - Uh...
[02:11:55.240 --> 02:11:56.840]   - I think I'm too old for TikTok.
[02:11:56.840 --> 02:11:58.240]   - TikTok? - No, I was just gonna say--
[02:11:58.240 --> 02:12:01.520]   - TikTok now has overtaken YouTube
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:06.440]   for the average watch time. - Wow.
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:10.080]   - So basically, App Annie says TikTok
[02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:12.920]   has upended the streaming and social landscape
[02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:15.080]   because YouTube has so many users,
[02:12:15.080 --> 02:12:19.400]   it still has the number one for overall time spent.
[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:22.400]   But for average time, users in the UK and the US
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:26.200]   spend more time on TikTok than on YouTube.
[02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:27.080]   - I really like it.
[02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:29.320]   I mean, I didn't really understand Snapchat.
[02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:30.880]   I didn't really get into a lot of apps,
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:32.600]   but I like TikTok.
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:34.480]   - Yeah, Carl, I'm there with you as well.
[02:12:34.480 --> 02:12:37.200]   I feel like I never really got that into Snapchat,
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:40.320]   but I don't know, TikTok's algorithm is just really good.
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:42.120]   Like, as much as I hate to admit it,
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:46.400]   I give them barely any information about my interests
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:47.560]   or myself or what I like.
[02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:49.920]   But yeah, it's like a rabbit hole.
[02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:50.760]   I don't know.
[02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:54.200]   I just, that stat does not surprise me
[02:12:54.200 --> 02:12:56.320]   because I don't go on TikTok very often,
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:12:59.280]   but when I do, I feel like I could just scroll
[02:12:59.280 --> 02:13:00.840]   like forever, basically.
[02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:03.240]   - Yeah, like that most interesting man in the world.
[02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:05.400]   I don't go to TikTok very often.
[02:13:05.400 --> 02:13:06.240]   (laughs)
[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:07.720]   But when I do. (laughs)
[02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:11.320]   - No, honestly, I don't because I feel like it's,
[02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:13.200]   it is a little addicting, but also I feel like--
[02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:14.120]   - It's bad, yeah, you can't stop.
[02:13:14.120 --> 02:13:16.080]   - When I just want something to like,
[02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:19.320]   compulsively scroll, I feel like it's not always a video.
[02:13:19.320 --> 02:13:22.080]   I'll kind of go to Twitter for that.
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:24.400]   Otherwise, I do try like to what Carl was saying.
[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:27.760]   I do try to distance myself and be more conscious about it
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:31.040]   because if I don't try to kind of cut down
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:33.400]   on the screen time or not compulsively reach
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:35.400]   for my phone to check something,
[02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:37.120]   it's just out of control.
[02:13:37.120 --> 02:13:38.680]   I think you know-- - I think that Twitter
[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:40.800]   is for doom scrolling.
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:42.240]   - Yes, that's true.
[02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:44.960]   - TikTok is just pure dopamine.
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:46.040]   It's just like-- - Yes, exactly.
[02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:48.720]   - Yeah, it's all very positive.
[02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:52.240]   Like when I'm in a rabbit hole on TikTok,
[02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:55.120]   it's because I'm looking at really cute pet videos
[02:13:55.120 --> 02:13:57.320]   or like something that makes me feel happy,
[02:13:57.320 --> 02:14:00.400]   not all of the horrible things that are happening out there
[02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:02.040]   in the world. - Also--
[02:14:02.040 --> 02:14:04.560]   - I think you all are being a little too hard.
[02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:08.400]   I mean, I cannot tell you how many times I've just yesterday,
[02:14:08.400 --> 02:14:11.560]   like someone's like, "Hey, look at this Atlantic article."
[02:14:11.560 --> 02:14:13.880]   That never would have clicked on in a million years.
[02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:16.120]   You read it, it's deeply substantive.
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:18.720]   I mean, sometimes you just gotta follow the right people.
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:22.200]   I'm on car Twitter, which is completely different
[02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:24.240]   than political Twitter, 'cause it's just like,
[02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:26.560]   look at this cool thing that this person's doing,
[02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:29.600]   look at their great ride, look at this car that's coming out.
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:32.720]   I mean, it's, you just gotta change your people, you know?
[02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:35.320]   - Yeah, that's true.
[02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:37.400]   - That's what everybody always tells me.
[02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:39.720]   Is, "Oh, you're just not following the right people."
[02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:41.680]   But--
[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:45.560]   - The only reason I still have a Twitter account is,
[02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:47.440]   'cause my wife says, "You have to retweet this."
[02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:48.760]   I said, "Okay, fine."
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:51.880]   So every time I do, invariably somebody say,
[02:14:51.880 --> 02:14:53.520]   "Oh, are you back on Twitter?"
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:54.360]   No.
[02:14:54.360 --> 02:14:55.760]   (laughs)
[02:14:55.760 --> 02:14:57.400]   I am not.
[02:14:57.400 --> 02:14:59.680]   To show you how successful TikTok is,
[02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:01.840]   Amazon has announced that not only in their TVs,
[02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:04.880]   but Amazon Fire TV sticks and other devices
[02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:06.440]   will now have a TikTok channel.
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:10.480]   So you get your TikTok on your big screen.
[02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:12.880]   I don't feel like this is a good trend.
[02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:16.800]   I feel like this is encouraging short attention spans.
[02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:18.200]   - I don't know if people wanna watch
[02:15:18.200 --> 02:15:20.000]   TikTok on a bigger screen either, right?
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.560]   - Oh, it belongs on the vertical thing, yeah.
[02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:23.400]   - Right.
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:29.880]   - What do Florida, Texas, and Brazil have in common?
[02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:34.040]   All three have passed laws banning social networks
[02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:38.400]   from removing posts from politicians.
[02:15:41.840 --> 02:15:44.040]   Texas Governor just signed the bill,
[02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:46.160]   Governor Abbott prohibiting social media giants
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:48.720]   from blocking users based on viewpoint.
[02:15:48.720 --> 02:15:50.480]   I mentioned earlier,
[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:55.480]   I think that the Florida law has been paused by the courts.
[02:15:55.480 --> 02:15:58.880]   Maybe the same thing will happen in Texas.
[02:15:58.880 --> 02:16:01.400]   I'm thinking Bolsonaro probably doesn't have to worry
[02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:02.640]   about that so much.
[02:16:02.640 --> 02:16:09.000]   They don't have a First Amendment though.
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:10.600]   See, that's the difference.
[02:16:10.600 --> 02:16:14.960]   In the US, it's illegal for government to restrain
[02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:19.800]   or do anything about speech, not that they don't,
[02:16:19.800 --> 02:16:23.280]   but it's illegal, it's anti-conconstitutional.
[02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:25.960]   I don't think Brazil has the same kind of protections.
[02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:29.640]   He's also up for election next year,
[02:16:29.640 --> 02:16:31.720]   which might have something to do with it.
[02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:32.560]   - Yeah.
[02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:35.520]   - Let's see what else here.
[02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:40.040]   Kind of down to the bottom of the barrel,
[02:16:40.040 --> 02:16:42.840]   always some of the most exciting stuff down here.
[02:16:42.840 --> 02:16:46.160]   - Did you see Facebook's finally made the smart glasses,
[02:16:46.160 --> 02:16:47.200]   not look ridiculous?
[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:51.560]   - Oh, but they're just like the Snapchat spectacles.
[02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:55.120]   - Yeah, and then they tried to lose smart glasses.
[02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:58.000]   - They tried to claim that if you put tape over the light
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:16:59.120]   that indicates you're recording,
[02:16:59.120 --> 02:17:00.760]   that you're violating their terms of service,
[02:17:00.760 --> 02:17:01.840]   I don't know if you saw that.
[02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:02.840]   - Oh, please.
[02:17:02.840 --> 02:17:04.080]   - I did, I did.
[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:04.920]   - Yeah.
[02:17:04.920 --> 02:17:07.560]   - They don't know, the thing about the Snapchat spectacles,
[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:11.560]   it was very obvious you were wearing glasses with cameras.
[02:17:11.560 --> 02:17:15.120]   These are Ray bands, they look like regular sunglasses.
[02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:16.120]   - Yep.
[02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:16.960]   - Yeah.
[02:17:16.960 --> 02:17:18.520]   Well, it's interesting that you bring that up
[02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:20.480]   because I feel like something like this,
[02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:21.960]   no one's gonna wear it if it doesn't look
[02:17:21.960 --> 02:17:23.240]   like a normal pair of glasses,
[02:17:23.240 --> 02:17:24.840]   but at the same time,
[02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:26.720]   you do have to make it look distinct enough
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:28.240]   so that people know what it is
[02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:30.000]   and people know that this is a device
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:33.320]   that might possibly be recording.
[02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:37.840]   - Yeah, so it's just a, I think a weird kind of middle ground
[02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:40.760]   to balance and I don't know what the answer is for that.
[02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:42.080]   - Where's the light?
[02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:44.160]   Is it somewhere prominent?
[02:17:44.160 --> 02:17:46.480]   - Right above the camera, I think on the right side,
[02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:48.440]   there's a little white light that pops up
[02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:50.480]   and somebody took like a little bit of duct tape
[02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:51.720]   and painted it black.
[02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:53.960]   I think Buzzfeed asked Facebook about this
[02:17:53.960 --> 02:17:54.800]   and there's a reason.
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:56.440]   - That's illegal, you can't do that.
[02:17:56.440 --> 02:17:58.120]   We're gonna come and get you.
[02:17:58.120 --> 02:18:00.040]   - Yeah, I don't know what they're--
[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:01.640]   - You guys had seen it reviewed it.
[02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:04.080]   I don't know if you've played with them, Lisa or not yet.
[02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:06.520]   Are the image quality good?
[02:18:06.520 --> 02:18:08.520]   - So I haven't personally played with them yet,
[02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:10.560]   but it's not-- - 300 bucks, what?
[02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:12.240]   - Yeah, exactly, it's 300 bucks
[02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:14.160]   and it's not a pair of,
[02:18:14.160 --> 02:18:16.440]   it's not really the smart glasses that you think of
[02:18:16.440 --> 02:18:17.600]   when you think of smart glasses.
[02:18:17.600 --> 02:18:19.480]   There's no display, it's basically--
[02:18:19.480 --> 02:18:20.320]   - Just camera.
[02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:22.920]   - It's kind of like the echo frames and like the bows.
[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:25.000]   It's a cross between Snapchat spectacles
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:26.600]   and like the Amazon echo frames,
[02:18:26.600 --> 02:18:28.480]   except, you know, it's not, you know,
[02:18:28.480 --> 02:18:30.240]   obviously Amazon's is very much built
[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:31.880]   around Alexa and stuff like that,
[02:18:31.880 --> 02:18:34.000]   but this is really just built to,
[02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.880]   I think basically play music and kind of act like--
[02:18:36.880 --> 02:18:37.720]   - Oh, so they do have speakers.
[02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:40.160]   - Wireless earbuds, they have speakers, yes.
[02:18:40.160 --> 02:18:42.240]   And then there's the camera, of course,
[02:18:42.240 --> 02:18:44.840]   for taking photos and whatnot.
[02:18:44.840 --> 02:18:47.160]   - But there is no, there's no kind of heads up display,
[02:18:47.160 --> 02:18:49.360]   there's no information fed to you in any way.
[02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:50.840]   - I don't think so, no.
[02:18:50.840 --> 02:18:53.080]   I mean, again, I haven't used them,
[02:18:53.080 --> 02:18:55.920]   so I, you know, I can't say for sure,
[02:18:55.920 --> 02:18:57.760]   but I'm pretty sure that's not what these glasses
[02:18:57.760 --> 02:18:58.680]   are meant to be.
[02:18:58.680 --> 02:19:00.440]   If I see Scott Stein in the men's room,
[02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:01.760]   I'm gonna avoid him, I'm just saying,
[02:19:01.760 --> 02:19:03.960]   especially, I'm just wearing these.
[02:19:03.960 --> 02:19:05.280]   The pictures actually look pretty good.
[02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:08.040]   He took a lot of images with it,
[02:19:08.040 --> 02:19:10.160]   and they seem like they're okay.
[02:19:10.160 --> 02:19:12.000]   - I don't know.
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.480]   I feel like we were all worried about like a surveillance
[02:19:14.480 --> 02:19:17.080]   tape being ushered in with, you know, the iPhone.
[02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:19.560]   I remember this exact same conversation.
[02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:21.880]   - And Google Glass, of course, too, yeah.
[02:19:21.880 --> 02:19:23.280]   - And that as well, though,
[02:19:23.280 --> 02:19:25.360]   didn't have obviously as much breakthrough.
[02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:29.640]   And, you know, it's project veritas,
[02:19:29.640 --> 02:19:31.760]   and there've certainly been things
[02:19:31.760 --> 02:19:34.840]   like the Central Park dog walker situation.
[02:19:34.840 --> 02:19:36.600]   Like there certainly have been situations
[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:38.040]   where people have been caught on tape,
[02:19:38.040 --> 02:19:40.360]   and it's been awkward for them,
[02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:42.160]   but overall, I feel-- - Oh, you feel--
[02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:45.000]   - That's been like the story of the year.
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:46.880]   I mean-- - I've had people
[02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:50.000]   secretly record me, yeah, and record it.
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.640]   But I don't know if this-- - On the one balance,
[02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:54.000]   is it a pro or a con?
[02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:57.360]   - I mean, if you're a teenager these days,
[02:19:57.360 --> 02:19:59.440]   I would be terrified that, you know,
[02:19:59.440 --> 02:20:02.960]   I'm completely out of control of my persona
[02:20:02.960 --> 02:20:05.560]   because every other teenager has a camera.
[02:20:05.560 --> 02:20:07.200]   I can't do anything.
[02:20:07.200 --> 02:20:10.760]   On the other hand, man, it's changed policing in America.
[02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:13.000]   Thank goodness. - Yeah.
[02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:14.260]   - Is it a pro or a con?
[02:20:14.260 --> 02:20:17.040]   - I think there's pros and cons.
[02:20:17.040 --> 02:20:19.440]   I mean, I think that's the case with any kind of technology.
[02:20:19.440 --> 02:20:21.800]   Like if there's a use for it, it's progress, right?
[02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:24.280]   But also, there's a lot of downsides to it.
[02:20:24.280 --> 02:20:26.240]   There's a lot of things that you need to be careful about.
[02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:28.320]   And I feel like in more recent years,
[02:20:28.320 --> 02:20:29.640]   especially with social media,
[02:20:29.640 --> 02:20:32.000]   we've seen that sometimes we realize
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:33.840]   what those downsides are way too late
[02:20:33.840 --> 02:20:35.720]   and we spend years trying to course correct.
[02:20:35.720 --> 02:20:38.360]   And instead of thinking about some of these,
[02:20:38.360 --> 02:20:41.680]   you know, possible, like, you know, bad situations
[02:20:41.680 --> 02:20:44.120]   from the ground up, which is difficult.
[02:20:44.120 --> 02:20:47.000]   But yeah, I mean, I think there's pros and cons, you know,
[02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:47.840]   for sure. - Yeah.
[02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:51.280]   - Oh my goodness, time flies.
[02:20:51.280 --> 02:20:52.120]   What else?
[02:20:52.120 --> 02:20:56.720]   El Salvador, it's official.
[02:20:56.720 --> 02:20:59.760]   Bitcoin is their official currency.
[02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:04.080]   They bought 200 Bitcoin a day before their Bitcoin law
[02:21:04.080 --> 02:21:06.400]   became effective and we'll be buying much more.
[02:21:06.400 --> 02:21:09.400]   And of course, how does the price of Bitcoin respond?
[02:21:09.400 --> 02:21:10.300]   It drops.
[02:21:10.300 --> 02:21:12.440]   - Precipitously.
[02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:17.360]   - I don't even understand how this works.
[02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:18.760]   I don't even understand how a country
[02:21:18.760 --> 02:21:21.480]   could use Bitcoin instead of dollars,
[02:21:21.480 --> 02:21:23.680]   which El Salvador used to use.
[02:21:23.680 --> 02:21:26.320]   It's their legal tender.
[02:21:26.320 --> 02:21:30.400]   They're gonna use the chevow e-wall
[02:21:30.400 --> 02:21:32.680]   it preloaded with $30 a Bitcoin
[02:21:32.680 --> 02:21:34.280]   for everybody who downloads it.
[02:21:34.280 --> 02:21:40.480]   - I just, I don't, I don't,
[02:21:40.480 --> 02:21:42.560]   it's for gonna be an interesting experiment.
[02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:46.440]   - Nothing is-- - I feel old.
[02:21:46.440 --> 02:21:48.000]   Any time NFTs and Bitcoin,
[02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.200]   yeah, yeah. - I feel old and confused
[02:21:50.200 --> 02:21:52.360]   and I'm trying my best to understand it,
[02:21:52.360 --> 02:21:54.000]   but I'm not doing a very good job.
[02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.160]   - That's all right, it's not for you.
[02:21:56.160 --> 02:21:57.560]   - Yeah, I know it is.
[02:21:57.560 --> 02:22:00.320]   (both laughing)
[02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:04.600]   - I get it, I get it, but the NFTs in particular,
[02:22:04.600 --> 02:22:06.160]   I'm still trying to get my head to her head.
[02:22:06.160 --> 02:22:08.960]   - I know, I'm very pessimistic on NFTs.
[02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:11.240]   I have made back a good chunk of the money
[02:22:11.240 --> 02:22:14.240]   I spent on my 3090 doing a theory mining.
[02:22:14.240 --> 02:22:15.880]   - There you go.
[02:22:15.880 --> 02:22:19.280]   - My daughter's all about issuing her artwork as NFTs.
[02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:22.840]   You know, we've had Kevin Rose on the show.
[02:22:22.840 --> 02:22:25.960]   He owns, we talked about that was going on in the show.
[02:22:25.960 --> 02:22:27.760]   He has one of the very first NFTs
[02:22:27.760 --> 02:22:29.400]   which are these crypto punks.
[02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:32.760]   He has a crypto punk.
[02:22:32.760 --> 02:22:35.480]   I don't know how much he bought it for,
[02:22:35.480 --> 02:22:38.500]   not much 'cause he got it in the early days.
[02:22:38.500 --> 02:22:42.880]   It's worth more than $4 million now.
[02:22:42.880 --> 02:22:44.640]   All it is is an icon.
[02:22:45.640 --> 02:22:47.200]   So that's amazing to me.
[02:22:47.200 --> 02:22:49.200]   That's just amazing to me.
[02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:51.440]   - Yeah, it's an icon.
[02:22:51.440 --> 02:22:53.400]   Apparently he got the right one, I guess,
[02:22:53.400 --> 02:22:55.120]   which is the smiling zombie.
[02:22:55.120 --> 02:22:58.160]   (both laughing)
[02:22:58.160 --> 02:23:00.280]   What do you own when you own one of these?
[02:23:00.280 --> 02:23:02.200]   Just, well, here's the good news.
[02:23:02.200 --> 02:23:03.880]   You get it on the ground floor.
[02:23:03.880 --> 02:23:06.440]   I'm here $400,000.
[02:23:06.440 --> 02:23:10.440]   And you too can own something, I don't know what,
[02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:13.320]   a URL that points to this image.
[02:23:14.400 --> 02:23:16.480]   I just feel like this is one of those stories.
[02:23:16.480 --> 02:23:17.840]   I wish I had a fast forward button
[02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:21.280]   to see what the outcome of this popular is.
[02:23:21.280 --> 02:23:22.120]   (both laughing)
[02:23:22.120 --> 02:23:25.360]   Because I suspect there's gonna be some downfall.
[02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:28.240]   - I think the trick is to get off this pyramid scheme
[02:23:28.240 --> 02:23:30.880]   before everybody else does, right?
[02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:34.040]   - Yeah, it all seems so speculative and hard to make.
[02:23:34.040 --> 02:23:34.880]   - Yeah.
[02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:36.240]   - Well, that's exactly what it is.
[02:23:36.240 --> 02:23:38.800]   You have capital and they've got to put it somewhere.
[02:23:38.800 --> 02:23:41.840]   I mean, normal people don't have $400,000
[02:23:41.840 --> 02:23:43.760]   to stick around for an NBA clip.
[02:23:43.760 --> 02:23:44.800]   You know what I mean?
[02:23:44.800 --> 02:23:48.440]   - I'd really like to know why this crypto punk
[02:23:48.440 --> 02:23:51.280]   is worth $280,000.
[02:23:51.280 --> 02:23:53.280]   But this crypto punk down at the bottom,
[02:23:53.280 --> 02:23:56.160]   they're sorted, I've sorted them by value,
[02:23:56.160 --> 02:24:00.920]   this crypto punk at the bottom is worth $3.4 million.
[02:24:00.920 --> 02:24:02.800]   It's just an icon.
[02:24:02.800 --> 02:24:05.560]   I don't understand it.
[02:24:05.560 --> 02:24:09.480]   - I mean, I like them, but I don't like them
[02:24:09.480 --> 02:24:12.400]   $342 million worth of money.
[02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:13.720]   - Right.
[02:24:13.720 --> 02:24:15.880]   - So actually some of these are worth billions of dollars.
[02:24:15.880 --> 02:24:19.440]   I guess that's just, that's maybe aspiration.
[02:24:19.440 --> 02:24:20.280]   That's aspiration.
[02:24:20.280 --> 02:24:21.120]   - Good luck.
[02:24:21.120 --> 02:24:23.320]   (laughing)
[02:24:23.320 --> 02:24:26.440]   - Good luck finding a venture capital firm
[02:24:26.440 --> 02:24:28.880]   that's gonna pay you $1 million.
[02:24:28.880 --> 02:24:32.160]   I don't know if you saw this scandal, Leo,
[02:24:32.160 --> 02:24:35.000]   but there's been a recent price fixing scheme
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.120]   in the video game industry,
[02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:39.640]   where I don't know if you saw the story a while back
[02:24:39.640 --> 02:24:42.840]   with a copy of Super Mario 64 being sold
[02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:44.480]   for a million dollars.
[02:24:44.480 --> 02:24:45.320]   - Yes.
[02:24:45.320 --> 02:24:47.440]   - Everybody was like, wait a minute,
[02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:50.000]   that was not an uncommon game.
[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:51.280]   There are gonna be a lot of those,
[02:24:51.280 --> 02:24:53.120]   or still new in box.
[02:24:53.120 --> 02:24:54.600]   What's going on here?
[02:24:54.600 --> 02:24:57.720]   And there was a YouTuber that did an ex-buzzet.
[02:24:57.720 --> 02:25:00.600]   It turns out that it looks very likely
[02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:02.240]   that there's a bunch of price fixing
[02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:04.680]   between the people that grade the games
[02:25:04.680 --> 02:25:06.360]   and the people that are selling the games.
[02:25:06.360 --> 02:25:09.640]   - So somebody got scammed, I guess the buyer.
[02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:13.640]   - Well, it's a scheme to make the entire vintage game
[02:25:13.640 --> 02:25:17.760]   in the street pure more valuable than it really is.
[02:25:17.760 --> 02:25:19.640]   - I'm holding on to those beanie babies,
[02:25:19.640 --> 02:25:21.680]   they're gonna be worth something someday.
[02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:23.920]   - I believe in you.
[02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:25.560]   - I know it, I just know it.
[02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:28.040]   It's gonna happen.
[02:25:28.040 --> 02:25:30.440]   I don't know what to think about this week.
[02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:31.920]   The news came out this week
[02:25:31.920 --> 02:25:36.280]   that the Los Angeles Police Department on routine stops,
[02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:38.280]   even if you're not being arrested,
[02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:40.320]   will interview you.
[02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:41.520]   That's what the police call it
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:43.560]   when they're asking you questions.
[02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:45.240]   And try to fill out this.
[02:25:45.240 --> 02:25:47.720]   This is the interview card they're provided with.
[02:25:47.720 --> 02:25:49.480]   Name, sure.
[02:25:49.480 --> 02:25:52.080]   Data birth, sex, gang, moniker.
[02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:53.320]   Okay, fine.
[02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:57.680]   Plus, full, e-mail, social media accounts,
[02:25:57.680 --> 02:26:01.320]   e.g. Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, et cetera.
[02:26:01.320 --> 02:26:04.280]   They're collecting information
[02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:07.440]   about your social media accounts.
[02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:08.760]   You haven't been arrested.
[02:26:08.760 --> 02:26:12.840]   But the worst thing to me is this,
[02:26:12.840 --> 02:26:14.400]   they're pretending it says,
[02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:16.560]   "If a social security number is requested,
[02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:18.920]   the following disclaimer must be read,
[02:26:18.920 --> 02:26:22.200]   federal law requires that you be informed
[02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:24.360]   when asked for your social security number
[02:26:24.360 --> 02:26:27.360]   that it must be provided for use in identification."
[02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:31.440]   That's exactly not what federal law requires.
[02:26:31.440 --> 02:26:33.200]   That's the exact opposite.
[02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:37.000]   Why are they collecting social security numbers
[02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:38.920]   and Twitter handles?
[02:26:38.920 --> 02:26:39.760]   It's a--
[02:26:39.760 --> 02:26:41.120]   - Did they comment?
[02:26:41.120 --> 02:26:41.960]   - Pardon me?
[02:26:41.960 --> 02:26:44.480]   - Did they comment anywhere to the media
[02:26:44.480 --> 02:26:45.920]   and try to find a media--
[02:26:45.920 --> 02:26:48.080]   - All they said was,
[02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:49.800]   we're gonna update our policy.
[02:26:49.800 --> 02:26:52.060]   (laughing)
[02:26:52.060 --> 02:26:57.720]   Meanwhile, the Guardian talked to a professor of law at Loyola,
[02:26:57.720 --> 02:27:00.160]   Kathleen Kim, she's an immigrant's rights expert,
[02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:03.920]   previously served on the LA Police Commission.
[02:27:03.920 --> 02:27:05.920]   She says she was not aware of any law
[02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:07.520]   requiring individuals to disclose
[02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:09.840]   social security numbers to local police.
[02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:11.640]   She also says she was shocked to learn
[02:27:11.640 --> 02:27:13.520]   about the social security section,
[02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:15.320]   noting that that is antithetical
[02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:17.460]   to the department's own policies.
[02:27:17.460 --> 02:27:23.120]   And it violates the spirit of sanctuary laws.
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:25.680]   So that's what they're trying to figure out,
[02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:26.800]   are you a citizen?
[02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:33.140]   And can we deport you?
[02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:36.640]   Anyway, I don't know what to make of that,
[02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:38.480]   I'm just glad I'm not in that way.
[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:41.720]   - I would not give a cop my--
[02:27:41.720 --> 02:27:43.560]   - I think you just say I don't have Twitter.
[02:27:43.560 --> 02:27:44.400]   - I don't know. - I don't know.
[02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:45.720]   - I don't know what's that.
[02:27:45.720 --> 02:27:47.360]   - I posed about BLM,
[02:27:47.360 --> 02:27:49.760]   I would not give them that information.
[02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:52.400]   - And good news.
[02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:54.640]   - I also feel like in general, it's like, I don't know,
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:57.920]   I operate under the approach of like,
[02:27:57.920 --> 02:27:59.760]   no matter who I'm giving information to,
[02:27:59.760 --> 02:28:01.000]   give as little as possible,
[02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.520]   because I just going back to what we were talking about
[02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:05.200]   earlier about security and hacks,
[02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:07.280]   I just assume my information is everywhere
[02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:11.880]   and it's inevitable that your social security number
[02:28:11.880 --> 02:28:13.160]   is gonna be, you know--
[02:28:13.160 --> 02:28:14.680]   - Exactly what I was saying earlier.
[02:28:14.680 --> 02:28:16.960]   - Obtain, just give as little as possible,
[02:28:16.960 --> 02:28:18.360]   at least try to make it a bit harder
[02:28:18.360 --> 02:28:19.520]   for them to get my information.
[02:28:19.520 --> 02:28:21.720]   - I mean, after all, they can fingerprint you.
[02:28:21.720 --> 02:28:24.120]   I guess they have to arrest you before they can fingerprint you,
[02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:25.280]   though, that's the difference.
[02:28:25.280 --> 02:28:26.360]   This one, you're not arrested,
[02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:28.960]   they're just asking some questions.
[02:28:28.960 --> 02:28:30.520]   Just asking some questions.
[02:28:31.560 --> 02:28:33.480]   All right, I think we should wrap this up,
[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:35.920]   because I'm sure there's a football game to go to
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:37.320]   or something like that.
[02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:39.080]   A Porsche, there's Porsches to be driven,
[02:28:39.080 --> 02:28:41.280]   Princess Peach vines to be jumped.
[02:28:41.280 --> 02:28:42.680]   - I got aliens to kill them.
[02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:44.080]   - Got aliens to kill.
[02:28:44.080 --> 02:28:47.200]   Now you got a new buddy to kill aliens with.
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:52.120]   See, we're making friends all the way around here.
[02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:54.040]   Carl Bodie, thank you so much.
[02:28:54.040 --> 02:28:55.560]   Your first Twit, not your last,
[02:28:55.560 --> 02:28:56.520]   it was really great to have you.
[02:28:56.520 --> 02:29:00.320]   Tech reporter, you'll see him everywhere,
[02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:01.760]   including Vice motherboard.
[02:29:01.760 --> 02:29:02.640]   I love motherboard.
[02:29:02.640 --> 02:29:04.400]   I think they do a great job.
[02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:06.480]   Tech Dirt, I love even more.
[02:29:06.480 --> 02:29:10.240]   The Verge, so nice to have you, Carl.
[02:29:10.240 --> 02:29:11.440]   Really appreciate it.
[02:29:11.440 --> 02:29:12.280]   Anything you can grab me.
[02:29:12.280 --> 02:29:13.120]   - Anything you can grab me.
[02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:14.640]   Anything you want to plug?
[02:29:14.640 --> 02:29:16.240]   - I'll have a newsletter probably this winter,
[02:29:16.240 --> 02:29:17.920]   'cause I have to go down that train
[02:29:17.920 --> 02:29:20.200]   before everybody's disposable income runs out
[02:29:20.200 --> 02:29:22.360]   in terms of how many newsletters they can subscribe to.
[02:29:22.360 --> 02:29:25.640]   - Newsletters are the NFTs of Sovereign Writers.
[02:29:25.640 --> 02:29:26.480]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:27.320]   - Something.
[02:29:27.320 --> 02:29:28.840]   - So this winter I'll have one of those.
[02:29:28.840 --> 02:29:29.760]   - Good.
[02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:32.440]   - All right, on Substack or do you know where he'll be?
[02:29:32.440 --> 02:29:33.720]   - I'm still talking to different people
[02:29:33.720 --> 02:29:35.160]   to set up my options.
[02:29:35.160 --> 02:29:37.480]   - Good, well, we have to have you back
[02:29:37.480 --> 02:29:40.840]   as soon as you started so we can tell people where to go.
[02:29:40.840 --> 02:29:41.680]   - Awesome.
[02:29:41.680 --> 02:29:43.880]   - Lisa Adichiko, senior editor at CNET,
[02:29:43.880 --> 02:29:45.160]   what are you working on these days?
[02:29:45.160 --> 02:29:47.600]   I guess you're gonna be busy on Tuesday, I'm thinking.
[02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:50.640]   - Oh yes, Tuesday is gonna be a very busy day.
[02:29:50.640 --> 02:29:51.480]   (laughs)
[02:29:51.480 --> 02:29:52.320]   - Yikes.
[02:29:52.320 --> 02:29:53.160]   - Yeah.
[02:29:53.160 --> 02:29:55.520]   - Do you think there's any chance at all
[02:29:55.520 --> 02:29:58.520]   that Google will announce the Pixel 6 tomorrow?
[02:29:59.520 --> 02:30:00.880]   - I don't know, honestly.
[02:30:00.880 --> 02:30:01.960]   - Should I get up early?
[02:30:01.960 --> 02:30:03.200]   - It's hard to say.
[02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:06.520]   - Should I jump from my Casper and run to the Twitter
[02:30:06.520 --> 02:30:10.480]   and see if there's a Pixel 6 I can order?
[02:30:10.480 --> 02:30:11.880]   - Yeah, I don't know, honestly.
[02:30:11.880 --> 02:30:15.320]   I am not sure exactly when that's gonna happen, but--
[02:30:15.320 --> 02:30:18.000]   - No it is, they're really obfuscating the fact.
[02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:19.760]   - They're really making it very vague,
[02:30:19.760 --> 02:30:21.960]   but it will be sometime soon, I'm sure.
[02:30:21.960 --> 02:30:22.800]   So.
[02:30:22.800 --> 02:30:24.280]   - Good, it's nice to see you.
[02:30:24.280 --> 02:30:25.320]   I really appreciate your coming from--
[02:30:25.320 --> 02:30:26.720]   - Yeah, it's so great to be back.
[02:30:26.720 --> 02:30:28.080]   - Sorry, it's been so long.
[02:30:28.080 --> 02:30:29.800]   - The last time you were here, you were a business insider,
[02:30:29.800 --> 02:30:31.440]   so it's good to have you--
[02:30:31.440 --> 02:30:32.280]   - Yeah.
[02:30:32.280 --> 02:30:34.000]   - Your new gig, it's seen it, nice to see you.
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:35.560]   - Yes, absolutely.
[02:30:35.560 --> 02:30:38.520]   - And of course, the lady in the red beret,
[02:30:38.520 --> 02:30:40.720]   Brianna Wu, executive director.
[02:30:40.720 --> 02:30:42.280]   - I'm gonna wear this for now.
[02:30:42.280 --> 02:30:43.920]   - I love it, man.
[02:30:43.920 --> 02:30:47.280]   You look, I mean, it's just, it looks like,
[02:30:47.280 --> 02:30:51.080]   it looks like you're auditioning for,
[02:30:51.080 --> 02:30:52.320]   no, I shouldn't say it.
[02:30:52.320 --> 02:30:54.040]   I'm not gonna say it, what I was gonna say,
[02:30:54.040 --> 02:30:55.800]   I shouldn't say it.
[02:30:55.800 --> 02:31:00.520]   - I look like a drama, a drama kid that, yes, there we go.
[02:31:00.520 --> 02:31:04.720]   - No, I thought maybe you might be running
[02:31:04.720 --> 02:31:07.120]   for the lead in impeachment or something like that.
[02:31:07.120 --> 02:31:08.960]   (laughing)
[02:31:08.960 --> 02:31:10.560]   I shouldn't, that would be rude to say that.
[02:31:10.560 --> 02:31:11.400]   I'm not gonna say it.
[02:31:11.400 --> 02:31:12.240]   - There we go.
[02:31:12.240 --> 02:31:15.240]   - Executive director, rebellionpack.com,
[02:31:15.240 --> 02:31:16.520]   rebellionpack.com.
[02:31:16.520 --> 02:31:17.800]   - Dot com, there you go.
[02:31:17.800 --> 02:31:19.520]   So if you're worried about the midterms,
[02:31:19.520 --> 02:31:22.280]   feel free to go to helptherebellion.com.
[02:31:22.280 --> 02:31:25.280]   I always say yes when Leo calls me and asks me to come on
[02:31:25.280 --> 02:31:27.920]   because y'all are so generous in helping me out
[02:31:27.920 --> 02:31:29.080]   with whatever I'm doing.
[02:31:29.080 --> 02:31:30.320]   So you can do that at help the room.
[02:31:30.320 --> 02:31:31.320]   - Help her out.
[02:31:31.320 --> 02:31:33.880]   And I know you have Carson working with you over there,
[02:31:33.880 --> 02:31:34.720]   which is great.
[02:31:34.720 --> 02:31:35.560]   - Yes, that's true.
[02:31:35.560 --> 02:31:36.640]   - Glad to hear it.
[02:31:36.640 --> 02:31:38.840]   - I gotta tell you, he is a workhorse.
[02:31:38.840 --> 02:31:40.840]   He did so much amazing work.
[02:31:40.840 --> 02:31:44.640]   We have a data scientist who actually reached out to us
[02:31:44.640 --> 02:31:48.480]   because she saw me on Twitch and asked to do some analytics
[02:31:48.480 --> 02:31:51.640]   for us, so she's handing me a data proposal tomorrow.
[02:31:51.640 --> 02:31:54.360]   It's always worth coming on, Leo, one way or the other.
[02:31:54.360 --> 02:31:56.840]   Plug away, rebellionpack.
[02:31:56.840 --> 02:31:58.840]   I'm scared about the midterms.
[02:31:58.840 --> 02:32:01.560]   We got our own election coming up Tuesday.
[02:32:01.560 --> 02:32:03.320]   I'm a little scared about that.
