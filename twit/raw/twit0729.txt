[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340]   It's time for Twit this weekend tech father Robert Ballas.
[00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.600]   They're back from Nevada,

[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.560]   Today we've got a lot to talk about, including Apple.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.040]   They just spent a billion dollars.
[00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.520]   You won't believe what they got for that money.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.680]   The house has finally passed an anti-Robo call bill.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.880]   And Google wants your face.
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.280]   Would you take $5?

[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.480]   the show where we cover the week's Tech News
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.040]   with some of the most interesting people in technology,
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.360]   journalism.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.920]   I don't know how I would categorize
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.520]   Father Robert Baliser.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.640]   The digital Jesuit.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.600]   Down here, we're down here.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.680]   Oh, hey.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.240]   I know everything up there is more important,
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.200]   but we're down here.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.400]   I've been away for so long.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.320]   I forgot how this works.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.240]   Yeah, look at the camera and say hello, everybody.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.920]   Robert is detailed out to the Vatican right now,
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.760]   but we are glad to have him.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.480]   What brings you to the US?
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.560]   Every once in a while, they let us go away.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.280]   Travel.
[00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.240]   And August is a big thing.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.240]   Let you or make you?
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.800]   Well, no, they allow us to.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.080]   Oh, because it's so hot.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.880]   August is terrible in Rome.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.160]   It's hot, it's humid, and the wind that blows
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.320]   comes over Africa, so it's sandy.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.920]   So you get sandy grit in your hair.
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.600]   And everyone just decides that this
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.440]   is when they're going to take that.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.560]   That's the Shirocco.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.480]   The Shirocco wins.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.240]   Yes.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.320]   Wow.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.840]   Well, welcome.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.840]   So nice to have you.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.400]   Also with us, Lisa Schmeiser from the fabulous IT
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.800]   pro today where she edits.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.120]   How do you survive?
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.800]   How do you survive enterprise journalism?
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.560]   I feel like it's the first draft of tech journalism history,
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.680]   to be honest, because it's the intersection
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.880]   of so many different industries and technology.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.080]   And you get a chance to see how these technologies are
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.920]   changing the way people do their jobs,
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.440]   people work, and how businesses and societies are
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.720]   structured as a whole.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.720]   Preach.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.720]   Preach.
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.920]   Yeah, you're also in enterprise.
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.400]   Oh, yes.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.400]   If you think about cloud that started first in enterprise.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.840]   Right now it's--
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.560]   Yes, that was about 2016, 2007.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.000]   So I guess I see what you're saying.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.320]   You're kind of the leading edge of stuff
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.800]   that will eventually become consumer-type.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.200]   I think another good example that's happening right now
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.160]   is IBM and other companies are keeping
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.160]   an eye on global supply chains.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.400]   And their idea is to help streamline
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.960]   and to make more efficient the movement of, say,
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.240]   lettuce from the field to a Walmart shelf.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.280]   Interesting.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.520]   And this will affect so many different industries
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.360]   in so many different ways.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.200]   It's not just a matter of being able to tag ahead of lettuce
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.480]   and know what farm it comes from.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.080]   You're also now affecting the way things are harvested,
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.280]   the way food is processed, the way it's shipped,
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.360]   the way it gets onto shelves, how it's tracked,
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.560]   how it's regulated.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.080]   And so when you see these technologies being rolled out,
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.720]   there's just so many stories you can follow on it.
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.800]   OK, you make a good case, but Lexi and I just care about
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.600]   with the next iPhones.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.760]   Oh, that's right.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.880]   That's all about your latest greatest.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.000]   Lexi Savitas, it's great to have you first time
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.160]   on Senior Editor at CNET where she covers the good stuff.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.080]   Consumer tech.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.760]   All the fun stuff.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.960]   I like to call it the fun stuff.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.680]   Anyway, it's stuff I love, live and breathe.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.120]   So new phones, new gadgets, helping you find and buy
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.320]   the latest and greatest.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.560]   Or they're not so latest and greatest as the case might be.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.640]   Yeah, people are always asking me, what phone should I get?
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.440]   I don't want to spend $1,000.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.320]   That's the number one question I get on the radio show.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.920]   Lexi is, you might detect from down under,
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.280]   but you live here in the Bay Area.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.320]   I do, I didn't fly in this morning, don't worry.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.280]   I've been here a little while.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.320]   No, there are some people who flew in this morning
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.040]   in the studio, though, and they're a little groggy.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.880]   I think it's called Robert Bales here.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.560]   When did you get here?
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.120]   I got here about a day and a half ago.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.640]   Yeah, I'm--
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.560]   So you're still on-- it's 5 o'clock.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.200]   Roll me around.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.720]   5 p.m.
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.240]   For me, right?
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.400]   Oh, well, that's not too bad.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.800]   OK, can we get a plate of pasta for Father Robert?
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.680]   It's his favorite.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.600]   They can feel it all.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.440]   No Italian food while I'm in the States.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.440]   So big story of the week, the DOJ says,
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.800]   yes, to the Sprint T-Mobile merger.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.640]   It's not completely over.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.960]   FCC said yes.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:36.080]   DOJ had a lot of restrictions and caveats and requirements.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.600]   Looks like they're on board now.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.800]   Now it's just down to a handful, maybe a dozen or so,
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.680]   state attorneys general who have been suing,
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.480]   because as everybody was concerned,
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.560]   the lack of competition losing an entire carrier.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.040]   But that's what makes this deal, I think,
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.880]   the most interesting.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.520]   The requirement of the Department of Justice
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.720]   was that Sprint and T-Mobile give their businesses
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.600]   boost mobile and Metro PCS to dish the dish network.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.960]   Yeah, the satellite company, dish
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.160]   has been over the last 10 years buying and not using
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.560]   Spectrum.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.480]   Charlie Jurgen, who runs dish, is quite an iconic class.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.680]   Fascinating guy, there was a great piece in the Wall Street
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.640]   Journal this week about Charlie.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.160]   He was a professional poker player.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.360]   And in fact, so good at card counting,
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.240]   he was banned from many Vegas casinos.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.720]   They wouldn't let him play blackjack.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.920]   It's not illegal, but they don't like it.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:34.360]   He then partnered with his buddy.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.680]   They put in $60,000 in 1980 to create a big satellite dish
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.920]   company, a 10-foot dish satellite company in Denver,
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.360]   eventually came up with these smaller hubcap sized dishes,
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.880]   the dish network they launched, satellites competing
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.160]   with cable operators successfully.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.880]   His $60,000 investment is now worth $9 billion.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.400]   He's a very wealthy fellow.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.280]   And I've always thought the poker player tells you
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.560]   a lot about who Charlie Jurgen is.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.600]   I met him when we were doing tech TV
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:07.960]   because he invited me to Denver to do it.
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.240]   He has a show on a dish called Charlie Chat.
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:10.720]   At least he did.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.800]   I don't know if he still is.
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.200]   And I met him and I was really impressed.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.800]   Here's the thing I kind of come away with,
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.080]   especially after reading this piece
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.640]   and what I know about Charlie.
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.320]   We are lucky.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.960]   We live in a world where there are some of these kind
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.800]   of crazy guys like Elon Musk, maybe Jeff Bezos
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.640]   would be one of those who are willing to bet the farm,
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.240]   go all in to use a poker turn, push the chips all in
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.400]   on something that is really a risky bet.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.440]   And this is exactly what dish is about to do.
[00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:43.440]   To launch a new cell phone network in 2019.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.160]   What do you think, Lexi?
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.280]   - Well, I think that the team bubble in Sprint merger
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.440]   has sort of been one of those like,
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.160]   will they, won't they, romance this?
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.000]   - This is the third time, right?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.640]   - This is the third time that this is trying to go through.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.120]   To actually see it come to fruition,
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.920]   I mean, I think this is probably gonna be the final one.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.400]   And hopefully it is gonna actually come to their fruits.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.360]   - Do you think it's a good thing for people?
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.160]   Or do you think competition will be suffered?
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.320]   - This is a really interesting one,
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.960]   because if you look at the history of Sprint
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:12.640]   and its decisions and how it got to this point so far,
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.640]   it's made a lot of missteps along the way.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.080]   And I think that this had to happen in order to--
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.240]   - It's a very kind way of putting it.
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.320]   - Oh, you're all missteps, exactly.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.440]   This really had to happen.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.840]   And team bubble obviously is very, very aggressive
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.120]   in how it's trying to go on a customer's.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.560]   And it is a partnership that I guess is really gonna work
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.040]   out well because Sprint has what team mobile needs
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.920]   in terms of a spectrum.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.920]   They're really gonna complement each other in this way.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.040]   So I think it is going to be a formidable force
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.800]   to the big two if it's done correctly.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.640]   And if they can attract new customers
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.360]   rather than just keep the existing base
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.360]   that they already have.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.560]   - It will make the merged companies as big as,
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.240]   roughly as big as AT&T Verizon.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.880]   We'll have three big period though.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.240]   - That's on paper.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.200]   And yes, so what team mobile gets out of this deal
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.520]   is they get spectrum and they've been hurting for spectrum.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.800]   The problem is it's not all the right spectrum.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.520]   Sprint owns a lot of spectrum throughout the country,
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.880]   but a lot of it was from that failed pseudo 4G one.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.680]   - One man. - Exactly.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.680]   - And which works well, but it uses up a ton of power.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.200]   It does not penetrate buildings.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.960]   And so yes, you're picking up a big pile of spectrum.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.120]   Not all of it is gonna be usable by every device.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.960]   So like you said, they have to do this very carefully.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.520]   They cannot pitch themselves as,
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.160]   hey, we're just like AT&T and Verizon now.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.840]   It has to be, no, we're still a disruptive player.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.920]   We're just bigger combined.
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.280]   - I'd like to know how they're gonna handle
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.680]   customer expectations 'cause you've got two things going on.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.360]   You're going to have people who use the merger
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.440]   as any excuse to get mad at the company
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.960]   because well, when I was with team mobile,
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.520]   this is what happened since they've merged,
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.240]   they've been unresponsive.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.280]   So that's going to be, a merger is a great engine
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.560]   for customer dissatisfaction.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.000]   And the second big thing is 5G is rolling out.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.520]   So they're gonna be tasked with trying to merge
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.320]   two organizations, keep their customers going,
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.360]   please their investors and figure out
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.680]   how to position themselves in a market
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.200]   where customers are already saying,
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.560]   I'm not really happy, we're all moving to 5G anyway.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.560]   That's in it for me to stay with you.
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.920]   - The big winner if you ask me is dish.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.920]   And again, this is a gamble of a lifetime.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.000]   I mean, this is gonna cost him $10 billion
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.320]   to do the build out that he needs,
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.400]   but he has this spectrum.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:28.080]   He's been kind of quietly and not always
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.800]   to the delight of the FCC or the other carriers
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.440]   buying up this spectrum.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.000]   He owns some very juicy spectrum.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.200]   He, the opportunity, he was in a sense,
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.320]   in fact there's a great quote from him
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.000]   in this Wall Street Journal piece.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.600]   He said, I wasn't gonna build an LTE network
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.280]   'cause I'd have to tear it down in a year.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:51.040]   It's much better to start at 5G.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.560]   And so that's kind of what he's getting to do.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:56.280]   And isn't it historically,
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.880]   isn't it always better to not have legacy,
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.040]   but to be able to start with a clean slate
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:01.880]   and doing a new technology.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.000]   - We saw that in Africa when they started doing the rollout.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.680]   In several generations past what we did,
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.840]   we've seen that in a large part of Asia.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.320]   And what dish gets here is,
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.280]   yes, they've already built up their spectrum,
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.640]   but just like Sprint and T-Mobile, it's spotty.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.880]   But since T-Mobile is gonna have to sell over their smaller,
[00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.600]   their MVNO's, what dish we'll get is the ability
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.560]   to put those patches together
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.880]   through other carriers network.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.640]   - I don't think this even wants the MVNO's.
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:32.560]   They're doing this to satisfy the requirements of the FCC
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:35.680]   and the DOJ said, "You've gotta have a sell carrier
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.520]   "up and running next year."
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.720]   Otherwise, it was a big fine.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.480]   So they're gonna, this is kind of a stop gap.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.760]   I don't think they care about boost.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.320]   I don't think they care about a Metro.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.560]   They really care about 5G.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.640]   In fact, Ergin says wireless pricing is broken.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.760]   US carriers have people paying for unlimited data plans.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:53.840]   They don't need.
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.400]   He says, "That's just like the cable companies
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.920]   "that we disintermediated, forcing subscribers
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.160]   "to pay for bundles of TV channels."
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.960]   He says, "This is Deja Vu for us all over again."
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.920]   One of the things he wants to do is,
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.040]   and this is, so dish is gonna be the scrappy underdog,
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.680]   the T-Mobile. - They're the new T-Mobile.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.520]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.000]   - And one of the things he's gonna do is, for instance,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.880]   offer lower cost data at night in the middle of the night
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.160]   when nobody else is using it.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.440]   - Wait a minute, but we live in a 24/7 world.
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.640]   How is that pricing gonna work out?
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.440]   Are they gonna tie it to your location?
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.680]   - Yeah, I guess so.
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.200]   I mean, that's, you could do that technologically.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.120]   - He's gonna focus on businesses.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.040]   - So is he like a telecommuter who's home bases
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:31.880]   and another country business?
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:32.960]   - I don't think it's sweet for you.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.080]   - I think it really is more for businesses
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.560]   who might have a lot of connectivity they wanna do.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.000]   - Right, yeah.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.920]   - Just as right now, if you're charging an electric car,
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.080]   you charge in the middle of the night, right?
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:42.920]   - Yeah.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.720]   - So you might be, if there's a lot of data
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.160]   you need to download, you might do that
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:47.000]   in the middle of the night.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:47.840]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.560]   - The other thing he says, he sees automotive
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.920]   as a huge business.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.280]   5G, all the cars, new cars are gonna have 5G built in.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.320]   It's how autonomous vehicles are gonna communicate
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.160]   with one another.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.000]   - Yeah.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.360]   - I think there's a big opportunity for him.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.120]   Yes, a big risk, but he's gambling.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.720]   - That's a fixed wireless play.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.360]   Because fixed wireless, you can make it work
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.000]   at the times that you want it to work.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.960]   Both of us come from the enterprise world
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.240]   and yeah, there's times when you need massive amounts
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.640]   of bandwidth and that normally happens off hours.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.680]   - What I'm thinking is another one of the enterprise lessons
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.400]   that I've had is the person who establishes
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.600]   how things are done is the one who gets
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.160]   to effectively dictate the terms of the industry.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.760]   And so if he establishes the customer
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.000]   and the user experience for--
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.480]   - A brand new sector, 5G.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.440]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:35.280]   Then everybody else has, we've seen this with smartphones.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.240]   We've seen this with cloud-based apps.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.080]   We've seen the--
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.200]   - Yeah, look how Apple's dominated because in 2007,
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.800]   they said this is what a smartphone is.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.840]   This is how smartphones should work.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.000]   - I mean, and look at, although I love Google Apps
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.320]   and they use them a lot, but you have to admit
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.960]   that most of the metaphors that--
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:51.960]   - Started with Apple?
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.760]   - Well, they actually start with Microsoft too.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.080]   Microsoft Excel to do--
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.240]   - And they've done so well in mobile, haven't they?
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.760]   (laughing)
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.600]   - Lexi is--
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.440]   - That's why they're here.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:05.280]   - Is this gonna be as somebody buying,
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.320]   should I now say, oh, I'm gonna look at dishes,
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.840]   my next carrier?
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.320]   Or if I'm a T-Mobile customer, should I worry?
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.520]   If I'm a Sprint customer, why?
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.280]   - Well, this is gonna be interesting to see
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.200]   like the incentives that these carriers are gonna offer
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.120]   to both keep existing customers
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.200]   and then also to entice new people to switch.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.600]   I mean, T-Mobile and Sprint have both been really aggressive
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.320]   in terms of packaging deals,
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.880]   such as free Netflix subscriptions as a sweetener,
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.000]   you know, lots of bundles, cheaper rates.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.560]   And so I think dishes in a really unique position here
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.720]   to sort of to do one of two things.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.560]   To either go, yes, we're gonna offer bundles,
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.160]   we're gonna offer lots of discounts
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.680]   and try to entice you over,
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:45.080]   or they're gonna go completely the other way
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.200]   and just really be incredibly aggressive
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.640]   in trying to get new customers
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.760]   and just make it exactly as we were talking about,
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.680]   like having discounted rates of hours, you know,
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.760]   really things that the other carriers aren't doing
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.400]   to really differentiate themselves
[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.080]   and really give themselves a reason
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.920]   for people to switch over to them.
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:02.160]   - That could also be bad though,
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.360]   because we're starting to see the start of carriers
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.800]   that are also vertically integrated
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.680]   with distribution companies/content companies
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.200]   that are leveraging that vertical integration to say,
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:16.280]   hey, if you're on our network, you get X, Y, and Z for free.
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.800]   And we know you like Game of Thrones,
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.680]   or you're like, whatever's gonna come after Game of Thrones,
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.200]   you get that free through our bandwidth versus dish.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.040]   And the dish is gonna say,
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.320]   well, we've got agreements with so, so and so
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.120]   who have these shows that you love?
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:31.920]   And I really, I hate this idea of fragmenting content
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.920]   just because the carriers want to reason
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.040]   why you sign with them.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.920]   - Yeah, we're seeing that with podcasts.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:37.760]   - Oh, gosh, yes.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.240]   - With Spotify saying, we're gonna have exclusives Apple now,
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:42.840]   we're gonna have exclusives, that's bad for everybody.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.480]   That helps the companies maybe,
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.400]   but it doesn't help listeners at all.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.680]   - There has to be a tipping point though,
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.640]   because we sort of saw this with streaming services,
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.520]   maybe five, six years ago,
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.200]   when we had all of the competitors come out,
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.760]   we had the adios, we had Pandora's, obviously,
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:57.840]   Spotify, the big players,
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.200]   and then the smallest streaming companies.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.280]   They have to consolidate.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.280]   - There was a shakeout, was there?
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.600]   - There was a huge shakeout.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.960]   There is a tipping point.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.400]   And unfortunately, I think we just have to go through
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.000]   that moment and to be find the big players that come out,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.600]   because we can't have feasibly all of this.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.560]   I mean, if you just think about how many subscriptions
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.920]   that you have now to streaming services in general,
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.440]   I can't even count it on one hand.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.160]   - It's becoming a, it's becoming,
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.920]   what's interesting is it's becoming a growing topic
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.360]   of conversation among people where they talk about
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.400]   how many streaming services,
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.040]   and now they're starting to ask more,
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.400]   well, we're looking at which ones to get rid of.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:33.840]   - I saw a guy justify pirating Star Trek Discovery.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.440]   He said, because I don't care what happens,
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.480]   I am never paying for some ASOL access.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.360]   - Never, ever paying.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.200]   - Here's another reason I'm saying that.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.320]   - And I understand that point of view,
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.720]   I just skipped Star Trek.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.960]   - 'Cause I was sitting at my daughter's swim team practice,
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.720]   and a bunch of folks were talking,
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.080]   and I generally don't cop to what I do for a living,
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.240]   'cause it's just easier to--
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.680]   - It just gets it, yeah.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.520]   - When they say I got this pain on the side,
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.080]   and I need you to know it.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.120]   - But what was interesting is they were talking about
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.920]   the Disney Plus streaming service,
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.880]   which is gonna come out,
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.800]   and all of these people, to a person,
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.080]   were saying, well, I'm having a discussion,
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.520]   now do we drop Netflix, or do we drop Hulu?
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.120]   - Now, if you have kids, it's different.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.360]   'Cause the kids are gonna watch it.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.200]   - Yeah, exactly, and the Marvel stuff is moving over
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.760]   to Disney Plus, and so is Star Wars.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.760]   So that's potent, but--
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:19.760]   - I'm not killing Netflix--
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.600]   - 'Cause we're gonna see a lot of shakers.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.440]   - I'm not killing Netflix,
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.280]   'cause I can't watch the office on Netflix anymore.
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.800]   I think most of us are passive enough,
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.200]   whatever they got, well, what?
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.000]   I'll watch that, whatever that is.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.760]   - Or like you make a New Year's resolution, or a blog.
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.960]   For example, I have a friend who every--
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.320]   - Guess you have to make that decision, though.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.920]   - Every Friday, every Black Friday,
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.520]   my friend goes through her inbox and sees
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.400]   which vendors have sent her sale emails,
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.760]   and then she just sits unsubscribed.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.720]   Like that's her little post Thanksgiving ritual is--
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.560]   - Oh, I see, I see.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.400]   - To do that.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.240]   - And maybe there are people
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.480]   where there are New Year's resolution,
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.640]   and we'll be, okay, let's review all of the streaming
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.400]   and subscription services I belong to,
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.320]   and just, and get out.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.320]   Maybe we'll get to that point,
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.920]   but I'm more inclined to believe
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.960]   that we'll get to another point where people
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.520]   start saying, do I really wanna pay for the streaming service
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.640]   where all it is is British detective shows?
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.720]   By the way, I would pay for that.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.160]   (laughs)
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.200]   Do I really wanna pay for this hyper niche?
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.040]   - Is that Britbox?
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.800]   - Or Acorn, or--
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.720]   - Yeah.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.560]   - So--
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.400]   - They'll consolidate, they'll bundle the same way cable,
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.120]   it's gonna be like a beautiful circle.
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.480]   - It's a circle, because you get this,
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.120]   you get this, the unbundling,
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.040]   and then you get bundling,
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.360]   because people don't want the unbundling,
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.720]   all of a sudden, we thought that was a good idea,
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.560]   and it's not.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.760]   I have to say, I think in the long run,
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.200]   this is gonna be good for competition,
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.800]   I think in the short run, as you point out,
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.920]   it's not necessarily good for competition,
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.000]   but I love getting,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.040]   I'm gonna subscribe to Charlie Ergens' Twitter feed,
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.600]   'cause I think he's the next deal on Musk.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.800]   I love getting one more iconoclastic,
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.280]   kind of wild man in the mix.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.080]   These people inspire me,
[00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.200]   they're willing to take big, risky gambles,
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.560]   and they can change the world,
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:51.600]   or they can crash and burn,
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:53.720]   but either way, it's a fun show.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.160]   - Sure, it's just way too late to start,
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:55.960]   it's nice. - More crashing than changing,
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:57.680]   but that's how it's always been.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.360]   - Well, I think Elon, look at Elon.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.040]   - I mean, I think Elon, Starlink,
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:05.120]   forget going to Mars, forget even Tesla,
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.320]   Starlink has bid to put these low earth orbit satellites up
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.040]   and give gigabit internet service
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.480]   to every corner of the world.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.560]   That could be the final play
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:17.000]   that makes T-Mobile AT&T sprinting Verizon completely useless.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.480]   - Okay, I got-- - The one world network
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.960]   sprinted by one guy who--
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.080]   - Yeah, I've got it higher than that.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.080]   - I've got it higher than that.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:23.920]   - Do you?
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.360]   - Well, just because, so we run
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.360]   like the Vatican Observatory
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.080]   and the chain of observatories that do a lot of it.
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.680]   - You do not wanna see 12,000 low earth orbit satellites.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:34.680]   - If you get 12,000 high albedo low earth orbit satellites.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.520]   - You'll never see the Starlink.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.080]   - You can't see anything.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:38.480]   It effectively kills the best of you.
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.320]   - It's pretty expensive, yeah.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.160]   - Well, that's the problem.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.520]   - It's kind of like Vegas and the grasshoppers
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.440]   and the pyramid, it's gonna be gorgeous.
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.760]   Wait until you see.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:46.600]   - All right.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:47.440]   - Aw.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.280]   - Aw.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.120]   - That one sounds pretty expensive.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:49.960]   - I didn't think about that.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:50.800]   Are the astronomers up in arms?
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:51.640]   - Yeah.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.480]   - Too late.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.840]   It will kill earth based astronomy.
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.000]   If you put 12,000 highly reflective objects in orbit,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:57.840]   it kills it.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.320]   - Well, this sounds like you're now facing it
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.240]   for the Jeff Bezos versus Elon Musk fight
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.920]   because Jeff Bezos wants in space.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:04.760]   - Jeff Bezos put thousands too.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.680]   - He wants into space and Elon wants the satellites
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.040]   that will kill earth based astronomy.
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.760]   - If Elon wants to put those satellites, that's great man.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.560]   - He has to pay for an observatory in orbit.
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.880]   So that, okay, there we go.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.720]   - We'll make that deal.
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.560]   - That's a trade off, that's right.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.160]   - And you wanna be up there.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.000]   - I wanna be up there.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:17.840]   - I know you.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:18.680]   - I can run IT.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:20.840]   - I feel like the Vatican Space Observatory
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.840]   is both a fantastic science fiction idea
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.920]   and like a dream job.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.200]   - Almost like a space force.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.520]   (gasps)
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.040]   Actually, the Jesuits have a long
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.480]   and kind of glorious history in science.
[00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.480]   - We were in an episode of the Outer Limits.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.320]   - Really?
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:40.360]   - Okay, so this is for people of a certain age.
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.280]   There was an episode of the Outer Limits where priest goes off
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.680]   because he finds a signal from a supernova,
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:48.720]   shows up there light years away and finds out
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.600]   that the entire civilization was devastated
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:52.520]   by the explosion of the nearby sun.
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.320]   And that happened to be the light that was seen
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.280]   during the birth of Christ.
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.520]   It was an Outer Limits episode, way, way back.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.360]   - Wow, that's heavy.
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.480]   - And that was a Jesuit, so that's heavy.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.320]   - I just keep thinking about the Jesuits.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.160]   - It's in space.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.000]   - Space.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.400]   (laughs)
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.000]   That's Schmeiser.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.880]   - It's a Schmeiser from ITPro today.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.120]   - Yeah, it's very serious about the ITPro.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.320]   - Very serious about enterprise technology.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.080]   Great to have Lexi also with us from CNET,
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.320]   Father Robert from the Vatican.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.680]   I like saying that.
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.080]   Our show today brought to you quite literally by CashFly.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.920]   If you subscribed to any Twitch podcast,
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.600]   if you downloaded from our website,
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:29.680]   you're actually downloading it
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.680]   through our Content Delivery Network.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.240]   We have the best CashFly.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:37.280]   If you deliver content or apps to customers
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.440]   over the internet, a CDN can make such a difference.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.560]   Give your customers a seamless experience they want.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.560]   Power your site or app with the CashFly CDN.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.640]   You'll be 30% faster than the competition
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.760]   and it will cost you less.
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.880]   No matter what is just your end.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.600]   If your website's tied to company revenue,
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.400]   give your customers the fast downloads they need
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.480]   with CashFly.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.400]   Media-rich content 10 times faster than delivery,
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.840]   traditional delivery methods,
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.520]   up to 30% faster than the other guys, the other CDNs.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:10.160]   And because CashFly has servers all over the world,
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.800]   they can offer a 100% SLA.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.600]   I'm not talking 11.9, I'm talking 100%.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.520]   That's an infinite number of 9s.
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.440]   Perfect reliability.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.880]   That means I never get a call at three in the morning
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.600]   saying that the server's down.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.640]   CashFly guarantees the best user experience
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:31.640]   for all your customers, no matter what or where they are.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.040]   Join the thousands of others who trust
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:34.200]   CashFly's reliable network.
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:38.040]   It's not just us, LG, Microsoft, Adobe,
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.640]   R's technical, I'll use CashFly.
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.800]   And the other thing I really like,
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.680]   I don't get billing spikes because CashFly
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.960]   works with you on your yearly usage.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.240]   We have very spiky, as you might imagine, bandwidth needs.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.480]   Sunday night, Monday morning, when everybody downloads Twitch,
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.760]   that's when we get a big spike
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:53.960]   and then it's quiet for a little while
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.480]   and I get another spike with a Mac break weekly.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.520]   And that, if I had to constantly log in
[00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.400]   and make sure we hadn't exceeded our monthly quotas,
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.320]   would be nightmarish.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.920]   But I don't because I have a custom plan.
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.440]   In fact, customers who switched to CashFly
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:11.240]   save more than 20% on average.
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.360]   Right now you get a complimentary detail analysis,
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.240]   no pressure, no sales, they'll just tell you,
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.800]   they'll look at your CDN bill,
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.040]   they'll look at your usage trends
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.120]   and they'll tell you if they can save you
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.840]   20% or more at CashFly.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.920]   I bet they can.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.640]   Take advantage of this twit.cashfly.com.
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.040]   We thank you, CashFly, for bringing Twit
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:32.280]   to our listeners, painlessly for me, painlessly for them.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.960]   twit.cashfly.com.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.960]   And I have to say, if you can get a podcast three seconds
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.880]   faster, you're probably gonna listen to it more.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.200]   No, I'm making that up.
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.920]   - That's actually not far from the truth though.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.920]   - Well, if I have to wait, I might switch,
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.440]   I might go to another one.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.120]   I don't like to wait, no one likes to wait.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.560]   Hey, so you guys with surprising allacrity
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:55.600]   got through the Sprint T-Mobile discussion,
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.840]   that was quite good.
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.880]   I'm excited, are you T-Mobile Lexi?
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.960]   - No, I am on Verizon.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:01.800]   - Verizon?
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:02.640]   - Also Verizon.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.280]   - T-Mobile, all the way.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:06.000]   - Yeah, I have all of them, but I--
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:06.840]   - Naturally.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.560]   - You know what, I worry a little bit about Google Fi,
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.080]   'cause they ride on T-Mobile and Sprint, right?
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.640]   And US Cellular, so I don't know what's gonna happen
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.920]   to Google Fi, but I think that's actually
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.240]   probably one of the best deals.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.160]   - They can't kill it immediately,
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:23.040]   because then they would run it to all sort of end-of-the-the-the.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:24.960]   - Yeah, I think that they said that the MBONOs
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.120]   will be-- - It's like a little alert
[00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.440]   goes off in and off or somewhere and somewhere.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.920]   - Mint Mobile, which is our sponsor,
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.600]   I have mints and amazing deal.
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.400]   300 bucks for 12 gigs a month,
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.360]   300 bucks a year for 12 gigs a month.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.440]   - Geez.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.760]   - And I had that on my OnePlus 7.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.720]   I love it, but they also ride on T-Mobile.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.600]   I don't know what's gonna happen.
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.920]   I guess they have to keep those companies.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.720]   - I have the best plan ever.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.560]   - Who's that?
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.040]   - Tim, DIM, the telecom in Italy,
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.640]   which works all through Europe.
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.920]   It's 20 gigs, unlimited talk and text,
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.720]   including international, it costs five years a month.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.160]   - Oh, five euros?
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.760]   - And you have, because the EU, you have,
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.280]   you roaming my room. - It's amazing, right?
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.960]   - So that was one of the requirements.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.320]   - In my corner, I can come up with my--
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.160]   - You don't wanna know, trust me.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.040]   You don't wanna know.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.160]   So Apple's spending a billion dollars, they can afford it.
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.000]   - Of course.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.240]   - To buy Intel's smartphone business.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.000]   We knew this would be the upshot, right?
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.560]   So the timeline of this is hysterical.
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:24.000]   So Apple sues Qualcomm saying,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.480]   "You don't license the stuff to us cheaply enough.
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.040]   "They stopped the, they were gonna pay a billion dollars
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.880]   "to Qualcomm, they stopped payment.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.800]   " Qualcomm countersues, this goes on for years,
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.080]   "all of a sudden."
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.640]   Meanwhile, by the way, I forgot to mention this part,
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:43.520]   Apple calls up, I think Jeff Williams at Apple calls up,
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.240]   the CEO of Intel and says,
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:49.120]   "You have to make 5G modems for us, you have to.
[00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.120]   "You have to."
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.760]   Intel says, "We don't want 'em, we don't want 'em.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.320]   "You have to."
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.280]   So Intel goes, "Okay, they drag their feet.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.600]   "They really don't want to make these."
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.040]   Apple, I think at some point there must have been
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.280]   an internal memo, this is the smoking gun we haven't seen,
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.360]   where Intel says, "Yeah, we're probably not gonna have those
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:10.360]   "til 2022 or 2023, having some trouble making 'em."
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.280]   So, boom, all of a sudden Apple says to Qualcomm,
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.120]   "You know, forget it.
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.720]   "Here's your money.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.080]   "We're gonna license through 2025,
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.880]   "we're gonna be using your 5G modems, thank you."
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.920]   The next day Intel says, "And we're out of the business."
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.120]   That's it.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.440]   We didn't wanna do it in the first place,
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.320]   but they have a lot of patents.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.880]   2,200 Intel employees will go over to Apple,
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:36.560]   those are the engineers working on this ill-fated 5G effort.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:41.560]   17,000 patents, 17,000 patents will go over.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:46.640]   Intel will retain the ability to develop modems
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.920]   for non-smartphone applications, like PCs,
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.960]   internet things, devices, and autonomous vehicles,
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:56.760]   to which Intel probably says, "Yeah, but don't count on it."
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:01.160]   And Apple's gonna start working on their own 5G stuff
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:04.800]   for the phones, billion dollars.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.040]   This kinda had to be the final piece in that puzzle, right?
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:10.240]   - Well, Apple has always had the philosophy
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.640]   of owning the core technology.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.480]   - Make it ourselves.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.560]   - And the processor has been a sore spot for that,
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.200]   because they're always licensing it out.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:18.240]   Now they own not just the technology,
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.200]   but they've got all those patents,
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.480]   so they've got a war chest,
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.120]   which means even if they choose to use non,
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.960]   Lisa keeps doing the vertical, non-vertive technologies.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.400]   - All the way from design to the retail experience,
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.880]   there is no part of that experience
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.920]   where they're vulnerable to outside forces anymore.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.800]   And from a business perspective, that's great for them.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.080]   - However, there is one thing,
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.080]   which is Intel didn't want to work on this,
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.080]   not just because they were being mean,
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.040]   it was because all of their testing showed
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.160]   that the current 5G standards that are out there,
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.680]   they suck power.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.040]   They are horrible for power,
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.080]   so how do you squeeze a 5G radio into a device
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.400]   that you think Qualcomm's done it?
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.080]   - Qualcomm has something that they're calling 5G,
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.560]   it's not really the same.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.120]   Qualcomm's big tagline at CES was true 5G.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:05.120]   - Yeah.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.120]   - What does that actually mean?
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.680]   We don't actually know what that means.
[00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.160]   - I think we'll find out, like in December,
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.680]   they usually do a really big meet and greet
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.400]   for people who are in mobile in December and Hawaii,
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:17.360]   and my sense is that they're probably gonna queue up
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.400]   whatever they've got going there.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.440]   So we'll find out by the end of the year.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.880]   But it's a good point about PowerSuck,
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.160]   because phones are now people's primary computing devices,
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.680]   and if you're like, "Well, good news, you have 5G, bad news,
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.440]   you have to be in charge every eight hours."
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.840]   - Well, no, it wouldn't even be,
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.680]   like what they were saying,
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.360]   they were seeing a two to 300% power spike
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.200]   at maximum 5G bandwidth.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.320]   So what good is it to have a nice phone
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.840]   that you can only use for half an hour
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.160]   before you had to plug it back in?
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.080]   - Well, this is another thing is how many end users,
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:47.640]   or I should say how many civilian end users
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:51.320]   pay a lot of attention to which apps drain their batteries.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.760]   - Can I point out that I think bandwidth's pretty fast
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:58.280]   on LTE, and it's for mobile seems to be fast enough.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.920]   People are watching movies.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:00.760]   - Yeah.
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:04.480]   - What does this demand doesn't seem
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.920]   to be coming from consumers?
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:06.960]   - No, it's educating.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.520]   It's the idea that if you're out working oil fields
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.640]   or agriculture or mining or someplace like that,
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.640]   and you have intermittent connectivity at best,
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:17.400]   when you do have it, you need small portable devices,
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.520]   and you need to send and receive information quickly,
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.760]   often under very stringent circumstances.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.880]   - What Apple's 5G iPhone is for?
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:24.720]   - No, not Apple's 5G.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:25.880]   - Or Samsung's 5G Galaxy.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.280]   - I guarantee you, these guys are gonna wanna bring
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.320]   this stuff in the field though.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.960]   Apple gets into the enterprise
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.760]   because users love the experience,
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:32.840]   and they're gonna bring it in,
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.360]   and they're like, "Well, can't you make it work?"
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:37.720]   - What is Samsung using in its 5G Galaxy?
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:40.400]   They must be using, are they using their own Exynos platform?
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.240]   - Oh, I've found out it.
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.080]   They're actually not as--
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:42.920]   - They're using Qualcomm.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.200]   - They're both unstable pieces of silicon on the market.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.600]   - I don't have a 5G phone,
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.840]   'cause we don't have 5G carriers,
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.280]   but do people who have 5G phones and 5G carriers
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:51.880]   complain about battery life?
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.480]   - Yes, they do, constantly.
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:54.880]   - It's a huge deal.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.120]   - Okay, so this is,
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:00.720]   this may be pointless, this whole thing, right?
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:03.600]   - 5G really makes sense if you wanna replace
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.800]   a wired connection in a fixed location.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.520]   That 100%, that's a better way to run it,
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.120]   an easier way for you to run it.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.760]   But for me to have to walk around with a 5G radio,
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.560]   that's using a power for bandwidth,
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:17.320]   I probably don't need for what I'm doing on my mobile.
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.520]   That's not a great value.
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.280]   - So why is Apple spending a billion dollars?
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.480]   'Cause 5G is bigger than 4G.
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.320]   (laughing)
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.160]   - It's one more.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.160]   - No, I would do one more G.
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:30.840]   - Maybe it's also just that they enjoy,
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.720]   not enjoy it, but it's a core business value
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.800]   to bring everything in-house as much as possible.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.000]   - It is. - Every assert control.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.200]   And since they're already,
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:41.800]   since they're already dominating the mobile experience,
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.920]   for them perhaps this is them saying,
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.520]   all right, we've eliminated all possible variables
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.280]   where another company can hose our products like-
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.200]   - Yeah, they were mad at Intel.
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.560]   They've been mad at Intel for generations.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.200]   - Yeah, Intel's been kinda screwing the pooch
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.280]   on this since 2016.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.280]   - But at the same time, it feels like
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.400]   maybe we're rushing this whole 5G thing.
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:03.160]   And Apple has never been, another core value of Apple
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.440]   has not been to be the first with any new technology,
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.680]   but to wait. - No, it's not.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.800]   It's to establish the user experience.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.640]   - Yes, and when 5G's ready,
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.760]   video on mobile pushed 4G.
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.800]   There is no killer app for 5G yet.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:17.520]   There's nothing I wanna do on my mobile.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:19.080]   - There's no killer consumer app.
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.920]   I'm willing to bet that we're gonna see a lot in this-
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.360]   - I'm sure it's right. - In a sense.
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.800]   - And all Android major manufacturers have 5G plans
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.320]   or have 5G phones available,
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.200]   and will do by the end of this year.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.840]   So Apple obviously won't have a 5G phone this year,
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:32.840]   we don't think.
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:36.240]   We sort of have rumors that there will be a 2025G phone.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.920]   And so I think from the Apple perspective
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.320]   for both investors and consumers,
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:42.160]   if they don't have a 5G plan in place,
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:44.320]   they're gonna see as being behind the code.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.480]   - They'll look laggard. - Absolutely.
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:47.080]   So they have to have that in store.
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:47.920]   - So that's a weird thing,
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.000]   because Apple has never worried about that before.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.440]   - The other thing I'd like to bring up is
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.520]   we're talking about this. - This is a different Apple
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:53.360]   in a different environment.
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.480]   - We're talking about a really US centric perspective
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.360]   when it comes to 5G and killer apps
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.120]   and user experiences and things like that.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:01.120]   And you know, you tossed aside the comment earlier
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.160]   talking about how Africa effectively leap-progged
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:07.080]   broadband bandwidth and went straight to mobile experience.
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.040]   We don't know that Apple's not doing this
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.160]   because this helps them to position their products
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.880]   more effectively in the Asian markets,
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:15.960]   where they have a much different mobile user experience
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:16.960]   than the US has.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.480]   We have to stop assuming that the US
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.840]   is the primary market for any technology.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:20.680]   - Yeah, it's not anymore.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.640]   - It's just strange that Apple is rushing in
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.720]   to offer a 5G product when the 5G standard
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.160]   has not yet been established.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:28.600]   - They are betting a lot on China in the future though.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:33.000]   And I would be willing to speculate
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.520]   that they're probably also taking a look
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:38.400]   at how they can position a 5G or 5G adjacent phone
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:43.120]   in countries where Apple is not embraced
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.840]   to the same extent as Samsung
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.200]   or other Android based phones.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.120]   - But I mean, the best Apple, the most incredible Apple,
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.440]   the most innovative Apple has always been the one that said,
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.880]   "We don't care if you're first, we're gonna do it better."
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.200]   And the fact that we don't really know
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.880]   what 5G should look like now, it tells me,
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.760]   this is not something Apple should get in right now.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.360]   - Who is the number one manufacturer
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.160]   of 5G network infrastructure?
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.760]   - Huawei. - Huawei.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:10.800]   - China Mobile apparently has big plans for 5G.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:14.040]   Commercial rollout is October 1st.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:17.640]   They expect 5G, I didn't know, I was curious.
[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:20.000]   And you said that, they expect China
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.360]   to be the leading 5G market very, very quickly
[00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.080]   in the next few years.
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.560]   So for whatever reason, maybe because
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:32.160]   that they don't have all the LTE infrastructure in place
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.040]   and they can leapfrog, I don't know.
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.400]   - They also have super dense cities,
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.120]   which works much better for 5G.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.920]   We've got a lot of rural areas where 5G just does not make sense
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:44.600]   because you're just using a tower per person connected.
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:49.120]   - Is it also the case that mobile computing in China, India,
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.400]   Japan is computing?
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.080]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.480]   Don't forget Korea, that's a big one,
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.400]   especially South Korea.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:59.960]   - Where we are, we have desktops and laptops,
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.720]   we're computer focused.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.800]   In those countries, mobile is the primary computing platform.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.960]   - We think that we're computer focused is a generational thing too
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:11.240]   because almost all of us grew up with laptops
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:14.000]   and desktops as our primary interface.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.520]   But if you look at how kids are learning computing now,
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.000]   it's tablets and phones.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.480]   - It's mobile, it's tablets.
[00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:21.440]   - Let me ask something of the entire panel,
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.760]   which is when you see a journalist working in a press room
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.160]   with a tablet on like a keyboard stand.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:28.000]   - I laugh.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:28.840]   - I laugh.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.720]   - Giggle, do you think wow, what is wrong with you?
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.320]   - I laugh at myself a lot.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.640]   - Oh, that's what you do?
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.760]   (laughing)
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:38.560]   - I always feel like, you can correct me Lisa,
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:42.720]   but I always feel like it's a square peg in a round hole
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:47.040]   that we're so invested in making that iPad be a usable computer
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:49.480]   that we're kind of stretching and it's hard,
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.200]   everything's harder.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.320]   - I think it depends on why and how you use it.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:56.040]   I don't do a lot of video editing and I don't do it.
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.400]   - Well, iPad's actually pretty good.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.360]   - Yeah, it's a really good video.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.800]   - I don't do a lot of image style, I do text.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:02.640]   And I find things--
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.480]   - I guess you could write on anything.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.880]   - Yeah, and I do a lot of using on my lap,
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:08.200]   actually, during a keynote, I can't do that
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.040]   with a tablet on a keyboard.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:13.240]   - This is way too big, whereas if I have my iPad,
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.840]   it's easier for me to rest that way.
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.400]   And then have my phone on the other with Otter AI going
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.040]   so I can do things that way.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.080]   And then--
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:22.720]   - Otter is a dictation tool that you can record
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:24.280]   and it will give you a transcript back of the media.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.200]   - And the transcript's kind of hilarious because--
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.200]   - Is it not great?
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.440]   - Oh gosh, the transcript is a great way
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.280]   to help you understand language acquisition actually.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.440]   - So it's automated, it's not human, it's machine translation.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.400]   - But in some of the events I've been in,
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.800]   the chairs are tiny and you're cheeked by a gel
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.320]   with lots of people and you don't want to be throwing elbows.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.360]   And I found it much easier.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.320]   For example, the last time I was at CES,
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.480]   I pretty much used my iPad exclusively.
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.960]   - Trust me.
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.880]   - But I was lucky enough to go to Microsoft
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:57.080]   for like three days a couple months ago
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.400]   and get briefed on Azure--
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.400]   - And what did they say when you were using your iPad?
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:04.760]   - They actually use my MacBook for that.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:05.840]   - Okay, okay.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.440]   - And you know, 'cause we had room,
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.280]   they gave us lots of room.
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.600]   - A lot of people use Macs and Microsoft.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:11.560]   They don't care anymore.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:12.400]   - Well it was--
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.240]   - They really don't care anymore.
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.760]   - They gave me a surface as a loner too.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.440]   So I was able to move back and forth.
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.240]   - Microsoft is a cloud company, there's services.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.320]   - That's right, they're not on Windows.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.800]   - Microsoft was like here, have a surface
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:23.680]   and try out and see how you'd like this tablet experience.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.080]   I was like, this is where we're going.
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.000]   - Yeah.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   - Surface is nice.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:27.840]   - Yeah.
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:28.680]   - So this--
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.360]   - You know it spoiled me because it's such a great--
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:34.840]   quasi-laptop experience and I liked being able to drop
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:38.000]   and drag with my fingers and pinch in and zoom out
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.800]   and then I went back to my MacBook and did that
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.640]   and was like, what in the--
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.080]   - But that's what the touch bar's supposed to be for.
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:44.920]   - Oh please.
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:46.360]   - Don't get me started on the touch bar.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:48.360]   - No, no, I noticed you're saddled with a touch bar.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.960]   - I am saddled with a touch bar.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:53.920]   To my chagrin, it doesn't do anything that I need it
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.280]   to do the touch bar has been one of those big things
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.120]   for the MacBook.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:57.960]   - I agree.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:58.800]   - You can have that on the keyboard.
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.360]   - Do you like the keyboard?
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.360]   - So for me, I haven't experienced any problems
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.000]   that people have reported with the monetizationality.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:05.840]   - It's fine.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:08.520]   So someone commented that I'm a very loud typer
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.360]   in the middle of a keynote and I wasn't,
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.880]   I didn't feel like this was actually at an Apple event.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.680]   I was sitting there in the keynote
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:17.280]   and then someone was like, shit, type in too loud.
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:21.440]   - She's got the butterfly three keyboard, it's not her fault.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.320]   - I like to put the full on mechanical like cherry switches.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.280]   - So we got a typewriter on this platform,
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.440]   on this table we have three MacBook Pros,
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:32.320]   two with function keys, one with a touch bar
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.840]   and one Surface Studio.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.120]   - Wait, no, this is not a MacBook.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:36.960]   - Oh, what is that?
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.000]   - This is an Acer, this is a MacBook.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.880]   - It looks exactly like a MacBook.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.680]   (laughing)
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.160]   - So I think this is Acer on the front.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:46.040]   - I was trying to think about MacBook was.
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.640]   - It was just like a MacBook, I'm sorry.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.560]   - It kinda does.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:54.400]   - Boy, the design language, Apple started that, didn't they?
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.440]   So it actually raises an interesting issue.
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:01.000]   Apple is kind of in an intermediary state
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.440]   where they're making this issue of,
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:05.800]   well, Intel's been a problem partner for us,
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.560]   they've slowed down development of new Macintosh computers.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:12.400]   They're the general consensus is they're gonna make
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:16.200]   their own A, whatever chips for desktop computing.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.960]   Sean Loewigase, who used to be an Apple Vice President,
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:22.040]   he was with B, remember he went out to start BOS
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:25.760]   and writes, I think some really good opinion pieces
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:26.840]   on his Monday note.
[00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.600]   He's been thinking about this and he says,
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.640]   after last week's thought experiment on the Mac's future,
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:35.120]   I realized leaving the x86 processor family
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:38.720]   makes little sense, a pleasing fantasy, but too complicated.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:43.120]   He says, honestly, as long as Apple makes Macs,
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.560]   it's gonna have to use Intel chips.
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:48.720]   But that doesn't mean Apple's future lies with Intel
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:53.240]   because of the iPadOS fork, that he thinks iPadOS
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.280]   is really where, and I have always thought this,
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.600]   where Apple's heart lies, right?
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:01.760]   And he just says, it's just not gonna make sense
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:04.680]   for Apple to abandon Intel, they're gonna still,
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:09.720]   how are you gonna make a Mac Pro with 32 cores
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:14.480]   or an iMac Pro with 10 cores out of an ARM chip?
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.760]   There's no point, there's no point.
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:19.000]   - I mean, you've used ARM powered computers before.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:19.840]   - They're terrible.
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.080]   - No, I admit they could get better.
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.920]   - I don't think risk is necessarily not as good,
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:27.520]   it's just that the ARM isn't focused
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:30.120]   on these fast big pipelines.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:34.120]   It's focused on low power and other things.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:36.800]   So he says, there is a fork in the iOS world,
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.200]   which is the iOS versus iPadOS.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:43.280]   And he says, as iPadOS lets iPads gain more use cases,
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:46.200]   especially in the realm of productivity, iPhones,
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.480]   will stay in the mainstream of iOS.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.840]   That's what he sees.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.640]   He says, really, Apple doesn't want to support two platforms,
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:56.560]   ARM and Intel, but they're actually gonna have to support three.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.920]   - But a big sense to do that,
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:02.920]   because the user base for the X86 Apple user,
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:03.760]   - That's not gonna change.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.160]   - It's actually quite small.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.000]   - It's tiny.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.320]   - It's even smaller when you look at
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.320]   where the profit comes from.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.680]   So for them, it's not really worth the pain
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.440]   to try to migrate everything over,
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:14.000]   encourage all the developers to
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:14.840]   - For a tiny market.
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:15.680]   - to redevelop their applications.
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.360]   - Yeah, no, it's just, no, don't do that.
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.960]   - And frankly, as a coder, I'm not gonna use an iPad Air.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.560]   I'm gonna use a computer with a real keyboard.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:25.960]   Well, anyway, it's an interesting.
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.760]   - You are, but again, I'm saying that.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.800]   - You think there's a generation of coders coming up
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.760]   that are gonna write the next generation
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.720]   of Apple software on an iPad?
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.160]   - I do, or at least a tablet,
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.040]   because they're gonna be used to the experience
[00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:40.720]   where they expect to be able to input in a lot of different ways.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.080]   - Apple has created this artificially though,
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:46.360]   because I have touch on my surface.
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.640]   You have touch on your Acer.
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.520]   - You've now got generations of school kids
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.040]   who have come up learning how to code through gooies
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.560]   like Minecraft or other,
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.160]   I forget the Google platform
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.320]   where they're teaching kids how to code
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:00.800]   by effectively having them plot out
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.080]   how a program works with little graphical interfaces
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:03.920]   where they can learn how to--
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:05.400]   - It's a drag and drop interface, yeah.
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:09.400]   - And I think we will probably always have a need
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:12.160]   for somebody to write the alphanumeric sequences
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.880]   that make the pretty blocks that you drag and drop.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:15.720]   But--
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.240]   - Yeah, I'm not gonna program with pretty blocks.
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:22.800]   But I suspect that programming applications
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.240]   has gotten to a point in the fields development
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:28.120]   where it's some low-code, no-code apps,
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.880]   and those can be purely GUI based
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.000]   and they don't necessarily need a keyboard.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.360]   They just need a method to drag and drop
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.360]   and put things together.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:37.560]   - We are, as you pointed out,
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.320]   Lexi's starting to hear rumors about this falls iPhone.
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.280]   That makes sense, they're probably already making it, right?
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:45.360]   - Oh yeah, and we even know stuff about the 2020 iPhone,
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.200]   supposedly.
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:47.320]   I mean, it's just-- - And then she quotes us,
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:48.160]   that's the 5G.
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.600]   - Yeah, that's supposedly the 5G.
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:52.120]   So what we do know about this year's iPhone
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.120]   is that it will probably be very similar
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.000]   to what we already know.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.320]   So there'll be three models.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:59.120]   There'll be one to replace the 10S, the 10S Max,
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:00.360]   and the 10R.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:04.880]   Hopefully they'll change it to iPhone 11 rather than Xi.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.000]   - So, so, so, so, so, yeah.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.680]   - The number of times I go and people are like,
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:08.960]   oh, what do you think of the XS?
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:11.040]   And I was like, the discord in my brain
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.600]   because I have to say it the way that Apple says it,
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.960]   the 10S, and I'm like, oh yeah, that's what you mean.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:20.160]   - For the longest time, call my Tesla Model X a Model 10.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.040]   It's very confusing.
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.720]   - So, I think Apple should just switch to like Greek lettering.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:27.680]   So the next iPhone is-- - So, here's my big disappointment.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.600]   It looks like it's gonna be lightning again.
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:33.360]   - Yes, so there's no signs that it's USB-C, like the iPad.
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:34.200]   - Why?
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:35.760]   - The screens don't seem like they're gonna get
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.480]   a significant bump if they-- - Still a ledge.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.120]   - All resolution.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.560]   What the most interesting thing though,
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.720]   is the cameras on the new iPhones,
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:46.240]   because Apple has made, you know, leaps and bounds,
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.960]   I think over the past year at least,
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:50.520]   with their move to computational photography
[00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:54.000]   with the iPhone, and it's something that we've gonna see,
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.680]   potentially three cameras on the back of the new iPhone.
[00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:59.120]   So there'll be the regular wide telephoto lens,
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.240]   like the iPhones already have except for the 10R,
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.840]   which only has that single lens,
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.760]   but there's gonna be likely a third lens,
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.640]   which is an ultra wide angle lens.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:07.480]   And this is really interesting.
[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:08.800]   - I love that on my XS10 Plus.
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.800]   - It's test 10 on the P30, sorry.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.040]   - I use that all the time.
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:14.600]   - It's a really, once you have it,
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:18.800]   you don't realize how much we're missing out on before.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.360]   So what we're probably gonna see on the iPhone,
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:22.400]   at least from the rumors,
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.040]   is that this ultra wide angle lens,
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.880]   is potentially gonna be able to capture more detail,
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:29.560]   than is actually presented in the frame to the user,
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:31.240]   and then you can basically go in
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.640]   and choose to have that extra data presented
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:35.320]   in a wider frame if you want to.
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:36.160]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.720]   - And then throw away that extra information out.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:38.840]   - The first time you do that,
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:41.480]   and you like refocus an image,
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:42.320]   you're just going,
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.840]   I never want to move back to the regular.
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.080]   - But hasn't Google done the best
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.720]   with a single lens on its Pixel 2 3?
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:49.560]   I mean that?
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.240]   - The Pixel 3 is the one to be,
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:53.040]   but also the P30 Pro,
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.920]   the Huawei P30 Pro if you've used that.
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:57.200]   - We don't use that here in America.
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:00.200]   The low light of yours is pretty incredible.
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.240]   - The low light on the P30 is incredible.
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.480]   And that's where Apple really needs to play catch up,
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.880]   I think, the low light and the ultra wide angle,
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:10.320]   because Apple has always been king of video, absolutely.
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:12.880]   Like you shoot video 4K on the iPhone,
[00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.520]   we put it side by side with stuff
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.200]   that we shoot on our production cameras,
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.720]   it's seen it and it looks very similar.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:19.560]   - It's amazing.
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:20.400]   - It's amazing.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:21.880]   - Yeah, it just does such great stuff.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.960]   - Is Google's night sight better than the Huawei,
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:25.480]   or is Huawei catching up?
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:28.840]   - It's slightly different in the way it works.
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:31.920]   I think the Pixel has a lot more computational smarts there.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:33.000]   The Huawei-- - It has its own
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.080]   processor dedicated to it.
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.200]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.160]   The Huawei does an incredible job,
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.320]   and you can literally see things in the dark,
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.880]   like I did a lot of test shots.
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:44.400]   It's creepy, and how well it sees in the dark.
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.520]   But Apple finds the camera from the doctor.
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:49.200]   - What do you see when you turn off the lights?
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.720]   I don't know, but it's creepy.
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.760]   Are you using the OnePlus?
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.600]   - This is a OnePlus 6.
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:57.000]   - I like the 7 a lot.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.760]   - 7 is nice, the one thing I will not give up
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:00.840]   is an audio port.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:01.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.000]   - Yeah, I'm a 3.5 mil.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.600]   Especially where I live now,
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:06.600]   where you need that to interface it with things.
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:07.760]   I'm not gonna carry around.
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.360]   - That's another sad thing for me.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:13.440]   We're gonna, the next week is the Note 10 announcement.
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.440]   We're gonna cover that, we'll stream it live
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.320]   and talk about it.
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:21.320]   And Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Unpacked event is,
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:23.640]   what is that, August 7th?
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.480]   - They removed all buttons.
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:27.640]   - Apparently, not only have they removed buttons,
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:29.280]   they removed, yeah, courage.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.120]   - All right, sure.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:30.960]   - Headphone jack.
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.360]   - So much courage.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:33.200]   - What?
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.720]   This is the main reason that I still use a Galaxy phone.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:36.880]   Is they headphones jack?
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:39.040]   - I hate when they say, oh, we had to remove it
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:39.880]   to make it water.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:41.160]   They did, that's totally not true.
[00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:42.320]   100% not true.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:43.160]   - Mm.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.000]   - Wow.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.960]   - But then you get a stylus.
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:47.480]   So, you know it's trade off.
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.200]   - Leo has history with Stylai.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.040]   - Yeah, obviously.
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.280]   (laughing)
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:53.080]   - Remember, I don't know if you remember when the,
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.080]   was it the S7?
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:54.920]   - Is it Note 7?
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:55.760]   - Yeah.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.920]   - If you put the stylus in backwards, was it the 5?
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:58.760]   - You broke it.
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:45:59.600]   - You broke it.
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:00.440]   - You put the stylus in.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:01.920]   - And he did it on air during a show.
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.480]   - The story was everybody was saying,
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.080]   don't put it in backwards, it'll break it.
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.520]   - It still do like that. - Okay.
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:07.360]   - Let's see.
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:08.200]   - It will, yeah.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.040]   - It did.
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.360]   - It totally did.
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:11.920]   - And then I thought I brought it to T-Mobile.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.920]   I said I broke it and they said, yes you did.
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.160]   (laughing)
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:16.000]   - You sure did.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.960]   Well done, don't you think?
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:19.080]   - I said, well what are you gonna do about it?
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:20.720]   They said, well, I don't know.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:21.560]   (laughing)
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:23.160]   - We could yank that thing out.
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:25.200]   - Still think Samsung should lean right into
[00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:26.680]   the earlier disaster this year and just
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.400]   on debut this Samsung origami.
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.240]   Just, just try it.
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.080]   - That's right.
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:31.520]   - So the fold is coming out in September.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.520]   - Yes.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.360]   - Finally.
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:34.920]   - But T-Mobile says, yeah, this time we're
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.760]   not carrying it.
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.600]   So there's not a lot of confidence, is there?
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:38.440]   - No, I mean.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:39.320]   - They changed the design.
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:40.840]   They've actually just taken two S-10s
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:41.680]   and they've put them together.
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:42.840]   - They put the glue them together.
[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:44.080]   No, it folds back up.
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:44.920]   - No, it should work better.
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:45.760]   - It's like a hinge that goes up to the floor.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.520]   - Did you guys get the E-F-4?
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:48.960]   - Yes, so we had the fold.
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:52.200]   We were one of the few outlets that didn't experience
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:53.160]   any issues.
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.400]   Well, yeah, well we didn't hear all the protective film off
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.240]   but we didn't have any issues with it at all
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:59.040]   but other people absolutely did.
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.960]   And this was the reason why they had to go back
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.800]   to the drawing board and recraft it.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.400]   And I was wondering, you know, for everybody
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:07.480]   that had a pre-order for the fold, you know,
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:08.960]   there was such, I was actually one of those people.
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:09.880]   I did pre-order it.
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:10.720]   - I did too.
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:14.040]   - Yeah, and it was just like this endless like delay of,
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:17.160]   will I get an email saying my pre-order's been canceled
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:18.560]   and then I'll get an email.
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.080]   It's like click here to make sure
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:21.560]   that you still want the fold.
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:24.640]   And I thought, okay, it's been, you know, 50 days,
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:25.480]   60 days, 70 days.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:26.400]   I think it's 89 days.
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.240]   - I think it's been 89 days.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:29.640]   - I think it's been 89 days since, you know,
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:32.120]   since the first issue that they actually made the announcement.
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:34.400]   And so yes, the pre-orders are still active.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:35.920]   If you got it for Samsar.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.280]   Yes, I checked because I got the email that says,
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.040]   your pre-order is still active.
[00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:41.960]   - Do you have your $2,000 still ready?
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:42.800]   - You have $2,000.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.960]   - Ah, that's a problem for future Lexi to look after.
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:48.040]   (all laughing)
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:49.840]   - So the fold is the new Duke Nukem.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.640]   It will just always be preparing for some time.
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.200]   - I believe it's gonna come out,
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.240]   but the real question is who is gonna buy it?
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:56.080]   $2,000. - Why would they
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:56.920]   want to buy it? - $2,000.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:57.760]   - It's a more experienced company.
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.360]   - They stretched the coating around more
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.800]   so you wouldn't be tempted to peel it off.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:04.600]   They put some bumpers on the ends of the hinges
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:07.920]   so stuff couldn't get into it as it did with the verges.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.400]   Do you think that's enough?
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.240]   - It has to be.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:12.600]   They cannot afford another issue
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:15.320]   because you look at the Note 7 with two recalls.
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:16.480]   - Yeah, yeah. - They can't afford that.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:17.400]   - That was the battery.
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:18.360]   - Yeah, that was the battery.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.960]   So Samsang has to get it right this time
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:24.600]   because Samsang is a brand that has so many devoted followers.
[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:26.760]   If you look at the people that love the Note line,
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:30.560]   Samsang acknowledges like how dedicated this user base is.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:32.480]   And I think it has to be similar with the Fold
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:36.480]   people that are willing to hand over $2,000 on this new phone.
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:39.240]   They're so interested in having the latest and greatest.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.760]   And this is a radical new category.
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:45.520]   We haven't seen anything this crazy
[00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.600]   in terms of phone design for at least 10 plus years.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:51.000]   We're so used to just the straight design
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.520]   that we see iPhone, Samsang, every other phone with.
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:56.280]   So for Samsang, this is a huge deal.
[00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:59.760]   And I hope it works because I,
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:02.040]   even though I played with the Fold a little bit
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.120]   when I did have it. - Did it appeal to you?
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:04.520]   'Cause a lot of people when they first saw it said,
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.160]   "This is good, I get it, this is good."
[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.280]   - It does, you get it.
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.280]   And you didn't sort of,
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:12.720]   I didn't quite see the need for it just yet.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:16.400]   But when I started flipping between views of,
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.840]   okay, I had a nice big map open
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:21.040]   on when I had the phone unfolded.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.360]   And I flipped it back and then I had a smaller view.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.560]   It just made sense.
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:29.360]   But again, I literally spent 15 minutes with it.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:32.240]   So I didn't have the full use of it,
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:34.040]   but there is so much potential there.
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:35.080]   - And I maybe-- - Well, what a future
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.520]   Lexi on with her galaxy. - Future Lexi
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:38.160]   will come on with the falls.
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:40.200]   I'll show you if I agree with past Lexi.
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:42.840]   - I've been really, I just go back and forth
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:43.800]   about whether I should get it.
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:46.200]   I feel like I just don't, I don't wanna.
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:47.240]   I really don't wanna.
[00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:49.000]   - I mean, it's interesting.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.240]   - It's interesting. - It is the coolest thing
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:51.920]   that has gone out of fault. - We'll never see
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.960]   Huawei's now, which is sad.
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:56.560]   Huawei had a very interesting trifold design.
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:57.400]   Who else is it?
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.000]   - The FDA that showed one.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.360]   I don't think they announced it, but they showed it.
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:01.840]   - It is another company as well.
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:03.600]   I've totally blanked on the name.
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:06.320]   - There's one I always wanna call it the Perfittoral.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.640]   - Perfittoral. - It's not.
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:08.720]   It's the Royal.
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:11.480]   - That's the one, Royal, yes, the Royal Perfittoral.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:14.240]   - But it kind of is a Perfittoral of phones.
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:15.840]   That one sank with it.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:18.440]   - Where I would like to see a foldable screen
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:19.360]   would be on a laptop.
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:21.680]   If I could fold out a second screen, I gosh.
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:22.760]   - Oh, they do make up for-- - They do make up for--
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:24.080]   - They kinda do, but it's really just
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.200]   a second screen attached.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.640]   It's like a transformer laptop.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:27.880]   - Right, right.
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:29.880]   But it would make more sense because it's larger,
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:32.360]   which means you're gonna put less force on the crease.
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:34.200]   It also means it's gonna be opening and closing
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:35.520]   a lot less than a mobile phone.
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:36.360]   - Right.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:39.280]   - Here is a video of Monkey Leo.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:40.600]   (laughing)
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:42.120]   Unable to resist.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.400]   - Oh, is this the-- - Breaking?
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.560]   - Breaking. - Back in, and you can.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:46.400]   It goes in ver--
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:47.720]   This is backwards.
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:48.560]   - Yeah, it goes in.
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:50.360]   - Nickus and FanDry's handled it on a couple days ago.
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:52.200]   He told people not to do this, but they didn't--
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:53.320]   - Yeah, this is painful to watch.
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.720]   - I'm not gonna say the theater.
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:55.560]   - Don't do it!
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:56.400]   Don't do it!
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.480]   - Hey, Richie's trying to talk me out of it.
[00:50:58.480 --> 00:50:59.640]   - You're holding it wrong.
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:01.280]   You're inserting it wrong.
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:03.320]   - We highly recommend our Galaxy Note 5 users
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:04.800]   follow the instructions in the user's guide
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:07.080]   to ensure they do not experience such an unexpected scenario
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:09.520]   caused by reinserting the S-pin in the other manner.
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.560]   - Even after he read me that.
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:12.800]   - You're inserting it wrong.
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:13.640]   - Wow.
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:14.480]   - No, it doesn't.
[00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:16.520]   - But the truth is, he's very easy to do that.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:17.360]   Oh, I just did it.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:18.360]   Oh, crap.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:20.620]   (laughing)
[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:21.460]   - Okay.
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:23.560]   (laughing)
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:26.880]   - This just shows you I got no impulse control whatsoever.
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:30.000]   We have a great panel, so good to have Father Robert back
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.160]   for at least a little while.
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:32.000]   - A little while.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:33.560]   - I get to go about a month a year.
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:36.080]   - We miss you, but do you get to go to Defcon this year?
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:36.920]   - I do.
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:37.760]   - Oh, that's next week.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.360]   - Oh, wait, no, I mean, no, you don't.
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:41.880]   - Oh, I mean, no one knows.
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:44.000]   Will you be on the wall of sheep?
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.760]   - I might actually try to put a device there this year.
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:47.600]   - That'd be fun.
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:49.680]   - Yeah, and I hear there's a Star Trek convention
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.240]   just next door in case you want to pop it.
[00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:54.080]   - And actually it's been turned into
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.920]   futuristic grasshopper convention.
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:56.760]   (laughing)
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:58.520]   - And watch out for the grasshoppers.
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:00.680]   Also great to have Lexi Savitas, right?
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:01.520]   Am I saying it right?
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:02.360]   Savitas.
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:03.200]   - Yeah, Savitas, you got it.
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:04.040]   - You like it Savitas?
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:05.840]   Senior editor of CNET where she covers
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.600]   consumer technology and you can watch
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:09.600]   she did a lot of videos for CNET.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:12.160]   And so we're thrilled to have you for your first time.
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:14.480]   Lisa Schmeiser, always welcome.
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:16.720]   You didn't bring Guil Scout cookies, I'm grateful.
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:18.000]   Editor IT Pro today.
[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.200]   - That'll be next February.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.040]   I brought you cookies.
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:21.640]   - That's January, February, I won't get them.
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:24.960]   - You know I'm keto these days, I can't eat those.
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:25.800]   - Oh wow.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:28.280]   - Yeah, it's been going good for me.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:30.760]   I've lost a lot of weight and my blood sugar is good,
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:31.960]   it's yeah.
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:33.520]   And I get to eat all the meat I want.
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:35.960]   - Are you still doing the internet fasting as well?
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:37.120]   - No, I stopped that.
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.280]   Although when I realized that was very good training
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:41.600]   for keto because it was kind of like building up
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:43.600]   my ability to say no.
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.000]   I'm not gonna eat, I'm not gonna eat, but it was hard.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.920]   This way I could say, well, I'm not gonna eat that.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:50.400]   And so that's helped me a little bit.
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.160]   - I've been doing keto for about a year now.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.800]   - I mean I also eat carbs.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:54.640]   (laughing)
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:55.480]   - Yeah.
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:56.320]   - Keto Plus, we call it.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:57.720]   And for the plus sized priest.
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:58.560]   It's actually great.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:52:59.520]   It's really great work.
[00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:03.360]   - Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:04.960]   We use, I think we have two accounts here,
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:05.840]   we use it so much.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:10.400]   If you mail things, whether brochures, invoices, books,
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:13.640]   maybe if you're a seller on Etsy or eBay or Amazon,
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:16.080]   you use the US mail, it's not me, the US mail,
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:17.920]   it's a miracle, it's a great service.
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:20.240]   But, you know, you're bringing your packages
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:22.520]   into the post office, you gotta find parking,
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:24.600]   you gotta bring it in, and then you're competing,
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:27.440]   you know, you're a pro, you're competing against the amateurs.
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:30.560]   And I have to say, sometimes people go in the post office
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:32.680]   and they take their time.
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:35.000]   So I think they like being there.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.040]   I got stuff to do.
[00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:37.080]   We use Stamps.com.
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:39.120]   I can do everything I can do to the post office.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:40.320]   I love the post office.
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:42.800]   I still go to say hi to my mail carrier,
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:46.320]   but I do all my postal stuff at minddeskwithstamps.com.
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:50.560]   Everything you can do, it eliminates trips to the post office,

[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:53.680]   You can't even get at the post office.
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:56.000]   You can buy and print real US postage
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.280]   right from your computer printer.
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:00.560]   You don't need a special ink, you don't need a special printer.
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:03.000]   If you're sending out any class of mail
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.880]   anywhere you wanna send, Stamps.com makes it easy.

[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:12.080]   They'll even suggest ways to save money.
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:14.360]   That could be media mail, they'll say.
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:16.080]   You with Stamps.com, when you buy Stamps,
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:20.000]   you get five cents off every first class stamp.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.360]   Up to 40% off priority mail.
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:25.120]   Forget the postage media.
[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:26.480]   This is a fraction of the cost.
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:28.640]   You don't need it, you just need Stamps.com.
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:30.840]   Honestly, it's a no-brainer.
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:33.280]   It saves you time, it saves you money.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.520]   No one or 700,000 small businesses
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.000]   like mine already use Stamps.com.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.480]   And by the way, it makes your mailing much more professional.

[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:45.440]   don't be licking stamps and handwriting addresses.
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:46.280]   Make it easy.
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:48.080]   It automatically print the address right
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.520]   from your address book from the order.

[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.760]   I don't like this camera.
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:35.880]   I don't wanna get, we're not gonna get back
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:38.560]   to the new iPhone, but I don't like that camera bump.
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:40.080]   - I think it's looking at you strangely.
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:42.320]   - It's ugly and it's big.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:43.960]   - The camera bump has been designed.
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:45.600]   - I turn on the Robber's bike.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:46.600]   - That's smooth.
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:48.520]   - Yeah, the camera bump has been designed
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:50.480]   for a bumper case that smooths it out.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:53.600]   - I don't want a case.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:55.320]   Notice, I--
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:56.160]   - That's an iPhone thing.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:00.280]   - We use the, you and I use the little rubber sleeve cases
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:01.960]   'cause they don't hide the looks of it.
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:03.360]   What do you, Klexi?
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.200]   - I have a--
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.360]   - It's actually under the desk.
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:06.720]   - That's all right, you can just tell us.
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:07.640]   - No, actually I'll show you.
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:08.480]   - Oh.
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:09.640]   - You have it on the floor.
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:12.960]   - I do, because I am very rough with my devices.
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:15.400]   Not intentionally, I'm just a very clumsy person.
[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:17.120]   So I have to have a really tough device,
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:18.040]   otherwise I'll break it,
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:20.440]   so I have this very elaborate locking system.
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:21.440]   - Do you recommend it?
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:22.280]   Who makes it?
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:23.880]   - This one is, it's life proof.
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.040]   It's a-- - Life proof is good,
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:25.880]   I know this is a very good thing.
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:27.080]   - Yeah, it's been fine.
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:28.960]   Actually, every year at CES,
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:31.720]   we do a case testing competition.
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:32.560]   - That's probably fun, you drop the rice.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:34.400]   - Yeah, it's a lot, we drop a lot of phones
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.720]   and we break a lot of phones
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.440]   and we find the toughest cases.
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:38.800]   So it's-- - So you know.
[00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:40.400]   - We know which are the toughest ones.
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:41.240]   - I know you drop the thing
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:42.880]   an average of once a day from about--
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:44.360]   - I never, ever dropped my phone.
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:45.760]   I think I can just-- - I always drop.
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.560]   - You know what, I'm taking the case off.
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:48.400]   - No, no, no!
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:51.680]   - I know it's gonna snap. - It's almost guaranteed, right?
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:52.520]   - Yep. - I'll drop it.
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:53.360]   - Yep.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:55.440]   - No case, look at that.
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:58.040]   This, this, beautiful, I love how that looks
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.320]   without a case, it's so pretty.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:00.240]   - Is that the ceramic one?
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:02.400]   - Yeah. - Is that nice?
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.880]   - Terabyte of storage.
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:05.000]   You know how much I've used out of this,
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   terabyte of storage?
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.160]   About 128 gigabytes.
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:10.240]   I think I have about 512.
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.600]   - Do you? - This doesn't even,
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:13.080]   I mean, I put an SD card in here
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:15.520]   so it's even more than a terabyte now.
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:16.360]   What do you use?
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:17.960]   It's Schmizer. - I have a--
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:19.160]   - Oh, that's pretty. - Yeah.
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:20.480]   - It's the same thing.
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:22.600]   'Cause you have a beautiful project red phone.
[00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:24.280]   - Yes. - Or is it, is that orange?
[00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:25.200]   - It's the Tenar.
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:26.040]   It's the Carl.
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.640]   - Yes, it's the Carl. - Carl.
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:28.480]   - Mm-hmm, yep.
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:30.160]   - It's the Tenar, I'm not saying XR.
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:31.000]   - It's the enough-- - You can say it
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:31.840]   however you want.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:34.000]   - I can say it. - No, what's right,
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.280]   that's gonna be remember now.
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.840]   - When I was on Leo's show earlier this year,
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:40.120]   I broke out my iPhone 5S and you were like,
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:42.880]   - I mocked it, it was so small, it was cute.
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:44.360]   - It is so small, it's so tiny.
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:46.280]   - It's so tiny. - You have a baby phone.
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:47.120]   - But I finally gave it--
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:48.880]   - I think the XR is actually very good.
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:50.960]   - It really-- - I really like it.
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:52.120]   - It's, I really love it.
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:54.240]   I really love it, I've created the experience.
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:56.920]   I love not having to charge my phone every day anymore.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:58.800]   - Yeah. - Which I had to do.
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:01.040]   - You needed to upgrade, I'm glad you did.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:02.560]   Did you give your kids the--
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:03.960]   - No, I traded it into the store
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:06.040]   because I got a few dollars off this phone for it.
[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:07.400]   - Do your kids have phones?
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:09.360]   - No, no, not on the middle school list.
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:10.800]   - Yeah, I think that's probably smart.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.720]   Although they probably are the only kids
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:14.640]   in their class who've done.
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:17.520]   - We actually, 'cause we send our daughter
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:20.040]   to an art magnet elementary school,
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.240]   there are plenty of other really good--
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:22.560]   - A lot of hippies, huh? - Yeah, a lot of hippies,
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:24.000]   so she's okay for now.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.960]   (laughing)
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:28.240]   - Always good. - Has your phone been--
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.640]   - Vaccinated?
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:31.120]   - Well of course, of course it has.
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:32.320]   - Just check it. - We're hippies,
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:33.320]   we're not birthbarians.
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:35.560]   (laughing)
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:41.480]   - Inside the Apple factory theft secret tunnels.
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:43.760]   - Ooh, I like tunnels.
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:46.920]   - This is not a revelation, this story,
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:50.440]   from the information, but it was fun to read
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:54.800]   about all the ways the workers in the Apple's factories
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:59.560]   are sneaking Apple's products out of the factory.
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:00.480]   - Of course they are.
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:03.600]   - Yeah, because they can make as much as a year's salary.
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:05.720]   - Just by selling them in electrical property, yeah.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:08.520]   - By leaking it out, I mean if you wonder,
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:10.160]   you mentioned when we were talking about
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:11.560]   the next generation iPhone that they're probably
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:14.040]   already making it, that's how we probably will get
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:16.320]   all this information because they have it in the factory.
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:19.760]   - Go to Shenzhen, go to the market stalls of Shenzhen,
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:23.320]   and you can literally buy any brand new sum,
[00:59:23.320 --> 00:59:26.760]   not yet released technologies from these little tables
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:27.600]   that are set up, you know,
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:30.280]   - I love that. - It's like Blade Runner.
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:33.360]   - It's like, I'm gonna say, I love this author
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:34.520]   and I cannot pronounce his name.
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:38.080]   Paolo Bassio Gallupi is a great science fiction author.
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:40.960]   - A wind up girl. - Yes, and he has a
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:43.000]   collection of short stories called Pump Six,
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.880]   and there is an entire short story based around
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:49.320]   a factory girl in China who smuggles out,
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:51.120]   who is presented with an opportunity,
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:53.440]   and did his over it for approximately five nanoseconds
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:56.080]   and then sets herself up for life based on this.
[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:58.360]   And Mr. Bassio Gallupi has spent a lot of time in--
[00:59:58.360 --> 00:59:59.600]   - I think it's Bacha Gallupi.
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.360]   - Bacha Gallupi. - 'Cause it's a kiss, Bacha.
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:02.440]   - Bacha Gallupi. - Bacha Gallupi.
[01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:03.480]   - I read him, I don't talk to him.
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:04.960]   (laughing)
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:07.880]   But he's spent a lot of time in China,
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.280]   and I feel like he's one of the writers
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:13.120]   who effectively has a telescope trained on the future,
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:16.080]   and has been like laying down all of these drawings
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.520]   and his short stories are all of these things
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.840]   with the way the world works. - I'll have to read these.
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:19.760]   - Don't be surprised by this.
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:20.960]   - Yeah. - It does have that sort
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.400]   of Blade Runner feel to it, though.
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:25.120]   I just, I look really bad in transparent plastic clothing.
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:26.640]   - Yeah. (laughing)
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.160]   - I look forward to seeing how the Pope's gonna look
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:31.360]   once his best wincer turn. (laughing)
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.440]   - Oh, but I've been to Shenzhen before, ever.
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:36.000]   - Have you? - Yeah, it is, it's a kick.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.080]   - Yeah, my husband covers Mobile for Tom's Guide,
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:41.360]   and Tom, I think it was Huawei actually brought him
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:44.160]   over there two years ago, 'cause they wanted to show him
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.280]   what the facilities were like and things like that,
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:47.880]   and that was something else he talked about too.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:51.360]   - We might wanna scan him for bugs now or wires.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:52.200]   (laughing)
[01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.040]   - Well, I thought I was gonna find all these knock-offs,
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:56.040]   like, you know, iPhone, spelled with an F,
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.200]   but no, there was actual real genuine product there.
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:04.200]   So Apple has, or at least after the first big theft,
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:07.200]   where six years ago, a warehouse employee
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.600]   at one of Apple's top suppliers,
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:11.760]   Jibile stole thousands of iPhone 5C casings,
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:14.160]   boy was he sorry, from a factory in China
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:16.240]   before the product was announced,
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.640]   with the help from a security guard, falsified documents,
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.840]   and avoided security cameras as he drove a truck
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.480]   filled with the candy colored shells out of the gates.
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.640]   After that incident, Apple formed something called
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.640]   NPS, the new product security team.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.240]   And you can only imagine what these people
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.280]   are looked like in a dress like this.
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:36.000]   There's probably very scary people.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.640]   However, it's gotten better.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.320]   Last year, Apple began to trim the team
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.600]   and is now moving some of the work to contractors.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:47.600]   The real problem now is electronics leaks, schematics.
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:52.400]   In fact, what we're seeing is 3D renders the cases
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.840]   for the new iPhone that leaked out
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:57.400]   are actually 3D printed from schematics
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:59.120]   that leaked out that kind of thing.
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:05.760]   It's a great story if you get a chance to read the information.
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:08.280]   A woman at Jibile once hit dozens of glass screens
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:11.080]   in her bra, but was caught by security guards
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:13.720]   after the no-stirring usual style of walking.
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:17.040]   - And you can't really keep it that secret.
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:19.480]   If people in IT, in the enterprise world,
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:21.880]   have trained themselves to look at
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.120]   what's happening in the channel.
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:24.960]   And if you look at what's happening in the channel,
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.360]   you know what parts you know about.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:27.760]   You know what's being assembled.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.200]   - Apple once caught factory workers digging a small,
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:33.720]   oh, that's yours, a small, you don't mind if I take your phone.
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:34.560]   - That's all right.
[01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.120]   - A small tunnel in a corner of a room
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.680]   behind a large piece of machinery.
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:39.480]   They were gonna use it to ferry stolen parts
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.440]   to the outside world.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.360]   They were chipping away the wall,
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:44.440]   Shawshank Redemption style.
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:47.160]   - At some point, we're gonna see like an Oceans 11-
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:48.680]   - Yeah. - Type of heist movie based out of it.
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:49.920]   - That'd be a good heist movie.
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:54.920]   - You know, it's, because if you've got a huge financial
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:58.800]   incentive to steal this stuff and get it out there,
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:01.600]   cracking down on security is one way to address the issue.
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:03.200]   But I can't help but think,
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.200]   perhaps there are other creative solutions
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.120]   Apple could come up with so that their employees
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:09.200]   are not so strongly incentivized.
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:10.880]   - Maybe pay them better, right?
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:11.720]   - Yeah.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:12.560]   - That's crazy.
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.640]   - Just as you said, Robert, many of these parts
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.920]   end up in China's largest electronics market.
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:21.320]   It's called Wachangbe in the technology hub of Shenzhen.
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:24.200]   So you could, Apple routinely sends undercover employees
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.680]   and contractors to hunt for buy back and trace stolen parts.
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:31.080]   - By the way, if you go there, do not eat the street meat.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:32.480]   - Street.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:34.040]   - Don't, don't do it.
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:34.880]   - Top tier.
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:35.720]   - It was sick for a week.
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:39.440]   - I think as I remember that was an initiation ritual
[01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.920]   in the Anthony Abordain TV series.
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:43.440]   When an intern came on board.
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.560]   - You have to eat the street meat.
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.080]   (laughs)
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.200]   - Just once.
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:48.040]   You don't wanna do it again.
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:51.680]   Are we gonna get an Apple card this next couple of weeks?
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:52.520]   That's the rumor.
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:54.560]   Actually, the rumor was we were gonna get it last week.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:57.440]   Remember when iOS 12.4 came out, it came out?
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:58.440]   No Apple card?
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:03:59.600]   - No Apple card, no.
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.000]   I mean, it has to be happening sooner rather than later.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.680]   I mean, the summer timeline is what was announced
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.080]   and we're kind of getting to the tail end.
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.360]   I would be surprised.
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.640]   - Well, but it's summer down under in a few months.
[01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:12.600]   - Well, if that's right, they didn't specify which hemisphere.
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:13.440]   - We could see that.
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.920]   - Right, so clearly then.
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:15.960]   (laughs)
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:18.440]   I'd be surprised if we were waiting until the September.
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:19.680]   - I think they're gonna do it soon.
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:20.520]   - Yeah, they have to.
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:21.360]   - Because employees have been using it.
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:22.200]   - Right, it's even wise.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:23.720]   - Unless there's an unknown problem.
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.000]   - Yeah.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.880]   - Titanium, so the story in the,
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.440]   according to Bloomberg and of course, Mark Herman
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.640]   has great sources inside Apple.
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.720]   That Goldman Sachs did the financial back end.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:37.640]   Apple's only real responsibilities were, of course,
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.360]   designing the titanium card
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:42.640]   and writing the software for the wallet,
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:44.600]   the wallet software that will give you budgeting
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:45.760]   and all that stuff.
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:48.880]   It's not after reading all the reviews
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:53.160]   and it's not a super great deal card.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.480]   - Well, it is if you buy a lot of Apple products.
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:56.320]   - 3% on Apple.
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:58.560]   - And it is if you use Apple Pay a lot.
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:01.480]   And I know, like I have been into mobile payments
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:04.320]   for a very long time and at least in Australia,
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.560]   it's huge everywhere you can tap to pay.
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:07.560]   Yeah, and if you pay--
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:10.520]   - Do they use watches or they use their phones mostly?
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:11.880]   - And mostly credit cards though,
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:14.040]   because all credit cards have an NFC chip
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:14.880]   and it tap to pay.
[01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:17.600]   - We were in France for the Women's World Cup in June.
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:19.360]   Oh, I'm so jealous.
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:20.840]   Did you go to US France match?
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:23.160]   - No, we were mostly in the knockout round games
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.160]   because that was Bud.
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:25.640]   - Oh, fun.
[01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:26.480]   - Scotland.
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:29.480]   That was the first, give me a ticket too.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.800]   But one of the things I noticed is on the Metro,
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:33.160]   both in Paris and in Rowan,
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:35.640]   and actually all through Paris is they were,
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:36.480]   I wouldn't say pushing,
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.440]   but all of the vendors that we ran,
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:40.600]   Apple Pay and mobile payments were the first line.
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:41.440]   And then you bring out the card
[01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:43.080]   and everyone will see like you're a peasant
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:44.080]   because you know, it's--
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:45.760]   - Well, do you take my credit back?
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:46.840]   - You're a spin ahead of us.
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:48.640]   - And I suppose Australia is true for a long time.
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.000]   - But it also occurred to me,
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.880]   this way of paying is so much more frictionless
[01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:54.760]   in dense urban habitats
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:56.840]   because you've already got a lot of mobile infrastructure.
[01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:00.040]   It's easier to get connectivity and things like that.
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.320]   And I'm wondering if-- - There's no receipts,
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.120]   no, there's signing and the swiping and all that.
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.240]   - And I think you're gonna see,
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:06.280]   I think this is a sort of a backdoor way
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:08.000]   to get more Americans on board
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.400]   and comfortable with this idea.
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.240]   'Cause I've started-- - So the card is--
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:13.320]   - A lot of mobile payments in San Francisco.
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.880]   I haven't seen it in smaller parts of the country.
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:18.000]   - The card is probably just an interim technology.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.920]   Ultimately, Apple wants you to use Apple Pay.
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:20.800]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:21.640]   - This is how you get there.
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:23.440]   - Yeah, and the card is just a nice incentive
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.800]   to have in your wallet to show off to people
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:28.000]   'cause it's a nice beautiful design titanium card
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.920]   and also if you don't have the ability to use Apple Pay,
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.800]   wherever you might be because a lot of retailers
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:34.280]   in the US still don't have it.
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.880]   Smaller retailers specifically,
[01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:37.960]   I mean, the cost to deploy, you know,
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.160]   a contactless system is substantial
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:41.920]   and you will look at the retailers that have done it,
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.880]   you know, like Walgreens was one of the first,
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:46.480]   you know, you have massive resources there to deploy.
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.360]   You know, Target's taken a long time to get there,
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.920]   but finally they have.
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:53.600]   - Our company's like Square making this happen a little faster.
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.520]   - For smaller retailers, yes.
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:57.760]   I mean, you know, you go to like food trucks
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:58.600]   or you go to school.
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.440]   - Yeah, I see Square everywhere in those places.
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:01.280]   - Yeah, but it's small.
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:03.000]   - Or you need all you use a phone and a square phone.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:03.840]   - Yes.
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:04.840]   - When you get back to the girls,
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:06.320]   you know, it all comes back to the Girl Scout cookies.
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.680]   But this past year Square actually had a partnership
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:12.360]   with the Girl Scouts where they would give us the--
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:13.520]   - And you know, as a buyer.
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:14.360]   - And a little--
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:16.320]   - I would feel more comfortable doing that.
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.160]   - Yeah.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.000]   - Then they give some strange girl
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.440]   and a green outfit cash.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:20.280]   - But you think about it,
[01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:22.600]   it was really clever how Apple to normalize the--
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.600]   - I'm in a bad place here.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.000]   You just stayed out of that one.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.840]   - Look, in the Vatican, we're still trading cheap
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:31.840]   and tulips and using gold press latin.
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:36.080]   So I have three tulip bulbs I will give you
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:37.360]   for that espresso.
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.480]   So yeah, this is the future clearly.
[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:43.000]   I'm not sure Apple Pay needs this kind of a bump.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.640]   It's doing pretty well, right?
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.480]   - No, it's--
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:48.040]   - Is it doing better than Samsung or Android touch the pay?
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:49.160]   - I think the thing here is,
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:51.440]   is if you hand somebody a card and you say,
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.760]   you have the option to use this as a card in places
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.040]   that don't accept Apple Pay.
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:55.880]   - Yeah.
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:57.560]   - But you're also tied into an Apple Pay system.
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:58.720]   - Well, they incent you because--
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:07:59.560]   - You have--
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:00.400]   - You get twice as much money back.
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:01.400]   - You have a lot of--
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:02.240]   You have a--
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.200]   You have an ability to track purchases,
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:07.520]   probably throw an app on your phone that gives you--
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:08.400]   Then this--
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:11.160]   Apple's always been about sucking you into their ecosystem
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:13.680]   and giving you a continuity of experience.
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:16.640]   And this is a way for them to habituate you
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.320]   to using them as your first line of commerce.
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:20.760]   - Yeah, and this isn't the first time we've seen,
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:23.560]   you know, a company like Apple to incentivize
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:24.920]   the reason to use a mobile wallet.
[01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:26.480]   I mean, Samsung for a very long time,
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:29.160]   with Samsung Pay has had a lot of rewards built in.
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:30.880]   So the more transactions you make,
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:32.560]   the more points you get and you can redeem
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:33.920]   those points for things.
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:37.000]   I think Google Pay has had something similar in the past.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.120]   But in terms of just getting people to use it,
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:41.600]   I mean, I still think a lot of people outside
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.600]   of people who are very tech savvy
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:46.040]   are probably a little reluctant to use mobile payments.
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.880]   And don't quite get why they would do it
[01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:50.360]   if they can just carry a credit card.
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:52.280]   So a lot of the times I talk to people,
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:54.400]   I'm like, oh, I don't bring my wallet at all.
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:55.960]   And you might have to.
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:56.800]   - Oh, nice.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:57.640]   - If I don't have to, though.
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:59.440]   - I look forward to the day there's no cash,
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:01.200]   there's no credit cards.
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:03.200]   Maybe I could have a chip embedded in my wrist.
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:04.160]   - That's already happening.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.960]   - It's gonna be interesting to see what happens
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:06.800]   to consumer debt, though.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:07.640]   - Who's doing that, though?
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:08.480]   - I think it was--
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:11.280]   - I think maybe it was Belgium somewhere.
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:14.640]   The biohackers are putting in chips
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:17.120]   that have abilities to use contactless payments
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:18.280]   and all sorts of other things.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:19.120]   I don't know if I want to--
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:19.920]   - This is an interesting area to me.
[01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:22.080]   This revolution that's happening
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:25.240]   in financial technology in FinTech is really interesting.
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:29.160]   I got an email last week from a company called,
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:32.280]   and my initial reaction was, no way.
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:33.400]   We're in 26.
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:36.040]   We're the new digital bank from Germany.
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:37.160]   You can use this now.
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:38.600]   - Yeah, I'm gonna give you my money.
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.120]   Turns out it's completely legitimate,
[01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:45.360]   and it's one of maybe a dozen new digital-only banks
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:47.440]   that you give your money to.
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:48.920]   And it's the same idea, really,
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:52.600]   is to eliminate all the friction in finance.
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:55.200]   You don't have an ATM machine.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.040]   You don't have-- - I don't know
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:56.880]   how much friction there's been, though.
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:58.520]   I mean, I understand the need to incentivize--
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.840]   - Well, I said that too when the Apple Pay came out.
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.920]   How hard is it to get out of credit cards?
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:04.960]   - When I'm in the States, I am entirely digital.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:07.480]   I don't have to have cash.
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:09.520]   And when I'm in Italy, I have to have euros,
[01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:11.160]   because there's so many places that do not do
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:13.240]   any sort of electronic transfer whatsoever.
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:15.880]   But in the States, my banking is digital.
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.880]   My credit card is digital.
[01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.520]   I use American Express, which actually does have an app
[01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:22.480]   on my phone if I wanted to pay with my phone.
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:25.360]   So for me, something like the Apple card
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:26.640]   makes absolutely no sense.
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.320]   It would be something else I have.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.160]   - You couldn't use it.
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:30.400]   - I couldn't use it, yeah.
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:32.080]   - I was in LA, I got a salad.
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:33.520]   They said, no cash.
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:35.720]   - You can't even, they don't take cash.
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:37.880]   - I remember the name of the Jo and the Java, is it?
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:38.720]   Is that the name of the--
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:39.560]   - Jo and the Juice.
[01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:40.400]   - Jo and the Juice, yeah.
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.040]   Jo and the Juice is cashless.
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.520]   - Yeah, a lot of stores in San Francisco are,
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:46.880]   but now they can't be, because you have to accept cash.
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:47.720]   So Amazon goes--
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:48.560]   - There's a law?
[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.440]   - Yeah, Amazon go, and all of the other cashless stores
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:52.160]   have to be at half to accept cash.
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:53.440]   - Who says that?
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:54.720]   That's lame.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:56.160]   Was that the San Francisco supervisor?
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:57.360]   - I think so, yes.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:00.520]   - Oh man, on your cash, it does say,
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:01.800]   it's Lissa's legal tender.
[01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:04.240]   - Yeah, they need to accept it.
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:07.040]   - The case is made, the only cash is truly anonymous.
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:10.160]   We know now, Bitcoin is not, in fact, the IRS has been
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.280]   sending little notices out to people saying,
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:14.000]   yeah, we know you made mine Bitcoin,
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.520]   and you owe taxes on that.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:16.360]   - Whoops.
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.560]   - Are they going to pay those taxes in Bitcoin?
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:19.880]   - I don't know, I don't know.
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:21.760]   - And they have to use legal tender.
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:22.600]   - Dogecoin.
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:23.600]   - Dogecoin, dogecoin.
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:24.880]   How much dogecoin do you still have?
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.720]   - I have--
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:27.520]   - You're a dogecoin millionaire for a while.
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:28.360]   - Wow.
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.680]   - It's like four million dogecoin in the end.
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:31.640]   - How much is that worth now?
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.560]   - I don't think 45 cents, I think.
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:34.400]   - Oh, wow.
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:37.320]   - No, crypto may be interesting.
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:40.120]   We've talked a lot about Libracoin, the Facebook crypto.
[01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.960]   Now, of course, Congress says you can't stop it.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.560]   There is definitely going to be a battle.
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:47.160]   Some of it, I feel like, is the entrenched
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:49.920]   in financial system incumbents who say,
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:52.240]   no, no, no, this is, we make too much money on that.
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.640]   Now, you're a young person.
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:54.960]   Do you, I pray--
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.160]   - Is that my badge now?
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:58.120]   - You're a young person, I can tell.
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:11:59.280]   - That's gonna be your chiron under--
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:02.040]   - You young people are beautiful in your cash.
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:05.600]   Typically, though, in your generation, do you use Venmo?
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:06.440]   Do you use--
[01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.680]   - A combination, this is really difficult
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:11.480]   because I, covering all of this stuff,
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:12.640]   I am across all the different platforms.
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:13.600]   - You use it all.
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:17.280]   - I have to, and to the biggest pain point for me is,
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:20.120]   okay, so I have to pay a friend, do I Venmo them?
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:23.160]   Do I use Apple Pay Cash in iMessage?
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:26.240]   Do I use Facebook Messenger to send them some money?
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.840]   Do I just give them cash, like,
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:30.040]   if I have face-to-face contact with this person?
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:31.560]   - So is this the new conversation
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:32.560]   that you always have to have?
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:33.400]   - It is.
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:34.240]   - So how do I pay you?
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:35.080]   - Yeah, how do I pay?
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:35.920]   Do you take Venmo?
[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.480]   I mean, a lot of buskers as well
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:38.920]   on the streets of San Francisco, you know,
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:39.760]   play music.
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:40.600]   - I see, yeah.
[01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:41.440]   - If they'd have an event more tag,
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:42.280]   - I just saw that the other day,
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:43.800]   it's gonna claim the street, you got a Venmo.
[01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:44.640]   - Yeah.
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.240]   - Here's my QR code, you could pay me.
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:47.760]   - Exactly, so that's the thing.
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:50.320]   - It's not as satisfying as bending down
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:51.880]   and giving the poor person a dime
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.040]   and having him safe.
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.400]   - But you see, if you have Venmo,
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.400]   then you probably give the poor 'cause it's a dime.
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:58.400]   - A shiny dime.
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:02.320]   Venmo would take 90% of that, probably.
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:04.800]   All right, so that is an issue.
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.400]   It's kind of like,
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:09.680]   do I need Netflix, you know, which subscriptions do I keep?
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:11.400]   Do you set up a cash me and a--
[01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.280]   - I have all of them unfortunately.
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:15.240]   - And it's a managed the business
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:17.120]   and you have to monitor the balances and all of them.
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:18.720]   - Well, the trick is you always make sure
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:19.960]   you have like zero balance.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:22.040]   So I never keep money in these services
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:23.400]   because that's how they make money.
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:24.240]   - That's what they want you to do.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.400]   I always put it into my bank account,
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.880]   but Venmo now charges if you put a credit card, I think.
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:31.880]   So if you have a debit transaction, it's okay.
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:34.360]   There's a lot of different stipulations
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:35.600]   that each of these services have.
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.800]   So you have to do a lot of due diligence
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:39.800]   to make sure that you're not getting charged
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:42.360]   all of these fees or that you don't have.
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:45.160]   Like someone I spoke to the other day had like,
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.720]   I think maybe almost $1,000 sitting in their vid.
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:48.560]   - Oh no, no.
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:50.440]   - I was like, don't please put it in the bank.
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.680]   Please put it in the bank, please just take it out.
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.160]   - But honestly, that's 'cause you just want
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:56.240]   to screw Venmo 'cause you're not gonna say
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:57.280]   you put the money in the bank,
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:58.800]   you're not gonna make that much money.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.040]   - Well, then Venmo makes money of you money.
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:02.400]   - Yeah, you don't like Venmo?
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.080]   - Well, why would I want that money?
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:04.920]   - It's a free service.
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:05.760]   - Why wouldn't that money?
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:07.600]   Why would it be Venmo?
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:10.600]   I could put it in a high interest savings account.
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:11.680]   - No, this is the new thing.
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.080]   And I see this a lot.
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:14.960]   It's the same thing as a cord cutter.
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:17.360]   There's this whole thing of, well, it's like me,
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:19.400]   I won't look at a banner ad when I'm on a website.
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.560]   I just don't, I've hurt my eyes.
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:25.600]   And I think we've created a society where people who are doing,
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:29.320]   I mean, we run ads, this is a reasonable way to monetize,
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:32.080]   but people, it's almost an ethical thing,
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:33.560]   like I'm not gonna look at that ad.
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:35.400]   I'm not gonna give Venmo any,
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:37.080]   I'm not gonna give them their big,
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:39.080]   but you're getting a free service.
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:40.000]   - Yeah, that's true.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.360]   - But I want them to be honest about
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:43.440]   how they're making their profit.
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:45.920]   If they told me they don't hide that interest
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.560]   off the money that you leave in your Venmo,
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:48.600]   kind of be like, okay, that's fine.
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:49.440]   - Or if they said here,
[01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:52.640]   we're doing lateral data collection to analyze
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:54.720]   when Venmo requests are the most frequent,
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:55.560]   we can break down.
[01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:56.840]   - Sure they do that as well.
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:59.080]   - I would like disclosure on how my data is used.
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:00.680]   - Well, don't you think Apple makes,
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:02.760]   don't you think Apple makes float on the money
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:03.800]   and you keep an Apple pay?
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.920]   Everybody sets it up that way.
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:08.800]   That float is their profit, isn't it?
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:11.240]   - Well, I think it's going to be,
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.080]   - Let's not allow it.
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:12.920]   - But there's one to figure.
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:14.520]   - There's a problem though, which is that we have no idea.
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:16.200]   - Free is the risk Venmo took.
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:17.640]   We don't owe them anything.
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:19.200]   - Yeah, I agree.
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:20.240]   - It's my money.
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:21.720]   I want my money in my account.
[01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:22.840]   - I mean, what does it come down to though?
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:24.800]   This is one of the things about electronic payments
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:26.160]   is there's a whole lot of data
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:28.480]   that you're giving these companies.
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:31.480]   And we have no idea how they're logging that data,
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:33.000]   how they're bundling that data to sell,
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.720]   who they're selling it to or what that data's being used for.
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:38.880]   And I'd love to see more transparency in that.
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:39.920]   I mean, at least with cash,
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:42.200]   when I hand $5 to somebody,
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.640]   they don't know where I live,
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:45.920]   they don't know what else I've been spending my money on,
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:47.760]   they don't know my name, they don't know my age,
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.760]   they don't know what else I might want to spend my money on.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:51.560]   So there's a certain appeal there
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:55.360]   because my activities are not going to be packaged
[01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:57.560]   and monetized for someone else's profit.
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:59.960]   - You know who was exceptionally good at this?
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:01.920]   Dell, they basically pioneered this.
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:05.080]   Dell, when they were selling at ridiculously low margins,
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:06.760]   they were really a financial services company
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:08.200]   because they would accept payment
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:10.560]   and they would pay all their suppliers net 90.
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:12.880]   So they would be collecting interest off this money
[01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:15.760]   for 90 days before they had to pay their suppliers.
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.640]   - I mean, when you multiply that by--
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:18.840]   - Something needs to fail.
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.200]   - Write an informative article
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:23.720]   or maybe make a YouTube video, "The Magic of Float."
[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:27.080]   Because I think, I bet you there's a whole generation,
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:30.040]   Lexi, notwithstanding that doesn't really understand
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:32.000]   that that's what's going on, right?
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.160]   What's wrong with leaving the money in there?
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:36.160]   - Well, something that feels wrong.
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:37.320]   - Yeah, feels wrong.
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:38.480]   - Mine, I want it.
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:39.600]   - It's so selfish.
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:40.960]   - I think this is a new world already.
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:42.760]   No, no, no, no, I'm not.
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.080]   Everybody's ad blocking right now.
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:47.040]   In fact, Corey Doctor, a really good piece
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:49.840]   on ad blocking at the Electronic Frontier Foundation
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:53.480]   where he's of course one of their stalwarts, smart guys.
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:56.760]   But the irony is they published this in Boing Boing,
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:59.920]   which has something like 63 trackers and ads.
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:02.960]   - And all sorts of things.
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:05.160]   The title of the article is "Ad Blocking."
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:06.400]   How about "Nad?"
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:09.840]   Not "Nad" to "Ad Blocking," but "Nad" adds in general.
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:10.920]   And I can't remember the numbers.
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:12.200]   Let me see if I could find it in the article,
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:15.520]   but it is now, I think, close to 40% of people
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:17.040]   on the internet are running ad blocking.
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.600]   - I don't block ads anymore.
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:21.400]   What I do block, I will block any site
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:23.800]   that does the tubula or those--
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:24.960]   - Oh, I hate those.
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:25.800]   I hate those.
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:26.640]   - Outbrain.
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:27.480]   - Yeah.
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:28.560]   - Just philosophically, I will not--
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:30.440]   - But don't you want to find out which vegetable
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:31.280]   the doctor is, but--
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.120]   - That's your daddy.
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:34.320]   - That's why I don't like those,
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:36.360]   because they suck me in.
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:39.000]   Every time you won't believe what these celebrities
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.280]   look like now that they're old.
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:41.120]   - And you have to--
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:42.880]   - You have to take the time to get the thing you want to--
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:43.720]   - You have to take the same--
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:44.560]   - The same, you have to take the same--
[01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:45.400]   - You have to take the same--
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:46.480]   - Stress, like that's just the--
[01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:48.200]   You don't have to know the celebrities all are good,
[01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:49.840]   because they have lots of money in those stories.
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:50.680]   - No, exactly.
[01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:51.680]   - There's no point in clicking on that story.
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:53.600]   - No, you know why they look good?
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:57.200]   They use calm.com, and now I'm going to do an ad.
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:00.480]   And this ad is going to be so wonderful and so relaxing.
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:02.160]   This ad is going to change your life
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:03.840]   that you don't want to skip this ad.
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:08.240]   You want to watch and listen to what I'm about to tell you,
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:10.280]   because it's going to make your life better.
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:12.640]   See, that's good.
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.840]   That's a good thing, and I know they're about--
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:16.320]   their people out there are going to say,
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:17.800]   "I don't care, I'm skipping it."
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:19.560]   No, no, you're going to miss out on something great.
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:23.280]   Calm.com, the number one app to reduce stress
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:27.000]   in this modern age to relax your mind to center.
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.640]   It's meditation and more.
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:30.640]   It's sleep.
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:33.760]   If you're struggling to sleep, this is an epidemic.
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:37.560]   About 33% of Americans now struggle.
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:39.160]   They don't get enough sleep.
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:41.280]   It can affect your cognitive functions during the day,
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:43.400]   learning, problem-solving, decision-making.
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:45.040]   I'm going to log into my calm.com,
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:46.840]   because I love my calm account.
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:50.400]   They have sleep stories that are so relaxing.
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:53.400]   See, I used to listen to my audiobooks,
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:55.400]   but I stopped doing it because I would miss so much
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:56.880]   when I fall asleep.
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:58.840]   And then I'd have to figure out where I was.
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:01.720]   With calm, they have sleep stories.
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:04.000]   You don't care if you miss them.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.360]   They're just very relaxing, wonderful stories
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:09.520]   by amazing people.
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:12.440]   Here, I'll play some sleep stories.
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:17.240]   Matthew McConaughey, Steven Fry.
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:19.840]   They have children's stories.
[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:23.720]   They have-- now, you wouldn't think that Jerome Flynn,
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:25.280]   the cell sword from Game of Thrones,
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:27.000]   you wouldn't think he's a relaxing guy.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.040]   Oh, no, he's got a great voice.
[01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:30.240]   But he's got this amazing--
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:31.080]   Hello there.
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:31.920]   Hi, Jerome.
[01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:33.680]   My name is Jerome Flynn.
[01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:34.600]   Yes.
[01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:38.600]   And tonight, we'll be taking a relaxing boat ride
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:41.040]   through England's picturesque waterways.
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:42.520]   Now, if you listen to this, you'll
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:45.400]   learn a lot about England's picturesque waterways.
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.400]   But you don't mind if you fall asleep halfway through.
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:50.600]   Take a moment to cozy up and get comfortable.
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:51.600]   OK, everybody.
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:53.000]   Now, if you're driving, don't do this.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.200]   Taking a few deep, relaxing breaths.
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:56.240]   Don't you, Jerome?
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:00.800]   Exhaling any tension from the day.
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:03.600]   And I love the little chug chug chug of the river boat.
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.920]   It's nice to slowly close.
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:08.080]   So you get daily meditations.
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:13.560]   You get all kinds of helpful information.
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:16.080]   And they're stretching now.
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:19.320]   They have morning stretches, evening stretches, warmups,
[01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:20.680]   cool downs.
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:22.560]   You can just have in the background
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:24.640]   some of these calm scenes running.
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:26.200]   Here's rain on leaves.
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:29.240]   Let me play the little rain on leaves.
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:30.080]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.600]   I can mix the rain in with Jerome.
[01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:35.600]   Wait, can you mix Jerome with Matthew McConaughey?
[01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:36.600]   That would be scary.
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:39.200]   I need the side of this crystal surface.
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.200]   All right.
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:42.440]   Actually, Matthew's story is really good.
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:44.320]   I really love these sleep stories.
[01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:45.920]   Here, you want to hear a little Matthew?
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:46.880]   Well, I love it there.
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.120]   Oh, there it is.
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:49.800]   There it is.
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:52.520]   Tonight, I'll be reading this special sleep story called
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:53.720]   Wonder.
[01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:57.400]   He's actually-- I've listened to this a lot of times.

[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:02.840]   help you relax, help you focus.

[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:10.680]   Tamara Levitt.
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:11.800]   She walks you through a guided meditation.
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.400]   Today, we'll be talking about empathy.
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:14.200]   Empathy.
[01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:17.000]   See, everybody needs to learn more about empathy.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:17.960]   How to be empathetic.
[01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:19.040]   Waving wheels.
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.040]   A feet of wheels.
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.560]   The feet of wheels.
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:22.520]   I love the feet.
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:24.480]   The waving feet of wheels.
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:26.680]   You're already relaxed, aren't you?
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:28.400]   I love calm.com.

[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:03.280]   It's one of my lifetime goals to do a sleep story for Calm.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:05.000]   You know, now that I've heard that, I think I do.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:05.760]   I think I do.
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:06.760]   I think I do the Apple Card.
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:07.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:09.040]   When the Apple Card be better--
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:10.400]   I'm going to trade my phone in front of my phone.
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:12.320]   Be so much better for you.

[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:25.440]   Now, it's interesting how we live in this world.
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:29.000]   Maybe we're just all teenagers that haven't grown up.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:29.760]   But just rebelling.
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:31.400]   I'm not going to give them all my money.
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:31.960]   That's me.
[01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:33.040]   I'm not going to look at that.
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:34.000]   I'm not going to walk that.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.040]   No, because teenagers don't care.
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.720]   Teenagers just want the shiny thing.
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:38.920]   I want the shiny thing.
[01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:41.320]   But I'm like, but I don't want to give them money.
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:43.920]   Do you think that is actually the state of the teenagers
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:46.080]   who care too much about everything all over the time?
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:47.200]   Everything and nothing.
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:47.640]   Yeah.
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:48.200]   It's the same.
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:49.360]   They care about an outrage.
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:49.960]   That's the one.
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:50.960]   Yeah, you faint.
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:51.600]   They're just coming.
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:52.080]   You look at that.
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.360]   They're just coming online as people.
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.920]   They've just now realized that it's an incredibly complex world
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:56.960]   with inherent unfairness.
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:58.800]   They're all, wait, what?
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:02.120]   So if a guy walks up to you on the street
[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:07.640]   and offers you $5 to take a picture of you, what would you say?
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:08.160]   Oh, no.
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:10.280]   No, absolutely not.
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:13.080]   See, everybody is so negative these days.
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:16.800]   What if you knew that he was a Google engineer who
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:19.640]   is actually trying to take pictures of people
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:21.960]   to improve their face recognition?
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:23.560]   And now definitely not.
[01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:24.560]   Yeah.
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:28.480]   You can better face me a lot more.
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:29.880]   He thinks you should pay more than $5.
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:30.960]   Google is rich.
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:32.240]   Google has so much money.
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:34.000]   And second, you know that that picture of you
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.960]   is not going to be used for just one use case.
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:38.520]   It's a piece of data that's going to be used as often
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:40.000]   as possible with more product development.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.040]   Why do people sell themselves out so cheaply?
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:44.680]   And yet, and yet, we complain constantly
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:46.760]   about face recognition technology
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:49.840]   because it's trained on white men and does a terrible job
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:52.040]   with people of color and women.
[01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:55.920]   So pay the data pool what it's worth.
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:58.400]   Where are they going to get the data pool if only white men
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:00.600]   are dumb enough to fall for the $5 gift card.
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.040]   Well, man, it looks like you've got a great data
[01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:03.560]   code on my head.
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:05.200]   I don't like that.
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.160]   That's one pool.
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:07.320]   And then actually--
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:09.320]   I would contribute, but I can't.
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:11.800]   And then, you know, hand out the cheddar for the real team.
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:15.360]   They already recognize me just fine.
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:18.560]   This was actually a great little piece in ZD net by Chris.
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:22.840]   Now, I'm going to mangle his name, Ms. Hizik, I think.
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:25.600]   Google bought my friends face for $5
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:29.360]   as they're working on a face ID for its next pixel phone.
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:30.520]   Employees are stopping people.
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:34.280]   In this case, it was in New York City.
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:38.440]   He was handed a phone and offered a $5 gift card
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:40.720]   to Amazon or Starbucks as long as he would just
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:43.760]   interact with the phone for five minutes.
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:44.920]   OK.
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:47.120]   Let me put this in a positive light.
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:49.440]   On one hand, yes, I am freaked out.
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:50.760]   I don't want any of these companies to have--
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:51.800]   I'm glad they're doing this.
[01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:52.280]   --to meet my data.
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:54.040]   But yes, how else are they going to do this?
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:56.680]   The fact that they are actually saying, no, this is a service
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:57.880]   that we're trying to develop.
[01:24:57.880 --> 01:24:58.800]   And here's some payment.
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:01.160]   Now, the payments weigh off from what I would actually want.
[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:03.680]   But at least they're recognizing, no, you're
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:04.520]   to the product here.
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:06.720]   We're actually buying something from you.
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:07.440]   It's a step.
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:10.400]   I'm just thinking back in the early Audis.
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:12.640]   There were a couple of times when my husband and I went to Vegas.
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.720]   And at one of the shopping arcades that
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:18.480]   was attached to Casino, you could be the test audience
[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:21.480]   for new TV shows that CNBC.
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:23.880]   They used to pay us $25 for 20 minutes of watching TV.
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:25.440]   And he gets to watch TV.
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:26.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:31.040]   So how has the payment dropped so dramatically?
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:31.920]   All right.
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:34.080]   And again, for a piece of data, that is endless--
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:35.600]   You know how it's dropped?
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:36.040]   --for them.
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:37.200]   It's the market.
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:38.200]   It's a market economy.
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:40.640]   Well, because we do it for five bucks, then that's what we're
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:41.280]   going to pay them.
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:42.800]   And we have all these dumb websites like upload your photo
[01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:44.520]   and see what you're going to look like when you're
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:45.360]   six years old.
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:47.160]   So did you let your kids play with that?
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:47.800]   Because it's fun.
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:48.640]   No, Jesus, no.
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:55.440]   I figured the Russians probably have plenty of images of me.
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:56.280]   Who cares?
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:58.360]   Oh, I sent them, so.
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:25:59.880]   Do you want to see what I look like?
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:01.400]   I'm ancient.
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.640]   I'm going to scare Lexi now.
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:03.480]   Let's do it.
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:04.000]   Yeah.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.440]   Let me see if I can find the picture.
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:08.800]   This is why I moved my photo album to Private Cloud.
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:10.200]   Yeah.
[01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:10.880]   Oh, no.
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:12.800]   Did you do the face aging app?
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:14.200]   Oh, wow.
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:14.920]   Face app.
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:16.200]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:17.720]   I think that's pretty accurate.
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:18.240]   That's great.
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:19.000]   And three.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000]   Good boy.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:20.600]   Good boy.
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:24.520]   The 15th cocoon three, the country.
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:25.840]   I like it.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:26.640]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:28.320]   They didn't give you anything for that.
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:29.400]   They didn't give you $5.
[01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:30.320]   They gave me that.
[01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:31.320]   They gave me that.
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.960]   Is that how it looked like when you take off that red necklace?
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:35.040]   That's actually what I look like.
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:36.440]   That's not-- I fooled you all.
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:37.400]   That's not Face ID.
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:38.440]   That's what I look like.
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:41.760]   I feel like one of the emerging aspects of digital literacy
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:42.440]   or online literacy--
[01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:43.960]   Teaching kids not to fall for that.
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:45.480]   Well, not just that, but teaching people
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:47.120]   how to value their own data.
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:50.840]   If you look at how much money companies make off of your data,
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:53.560]   either by training their AIs for services
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:56.440]   or by packaging up that data and selling to someone else who
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:00.280]   will then target you, value your personal data
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.600]   as the commodity it is.
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:04.440]   Stop giving it away for like five seconds of amusement
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:05.120]   on the web.
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:08.360]   That was my thing, which was I wasn't so put off by the app.
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:11.040]   It was an app from an app developer, whatever.
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:11.960]   You were, too much.
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.480]   You came up with it in Seattle.
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:16.880]   But stop installing all those apps on your phone
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:17.880]   that take your data.
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:18.400]   Why?
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:19.820]   You have a reason because you're actually
[01:27:19.820 --> 01:27:21.000]   reviewing this stuff.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:21.360]   But I know--
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:22.440]   But I took Facebook off.
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:23.360]   I took Instagram off.
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:24.360]   I don't want them to file on the app.
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:25.400]   Exactly.
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:29.240]   But you have so many people who have dozens, not hundreds,
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:30.120]   of apps installed.
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:30.620]   No.
[01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:31.360]   And they don't know what it's--
[01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:32.120]   Here's what they're doing.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:33.320]   How are you supposed to find out--
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:33.840]   It was telling--
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:35.880]   Tweeting, oh, don't do this.
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:36.080]   Right.
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:36.960]   With silly.
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:38.880]   But I am glad that the awareness was raised.
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:40.040]   That people started thinking about it.
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:42.760]   And I think every time I install an app, I always think, OK,
[01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:44.600]   who's going to get the data that they're going to get?
[01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:47.240]   This app is going to know where I am and do a lot of things.
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:49.400]   I downloaded a Paint by Numbers app recently.
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:52.320]   And I can only use it when I'm connected to my cellular network.
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.120]   And this confounds me because there is no reason--
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:55.000]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.480]   There's no reason whatsoever why I shouldn't be able to just go,
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:27:58.600]   think, think, think, think, think,
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:00.880]   and make the pastoral picture on my phone
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:02.080]   without having to be connected.
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:03.520]   There is.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:06.960]   There is because it's very easy to screen packets coming
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:07.960]   over your Wi-Fi network.
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:10.440]   It's far more difficult to do it if it's going over your cellular.
[01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:11.800]   So you don't know what's happening.
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:12.300]   Right.
[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:13.560]   You have to create a count of cells.
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:14.440]   They don't know what's happening.
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:16.340]   But they're sending back location information
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:17.880]   and how much you're not worth this.
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:19.800]   So I'm a little suspicious about this app now
[01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:22.360]   because, again, there's no reason why I should--
[01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:23.160]   But this is good.
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.640]   This is the kind of education.
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:25.360]   Exactly right.
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:28.200]   This is the new literacy we need to think about this stuff
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:28.800]   and use it.
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:31.080]   Then this pisses me off.
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:35.200]   Chris Hughes, who was Mark Zuckerberg's roommate
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:38.600]   and helped create Facebook, right,
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:41.720]   is now working with the feds.
[01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:44.140]   He's actually going to meetings with the Federal Trade
[01:28:44.140 --> 01:28:47.980]   Commission trying to figure out ways to break Facebook up.
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:48.980]   Oh, good.
[01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:51.500]   He has been a strong critic of Facebook.
[01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:55.620]   Now, of course, it's after he made his billions of dollars
[01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:58.300]   on Facebook.
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:02.660]   But apparently, he has joined two leading antitrust academics,
[01:29:02.660 --> 01:29:06.100]   Tim Wu, we know him from the Kill Switch or Master Switch,
[01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:07.780]   Scott Hempel of New York University,
[01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:12.180]   in meetings with the FTC and the Justice Department
[01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:14.780]   and state attorneys general, they're
[01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:19.140]   laying out a potential antitrust case against his company.
[01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:22.220]   He's no longer there, but the company he up found, Facebook.
[01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:25.780]   If I were Mark, I would be so hurt.
[01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:26.460]   That is--
[01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:27.460]   What did Mark Zuckerberg do?
[01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:28.620]   He's not hurt at this point.
[01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:29.820]   He's been betrayed by everyone.
[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:30.580]   I betrayed everyone.
[01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:33.100]   What does it feel like to be hurt?
[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:33.500]   I do not know.
[01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:35.020]   This is like these those complaining
[01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:37.100]   that we need to leave the planet because we're destroying
[01:29:37.100 --> 01:29:38.100]   your mistakes.
[01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:39.420]   You're doing it, dude.
[01:29:39.420 --> 01:29:40.420]   Exactly as a boy.
[01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:42.020]   It's only somebody with billions of dollars
[01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:45.260]   could fund some actions to help mitigate the problems
[01:29:45.260 --> 01:29:45.940]   he solved.
[01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:46.940]   Wow.
[01:29:46.940 --> 01:29:47.460]   So do you--
[01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:48.980]   It's a fatal lack of imagination.
[01:29:48.980 --> 01:29:52.260]   Is it me or do you celebrate this guy and say,
[01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:55.540]   good for you, Chris, you were Mark's friend.
[01:29:55.540 --> 01:29:57.420]   Now you've turned into a vicious enemy.
[01:29:57.420 --> 01:29:59.580]   Good for you.
[01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:00.100]   I don't know.
[01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:02.140]   This doesn't sound like someone who has suddenly
[01:30:02.140 --> 01:30:03.580]   grown a social conscience and says the same.
[01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:04.620]   It sounds like someone who has suddenly
[01:30:04.620 --> 01:30:06.620]   stuck his finger in the wind and seen which way it was below.
[01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:07.620]   I see.
[01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:09.820]   And he sees opportunity if it's broken up
[01:30:09.820 --> 01:30:12.740]   for some sort of competition and another way to arbitrage
[01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:13.940]   when he's already created.
[01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:15.900]   See, you have a devious mind.
[01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:17.060]   Well, see, I just thought--
[01:30:17.060 --> 01:30:18.300]   That's me.
[01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:21.140]   I just thought, oh, Mark must have stepped on his toes.
[01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:22.100]   He's but hurt.
[01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:24.260]   And he's just going to get him back.
[01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:26.100]   That's how low level I am.
[01:30:26.100 --> 01:30:28.060]   I wasn't thinking game of Thrones level.
[01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:30.260]   No, look, he's looking at which way the wind is blowing.
[01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:32.700]   Because Facebook is effectively this decades
[01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:35.660]   Microsoft in that it's a tech stand-in for all
[01:30:35.660 --> 01:30:38.460]   of the social and industrial anxieties people are having.
[01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:38.900]   I agree.
[01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:40.580]   Probably inappropriately, right?
[01:30:40.580 --> 01:30:42.780]   I mean, it's not just Facebook.
[01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:43.340]   It's not just Google.
[01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:45.180]   It's not just Amazon.
[01:30:45.180 --> 01:30:49.220]   But those are the ones who are going to bear the brunt of it.
[01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:51.380]   Google, by the way, has banned.
[01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:53.860]   This is angering.
[01:30:53.860 --> 01:30:56.620]   Fix it ads.
[01:30:56.620 --> 01:30:59.020]   They have banned ads for repair experts
[01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:01.620]   who can fix electronics, search for MacBook repair,
[01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:04.180]   cell phone repair, broken cell phone screen.
[01:31:04.180 --> 01:31:07.380]   And there are no advertisements.
[01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:10.460]   And this is an open letter to the Federal Trade Commission
[01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:13.020]   from Kyle Wiens of IFix.
[01:31:13.020 --> 01:31:15.260]   Actually, Kevin Purdy, who is now working for IFix.
[01:31:15.260 --> 01:31:17.260]   It's good for you, Kevin.
[01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:21.300]   About Google's ban of repair business ads.
[01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:25.940]   In October 2018, Google updated its other restricted business
[01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:27.740]   policies and banned technical support
[01:31:27.740 --> 01:31:30.980]   by third party providers for consumer technology products
[01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:32.100]   and online services.
[01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:35.980]   IFix, it's been a real champion for the right to repair movement.
[01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:37.100]   We have a right to repair.
[01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:39.100]   We own this technology.
[01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:43.180]   And it seems wrong for Google to carry water for Apple,
[01:31:43.180 --> 01:31:45.580]   John Deere, and other companies who say, no, no, no.
[01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:47.100]   You better bring your stuff into us.
[01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:50.660]   Only we can fix it.
[01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:55.100]   Maybe Google was just trying to ban spam.
[01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:56.220]   Maybe that was the point.
[01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:59.740]   Bing has not done this.
[01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:05.140]   Although there is dubious search results from Bing,
[01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:07.460]   if you search for computer repair, some of them
[01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:10.060]   are maybe not the best tools.
[01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:11.740]   I thought we had gone past this.
[01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:13.820]   I mean, this goes back to the '70s
[01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:18.580]   when car fix-it-places weren't allowed to actually do anything.
[01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:21.100]   And the federal government stepped and said, no, wait a minute.
[01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:22.100]   These people have bought it.
[01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:23.460]   This is their car.
[01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:25.500]   That's a service station that deserves the right
[01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:29.180]   to have the same manuals as the authorized service station.
[01:32:29.180 --> 01:32:30.580]   And at that point, it should have killed it.
[01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:33.340]   Now there's this attack on the right to repair.
[01:32:33.340 --> 01:32:36.020]   And I mean, that's my--
[01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:39.820]   Well, Google has not responded to this piece from I Fix It.
[01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:42.660]   Although I Fix It has pointed out that a lot of independent repair
[01:32:42.660 --> 01:32:45.100]   shops, even some of those authorized by Apple,
[01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:48.860]   are because they can't advertise on Google losing a lot of business.
[01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:53.180]   And there's a serious concern about losing these small shops,
[01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:56.900]   these mom and pop shops, because they can't get the word out.
[01:32:56.900 --> 01:32:58.740]   Well, there's currently 20 states considering
[01:32:58.740 --> 01:33:00.180]   right to repair bills on the state level.
[01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:02.180]   Right on, right on, right on.
[01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:07.300]   I'm not sure it's necessarily a bunch of constituents
[01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:09.820]   who contacted their legislators, and so I'm really angry about phones.
[01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:12.420]   I think one of the things that's been parking along
[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:14.220]   in agricultural tech for the last decade or so
[01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:16.500]   is a really nasty fight over whether or not
[01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:19.500]   farmers are allowed to repair their own John Deere tractors.
[01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:23.740]   Because agricultural tech right to repair is a huge issue now, too.
[01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:26.580]   I think it's probably them lobbying much more than the geeks.
[01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:30.180]   Yeah, but you do have right to repair is now up there the same way
[01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:33.260]   that digital privacy and data protection
[01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:35.260]   is percolating on a state level.
[01:33:35.260 --> 01:33:37.780]   So I think this is something that we're actually
[01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:42.500]   going to see a lot of in the political campaigns in 2020 as well.
[01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:46.020]   And it will be interesting to see when and how quickly Google
[01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:48.260]   either pivots on their position or modifies it
[01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:50.500]   so that they don't come off looking like the bad guys in somebody's
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:51.940]   stump ad.
[01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:52.460]   Because--
[01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:53.660]   Cars this for me, really?
[01:33:53.660 --> 01:33:54.660]   Yeah, we got a-- you guys are smart.
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:56.500]   Why is Google killing the small business
[01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:57.820]   by not letting them advertise?
[01:33:57.820 --> 01:33:58.320]   Right.
[01:33:58.320 --> 01:33:58.820]   It looks bad.
[01:33:58.820 --> 01:34:00.780]   It looks terrible.
[01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:03.660]   So is this a witch--
[01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:06.660]   the US government going after technology,
[01:34:06.660 --> 01:34:10.220]   making that the straw man the bad guy?
[01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:13.100]   We're going to see jobs lost, right?
[01:34:13.100 --> 01:34:14.580]   This is going to be a problem.
[01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:17.180]   And yet the tech sector is powering the US economy
[01:34:17.180 --> 01:34:18.460]   in many respects.
[01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:22.340]   There are probably some aspects to the probes that
[01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:25.100]   have become politicized.
[01:34:25.100 --> 01:34:26.340]   It's highly politicized.
[01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:27.340]   But there was a really--
[01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:28.020]   Look at Elizabeth Warren.
[01:34:28.020 --> 01:34:30.540]   There was a great slash terrifying Bloomberg article
[01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:34.820]   this last week talking about the future of a Pentagon
[01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:36.020]   cloud contract.
[01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:36.780]   Jedi, yeah.
[01:34:36.780 --> 01:34:39.060]   That Amazon was presumably on the fast track
[01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:43.820]   until the president decided that why should Jeff Bezos get
[01:34:43.820 --> 01:34:44.660]   that business?
[01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:46.140]   But the worst part was--
[01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:46.700]   But the point is--
[01:34:46.700 --> 01:34:49.500]   It was Oracle that lost the contract.
[01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:51.860]   Stafford Katz is-- it has an-- in the White House, though.
[01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:53.540]   And so she was able to press her case successfully.
[01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:56.320]   It was an Oracle memo saying there's
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:58.780]   no way-- they lost the bid.
[01:34:58.780 --> 01:35:01.220]   There's no way that Amazon or Google should get--
[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:01.740]   or not Google.
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:02.700]   Microsoft should get Jedi.
[01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:03.700]   Yeah.
[01:35:03.700 --> 01:35:04.200]   Yeah.
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:07.420]   And that somehow that memo that Oracle wrote that Katz wrote
[01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:08.460]   got to the president.
[01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:11.300]   Because she's visited the White House on multiple occasions
[01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:13.260]   and she's got the ear of the Oval Office.
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:15.300]   Which, by the way, IT people looking at that said,
[01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:17.980]   of course Microsoft or Amazon should have gotten that contract.
[01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:19.660]   They have the most developed products on the market.
[01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:21.100]   They've also got four data centers
[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:24.020]   a piece that are in Northern Virginia alone specifically
[01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:25.620]   designed for this kind of work.
[01:35:25.620 --> 01:35:27.960]   They've got the infrastructure in place already.
[01:35:27.960 --> 01:35:30.640]   But the broader point to the Bloomberg article
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:33.240]   was that the government procurement process, which
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:35.360]   has historically been protected by courts
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:37.880]   and has historically been practiced in such a way
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:40.640]   to take the politics out of it directly.
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:43.680]   That's been pretty severely disrupted over the last year
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:44.240]   or so.
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:48.960]   And it may be part of a larger politicization of regulation
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:50.360]   in this country when it comes to tech.
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:52.280]   You're going to have to look really carefully
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:55.360]   at who's being targeted, company-wise, who's going after them,
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:57.680]   and what the reasons are.
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:00.800]   It actually looks very politically
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:05.760]   savvy for Safra Katz, who was able to push the exact buttons
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:07.720]   that she knew the president.
[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:11.000]   The memo contains a flowchart titled
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:16.000]   "A Conspiracy," a good start, to create a 10-year DoD cloud
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:20.160]   monopoly and then has pictures of--
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:21.360]   Of course it has pictures.
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:22.080]   Look at the audience.
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:25.400]   Pictures of President Obama, Ash Carter,
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:30.640]   two previous secretaries of defense, James Mad Dog Mattis.
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:36.280]   And it's extremely cynical, if you ask me, for Katz,
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:39.360]   to put this together, make sure it gets the president's eyes,
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:44.120]   knowing that really it's propaganda targeted at one person.
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:45.040]   And it worked.
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:45.600]   And it worked.
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:46.360]   And it absolutely worked.
[01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:48.200]   Because now there's an investigation under this contract.
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:49.880]   Again, the Bloomberg piece was great.
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:51.600]   It dropped last Thursday or Friday.
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:52.840]   I'd urge people to go look for it.
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:55.360]   It's about 1,800 words long.
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:37:01.680]   And it lays out in detail exactly how this whole bid process
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:06.160]   has just gotten derailed in ways that are not typical
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:08.520]   to this kind of procurement for defense contracts.
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:10.920]   Oracle, when they lost the round--
[01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:13.360]   and we're eliminated from the bidding--
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:14.720]   sued.
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:19.960]   They alleged that rivals had an unfair advantage due
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:22.640]   to Amazon's close relationships inside the Department of Defense.
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:23.880]   Maybe it's justified.
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:24.240]   I don't know.
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:27.960]   But it's a fascinating story.
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:31.200]   And I think probably not the end of this kind of attempt
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:31.720]   to manipulate it.
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:34.920]   Now, something that you have to remember about this is Oracle's--
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:37.680]   they were specifically kicked out of the contract bidding
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:40.920]   process because they couldn't meet the requirement.
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:41.600]   They couldn't do it.
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:42.360]   They couldn't do it.
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:46.080]   So what Oracle is saying here is not, well, we could do it
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:46.800]   instead of them.
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:47.440]   No, it's just they--
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:49.000]   We want you to break it up.
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.360]   We want you to have--
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:51.880]   We want you to change the requirements
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:52.640]   so that we qualify.
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:53.680]   We can do it.
[01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:58.000]   Which is, again, from an IT standpoint, is not a great idea.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.080]   I don't want multiple vendors to be
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:02.360]   able to blame each other for when my system goes down,
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:04.280]   especially if it's mission critical to the safety
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:07.120]   of the United States.
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:07.960]   But that's just me.
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:09.400]   And again, a lot of these contracts
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:11.800]   also depend on pre-existing depth of expertise.
[01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:13.560]   And Microsoft has that.
[01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:15.720]   And Amazon has that at this point, too.
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:18.640]   Google is not in the running because they withdrew from it.
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:22.680]   This is the jet-eye contract that Google's employees
[01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:24.720]   or engineers said, we don't want to be doing this kind of--
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:27.760]   And honestly, Google wasn't well-suited for this.
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:29.360]   There's two companies on this planet
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:31.680]   that can do this from bottom to the top.
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:32.920]   And that's Amazon and Microsoft.
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:34.280]   $10 billion contract.
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:35.920]   It's a very valuable contract.
[01:38:35.920 --> 01:38:40.440]   And look, you can dislike, in an ideal world,
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:43.160]   even if the person who can yay or nay this
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:46.320]   dislikes the company or the CEO, what they can also do
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:48.840]   is say this is an area where they already
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:51.280]   have the depth of expertise that you need.
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:52.880]   The security clearances are already in place.
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:54.680]   The infrastructure's in place.
[01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:57.520]   It will be fewer man hours and fewer resources
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:58.320]   to guess what we want.
[01:38:58.320 --> 01:38:59.320]   It's good for the government.
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:00.520]   It's good for the people.
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:02.760]   The president who's got such a grasp of cyber
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:04.320]   will be reviewing this contract.
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:05.400]   It's powerful.
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:07.760]   And letting us know whether it's just like--
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:08.440]   What is jet-eye?
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:10.880]   Jet-eye is-- I know what it stands for,
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:11.920]   but I don't know.
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:15.680]   Is it the kind of the traditional cloud infrastructure?
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:17.640]   But this is what the Defense Department--
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:21.280]   is the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, JEDI.
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:23.680]   So imagine some of the problems that we've had with data
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:25.560]   leakages over the past 20 years, where
[01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:27.000]   you've got independent contractors who
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.680]   keep a little data silo.
[01:39:28.680 --> 01:39:30.280]   And then someone breaches that.
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:34.160]   And suddenly, China has all the data about the R35 fighter.
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:37.520]   Jet-eye is designed to put all of that into a secure enclave
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:41.760]   that is controlled by a set of rules that works for everybody.
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:45.600]   So it's a Pentagon cloud, specific cloud or size.
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:47.760]   So rather than every contractor rolling their own,
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:49.280]   they will be required to use jet-eye,
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:51.240]   which means all the people accessing it
[01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:55.120]   will need to work according to the security policies of jet-eye.
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:58.040]   So in theory, it's a really good idea.
[01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:00.720]   I've talked to security pros who work in the defense sector
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:01.520]   around the area.
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:03.520]   And this is something they all want.
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:06.440]   Because in addition to the technical considerations
[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:08.760]   that we've outlined, it also makes it easier for people
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:12.600]   to understand security and to work in a way where they reduce
[01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:15.360]   the risk of human error in the security process.
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:17.600]   And it keeps people from doing something like, hey,
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:20.280]   you know that file you need for the next design of something
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:21.240]   that's something that's--
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:21.240]   Exactly.
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:22.680]   I think the drop-- here's the link.
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:23.520]   Just download it.
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:26.080]   No, because that stuff happens now.
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:28.240]   At least, up to now, it was going
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:31.600]   to be awarded sometime in the next few weeks.
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:34.000]   Now the new Defense Secretary Mark Esper
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:37.040]   and the president have said that they want to investigate,
[01:40:37.040 --> 01:40:40.040]   perhaps start over, you know, scuttle the process.
[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:40.560]   And--
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:42.160]   It's going to come down to the same two vendors.
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:42.960]   It really is.
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:46.560]   It also depends on how many more congressional reps
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:48.560]   decide to get involved in this fight one way or the other.
[01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:50.640]   Because I can't imagine that anybody who
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:52.960]   reps, Northern Virginia, is going to sit on the side--
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:55.240]   Ron Johnson, Marco Rubio, have also
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:58.440]   written Letters to the Pentagon Raising Concerns.
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:40:59.280]   Come on.
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:02.160]   It is a shame when you start to politicize stuff,
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:03.240]   technical stuff like this.
[01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:05.840]   On the same token, I think it should be fair.
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:08.080]   Look, tech is inherently political in a lot of ways,
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:12.840]   because either it can introduce, perpetuate, or exacerbate
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:14.880]   power imbalances that are there already,
[01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:16.960]   or economic imbalances that are there already.
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:20.000]   We had a really good comment in the chat room earlier
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.280]   when we were talking about Apple Pay and things
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:25.160]   saying that a cashless life is, in many ways,
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:27.880]   an economic privilege.
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:30.120]   Because not everybody has access to the tech
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:30.840]   or the infrastructure.
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:31.600]   That's right.
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:33.640]   So again, tech is inherently political.
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:36.360]   What the question should be right now
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:40.240]   is when the US government starts looking at antitrust cases
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:42.880]   or anti-competitiveness cases, what
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:48.280]   are the motivations for bringing those cases to the investigatory
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:48.760]   stage?
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:50.040]   What do they hope in to get out of it?
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:52.080]   And who's driving this?
[01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:52.600]   Why are they driving this?
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:57.160]   There is pressure from Congress to also move forward on Jedi,
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:04.120]   including four GOP members of the House Armed Services Committee.
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:06.880]   The committee-- this is a Texas representative,
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:10.000]   Mac Thornberry, who wrote a letter to the president,
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.720]   urging him to move forward as quickly as possible
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:13.760]   with the award.
[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:16.040]   Our committee has conducted oversight of this contract
[01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:17.640]   from the beginning.
[01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:19.200]   As you know, the courts have upheld
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:21.400]   the DOD's handling of the competition.
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:24.560]   While it's understandable that some of the companies competing
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:26.400]   for the contract are disappointed at not being
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:29.040]   selected as one of the finalists, further delays
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:31.360]   will only damage our security and increase
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:33.360]   the cost of the contract.
[01:42:33.360 --> 01:42:34.480]   That's a Republican, by the way.
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:38.840]   So it's another battle.
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:40.120]   Every time that this has happened,
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:41.960]   it has always increased the cost of the contract.
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:44.400]   Yeah.
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:46.240]   So it's an interesting idea.
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:49.000]   So up to now, the Pentagon has not had its own commercial cloud.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.600]   This is something new.
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:51.960]   They've cobbled it together.
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:55.200]   They've used clouds that have been created by their contractors.
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:58.640]   And again, whenever you do that, that's when you--
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:42:59.640]   Well, we've seen breaches.
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:00.160]   --we've seen breaches of data.
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:01.920]   From their perspective to, I think, part of it
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:04.840]   was if we try out this one vendor who does things well,
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:05.360]   that's great.
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:07.840]   We can roll it out to more places if they don't do well.
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:10.360]   Yeah, what about a multi-homed cloud?
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:14.080]   I mean, maybe that's too hard to do.
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:16.280]   You're not really-- the cloud part, the storage part,
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:16.840]   is easy.
[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:19.600]   What you want is you want a company that has experience
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:22.480]   with zoning off information and making sure users are only
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:24.200]   in places they're supposed to be.
[01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:27.000]   And it's always the user's always the most complicated part.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:27.800]   Always.
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:30.000]   My mom used to be the security officer
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:34.200]   at one of the facilities for a BAE, British Aerospace.
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:36.920]   And it was the non-lethal weapons division.
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:39.880]   And the things that she told me about the protocol
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:42.200]   she had to put downward by the end of her tenure,
[01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:43.400]   she was checking for thumb drive.
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:44.720]   She had to confiscate smart folks.
[01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:45.720]   Can you imagine?
[01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:47.280]   People came in.
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:49.960]   And people who worked-- people who, in theory, design
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:51.560]   weapons that are very smart, literally,
[01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:53.840]   like she had to have a talk with one guy repeatedly
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:54.920]   as to why he couldn't start--
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:57.120]   he couldn't watch porn at work and click on banners.
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:43:59.160]   Like this is the kind of stuff--
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:43:59.160]   No.
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:03.000]   --security pros in top secret environments actually deal with.
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.080]   Or having an NSA consultant who thinks
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:07.440]   it's OK for him to bring files to home to work on.
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:07.440]   Yeah.
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:08.440]   It's like, whoa.
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:08.440]   Yeah.
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:09.440]   That's not really good.
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:09.940]   That's not really good.
[01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:10.440]   Yeah.
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:12.520]   No, it's amazing what--
[01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:15.360]   the user is always the area where you really
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:17.440]   need to do a lot of work.
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:19.080]   Let's take a little break.
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:21.040]   We've got a few more things to talk about,
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:22.080]   including a smart diaper.
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:25.160]   But before we get to the smart diaper story,
[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:26.840]   I'd like to play a little video.
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:29.280]   I think Victor made this for us of some of the things
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:31.200]   you might have missed if you missed anything this week.
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:32.520]   Onto it.
[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:34.520]   Previously, onto it.
[01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:34.920]   What about--
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:35.400]   What about--
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:36.680]   So we've got earnings and regulation.
[01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:38.040]   Now these earnings are on the PlayStation.
[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:39.840]   Let's do something fun.
[01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.440]   We're going to talk about licensing later.
[01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:44.040]   So we've got the holy trinity right here.
[01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:46.360]   You've made any plans for your end of life.
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:46.880]   Yeah.
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.280]   I mean, I know people will love you
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:50.280]   that need to be protected.
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:51.560]   iOS today.
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:54.200]   Today, we're going to talk about privacy,
[01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:57.520]   using your iPad or your iPhone, your Apple Watch, your Apple
[01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:01.600]   TV, and yet even your computer in a more private way.
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:03.120]   This week in Google.
[01:45:03.120 --> 01:45:05.600]   Did you hear the story about someone who apparently
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:10.920]   was propositioned $5 for a face scan by a Google employee?
[01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:14.320]   So apparently, your face is only worth $5.
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:15.680]   They got a quality relation.
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:20.440]   Where and how should societal values, democratic values,
[01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:23.880]   be embedded into these different platforms that
[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:25.920]   are shaping democratic societies?
[01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:29.760]   We need to get faster, tougher, and hold
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:32.200]   the feet of these executives to the fire in terms
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:34.880]   of whether they have responsibilities that go
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:36.960]   beyond the bottom line.
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:38.160]   Security now.
[01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:42.880]   If you visit any article on the Washington Post's website,
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:46.360]   using Chrome's incognito mode, you'll
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:48.720]   be greeted with a message, quote,
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:52.400]   "private browsing is permitted exclusively
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:54.680]   for our subscribers."
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:56.080]   Wait, what?
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:56.640]   Twitter.
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:46:00.120]   Join the chat room and watch us watching you.
[01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:02.040]   It's the Tin Hat Brigade here at--
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:02.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:03.040]   It's Twitter.
[01:46:03.040 --> 01:46:04.240]   I like my team hat.
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:07.920]   You know, I used to be a guy that privacy shmivacy.
[01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:10.640]   Now, I think we've all learned a little bit.
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:11.960]   I've got ultimate privacy.
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:14.520]   I've got a system that's not connected to anything,
[01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:16.440]   including power.
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:17.640]   It's probably not that useful.
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:19.960]   Our definition of tablet is different than you.
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:20.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:23.080]   Oh, you have the stone tablets, I understand.
[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:28.520]   Are sure they brought to you by worldwide technology, WWT.
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:30.160]   And they're ATC.
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:32.040]   I like these-- this is enterprise, right?
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:33.280]   It's all acronyms, right?
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:35.960]   ATC is their Advanced Technology Center.
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:38.080]   This is so, so cool.
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:41.160]   I remember years ago, Jim Latterback at Patrick Norton
[01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:44.920]   and I spent some time in Ziff Davis's Labs in Foster City.
[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:47.120]   Remember those days where they had these great labs
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:48.720]   and they taste, test stuff?
[01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:49.800]   Those days are long gone.
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:52.640]   But thank goodness, WWT has effectively
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:55.680]   created an even better lab in their headquarters
[01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:57.200]   or world headquarters in St. Louis.
[01:46:57.200 --> 01:47:00.240]   Half a billion dollars in equipment
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:02.840]   from all the big OEMs and the little ones too.
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:07.080]   You've got Dell EMC, you've got VMware, you've got Intel,
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:08.640]   you've got disruptors, new companies
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:11.440]   like Tanium and Equinix and Expanse.
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:14.080]   And the thing is, when you're buying enterprise technology,
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:15.560]   you've got to know it's all going to integrate
[01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:17.600]   with your existing technologies.
[01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:19.400]   You've got to know how it's going to integrate,
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:20.880]   how it's going to work.
[01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:23.000]   WWT is your trusted partner.
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.320]   They've been with you over the years.
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:25.160]   They're going to stay with you.
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:29.000]   I think many customers have been with WWT for over 10 years
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:30.520]   because they know that's where they can go
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:32.560]   to get the answers they need to make sure
[01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:34.000]   their businesses run right.
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.960]   WWT's engineers use this lab every day,
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:41.000]   beta testing new equipment, building reference architectures,
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.520]   custom integrations so they can help customers
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:44.800]   make the right decisions.
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:47.600]   See results faster with much less investment
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:49.080]   but here's the best part.
[01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:51.920]   You can use it too.
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:54.600]   The ATC is an incubator for IT innovation
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:56.920]   and offers and users, people like you,
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:48:00.160]   hundreds of on-demand integrated solutions at labs
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:02.160]   representing the newest advances
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:04.600]   and everything from flash storage,
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:06.600]   hyper converged infrastructure,
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:09.640]   hybrid cloud and analytics, infrastructure automation,
[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:13.240]   data protection, all the things that are so complicated
[01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:16.000]   to integrate in and so important to your business.
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.200]   You've got to learn about these things before you launch
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:21.400]   and this is where you can spin up proofs of concept.
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:23.160]   You can pilot programs.
[01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:27.000]   You can use their sandbox so you can choose the right solution.
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:30.440]   Reduce concept time from months to weeks.
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:33.800]   Get into the market, get your stuff running
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:37.040]   and this is all available as a lab as a service.
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:41.400]   A dedicated lab space within the ATC for you, the customers
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:44.240]   so you can perform programmatic testing using all of those
[01:48:44.240 --> 01:48:47.480]   amazing tools that vast technology ecosystem
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:51.600]   WWT's put together, half a billion dollars in equipment.
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:52.960]   Little later this summer they're going to launch
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:55.040]   a new digital platform with hands on access
[01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:56.840]   to more than 200 lab environments.
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:49:00.000]   You can get early access right now, pre-launch access.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.280]   If you go to www.t.com/twit.
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:06.640]   Their amazing advanced technology center,
[01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:09.600]   they built it for you and you can use it.
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:11.240]   You can even get pre-launch access
[01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:14.800]   if you go to www.t.com/twit.
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:17.680]   WWT simplifies the complex.
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:22.000]   www.t.com/twit delivering business and technology outcomes
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:26.160]   around the world and I'm really pleased to have them
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:27.600]   as a sponsor of this show.
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:30.640]   See I told you I don't know anything about Enterprise
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:33.120]   but we have a lot of people, a lot of Enterprise listeners.
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:34.280]   Enterprise is the future.
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:35.520]   It's the future man.
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:36.560]   Literally it's the future.
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:37.680]   But you see in the Enterprise,
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:39.480]   you'll soon see in the consumer market.
[01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:42.840]   Yeah, we're going to have Twitch at I soon.
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:44.040]   Twitter, Twitter.
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:45.640]   (laughing)
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:46.960]   Do not.
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:49.360]   You know I think this is kind of a standard thing.
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:51.360]   If a company comes along and says,
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:55.280]   would you like to install our app on your phone?
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:57.640]   'Cause we'd like to know more about what you think
[01:49:57.640 --> 01:49:59.040]   and what you do.
[01:49:59.040 --> 01:49:59.880]   Do not.
[01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:02.280]   ComScore, familiar with ComScore.
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:04.600]   They are a useful company for a lot of people
[01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:06.400]   trying to know how their websites are used.
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:07.520]   They do analytics.
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:10.960]   They have a product for macOS called Premier Opinion.
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:16.600]   Voice 5 distributes it.
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:19.520]   An arrow, a security company published this article saying,
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:22.360]   it's man in the middle proxy software installs.
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:24.360]   You'd appreciate this, Father Robert.
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:25.280]   Oh my goodness.
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:28.960]   A proxy on ports 8888-8443-8254
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:31.800]   captures all the machines SSL and TLS traffic.
[01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:33.360]   It's based on all of your traffic.
[01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:34.960]   All of your traffic.
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:37.600]   It's a bundled application that's offered along
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:39.880]   with the installation flow of other software proxies.
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:41.320]   It's one of those where you go,
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:44.240]   hey, use our downloader when you're downloading this.
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:47.920]   Oh, and it's gonna install this fabulous Premier Opinion.
[01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:50.520]   It installs its own local system certificate
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:53.680]   with any application that automatically trusts it
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:56.640]   at this point with all user traffic going through its proxy.
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:51:00.920]   Premier Opinion decrypts all the SSL traffic in the proxy
[01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:03.320]   so that even if you think you're secure,
[01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:05.160]   they could see everything you're doing,
[01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:06.960]   including emails, banking information,
[01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:07.880]   governmental websites.
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:09.960]   This is why you need Jedi, by the way,
[01:51:09.960 --> 01:51:11.440]   and potentially beyond.
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:15.280]   So just a little, I thought I'd pass along this warning.
[01:51:15.280 --> 01:51:17.600]   This is kind of like maybe a little bit
[01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:19.500]   like Lenovo's Superfish.
[01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:23.400]   That kind of, it's been around for decades.
[01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:25.280]   Superfish broke SSL.
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:26.200]   This looks like it's--
[01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:27.040]   It doesn't--
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:27.960]   It breaks in.
[01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:29.160]   But it breaks in a good way.
[01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:30.000]   Right.
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.120]   So they must have replaced--
[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:31.960]   They must have a certificate.
[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:32.800]   They must have a certificate.
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:35.080]   They put a certificate on your system.
[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:35.920]   Okay.
[01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:36.760]   No.
[01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:38.320]   See, this company must be destroyed.
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:39.160]   Yeah.
[01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:40.960]   (laughing)
[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:44.720]   But the real warning is it may not seem to be coming
[01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:46.520]   from ComScore.
[01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:48.960]   It's being distributed, for instance,
[01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:53.240]   if you use a BitTorrent product called BitLord, okay?
[01:51:53.240 --> 01:51:57.440]   When you download it, there's a little thing here.
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:59.800]   It says, "Oh look, we're gonna,
[01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:01.920]   "premier opinion is part of an online market research community.
[01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:03.440]   "We've got too many members worldwide.
[01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:06.080]   "It's voluntary, but if you wanna accept this,
[01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:08.080]   "you can download it while you download BitLord."
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:08.920]   Yeah.
[01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:10.480]   This is why we can't have nice things.
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:11.320]   Mm.
[01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:12.160]   (laughing)
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:13.440]   Just, I thought I'd pass that along.
[01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:14.600]   I think our audience is--
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:16.880]   It's not just for phones, folks.
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:18.720]   Don't download any software on anything.
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:19.880]   Hey, here's some good news.
[01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:21.120]   (laughing)
[01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:23.680]   Actually, that is my new recommendation.
[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:25.160]   It's software.
[01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:26.120]   Only install you.
[01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:27.400]   Absolutely no you need.
[01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:29.600]   So too many of us, like hobbyists,
[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:31.000]   we just install everything.
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:32.040]   You know what this computer is for?
[01:52:32.040 --> 01:52:32.880]   I want everything.
[01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:33.720]   It's a solitaire.
[01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:34.560]   That's it, that's it.
[01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:35.400]   Mm-hmm.
[01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:36.240]   That's all it does.
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:41.240]   The house Wednesday passed a measure banning robocalls.
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:44.240]   It's nice when you hear the house voting for something.
[01:52:44.240 --> 01:52:47.240]   429 to three.
[01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:48.240]   I wanted, who are the three?
[01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:49.240]   Three of those three.
[01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:51.080]   Who likes robocalls?
[01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:51.920]   I like the like, they just--
[01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:54.080]   Those are the only calls I get.
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:54.920]   (laughing)
[01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:55.760]   You don't stop me.
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:56.680]   (laughing)
[01:52:56.680 --> 01:52:58.720]   How would you, how would you,
[01:52:58.720 --> 01:53:02.360]   how would you justify to your constituency voting against
[01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:04.680]   the stopping bad robocalls act?
[01:53:04.680 --> 01:53:07.400]   Your constituency are the people who are setting up the best.
[01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:08.520]   Robocallers.
[01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:10.400]   Yeah, that's the definition of constituency.
[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:12.880]   Who gave me the biggest bag of money this week?
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:17.480]   Stop the Stop Bad Robocalls act passed.
[01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:19.480]   Who knows if it'll get voted on in the Senate.
[01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:21.760]   $10,000 per violation.
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:22.600]   Yeah.
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:25.840]   They weren't really enforcing the $1,500 per violation.
[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:28.080]   So the Senate did pass a similar measure,
[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:30.720]   the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement
[01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:33.600]   and Deterrence Act, which by the way is an acronym
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:35.360]   that spells traced.
[01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:38.000]   They passed that 97 to one.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.800]   I'm surprised they don't have shield yet.
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:41.360]   Yeah.
[01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:43.440]   They have shaken and stir.
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:44.680]   Do they have to turn it out again?
[01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:47.000]   You don't know about shaken and stir?
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:47.840]   Isn't that great?
[01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:50.200]   Those are the anti-robo call protocols.
[01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:51.400]   Shaken and stirred.
[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:52.760]   The authentication protocols.
[01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:55.160]   In fact, I think T-Mobile's already started to use it,
[01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:59.480]   that it'll provide authentication for.
[01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:01.360]   This call came from our network.
[01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:02.200]   Okay.
[01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:03.200]   From one of our subscribers.
[01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:05.040]   I think I can't remember which does it.
[01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:06.720]   This one's the shake in which one's the stir.
[01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:08.560]   Shaken stands for Secure Handling
[01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:10.320]   of Asserted Information Using Tokens.
[01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:11.160]   Oh, naturally.
[01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:16.160]   Of course, stir, secure telephony identity revisited.
[01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:19.960]   There's a James Bond fan who really cared about the retronim.
[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:22.760]   Now that's one of the nice things about being an
[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:24.400]   18-10-robo-post.
[01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:25.240]   Not at all.
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:26.080]   None.
[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:28.320]   Is there a law against it or they just haven't figured it out yet?
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:31.600]   Well, I mean, because the only US number that works for me
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:32.920]   is my Google Voice number.
[01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:34.920]   And I get no robocalls on my Google Voice number.
[01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:36.720]   I get no calls.
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:38.960]   That's the famous last words I'm probably now going to get a lot.
[01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:40.160]   Yeah, now everyone's going to be calling.
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:41.760]   What if the calls are coming from Google after a while?
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:43.640]   What if the calls are coming from inside?
[01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:45.640]   (laughing)
[01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:48.440]   Oh, let's see here.
[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:50.880]   I guess we can do the diapers.
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:51.800]   Yes.
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:53.680]   Finally we get that.
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:54.520]   Oh.
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:57.960]   So it seems like a bad idea.
[01:54:57.960 --> 01:55:01.880]   I think, no, it's been a long time since I changed the diaper.
[01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:04.360]   But I think you pretty much usually know when they're full.
[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:07.960]   I think you have a sixth sense as a parent.
[01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:08.960]   Right, Liza?
[01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:09.800]   Am I wrong?
[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:11.520]   Can I tell a quick CES story?
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:12.360]   Yes.
[01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:15.840]   Because I read, so a few years ago when I was at CES,
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:19.000]   I was talking to somebody who had a little sensor.
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.200]   You were to clip into the child's diaper.
[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:22.800]   And then when the child's diaper got wet,
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:25.240]   the sensor would ping the smartphone.
[01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:26.080]   Yes.
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:26.920]   And then tell you.
[01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:27.760]   That's this.
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:29.320]   And then tell, oh, the baby's what, time to change the diaper.
[01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:30.600]   And I said, that's great.
[01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:33.520]   How many users does it ping at this too?
[01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:35.120]   And they said, oh, just one.
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:37.840]   And I said, so what you've done is you've created a device
[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:40.240]   that guarantees one person is forever responsible
[01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:42.040]   for changing diapers.
[01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:43.960]   Mom, what's wrong with that?
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:44.800]   Mom?
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:46.200]   Or you have the diaper phone.
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:47.960]   It just passed it back and forth.
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:49.280]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:50.800]   It's like the talking stick.
[01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:51.640]   You got the diaper phone.
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:52.480]   You got the diaper phone.
[01:55:52.480 --> 01:55:54.360]   It was just such a weird,
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:56.440]   it was just such a weird thing to me because also,
[01:55:56.440 --> 01:55:58.800]   if you have a baby or a toddler who's in daycare
[01:55:58.800 --> 01:56:01.320]   and they have diapers there, what are you supposed to do?
[01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:02.480]   To get pinged at work all day?
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:05.240]   They must have had, because Huggies did this in Korea last year.
[01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:07.240]   So they must have had the Korean Huggies.
[01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:11.000]   So the question I have about this whole Pamper system
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:14.280]   is, again, is the relationship going to be just one person?
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:15.200]   Gets alerts?
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:17.160]   No, that would be foolish.
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:20.200]   Or are they going to recognize that many children are raised
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:22.240]   in a household with more than one adult
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:23.360]   who's responsible for them?
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:25.440]   The alert thing is the easy thing to understand.
[01:56:25.440 --> 01:56:27.680]   What they're really selling is they want this to be a data
[01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:30.840]   collection point so that you can give to your doctor.
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:32.840]   This is what my child's bowel movements look like.
[01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:33.840]   No.
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:36.160]   Well, that doesn't take a picture.
[01:56:36.160 --> 01:56:37.400]   No.
[01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:39.560]   No, there are already apps though where--
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:41.200]   I forget the name of the app that I actually
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:43.760]   used for the first three or four months of my daughter's life
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:46.440]   where I logged--
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:47.120]   Sleep patterns.
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:49.560]   Well, I logged every feeding how often I was feeding her,
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:50.560]   how long a feeding lasted.
[01:56:50.560 --> 01:56:52.080]   Why did you do that?
[01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:53.880]   Because I was a freaked out for so much.
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:54.520]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:56:54.520 --> 01:56:55.600]   That's the real reason.
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:56:58.080]   No, but it was also useful because I did nurse.
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:56:59.560]   And so it was a handy way to--
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:01.120]   because after all, I was like, oh, so--
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:04.320]   When Jennifer was pregnant with our first abbey,
[01:57:04.320 --> 01:57:07.000]   I handled my anxiety by writing a hypercard stack
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.280]   with which to time contractions.
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:09.800]   Oh, there you go.
[01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:12.960]   I went out the window almost immediately.
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:16.200]   It was nice to have the data and actually track
[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:18.160]   how often feedings were happening,
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:20.640]   how long her sleep intervals were when I was changing
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:21.520]   diaphragmings like that.
[01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:22.680]   Actually, this will do this.
[01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:27.520]   So weirdly, the one in Korea will send you a text alert
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:30.440]   when your child is pooped.
[01:57:30.440 --> 01:57:31.160]   Like you don't need to do that.
[01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:32.920]   Again, something you don't really need to know.
[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:37.200]   Pampers will only track urine, not bowel movements.
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:40.760]   But pampers will track sleep as well.
[01:57:40.760 --> 01:57:43.160]   And I think that actually maybe is more useful.
[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:45.160]   The loomie by Pampers line--
[01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:46.640]   Pampers says there's a wait list.
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:48.120]   It'll be launching in the US's fall,
[01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:50.520]   has an activity sensor that secures
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:53.920]   to a quote landing on the front of the baby's diaper.
[01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:58.240]   It comes with a baby monitor and a 10 day supply of diapers.
[01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:04.160]   There's also an app to log the kids' P and identify patterns.
[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:05.320]   This is really--
[01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:06.520]   This is helicoptering parenting.
[01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:08.120]   Well, one of the things I want to point out
[01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:10.680]   is there's a real pressure in US parenting right now
[01:58:10.680 --> 01:58:11.840]   to quote unquote sleep training--
[01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:13.560]   to sleep train your baby.
[01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:15.160]   And one of the reasons there's that pressure
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:18.400]   is because an increasing number of parents in the US
[01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:21.040]   don't have the luxury of having somebody who can stay
[01:58:21.040 --> 01:58:23.600]   with the baby and not have to go to work the next day.
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:24.120]   Yeah, that's why.
[01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:25.840]   And so sleep training is effectively
[01:58:25.840 --> 01:58:27.520]   you trying to get the baby to sleep.
[01:58:27.520 --> 01:58:28.680]   Regularize the sleep.
[01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:30.520]   So that workers aren't so exhausted.
[01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:32.400]   And what this tool is effectively
[01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:35.240]   is it's a way to say, oh, we can reduce the baby
[01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:37.000]   to a set of data that has needs.
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:38.320]   Apparently, this isn't the first there.
[01:58:38.320 --> 01:58:40.560]   Connected onesies at double asleep trackers
[01:58:40.560 --> 01:58:42.760]   is a robotic crib.
[01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:45.280]   And there are needs to track some children's sleeps,
[01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:47.120]   especially if they're premature and they've
[01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:48.360]   had breathing difficulty.
[01:58:48.360 --> 01:58:51.160]   For example, there are mattresses for that
[01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:53.080]   and there are onesies for that because some babies
[01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:55.000]   do have to be taught how to breathe.
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:58.400]   The app we display one of three diaper statuses, dry, wet,
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:00.680]   or very wet.
[01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:01.200]   Good.
[01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:04.200]   Parents, Pampers Spokesman told CNN business,
[01:59:04.200 --> 01:59:06.800]   parents didn't ask for a poo or pee alarm.
[01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:09.560]   They wanted something more like the smart watches of today.
[01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:11.920]   The activity sensor tracks baby sleep.
[01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:13.280]   And since it's there on the diaper,
[01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:14.320]   well, I can also track what that's wet.
[01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:15.760]   They want to be like a smart watch.
[01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:17.400]   Are they going to allow you to gamify?
[01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:19.480]   Can you complete with other parents?
[01:59:19.480 --> 01:59:23.280]   Yeah, I think you filled its rings today.
[01:59:23.280 --> 01:59:25.760]   Several times.
[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:27.080]   I see what the yellow rings for.
[01:59:27.080 --> 01:59:29.680]   What's the brown rings?
[01:59:29.680 --> 01:59:34.440]   OK, but from the business side, this is Pampers starter.
[01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:37.360]   They want-- because diapers, that makes sense.
[01:59:37.360 --> 01:59:39.720]   But you could see they want to sell you the baby monitors.
[01:59:39.720 --> 01:59:40.920]   They want to sell you the cameras.
[01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:43.080]   They want to sell you the little connected temperature
[01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:46.120]   strip so that you can keep a running log of your baby's
[01:59:46.120 --> 01:59:47.400]   temperature.
[01:59:47.400 --> 01:59:51.560]   They see so much money because over the last 10 years,
[01:59:51.560 --> 01:59:54.160]   baby tech has become its own pavilion at CES.
[01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:56.520]   It generates millions of dollars.
[01:59:56.520 --> 01:59:58.200]   And Pampers feels left out because they've
[01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:01.320]   got the old dumb Pampers.
[02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:02.280]   Kathy, you heard--
[02:00:02.280 --> 02:00:03.880]   Well, the problem with Pampers is that you
[02:00:03.880 --> 02:00:06.000]   don't have a lifelong customer base.
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:09.200]   Your customer base ages out of the product optimally.
[02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:10.200]   And if you have--
[02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:11.080]   The funny thing is, even if you have--
[02:00:11.080 --> 02:00:12.080]   They can age back in.
[02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:13.480]   They just out at ages in.
[02:00:13.480 --> 02:00:15.400]   But even if you have multiple children,
[02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:16.840]   you're only going to be buying diapers
[02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:18.000]   for a finite period of time.
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.680]   But if you've got all this data on how your kid is doing,
[02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:23.920]   then this gives them an opportunity to spin off products
[02:00:23.920 --> 02:00:26.200]   that they can then use to touch the family
[02:00:26.200 --> 02:00:27.520]   at different reflection points and spending.
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:28.280]   That's the concern.
[02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:30.280]   CNN talked to Kathy Hersh-Basek, president
[02:00:30.280 --> 02:00:32.960]   of the International Society for Infant Studies.
[02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:35.680]   The more we have analytics on babies, the more we worry,
[02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:38.040]   it actually matters that we've calculated this.
[02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:41.320]   This creates a frenetic feeling when you're a parent.
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:44.720]   And that is the problem, which is you can get nutty.
[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:47.080]   From the data privacy side, I am always
[02:00:47.080 --> 02:00:49.080]   worried whenever one of these traditional companies
[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:51.560]   seems to make a play for the Internet of Things,
[02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:54.000]   because, yes, it's great to have the data.
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.800]   Do you know how to secure the data?
[02:00:55.800 --> 02:00:59.400]   And increasingly, that answer is no, absolutely not.
[02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:01.560]   Well, I am just happy that I have found a panel that
[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:07.360]   can have a hot take on every subject, including smart diapers.
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:09.080]   You guys, it's amazing.
[02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:10.640]   Lisa Schmeiser, always a pleasure.
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:12.880]   Thank you for joining us, editor at ITPro today.
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:13.840]   Thank you very much.
[02:01:13.840 --> 02:01:15.960]   Really appreciate you coming up.
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:17.280]   You held your own Lexi.
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:18.360]   You're fantastic.
[02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:21.360]   Lexi Savidas is at CNET, where she covers
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:24.480]   consumer technology, watch her videos.
[02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:25.720]   This wasn't too bad, was it?
[02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:26.720]   This was a lot of fun.
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:27.720]   You were awesome.
[02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:28.560]   Thank you for having me.
[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:29.400]   Please come back.
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:29.920]   I'd love to.
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:30.520]   Thank you.
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:33.880]   Father Robert, I ask you to come back every time you visit.
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:36.160]   We miss you, but it's great to see you again.
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:37.000]   It's nice to be back.
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:41.000]   Although I'm going to be back again, September 20th.
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:45.040]   I'm going to be hanging around Area 51 selling bottles of water.
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:47.280]   Is that when we all are invading area after one?
[02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:49.080]   I'm going to do the new rutto run.
[02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:49.580]   Yeah.
[02:01:49.580 --> 02:01:51.560]   It turns out those grasshoppers in Vegas,
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:53.840]   they're actually nanobots that are
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:56.200]   implanting cameras throughout the area.
[02:01:56.200 --> 02:01:58.560]   I will send you pictures and video,
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:01.920]   because the beam from the Luxor is like a cricket magnet.
[02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:03.360]   It's amazing.
[02:02:03.360 --> 02:02:05.520]   I've seen videos of the crickets.
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:08.600]   And the bats are out in force, because it's like a buffet.
[02:02:08.600 --> 02:02:09.880]   Oh my god, always poor.
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:12.320]   All these these poor tech black hat isn't.
[02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:12.960]   Yeah.
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:13.880]   Oh, we get a half.
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:14.360]   I'll be there.
[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:14.880]   I'll be there.
[02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:18.080]   Is the cricket is the cricket buffet a flat fee?
[02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:21.040]   Or you have to pay for per allocation?
[02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:22.480]   You can eat crickets.
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:23.880]   You've eaten crickets.
[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:24.840]   I have on the show.
[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:25.920]   On the great crunchy.
[02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:26.560]   And flour.
[02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:27.240]   Yeah.
[02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:27.680]   Yeah.
[02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:28.520]   I don't know why.
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:29.160]   It seems like a bad.
[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:30.960]   My daughter had them like a school snack this year.
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:31.960]   That kind of blew my mind.
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:32.560]   Yeah.
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:32.880]   Again.
[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:35.040]   You do.
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:37.400]   That's not bad.
[02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:41.040]   What's for school snack, crickets?
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:44.000]   We do Twitch every Sunday, right after the radio show
