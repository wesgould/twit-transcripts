[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.540]   This week in technology, the show that
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.380]   covers the latest tech news in an iconic classic bizarre
[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.340]   and sometimes fragmented way.
[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.460]   And mostly that's my fault, not the fault of the panelists.
[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.860]   We've got a great panel today, even though it's Super Sunday,
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.020]   joining us right now from New York.
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.860]   Mr. Barretunde Thurston, hey, Barretunde.
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.460]   Brooklyn, Brooklyn.
[00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.140]   Oh, that's not New York?
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.180]   It's Brooklyn.
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.700]   It's part of New York, but it's Brooklyn.
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.900]   But I'm happy to be here.
[00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.180]   I'm not trying to waste a whole bunch of time
[00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.940]   when I went back.
[00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.620]   From the borough of Brooklyn, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.580]   Barretunde Thurston.
[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.380]   Technically, but who's--
[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.660]   Planet of Brooklyn.
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.660]   The planet, its own planet.
[00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.860]   Yeah.
[00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.340]   All right, well, I'm glad we got that straight,
[00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.900]   because I'd hate to have that get that wrong.
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.740]   I'm here to educate.
[00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.860]   Also, here for the first time, we're
[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.900]   really glad to have her care.
[00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.500]   A swishy of all things digital, all things D.
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.020]   .com, boomtown columnist, and one of the most astute observers
[00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.140]   of technology out there.
[00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.380]   So good to have you five care.
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.420]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.460]   I'm sorry I haven't been on.
[00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.460]   We've been trying and trying, but that's fine.
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.500]   Well, you know, I've got dogs and children,
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.980]   so that's sort of my Sunday.
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.940]   Yeah, I don't blame you.
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.300]   Yeah.
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.580]   In fact, you're probably grateful to get away from them.
[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.980]   Indeed, I'm thrilled to be here.
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.820]   Also, here, speaking of dogs and children, dogs
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.340]   and Englishmen, Will Harris.
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.700]   What is it?
[00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.820]   What is it they say?
[00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:47.320]   Mad dogs.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.460]   Mad dogs and English ones.
[00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.260]   And Englishmen.
[00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.220]   Will Harris from Channel?
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.500]   I don't have dogs or children, thankfully.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.100]   This is a show we had to--
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.940]   You can have one of mine.
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.060]   How old are your kids, Cara?
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.140]   Four and seven.
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.980]   Oh, they're little.
[00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.380]   They're one is actually here with two dogs, too.
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.940]   So yes, they're little.
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.020]   You know what?
[00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.900]   We have teenagers now, and we avoided the dogs
[00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.660]   until we got the kids to stop peeing on the furniture.
[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.100]   I figured--
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.980]   One stay.
[00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.740]   I cage trained my children.
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.820]   Oh, very smart.
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.460]   Do you use a newspaper trick?
[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.460]   No, cage training work.
[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.380]   Just cage, OK.
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.360]   Verritain--
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.820]   I'm just going to show up at home.
[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.900]   Shaking his head.
[00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.380]   About five minutes.
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.380]   That's a-- if they were that good, that would be nice.
[00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.380]   This panel is unique because we had to find a panel that
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.140]   cared not a wit about something.
[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.540]   There's some big game going on, I don't know,
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.180]   in New Orleans.
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.300]   It's in New Orleans, right?
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.100]   No, it's in Miami.
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.100]   It's with New Orleans.
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.620]   No idea.
[00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.420]   We have no idea.
[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.740]   It's the Baltimore Colts.
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.540]   No, wait a minute.
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.460]   The Indianapolis.
[00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.100]   People are going--
[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.100]   You're such a geeky.
[00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.620]   That's awesome.
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.140]   People are going crazy right now.
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.140]   Baltimorerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.140]   The Baltimore Rabbids.
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.140]   Yeah.
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.260]   It's Johnny United in his Baltimore Colts against the
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.300]   New Orleans Saints.
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.220]   Who dad?
[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.740]   Who dad?
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:03.180]   That's all I know.
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.820]   All he was saying earlier, there's a Kardashian
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:05.180]   involved.
[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.740]   That's all I know.
[00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.180]   There's a cartoon.
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.500]   I would actually love the Super Bowl if it were just all
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.380]   the football scenes from Friday Night Lights strung
[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.900]   together.
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.900]   Now, that's a good--
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.700]   Oh, that'd be a good victory for the Dylan Panthers.
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.460]   That'd be a great game to watch.
[00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.620]   See, I think even you will would appreciate American
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.180]   football if you were lived in Texas
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.060]   and you saw Texas high school football.
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.060]   I think so.
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.660]   Probably.
[00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.940]   It has a very unique part in your culture, which nobody
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.220]   outside of America can quite appreciate.
[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.300]   Oh, come on.
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.900]   Maybe Britain and Cricket.
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.100]   Maybe it's kind of the same thing.
[00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.780]   You would be America cares about Cricket, right?
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:39.980]   Or soccer hooligans.
[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.180]   Didn't Britain invent soccer hooliganism?
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.380]   Well, that's getting a little bit derogatory now.
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.740]   They did perfect it.
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:49.340]   There you go.
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.940]   Perfected is the word.
[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.180]   You meant we're looking in a good way.
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.660]   In a good-- what's wrong with that?
[00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.660]   Yeah.
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.380]   So, Barretunde does have to go before the game begins.
[00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.860]   OK.
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.260]   But for an odd reason.
[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.940]   I'll be live tweeting this cultural event.
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.460]   I like to take moments where everybody comes together
[00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.300]   and mess with them.
[00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.620]   So I don't know much about football.
[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.020]   I picked Alabama in this bowl game
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.180]   because I just like the state of Alabama over Texas.
[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.180]   I have nothing to do with the players or the stats.
[00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.460]   So I'll be tweeting about the commercials
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.660]   and about very uninformed sports analysis coming
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.060]   from the top of my head.
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.900]   It'll be fun.
[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.740]   Actually, I think this is--
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.820]   this was the idea of Luis Alavera, who runs
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.020]   my engineer for the radio show.
[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.620]   He said, this is upside down Tivo Day is what this is.
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.820]   This is the day you DVR the game so you can skip the program
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.340]   and go right to the commercials.
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.020]   It's true.
[00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.420]   They're good commercials.
[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.620]   They're up on all the websites.
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.300]   They have them all up all the commercials.
[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.020]   Do you remember?
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.940]   I haven't looked at them yet.
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:44.780]   I was going to be surprised.
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.220]   Well, they're not up yet, are they?
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.100]   Some of them are.
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.020]   I think they're previewing some of them on Yahoo.
[00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.540]   Yahoo usually has the best collection of them, typically.
[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.540]   But they're all over the place.
[00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.380]   So Yahoo does it.
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.940]   YouTube does it.
[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.020]   Hulu does it, I know.
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.420]   Yeah, they all do it.
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.940]   It's funny.
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.300]   Do you remember way back when that--
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.860]   in fact, this was well before YouTube.
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.940]   There was a site-- and I can't remember the name of the site--
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.620]   just was ads.
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.740]   Yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about.
[00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.620]   Ad Critic, wasn't it?
[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:08.820]   Ad Critic.
[00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:09.340]   Thank you.
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.220]   It's been driving me crazy all day.
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:12.620]   And then this is the funniest thing.
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.500]   This is what really dates it.
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.220]   The advertisers said you have to pull the ads down.
[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.700]   Yes.
[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.220]   What do you do?
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.740]   We don't want people to see the ads.
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:22.860]   These are our ads.
[00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.380]   I think they were mocking them.
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.260]   I think they were mocking them, though.
[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.820]   Or anything.
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.380]   They allowed-- well, originally Ad Critic
[00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:32.860]   was for ad agencies and artistic directors
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.820]   to say what's wrong with this ad or so forth.
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.540]   But most of the time, I went there.
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.500]   I just wanted to watch the ad.
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.820]   I wasn't reading the critique.
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.780]   Right, right.
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.620]   And how crazy is that for Budweiser to say, well, whatever
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.140]   you do.
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.620]   We have the copyright to the Bud ad.
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.100]   You may not hear it.
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.900]   In an unapproved forum.
[00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.420]   Actually, if we buy some Budweiser as a result,
[00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.540]   that would be an action.
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.860]   You say it sounds crazy, Leo.
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.100]   But how many times do we see the exact same thing?
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.180]   Or at least a very similar thing these days.
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.540]   Something that's designed to be out there and enjoyed
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.420]   by everybody where someone pulls it down and says,
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.260]   you're not enjoying it in the exact way
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.420]   that you kind of meant you to enjoy it.
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.700]   So just ditch it.
[00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.500]   Hulu.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.860]   You know, NBC and Fox said, mm-hmm.
[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.460]   I mean, it's--
[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.140]   But the reason I bring it up is because it just shows you
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.740]   that these-- what is now, you know, in 10 years in hindsight,
[00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.580]   10 years later, obviously, foolish persists.
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.820]   Well, they put them back.
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.460]   I think they want to just-- they sometimes release
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.300]   someone they want to.
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.700]   And you know, like the Susan Boyle stuff was interesting.
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.460]   It kept coming down and being pulled off and coming down.
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.220]   I don't think they have a lot of control over it.
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.620]   But they're certainly trying to control it.
[00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.740]   And when they want to, like the Conan stuff
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:42.900]   has been interesting.
[00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.540]   There's all this debate over whether they own--
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.660]   whether they can put up these Conan things that were sort
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.580]   of insulting to NBC or not.
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.780]   Is there a fair use argument that it's somehow editorial?
[00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:53.820]   No, probably not.
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.220]   I mean, just tiny clips of it.
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.700]   People are putting up whole-- the whole four or five
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:58.220]   minute thing.
[00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.540]   So no, not four or five minutes.
[00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:00.900]   Probably one line would be all right,
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.860]   but not four or five minutes.
[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.420]   That's kind of crossing the line.
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:07.060]   And yet, I mean, let's face it, Saturday Night Live
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.100]   was dying on the vine until people started putting up--
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:10.460]   Right.
[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.020]   Clips of it.
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:11.540]   Yeah.
[00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:12.300]   --on YouTube.
[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.660]   And of course, immediately NBC says, oh, you can't do that.
[00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.060]   But it's good for them.
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:16.820]   Well, some of it is.
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.380]   I mean, I think all the media comes.
[00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.420]   We're probably going to try to pull back Fair Use now.
[00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.060]   It's debate going on between News Corp, which owns our site,
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:24.940]   actually.
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.700]   We don't-- I don't agree with them on this.
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.940]   I think they're fighting to try to fight and restrict
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.340]   Fair Use even more in their fight with all the websites.
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.940]   We're not going to put-- what's a pay wall?
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:35.780]   Well, they want to actually-- they want to do-- that's fine.
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:36.820]   You can do whatever he wants in that.
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.740]   But to restrict Fair Use, that means
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.300]   going to Washington and paying for lobbyists.
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.100]   And Google will have their own group of lobbyists doing
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.060]   the same thing.
[00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.820]   And so that should be an interesting fight this year.
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.340]   What's going to happen to Fair Use and things like that?
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.780]   The lobbyist off.
[00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:50.380]   Merkle?
[00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:50.940]   It is.
[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.140]   It's a lawyer.
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.500]   Merkle claims that Google is sucking the life blood out
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:56.700]   of journalism.
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.020]   You guys are free-- everybody always accuses
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:00.300]   Google of free writing.
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.180]   They take one to know why.
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.620]   Well, yeah.
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.820]   I mean, I have to say, there's one of the Macs that I read
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.980]   in the UK is a Mac called Broadcast,
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.700]   which is for the kind of TV industry.
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.100]   If you get a broadcast-- any of the top stories,
[00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.060]   it's behind a pay wall, which is--
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.020]   it's like a few hundred, quite a year, I think.
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.940]   If you go to Google and you type the headline of the story
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.740]   that you want, you can just read it all on Google.
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:25.260]   Yeah.
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.260]   I mean, it'd be interesting.
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.780]   This year is going to be the big year of content,
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.740]   sort of the idea of how much content is worth,
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.700]   and what they can keep back, and what's available,
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:33.700]   and how that impacts them.
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.980]   I think there'll be more and more pay walls.
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:35.700]   They're going to try it.
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.380]   I mean, and then we'll see what happens.
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.620]   Does the iPad change any of this?
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.820]   I think so.
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.140]   Yeah, I think the sad--
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.420]   I mean, kind of the sad thing, possibly,
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.420]   or at least the kind of insufferable thing,
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.820]   was that all these old media companies
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.820]   that have had their head in the sand have been going,
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.540]   "Oh, you know, the web is killing our business,
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.780]   "and we've got to find a way to make people pay for everything."
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.100]   And that actually, if all this kind of stuff
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.780]   about digital subscriptions and the Kindle
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.500]   and the iPad kind of takes effect,
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.980]   that actually they'll have just rid,
[00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.500]   sort of, ridden out 10 years of pain
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.340]   to get to a point where they're just selling the same thing,
[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.380]   which is 50p for a newspaper every day,
[00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.380]   except it's on your iPad, rather than--
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.380]   On paper.
[00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.380]   But that's how--
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.380]   It's kind of slightly insufferable,
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.380]   if they've actually been right the past decade.
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.500]   That's how these companies want it,
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.900]   because that's their business model
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.100]   from Time and Memorial, right?
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.140]   Absolutely. Well, no, of course they'd like the internet
[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.260]   to go away. I think that's really the first choice.
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.260]   OK.
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.020]   They do. I remember the first decline,
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.340]   I guess, in the 2000 when they had the dot com bomb,
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.060]   they all were like, "Oh, thank goodness, Carrot."
[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.500]   So I was like, "Get ready, my friend."
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.180]   I mean, it was really-- that was this sort of attitude.
[00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:37.580]   Like, phew, that-- we missed that.
[00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.620]   It was close.
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.620]   Yeah, that was close.
[00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:42.620]   And I was like, "Get ready to really die now."
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.700]   But I think they would like it to go different,
[00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.700]   but they like to have some mode of control over it,
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.940]   and they're not used to that in the way they've set up their
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:49.940]   businesses.
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.140]   And so what it'll be interesting to see is what happens
[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.100]   when they-- with this iPad, I think Steve Jobs,
[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.940]   who has sort of an enemy of the music industry in a lot of ways,
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.780]   because the pricing fights he's had with them,
[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:02.020]   is now the savior of the print industry,
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.780]   or the book industry, or whatever, because, you know,
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.340]   McMillan is pointing to the iPad for fighting Amazon
[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.060]   and the 9999 book price.
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.340]   So it should be-- it's interesting.
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.860]   I mean, none of-- unfortunately, for the media industry,
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:14.380]   none of these people are their friends.
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.500]   I mean, they either Amazon or iPad or Apple,
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:20.180]   because they're going to control these distribution
[00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:20.780]   devices.
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.740]   But they do prefer the agency model that Apple uses,
[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.540]   where they set the price.
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.900]   Apple takes 30% of whatever that price is to Amazon's model,
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.300]   which basically says Amazon sets the price,
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.180]   tells you how much you're going to get, and take it or leave it.
[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.580]   Well, we call it for now.
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:37.340]   I mean, what if everyone's using an iPad?
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.220]   What could they do then?
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.420]   I mean, that's the thing, is they're just
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.660]   trading one potential problem for another.
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.740]   I mean, because if they look at what
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:45.500]   happened in the music industry, the music industry's
[00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.620]   been fighting Apple to raise from $0.99 to $1.29.
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.180]   Now, they eventually did it.
[00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.340]   But there wasn't a lot of options in paid music.
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:55.420]   And they had to make a concession, which was removing DRM.
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.140]   Right, exactly.
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:56.380]   So--
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.220]   Huge concession.
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.860]   You know, if this thing catches on,
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:01.300]   and we'll see if it does, or hopefully,
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.500]   there'll be lots of these, which should be great.
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.100]   But if this thing catches on, and they have--
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.740]   most of the New York Times, for example,
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.660]   comes over the Wall Street Journal, or whoever they're
[00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.500]   talking to, comes over these things.
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.140]   They're in a deleveraged position, I would say.
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:19.300]   I read a great blog from Dave McClure, who
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:24.700]   wrote Fantastic This Week on how the sort of the future
[00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.140]   of all these companies will be who
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.620]   can build the biggest, most ubiquitous micro-payment system
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:30.660]   that Google--
[00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.300]   sorry, that Apple is already a long way there with its--
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:33.800]   Yes.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.920]   There's 80 million people who have credit cards registered,
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.180]   and I choose they can aggregate the purchase together.
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.060]   They only charge you once every few days,
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:42.860]   so you that they pay less money.
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:44.120]   And that the big competitor to that
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.300]   won't be Amazon, in fact.
[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.720]   But will actually probably be Facebook, and Facebook's
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.300]   alleged micro-payment platform.
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:52.800]   Right.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.300]   Well, they have a lot of legit everything.
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.220]   You can already buy fake flowers, and gifts--
[00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.420]   the Facebook gift economy, and a lot of the--
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.300]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.420]   Real stuff with Facebook credit.
[00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:01.100]   You just put credit cards.
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:01.620]   They're a good money.
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:01.940]   Oh, man.
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.920]   I wish I were in the business of selling bits for real money.
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.480]   I mean, boy, you said it.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.640]   No, they make a lot of money.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.360]   Don't laugh at that.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.000]   High margin.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:08.840]   High margin.
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:09.840]   You don't have to make everything.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.920]   It was just in inane.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.200]   I mean, I got like a cupcake.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.640]   I was like, fruit screw that.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.640]   I don't want to real--
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.640]   But I gave you a cupcake.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.440]   Whatever.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.920]   They make a lot more money than you think of this.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.880]   Oh, of course they do.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.480]   Yeah, I'd express it.
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.480]   Well, you know who makes money?
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.800]   Mark Pankas of Zinga makes hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.520]   a year selling virtual farm employees.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.560]   And chips and whatever.
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.560]   He has a bunch of games.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.220]   But I think he probably makes more money in the poker area.
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.180]   But yes, the farm, whatever the farm--
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.340]   Hey, don't do it.
[00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.700]   You're going to sell the farm as a nation because of it.
[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:39.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.380]   People just don't have to collect their weight, hunger.
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.980]   We've had our farmville moment on this show.
[00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:46.980]   Yeah.
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.340]   I gave up--
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:51.500]   The funniest farm holding is the Jason Calicanis fraud
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:51.900]   or whatever.
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.500]   I did an interview with Jason with Jason.
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.860]   You didn't fall for that, right?
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:55.860]   You didn't get better.
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:56.860]   Of course.
[00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.660]   Really, it would weigh 112 pounds and cost $4 million.
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:01.280]   I was stunned that anybody fell for that.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.640]   And I was surprised at how much a probrium
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:07.200]   was heaped on Jason for doing it when it was obviously a joke.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.180]   What was your opinion on that, Cara?
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.640]   I did an interview with them.
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:11.140]   And I agree.
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.640]   I thought it was so obvious that it was a joke.
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.020]   And if you read them all together,
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.000]   I mean, it was ridiculous.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.320]   He was putting solar panels on it.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.160]   He was having the foresters.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:22.680]   And the farm animals, you could throw them from iPad to iPad.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.240]   That's a feature I want, though.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.240]   I know.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.080]   Really like, oh, take my cow.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.080]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:28.580]   It's crazy.
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.080]   Plus it was Jason, please.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:32.200]   Let's just start with-- let's start with it was Jason.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.800]   And yet CNN and others ran it as if it were?
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.200]   Yes, the Wall Street Journal did, too.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.400]   Did the Journal?
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:38.900]   Indeed.
[00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:39.400]   Oops.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:39.900]   Oops.
[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:40.400]   Oops.
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:40.900]   Oops.
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:41.560]   That is--
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.320]   You know, it was-- you know, they should have checked.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.280]   And in fact, none of them called him, which was amazing.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.800]   Or Apple, I guess.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.560]   They may have tried.
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.640]   Well, you're not going to call Apple.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.400]   But if you call Jason, the first thing you'd say--
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.200]   You call Apple.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:53.840]   I call Apple.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.360]   They do answer some.
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.720]   Who answers the phone at Apple?
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:56.800]   Someone who's like, I'm sorry.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.660]   You used a Google phone to call me.
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.300]   We can't talk to you like that company.
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:04.660]   You may not say the word the A word, or the G word,
[00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:05.980]   or the M word when you're speaking.
[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.540]   You can't even use the letter G in combination with letter O
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.140]   if you're doing any business with Apple.
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:13.180]   I do want to talk about this because there is a shooting war
[00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.380]   that has just erupted between Apple, Google, and Adobe.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.620]   Another one.
[00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:20.220]   This is nuclear annihilation here.
[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.460]   We went to the nuclear option, and it's only going to get worse.
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.460]   I want to talk about that in a second.
[00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.160]   We've got three great panelists here on Super Bowl Sunday.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.500]   We're going to move fast today because Baratunde's got
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.700]   to live tweet the bowl game.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.120]   Baratunde Thurston.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:35.740]   It's great to have you.
[00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.540]   Baratunde.com, Cara Schwisher from allthingsd.com.
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.800]   And of course, it's from channelflip.com.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.000]   My good buddy Will Harris, but today's show.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.960]   And by the way, the smoking light is on.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.320]   Smoke them if you got them.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.380]   I have to tell the panelists that so they know they can light up.
[00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.820]   We actually had a guy--
[00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:56.020]   I won't name names, but a well-known industry
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:59.860]   Maven who started rolling a joint during the--
[00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.460]   Yeah, well, you know, it's not 420 yet.
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.020]   And he took--
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.620]   What country was he in when he was doing it?
[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:07.940]   He was in the-- well, he's in California,
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:09.580]   which is, in fact, the nation where
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.940]   marijuana is virtually legal.
[00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:12.500]   Yeah.
[00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.140]   I mean, only a matter of time.
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.100]   I suspect this November.
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:16.660]   You know what?
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:17.820]   We don't know what you're talking about.
[00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:18.820]   What are you talking about?
[00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:19.320]   What?
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.140]   What?
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.980]   Well, I was in China over the summer,
[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.540]   and I asked our guide, tell me about drug use here.
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.260]   So what are you talking about?
[00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:33.420]   I said, we were walking by a head shop that had bongs.
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.020]   I'm not kidding.
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:34.580]   In the window.
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.740]   And I said, well, those things.
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:36.780]   Those who used to smoke marijuana,
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:37.980]   I said, I don't know what that is.
[00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:38.420]   I said, OK.
[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.820]   Elon loved the Chinese.
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:41.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.060]   That's exactly-- that's what they do.
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.380]   When you say internet censorship,
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:46.620]   it says, no, no, I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:47.220]   Yeah.
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:49.780]   Someone I know was at a meeting at one of the big search
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.860]   companies with the Chinese officials.
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:56.340]   And they said, when you call up Tiananmen Square or Tibet,
[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.820]   no pictures came up.
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:02.140]   And the official there was like, oh, that's
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.580]   the choice of the search companies.
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:04.700]   They wanted that.
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.580]   And they were like, what?
[00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.860]   They feel it best not to offend our cultural sensibilities.
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:10.140]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.180]   They have something called three teas and an F.
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:15.740]   It's Tibet, Taiwan, Tiananmen, and Falun Gong.
[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:16.740]   Falun Gong.
[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:17.740]   Yeah.
[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:18.500]   And so--
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:19.420]   Don't talk about that.
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.980]   In fact, this show just got banned in China.
[00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:21.820]   Thank you very much.
[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:22.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:25.740]   That's OK, because they're not interested in Carbonite Pro.
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.820]   Our sponsor of the hour, Carbonite Pro.
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.900]   Brand new, by the way, from the folks at Carbonite.
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.980]   You've heard me talk for years about Carbonite online backup,
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:37.340]   a great system for backing up your data on your computer.
[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:38.900]   But many people have asked me, well, what
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:39.660]   do I do in a business?
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:40.660]   I have multiple computers.
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.620]   In fact, I know people who have individual Carbonite
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:44.260]   accounts for each computer.
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:45.180]   There's a better way now.
[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:49.400]   CarbonitePro.com, the same great Carbonite online backup
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.900]   for PC or Mac.
[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.360]   The service developed to back up your stuff automatically
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.800]   to the internet.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.380]   More than 100,000 people use it to back up computers
[00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:00.660]   in their offices already.
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:03.820]   And we thought, maybe we should tell you about the pro version.
[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:04.900]   Just came out.
[00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:07.380]   CarbonitePro.com, you could try it free for 30 days.
[00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.580]   And by the way, we always do this with our sponsors.
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.700]   We really want them to give you the free trial
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.820]   to make sure this is right for you.
[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:15.460]   And I think anybody who's got a product
[00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:17.420]   that they're willing to stand behind is going to do that.
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:18.540]   And that's what's great about it.
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.040]   You can try it.
[00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.500]   You can see if it works for you.
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.380]   I could tell you.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:22.220]   You're going to love it.
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.700]   AES-256-bit encryption before the file even
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:25.340]   leaves your computer.
[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.020]   You choose the key.
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:28.740]   So only you can unlock it.
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.180]   128-bit SSL, while it's being transmitted.
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.380]   It's kind of the belt and suspenders technology there.
[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.500]   And prices for businesses with many computers
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.260]   as low as $10 a month.
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.020]   In fact, it will cost you less.
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.540]   For those of you, those 100,000 of you
[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:43.580]   who use it in Carbonite in the office
[00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.220]   now to back up individual computers,
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.420]   you'll save a lot of money by going
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:47.860]   to the CarbonitePro method.
[00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.080]   A unified dashboard for all your systems.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.320]   So you can see what's going on.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.200]   You can make sure it's happening.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.440]   And if there's ever a data loss program in unlike this,
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.680]   each employee can access their own backup files.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.560]   You'll be notified, of course, as an administrator.
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:03.200]   But individual employees can--
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.360]   let's face it.
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.160]   People throw stuff away by accident.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.400]   They don't have to be embarrassed and go to you and say,
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.280]   you know that report, my TPS report, I threw that out.
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.440]   They can just get it back.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.240]   CarbonitePro.com, try it free for 30 days.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.480]   It is awesome.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.120]   Cara Swisher, Will Harris, Berriton de Thurston,
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.580]   we're talking about the latest tech world stories.
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.160]   Google, supposedly, we'll be watching the night
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.180]   on the Super Bowl's got a third quarter ad.
[00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.720]   Speaking of credulous journalists,
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.480]   John Battelle on his search blog posted
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:41.140]   a ad from YouTube, a Google ad, that was--
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.000]   I mean, something that's never going to run in the Super Bowl.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.860]   It was an ad for France, for one thing.
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.860]   Have you seen it?
[00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.860]   Well, you know, they had a bunch of ads.
[00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:50.860]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.460]   These were ads they ran on Hulu like a year and a half ago.
[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.860]   Yeah, we put them up, I don't know, November,
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:56.860]   but it wasn't a year ago.
[00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:59.660]   They did a bunch for Chrome and then a bunch for Search.
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:00.660]   They had a whole bunch of--
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.860]   These are search ads, exactly.
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:03.060]   Yeah, you know, they keep clicking.
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.060]   They tell a story of romance or whatever.
[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:06.760]   Yeah, French romance, which, you know,
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.660]   is going to go over well with those beef eaters
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.660]   watch Super Bowl.
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:15.060]   The best one was the Tiger Woods one.
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.860]   And it shows kind of what Tiger should be searching.
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.380]   It shows the evolution of his downfall through Search.
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.380]   You're kidding.
[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:25.260]   It's like, how do you prepare the grill on your SUV?
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.580]   Are you from Page of Goldcore?
[00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:27.660]   It's really fun.
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.660]   I will.
[00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:29.660]   I'll go look at it.
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:30.660]   Did the onion do that?
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.660]   No, no, the onion does not do that.
[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.660]   It sounds like an onion ad.
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:36.560]   Well, in any event, you know, in gadget and a number
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.540]   of other blogs picked up John Battelle's posting,
[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:39.940]   oh, this will be the third quarter ad.
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:40.540]   Of course not.
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.220]   This is an old ad.
[00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.660]   The best Google commercial you're never going to see.
[00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:47.660]   This is from Gawker.
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.300]   Yeah, it's awesome.
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.940]   Slate V. Oh, this isn't an official one.
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:56.740]   It takes off on the ads that Google did run.
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.100]   The official ads that Google did run.
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:20:59.420]   Yeah, it's like a great pair.
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:00.180]   Oh, we got to watch it.
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:00.700]   I'm sorry.
[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.700]   I have to--
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:02.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:03.700]   This is from Slate.
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.540]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:07.580]   I'll have to talk you through it because it's all music.
[00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:10.220]   How to hide facial lacerations.
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.220]   Search.
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.220]   Band-aid.
[00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:16.060]   Escalade grill work.
[00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.380]   Oh, this is mean.
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:19.180]   Oh, this is better.
[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:24.180]   This is so mean how to get blood stains out of clothing.
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:28.660]   Out of a green jacks-- see, this is the style though of the ad.
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.340]   Oh, dear.
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:30.180]   Oh, dear.
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.740]   Now he's searching for the girlfriend.
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:33.380]   Derek Jeter.
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:33.880]   Oh.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:34.980]   Oh, painful.
[00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.980]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.420]   Derek Jeter-- oh, no.
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:40.620]   OK, I'm stopping right there.
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.220]   This is-- this is gone too far.
[00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.460]   The title of the video is called,
[00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.220]   "Is Tiger Feeling Lucky Today?"
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:49.740]   I'm feeling lighter than the week.
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.060]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.700]   "Dale" is where we're supposed to get his wife diamond.
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:55.260]   How much for a "Zale's Diamond Ring?"
[00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.540]   How much for the "Intile Zales Company?"
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:03.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.980]   He's getting Mark Stanford's apology.
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.460]   That's funny.
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.940]   Yeah, it didn't work.
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:08.500]   Did you see her?
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.740]   She's all over the web and everywhere with her new book.
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:12.460]   Oh, really?
[00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:31.920]   The T
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.000]   time I'd love to talk about.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.240]   That would be a good show coming soon.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.080]   Well, invite me on.
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.800]   I'm excited to hear you do everything you know all the dish.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.120]   You know, Walt Mossberg and I are huge celebrity gossip site
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:42.620]   fans.
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:43.600]   We're just crazy.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.160]   No, for that.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.360]   I have to say.
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.360]   It's our share.
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.720]   And one of our many things in common.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.120]   Now I find that fascinating.
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.960]   I feel like I'm superficial.
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:52.800]   That's our favorite one.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:53.880]   But you got a great scoop.
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:54.720]   You got a great--
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.520]   Superficial is better than Perez, right?
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.520]   I'm superficial.
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:58.280]   Oh, Perez is an idiot.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.120]   Oh, please.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:01.080]   Sorry, Perez, but you are.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.960]   But superficial, the guy who writes it, I'm trying to meet him.
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.960]   He's a hysterically funny writer.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:07.120]   And he's not a keenest.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.240]   And it's hysterically funny.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.720]   And there's bikini shots all day long.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.360]   So pretty much all it takes for me.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.120]   I like the title.
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.200]   I'm the superficial because you're ugly.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:16.600]   Is that it?
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.760]   It's pretty cool.
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.040]   Oh, bikini shots.
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.640]   Oh, and half the waiver feels so.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.000]   But I'm reading it for the text.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:24.760]   Let me just tell you.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.240]   Of course you are.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.080]   Of course you are.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:26.760]   Not the bikini shots.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:28.240]   No, no, of course.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.000]   It's the articles.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.440]   It's the articles.
[00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.120]   It really is.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.360]   That's why I'm looking forward to the Kindle version of Playboy
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.680]   magazine because it just gets all that--
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:37.760]   Does anybody remember what?
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:38.680]   Yeah.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.040]   The black and white renditions will be spot on.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:44.280]   It's all those 16 scales of gray.
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.960]   It's even more artistic in black and white.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.840]   Why even put the pictures in?
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.400]   And we've degenerated just because of May.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.600]   Sorry, let's move on.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.320]   No, I'm Kara.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.840]   I'm going to thank you because--
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.280]   I can go way low.
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.600]   If it weren't for you, I would never have found out about it.
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.080]   I'm superficial.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:23:59.920]   Yeah.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:05.440]   Here's a segue from Playboy on Kindle back to Apple and Google's
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.440]   fight over this application.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:06.960]   Thank you.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:07.800]   So approval.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:08.320]   Thank you.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.520]   For those who don't know, there is a guy who has--
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.120]   I don't remember the name of his game.
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:13.920]   It's an SAT.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.240]   It's an SAT flash of turn.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:15.740]   Yes.
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.160]   It's a flash card program.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.680]   I hope you prepare for studies.
[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.240]   And it did really well in an Android developer challenge.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.840]   So he wanted to list that in the meta information
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.200]   about the app as far as some marketing to say, hey,
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.600]   it did really well over here.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.680]   So you should trust this app more than apps.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.920]   That didn't do really well over there.
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.040]   May I do a dramatic reading?
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.760]   Please, Apple kindly responded as a follow-up.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.260]   Yes.
[00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:40.560]   I'd like to do a dramatic reading of the Apple response.
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.360]   During our review of your application,
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:47.480]   we found that your application contains inappropriate
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:51.080]   or irrelevant program information in the application,
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.920]   description, and/or release notes section.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.160]   While we hasten to say your application has not been--
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.400]   actually, you know, I'm not reading it right.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.000]   It should be more like--
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.040]   You're reading like masterpiece.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.320]   What do we like to say that your application has not been
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:05.120]   rejected?
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.080]   That's better.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:09.760]   It would be appropriate to remove the words
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:13.080]   finalist in Google's Android developer's challenge
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.440]   from the application description.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.920]   Please log into iTunes Connect to make appropriate changes
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:24.200]   to avoid an interruption in the availability of your game.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:24.560]   Is this--
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.440]   That is like heavy hands to be interrupted.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.240]   We would hate for that.
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:33.280]   So first of all, screw you Apple very loudly and with a hashtag.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:38.920]   Second of all, this capricious, inconsistent process,
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:42.040]   it's so opaque, it doesn't scale.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:44.240]   And ultimately, it hurts the world of ideas
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.640]   and it hurts innovation because your block is down
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.880]   to subjective things about fonts and specific words.
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.400]   They've blocked applications for an ugly icon.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.400]   Because the icon was--
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.520]   That's normal for Apple.
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.960]   He's obsessed with fonts and look.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:02.000]   Unfortunately, it is his world and you just live in it.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:02.880]   Well, come on.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:03.880]   Now, I have to say--
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.200]   I don't like it, but that's the way it is.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.600]   Well, this one is not because this one is clearly
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.640]   a response to Google which responded to Apple.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:16.120]   So I think this started two days after the iPad announcement.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:20.320]   When Steve Jobs held an all hands meeting and said,
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:24.840]   Google's slogan, we're not evil is both.
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.800]   I mean, you can't get-- this is aggressive.
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.960]   He also said, by the way, Adobe's a lazy and stupid--
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.240]   This means war.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.600]   Yeah, it's a declaration of war.
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.440]   So what does Google do?
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.920]   Google immediately, they were holding off
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.120]   on multi-touch in the Nexus 1, pushes out an update
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.040]   within days to the Nexus 1 that puts multi-touch back into it,
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.480]   saying, OK, we were going to be nice.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.840]   We weren't going to challenge your patent.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.440]   Go ahead, Apple.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.080]   Sue me.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.600]   So I think that this Apple Android thing is completely
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.280]   a response back.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.560]   We're in a shooting war, don't you think?
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.560]   Oh, yeah, I can commit.
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.760]   Go ahead, you go ahead.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.680]   So it's fun to watch.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:03.040]   And I think what's interesting-- Jonathan Zitrain
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.080]   wrote this great book, The Future of the Internet,
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.520]   and How to Stop It, where he talked about the risk
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.400]   of tethered devices and even marketplaces
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.600]   that are tied to single companies that can influence
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.760]   the types of ideas and applications we have access to.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:15.480]   It's a great read.
[00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.000]   I don't get any percentage for saying that.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.520]   It's just a good, thoughtful book.
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:21.120]   I think what's interesting here is Apple has such control.
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.560]   They've been super successful.
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.480]   They're really pretty.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.520]   And we talked about this before.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:27.760]   Oppression is often beautiful and very aesthetically pleasing.
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:31.880]   But it is a form of a mild form of injustice and oppression.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.520]   And what I'm hoping is, A, more competition from Google
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.560]   is better for us.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:38.240]   It's going to force Apple to do more.
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.800]   But even this whole concept of a gated community of apps
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.360]   that requires ultimately a person to sit behind a desk
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.960]   like an old school operator with cables to connect point
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.160]   A to point B is foolish.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:51.000]   It's 2010.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.880]   We're in the 21st century for goodness sake.
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.320]   There are billions of web pages and billions of apps to follow.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.200]   And that just doesn't-- it's not going to fly.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.280]   So what it's forcing developers to do is to think about,
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.960]   do I want to enter a business with such a high level
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.400]   of unpredictability where I have to create a whole app
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.600]   before I find out that they're going to say no?
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:11.880]   And it's pushing them to look at other alternatives.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.240]   So--
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.800]   Well, that might be wishful thinking.
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.800]   I don't know if they are.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.440]   Google Voice app is a mild example of this,
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.480]   because there is no Apple version, because Apple said no.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.960]   But so they just made a web app for it.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:23.960]   Google.
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.840]   And the web app is super functional.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.000]   You don't need to go through an app store.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.560]   You just point your browser.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.560]   And you use this crazy thing called the internet.
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.400]   It was designed to deliver goods and services and interactions.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.320]   It was a workaround.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.360]   It was a workaround to what Apple's doing.
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.480]   On one side, you could say, well, they do have the most
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:44.320]   successful device, smartphone device around.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.240]   And it's been years before anyone's really competed with it.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:51.360]   And even still, as nice as the new Google phone is,
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.920]   it's still not quite a competitor yet to the iPhone.
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:55.440]   Yet.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.800]   That doesn't mean it's not going to be--
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.320]   Well, it's only sold 80,000.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.520]   But I have to say, as far as I'm concerned, it's better.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.320]   That's what I use now.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:02.640]   Well, everyone has a different opinion.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.720]   I'm just saying it's not a killer.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:04.840]   It's not an iPhone killer.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:05.840]   It's what people are looking for.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.440]   No, nothing is an iPhone killer.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.760]   And it's still-- it's been years now,
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.920]   people haven't competed with this phone yet.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.320]   And they should, and they certainly should.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.880]   But I think the issue is, will Apple
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.200]   get into the same situation where it was
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.360]   in with the Microsoft?
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.880]   With Microsoft years ago, everyone-- Apple
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.880]   will be more of the precious smaller one
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:28.360]   versus the big, wide mass market Microsoft
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.560]   within the computing space.
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:30.840]   The same thing happened before.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:31.800]   They did a lot of gating.
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.080]   They did a lot of-- we're only developing on our thing.
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.920]   You can't have more than this kind of computer.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.280]   We're designing everything from soup to nuts.
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.120]   And the question is, will that matter?
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:46.240]   Or will they respond and maybe avoid that for the second time?
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.000]   Because you've got this massive lead right now.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.040]   And they've struck this really good evil genius balance
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.800]   between open and closed.
[00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:55.480]   Much more open than they were in the past,
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:59.000]   but closed enough to still play the A-hole card
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.080]   and invite Screw You Apple hashtags to fly, which they
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:02.720]   are on Twitter.
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:03.640]   So everybody tweets--
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.480]   On some levels, this guy doesn't care.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.280]   I mean, he's creating what he wants to create.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:11.920]   And so they're massively profitable now
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.000]   and doing very well with a lot of their stuff.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.920]   And their stock, of course, which can go up and down,
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.120]   of course.
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.720]   But they certainly are massively profitable
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.560]   with what they're doing.
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.080]   Well, that's why a lot of developers
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.280]   are still in the Apple store.
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:23.440]   I mean, they just follow them on the app.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.440]   Well, yeah.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.440]   When we made ours, it was no choice.
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.240]   We did the iPhone first because that's what everybody was
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:27.840]   using.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.320]   And that's the heartbreaking-- what you just said
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.760]   is so heartbreaking.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.160]   And who was a broken?
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.360]   It's just that--
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.360]   Humancy.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.040]   You know, this guy, he had to tell the word--
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:37.600]   Oh, that's so sad.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.560]   --and droid out of his app's description.
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.400]   Is that horrible?
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.920]   He's the Apple gods.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.120]   Like, that's absurd.
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.120]   I think--
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.280]   And that's what just bothers me.
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:47.440]   I know it's not business-wise.
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.760]   He's probably doing great.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:52.680]   But it's just a sad statement to the level of power Apple
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:55.840]   has and the flippant ways in which it abuses that power.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.080]   Well, again, this is not new.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.240]   This is his entire history is what he's done.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.960]   And you know, I'll tell you, his-- him being sick probably
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.640]   and surviving it probably has probably strengthened his--
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.320]   like, you know what?
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.160]   I'm going to do what I want.
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:07.840]   This is my vision.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:08.840]   It sure seems like that.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:10.720]   I mean, he was-- I've never heard him show outspoken
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.120]   is that this all hands me.
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.800]   And now he's like, I don't care.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:14.720]   I mean, I'd be--
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.600]   I might be liver cancer.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.080]   Right.
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.400]   So what can Eric Schmidt do?
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.200]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:18.880]   Wow.
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.200]   I would love to see it all out of war with you.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.200]   I've been going to think about it.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.040]   I'm going to think about it.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.000]   Let's just break it.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:23.400]   It is.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.400]   It is.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.840]   And by the way, throw Amazon into the mix
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.480]   because they're at war with Google right now.
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.920]   In fact, I thought it was very-- it was a huge mistake.
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:35.160]   Jeff Bezos made a very rare tactical blunder
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.040]   when he pulled-- when he yanked McMillan's books
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.040]   because he was forced--
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.040]   Scary.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:43.200]   But then he was forced almost immediately to back down.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.640]   And that's the opening that has shed
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.960]   and every other publisher-- there's only
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.440]   five big publishers.
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:48.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.720]   They're going, oh, this guy's--
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.000]   he's powder's wet.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   Let's go.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   And so everybody's going to go to the iPad.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.840]   And go ahead.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:58.600]   Go ahead, Will.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:59.600]   You haven't said anything in a while.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:01.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:05.800]   I mean, that was Jeff Bezos's real kind of staring down
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.160]   the barrel of the gun and--
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:07.960]   And blinking movement.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.080]   And he's-- and he--
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.280]   You could never see Joe's blinking, can you?
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.160]   No.
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.760]   Jobs will go down in flames before he'll blink.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:15.280]   Absolutely.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.280]   They'll be beautiful.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:17.760]   Because John wants to see the one who faced--
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.400]   I want Google to do this.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.760]   Amazon basically retaliated against McMillan
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.800]   by pulling not only all their eBooks,
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:27.000]   but all books for a time, right, from their entire online school.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.880]   That's a good idea.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.080]   So I want Google to do the same to Apple.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.760]   Like, you want to play this game, Apple?
[00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.880]   We will erase you from the internet.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:35.760]   Like, you've done.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.760]   Now, Cara, don't they have to worry about the Department
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.000]   of Justice or somebody?
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:40.520]   Kind of get--
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.080]   Go, Apple?
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:41.680]   Anybody.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.120]   You can't start doing all of this stuff.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:43.560]   Well, no.
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.320]   Google probably is the one in that-- across here
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.000]   is the Justice Department at this point.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.960]   Apple's not a monopoly, but yes they are.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:50.800]   Yeah, but it's just--
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.240]   Well, there are many people that are watching.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.200]   They're not the only one.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.160]   They're smugness.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.680]   Have the backbone of, like, of jello.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.600]   So they're going to-- they're going to do what the case
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.320]   they're going to win.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.440]   And I know that's going to be a tougher case than the Google
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:02.960]   case.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.440]   And the Google case, eventually, is something
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.240]   they're considering various things.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.160]   It's going to be tough, too.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.800]   So they're going to have to pick the one they're going to not
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.200]   look like idiots.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.800]   The good thing, at least from the point of view of users,
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.080]   is there is a clearer and clearer choice
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.960]   between open and proprietary.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:23.240]   Although there is certainly some proprietary stuff in Android,
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.000]   and Google has not always been pure goodness.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:26.840]   Yeah.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.640]   You know, I'm not sure it's always that clear cut.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:31.200]   I mean, although we do think of Google
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:35.000]   as being sort of very open, I think
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.600]   they're less open and more looking to scale efficiently.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:44.000]   I think what always strikes me, my personal anecdote,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.440]   the difference between Apple and Google,
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:48.400]   is that when Apple's looking to scale something
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:52.120]   like the App Store, it scales it by just having hundreds
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.560]   of people sitting in a room approving apps really, really
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:58.720]   quickly, and that getting it right and making sure
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.600]   that every single app meets sort of all their approval
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:05.720]   processes down to the text that goes along with it
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.520]   is the most important thing for them
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.480]   in scaling that quality of experience.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.080]   If you look at some more, like Google,
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.000]   we've had a personal experience with YouTube
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.920]   where you can get licenses to sell your own ads
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.680]   against YouTube videos.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:21.720]   You're talking about channels, YouTube--
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:26.600]   Yeah, and YouTube has rolled an act to maybe like two people
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.400]   in the UK.
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.960]   And the reason they haven't rolled an act to more
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.760]   is because they can't scale it without machines.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:32.440]   They haven't built the technology yet.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:35.360]   And so rather than scale it up and just throw people
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.160]   out of the problem, they would rather
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.880]   do it in an efficient manner.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:42.760]   And that's no less open or closed than anything
[00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.280]   that Apple has in the ecosystem.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.600]   It's just they want to scale it using technology, not
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:47.880]   using people.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.520]   And I think that's what Google is doing with looking
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:51.520]   at Apple.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.120]   You also have to think we had all these companies.
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:54.440]   You'd like to have these.
[00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.400]   We turn everything to a ridiculous horse race
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.520]   that they're once against the other.
[00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.440]   Google's all over Apple Maps.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.760]   It did not come off the iPad.
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:03.600]   And this iteration at least, the launch--
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.360]   Although Steve didn't really mention Google when he set
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.000]   for our app.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:07.520]   No, no, no.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.520]   It did.
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.520]   He was at the launch.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:10.520]   They showed it.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:11.520]   They showed the Maps.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.520]   I saw the word Google.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:13.680]   I saw the word Google.
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.520]   He said it's our Maps.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.520]   He was very clear saying our Maps.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.040]   I guess.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.680]   But this is, of course, with technology people
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.560]   like parse over ridiculously.
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.880]   Hey, that's my job.
[00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:23.880]   What are you talking about?
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:24.880]   It's still in there.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.640]   Maps are still in there.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.640]   And they're very useful.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.640]   No, I agree.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.640]   He didn't pull it.
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.800]   Although, what about this rumor that they want to replace
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.480]   Google with Bing?
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.560]   I mean, that's--
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:32.560]   They could.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:33.360]   Of course, rumor.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:33.880]   Thank you.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.520]   You need to actually report a story out and find out
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.040]   if it's actually true before you write it.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.040]   That's just so wonderful.
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:41.400]   Yeah, nobody's confirmed that this is in other words, magic tech crunch stories.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.680]   But I mean, I think that putting them one against the other is just typical of us as reporters
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:46.760]   to do that.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:51.080]   The fact of the matter is, I used to send a friend into a best buy.
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:52.080]   And people come up to you.
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:53.080]   And I turned to the person.
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.360]   I said, this person is not your friend.
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.360]   How friendly they are.
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.560]   And I tried to get-- I said, this is not your friend.
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:58.560]   They don't want to help you.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:01.280]   They want to sell whatever stupid device they want to sell today.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.120]   And so none of these companies are your friend.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:05.360]   They want to do what's-- these are not your friends.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.360]   They want to do whatever they--
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:10.400]   In fact, they have a fiduci-- they're all publicly held, publicly traded.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:14.520]   They have a fiduciary responsibility to their stakeholders to maximize profits.
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.520]   Period.
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:16.520]   Period.
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:17.520]   Period.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.760]   And you don't have to say any more except that the difference is in the business model.
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.840]   And Google even pointed this out in a recent blog post.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:29.200]   They said, however, our business model, we succeed when you use the web more.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:34.160]   And so openness is almost built into Google's business model because all they really care--
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:41.200]   they don't so much care that you use Chrome versus Safari versus Firefox.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:42.200]   At least I hope not.
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:43.200]   Today.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.080]   They care that you use the web more.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.720]   The point of Chrome is to give you a better experience.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.440]   But all they care about is that you surf the web because they're going to win no matter
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.440]   what.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:54.240]   Whereas Apple wins when you use Apple products and only Apple products.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:57.680]   But the fact matters, Google has 70 some-- listen, let me just make disclosure.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:58.960]   I live with a Google executive.
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.160]   And I'm frightened of the company.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:05.160]   You have 70% of the market share in search.
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.160]   And you have what?
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.160]   90% some in Europe.
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:08.160]   I don't know.
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:09.920]   It's some ridiculous amount in Europe.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.960]   And most countries, they have these massive things.
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.120]   They can do whatever they want.
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:18.280]   And so whether or not they do or not, or whether it's in their interest to be that way, there's
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.680]   still this massively powerful company.
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.120]   And it's not who runs it today.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.280]   It's who runs it in 10 years.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:26.600]   I mean, if they decide all of a sudden in their algorithm, but everything that has pink
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.280]   in it is what we're going to--
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.280]   No, you're right.
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:34.920]   It's a situation where they-- I think they don't accept the fact that they have such
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.080]   power over the internet.
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.080]   And they think they're benign.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:41.160]   And whether they're benign or not depends on who's running the company at the time and
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.760]   what's going on or anything else.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:46.600]   So I think more competition against Apple against all of them.
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:47.840]   I think you're exactly right.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:53.680]   I think Apple in maybe a decade's time when Steve is perhaps not the person that's
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:38:00.680]   what running it is going to be a very, very different company from where it is now.
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:01.680]   And Google too.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:05.400]   But at this point, the New York Times editorial that came out on Thursday from former Microsoft
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:11.280]   executive Dick Brass, who was the guy who ran the tablet division at Microsoft, really
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:15.600]   hanging out some dirty laundry at Microsoft saying, well, you know, we created Clear Type
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:20.200]   but we were told by a Microsoft executive that they'd only roll it out if he could have
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:23.160]   the employees and the technology in his division.
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.400]   The office guy said, Clear Type makes me sick.
[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:28.960]   It'll never appear in office over my dead body and on and on.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:33.560]   But the point that Dick Brass made was, and I think probably a good point, that Microsoft
[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:36.160]   is essentially a dysfunctional company.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:40.240]   And I wonder if that's just-- I mean, look, it's almost like a business cycle.
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.760]   Look what happened to IBM dominant.
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.280]   Over time becomes less dominant.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.280]   It doesn't go away.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.280]   Microsoft never going away.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:47.800]   They made $6 billion last quarter.
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:54.880]   But they're not-- in this whole conversation, they're not a player.
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:55.880]   They're kind of becoming relevant.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:59.400]   And I wonder if in 10 years we'll be saying the same thing about Apple or the same thing
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.400]   about Google.
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:05.640]   I mean-- Well, I think what's really interesting is that nobody has the ability right now to
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.680]   kill anybody else off.
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:11.640]   If you look at Google's market cap, it was a quick Google--
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:12.640]   It's a--
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:13.640]   Ironically, I Googled it.
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.840]   It's about 168 billion.
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:16.840]   Wow.
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.880]   They're 177 billion.
[00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:23.160]   Neither of them has got enough cash to make a dent in the shares of the other.
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.160]   So they're kind of locked in this, actually.
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:27.280]   But you would have said the same thing about Microsoft 10 years ago, and the same thing
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.800]   about IBM 30 years ago.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.160]   Look at Microsoft, Mark.
[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:35.640]   It's hard for us to imagine their hegemony being shattered, but these things happen.
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:37.200]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:41.240]   I mean, Microsoft's market cap is still above almost double.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:42.840]   It's kind of above 300 billion.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:43.840]   It's kind of crazy.
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.840]   Yeah, something like that.
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:46.840]   Which is crazy.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:52.320]   So if Microsoft chose to realize a lot of its assets--
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.320]   But that's the point.
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.320]   --it could be either of them.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.320]   It's the point.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:56.320]   It would be amazing.
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.320]   That's the point, though.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.480]   They're just like, oh, I mean, they don't--
[00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:00.160]   Well, although, you have to give them credit.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.240]   Bing is a nice effort.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.240]   It is.
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:05.360]   No matter how you slice it, I mean, something Yahoo should have been doing for years now,
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:08.160]   but they are trying to make some efforts that are actually innovative.
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.560]   Talk about damning with Faint Praise Cara.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:11.560]   A nice effort.
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:12.560]   Well, it is.
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:13.560]   It's good.
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:14.560]   I like it.
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:15.560]   I use it.
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:20.760]   It's something that they can't get much traction, although they've added market share a couple
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:23.560]   percentage points, because they're so small.
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:24.560]   It's really difficult.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:28.080]   And I think that if they had-- at Yahoo had done this and tried to differentiate themselves
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:31.000]   from Google, that it would probably be a different story.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.640]   But I think they're trying on some levels.
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:36.560]   I think it's really-- they're just really good at operating systems is what they were
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:37.560]   good at.
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.440]   And Google's really good at search.
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:41.240]   And so that's what the problem is.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.240]   You become really good at one thing.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.200]   It doesn't mean you're going to be good at anything else.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.680]   Well, the operating system is being replaced by the cloud.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:48.680]   It's become less important.
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:49.680]   Well, that is a problem.
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.440]   Except for, you know, that's a little problem.
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.440]   Sure.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:56.200]   We are all care bears now.
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.200]   Is that a tweet?
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.560]   Are you getting ready for the game?
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.960]   We are all care bears now.
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.000]   No, we said we were living in the cloud.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   That's why the care bears did so much.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.480]   Apparently I missed that cultural reference.
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:07.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.480]   That's cool.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.480]   We're going to help you.
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.880]   You didn't enjoy care bears now?
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:13.480]   I'm younger than you fellas.
[00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:16.480]   And apparently I missed the care bear revolution.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.480]   Yeah.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.480]   I was Captain Kangaroo.
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.480]   Oh, dear.
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:23.080]   If you make a bunny rabbit reference, I'm ready.
[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.080]   OK.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.640]   Just a great show title.
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:30.080]   You could be Mr. Green jeans if you took off the glasses and wore some jeans.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:32.080]   I just need big.
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.880]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:34.880]   Great.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:35.880]   Thank you, Cara.
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:36.880]   Well, no problem.
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.280]   On that note, let me take a break.
[00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.880]   We're going to come back in just a second.
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:40.880]   A great panel.
[00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:45.720]   I'm sure Barreton Day Thurston and of course Will Harris talking about the latest in tech
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:46.720]   news.
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.560]   We're going to talk about the Facebook redesign that's upsetting people so much.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:54.320]   You know, every pixel counts for your big time website, apparently.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.280]   Speaking of websites, I want to mention our friends at squarespace.com.
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.360]   What a great New York based company.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:05.280]   Young guys who in college said there's got to be a better way to do a website.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:09.040]   And Anthony and Dane in the gang said we can do better and they started writing some really
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.240]   amazing software.
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:14.440]   And now they become more than just content management system.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:18.520]   They're a web hosting company that just does a fantastic job.
[00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:21.720]   We've moved our twit blog over to squarespace.com.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:26.840]   I know many people, many of my friends have also gone to squarespace for several reasons.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:27.840]   You use it, Barreton Day?
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:28.840]   Yeah, I love it.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:29.840]   Tell me why.
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:35.560]   Well, it allowed me to focus on just creating instead of worrying about coding.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.200]   And even I was on WordPress before and I still have a lot of love for WordPress.
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.000]   So this is actually no slide against them.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.880]   But I wanted my blog to change from 700 pixels wide to 900 pixels wide.
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.880]   And I just slid it.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:49.880]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:51.880]   It's just easy.
[00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:55.040]   It's kind of like that big red staples, easy button, but for real, it was like just
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:43:00.360]   a lot easier to focus on the creation of the content and not so much the coding and design
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:01.360]   of the infrastructure.
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:05.920]   With squarespace, you start, I think that another 10, 15 templates, beautiful templates.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:09.320]   But the point is that you're not stuck with that because you immediately with drag and
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:13.400]   drop can modify their 14 templates, 60 styles.
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:16.440]   You can so easily modify your site.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:20.600]   And if you're a CSS whiz or a JavaScript whiz, there's no limit to what you can do.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.040]   You're never boxed in with squarespace.
[00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:24.040]   Beautiful sites.
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:30.480]   All you have to do if you want to see what squarespace is capable of is go to the samples
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.640]   on the squarespace site.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:33.600]   Go to squarespace.com/twit.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.400]   And you can do all of this.
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.520]   In fact, you could try it free for two weeks.
[00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.640]   No credit card necessary.
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:44.200]   It has import tools for blogger, WordPress, TypePad, and export.
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.160]   I love this.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.160]   You're never locked in.
[00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:48.720]   You can move around.
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:53.720]   Some of the most amazing sites are done on squarespace because it's quick.
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:54.720]   It's easy.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:55.720]   It's beautiful.
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.360]   You focus on the content.
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:05.360]   And because squarespace uses a very sophisticated server technology, you never, ever get to
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:08.040]   it slash dot it or dug out of existence.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.040]   It's very powerful.
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:11.200]   Look how good this looks.
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.200]   Squarespace.com/twit.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.040]   You could try it yourself for free for two weeks.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:20.680]   And if you use a Twit coupon code, you get 10% off.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:21.780]   Starts at $8 a month.
[00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:27.600]   It's a great deal for hosting and the most powerful CMS system out there.
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:28.600]   squarespace.com/twit.
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.400]   We love them.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.600]   And I think you're going to want to give them a try.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.120]   They're a pretty good iPhone app as well.
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.920]   Oh, well, that, okay, just between us.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.360]   That's the one that Apple blocked because they didn't like an icon.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:42.840]   Are you kidding me?
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:45.840]   You say just between us, just between like me, you and the internet.
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.760]   Just between us kids.
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:50.000]   It's a beautiful app.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.080]   They had to change one icon, like three pixels.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:54.240]   And then Apple said, oh, yeah, now it's perfect.
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:55.240]   That's awesome.
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:45:00.080]   Our future is going to be determined by people who get upset about the pixel size of an
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.080]   icon.
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.400]   But Steve has an incredible design sense.
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.120]   You cannot, I mean, you care.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:06.520]   I know you held that.
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:07.520]   I think it's great.
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.800]   I think if he wants to do that, it's just, you know, don't use it.
[00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.560]   I don't know how to say like he does.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:12.560]   This is what I'm having a choice.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:18.320]   I think when we were at the demo room at the iPod launch, we, he was, I got some of
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.320]   it on video.
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:21.320]   I know you flipped it, which is so cool.
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:23.640]   I got a whole, there's a whole two minutes of him talking about naming the iPod that
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:24.640]   I totally.
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:25.640]   I had.
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.080]   I had, excuse me.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:31.400]   That was talking about the naming of it, which I of course pushed the wrong button and it
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:32.400]   didn't.
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:36.640]   But when he was talking about fonts, he said, why, so we, I think Katie Barrett asked him
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:37.640]   why he wanted it.
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:39.080]   I had, he goes, well, the fonts look great.
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:43.200]   iPad, iPod, iPhone, they looked terrific together.
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.000]   And that was one of his things that he, of the many things he mentioned, it was right
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   in there.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.800]   So it matters to him.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:49.800]   He was a design.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:50.800]   He was a font.
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.280]   He did that in college, right?
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:53.280]   Something like that.
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.280]   He studied font design.
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:55.520]   That and he worked in an apple orchard.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.080]   That's the only thing I know about.
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:58.920]   And he was barefoot much of the time.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:45:59.920]   That's never going away.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:00.920]   I got to tell you.
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:01.920]   No matter what.
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:03.320]   It's never going to be ugly.
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.320]   No.
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.640]   And I admire him immensely for that.
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:06.640]   And I guess you're right.
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:07.920]   The, you have a choice.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.440]   You can, you cannot use apple.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:14.080]   The problem is as much as we geeks may moan and groan about the closed system, Barrett
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:16.200]   Tundi, do you use an iPhone?
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.960]   I absolutely do.
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:20.640]   I told you oppression is delicious sometimes.
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:22.160]   And it was the best tool.
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.440]   I mean, I had the G1.
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.040]   I had them, I touched.
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:29.520]   And both of those were severely underpowered devices that just couldn't handle what I needed
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:30.520]   them to do.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:35.040]   This device needs to be a mobile media production studio.
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:39.560]   And they didn't have enough RAM or enough processor power to do all the live coverage
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:42.040]   and photo taking and tagging and everything I wanted.
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:46.520]   So I got in bed with AT&T very reluctantly and very sadly.
[00:46:46.520 --> 00:46:51.080]   And I deepened my relationship with apple, a company that I both love and hate and equal
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:54.560]   parts depending on the moment of the hour of the day that I'm talking about.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:57.440]   Can I say that sounds like a lot of my past relationships.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.440]   It is.
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:46:59.440]   It's pretty complicated.
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:00.440]   It's complicated.
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:01.440]   It's complicated.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:02.440]   It's complicated.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:03.440]   It's complicated.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:04.440]   It's complicated.
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.440]   The very best one.
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:07.360]   It's a love hate thing.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.360]   Why are you torturing me?
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:10.920]   So I have switched.
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:11.920]   I have switched.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.600]   I switched about three weeks ago to the Nexus 1 and have not looked back.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.000]   I'm really happy with it.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.880]   There are a handful of apps I miss, but I can't, when I get the iPad, I'll have those
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:20.880]   apps.
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:21.880]   It's a terrific phone.
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:22.880]   I love the Nexus 1.
[00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:23.880]   It's fast.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:24.880]   It's a.
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:29.280]   What do you do about synchronizing media with iTunes, especially like audible, kind of
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:30.800]   content podcast thinking?
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.600]   The one exception is audible.
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:33.600]   Music.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:39.040]   There's a program from DVD John, the guy who cracked the CSS code.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.800]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.800]   He wrote it.
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:42.800]   No, no, no, this is legal.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.120]   No, there's nothing piracy in this.
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:47.840]   He wrote a program called Double Twist that looks just like iTunes.
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:49.280]   It synchronizes the phone.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.400]   It moves media over photos.
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.680]   It works perfectly.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.720]   It even does playlists.
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:57.800]   The only thing it doesn't do is audible because there's audible DRM is not supported
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:58.960]   on Android yet.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.480]   But I have it on Good Authority.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.520]   It will be very soon.
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:04.640]   That will be the last piece of the puzzle for me.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:08.880]   I mean, multi-touch was big and once they added multi-touch, I'm very happy with it.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:14.080]   And you don't buy TV shows or movies from iTunes that you want to see portably.
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.520]   Do you watch those on your iPhone?
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:16.520]   I do.
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:17.520]   Yeah.
[00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.560]   I watch most television on my iPhone.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.040]   Oh, see.
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:22.880]   So you can strip the DRM out.
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:25.400]   There are a number of ways to do that on both Windows and Mac.
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:26.880]   Basically using the analog hole.
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:28.040]   So you play it back.
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:30.400]   You actually do it in iTunes.
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:31.400]   They're plug-ins for iTunes.
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:32.400]   I'll take a while.
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.400]   Okay.
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:34.400]   Yeah, it's faster than real time.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.400]   Oh, it is.
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:36.400]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.400]   Depending on your Mac.
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:38.400]   But that doesn't bother me.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.000]   And see, to me, this is why the iPad is going to be a great...
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.680]   I'm not going to carry the iPad on the subway.
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:47.600]   But to me, I can see carrying the iPad to do that.
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:49.200]   This phone is kind of small.
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:51.880]   But I do have the iPhone with me.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:52.880]   You know why?
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.280]   It's this words for friends.
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:55.280]   It's a scrabble thing.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.840]   I can't stop playing it.
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:00.160]   A game forces you to carry an entirely extra device.
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.160]   Sad, isn't it?
[00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.800]   Well, it's a word for carrying that game.
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:05.800]   Yes, or something, right?
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:06.800]   Sing in?
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.880]   Is it worse than carrying a DS?
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:09.880]   It's like a...
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.240]   Yeah, this is my game machine.
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:14.560]   I think the iPad will be a very good solution for that.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.960]   Yeah, you know the iPad is the ultimate commuter machine.
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:19.280]   As someone who commutes four hours a day.
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.240]   It's going to be...
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.840]   It's going to revolutionize my life, I think.
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:24.840]   It's a lot...
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:26.600]   It fascinated to watch a lot of the...
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:29.880]   I was talking to a teenager the other day, an actual teenager about the iPad.
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:31.560]   He was like, "It sucks!"
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:32.560]   And I said, "Really?
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:33.560]   Have you touched it?"
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:34.560]   No, but it sucks.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:35.560]   It was really interesting.
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:37.400]   I was like, actually I spent many hours with it.
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:39.400]   It doesn't suck.
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:43.480]   But they were convinced that it does because of the flash issues and things like that around
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:44.480]   it.
[00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:46.520]   But I think people will be pleasantly surprised when they use it.
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:50.920]   Because you know, someone else told me, "Well, you know, it's just like the iPhone or the
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:51.920]   iPad.
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:53.480]   I'm like, what's wrong with that?
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:55.480]   You know, my mother can now pick it up and use it."
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:56.480]   That's exactly what I want.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:57.480]   That's not a...
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:58.480]   By the way...
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:49:59.480]   He's right about a computer device.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:00.480]   A computer device.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.480]   The iPod and the iPhone were both reviled by many.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:05.480]   It would have been absolutely.
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:07.960]   And you know, I kind of think, Cara, because I also...
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:12.680]   I was in the petting zoo and held it and had a different experience as most of us who
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:15.160]   did hold it did from those who didn't.
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:16.160]   And when you look...
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.440]   And I realized that when I looked at the Apple site, it's kind of like the fat nano.
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:19.920]   It looks like there's something wrong with it.
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:20.920]   It looks.
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:21.920]   When I...
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:22.920]   Up close, you know, it was...
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:25.360]   You know, the thing is, everyone expected to be some magic device.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:26.360]   It was just, you know...
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:27.360]   There were no unicorns.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:28.360]   It was probably because they used it.
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:29.360]   Better than Viagra.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:30.360]   Right.
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:31.360]   Better than, you know, all of a sudden...
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:32.840]   No, nothing's better than Viagra, I'm sorry.
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:34.840]   Well, I wouldn't know.
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:39.920]   But that expectation was fed by Apple using the word magical like 50 times in the presentation.
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:41.320]   They didn't come out of nowhere.
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:45.720]   No, in fact, I think in some ways you could say that Steve made a few strategical errors
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:47.680]   in the speech.
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:50.000]   He shouldn't have brought up netbooks at all.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   Because this is not a netbook.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   If you want...
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   If you want Flash and you want to camera...
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   Do we say hello?
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   That's Louie.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   Hey, Louie!
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   Oh, is he cute?
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   Oh, Mike.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   He is cute.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   Stop being so cute.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   Get out of here.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   Here's a dog.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   Here's a dog.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   Hello.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   All right.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   And move on for children in talk.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.600]   For those of you listening at home, we've just seen a small child who is very cute with
[00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:11.560]   a missing front tooth and a dog of undetermined breed.
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:12.560]   Yeah.
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:13.560]   It's a...
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:14.560]   Terrier.
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:15.560]   Terrier.
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:16.560]   I have a...
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:17.560]   Papillon.
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:18.560]   He loves the iPhone.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:19.560]   He's can't wait.
[00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:20.560]   He's...
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:21.560]   He's a terrier.
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:22.560]   Can use it.
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:23.560]   Exactly.
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:24.560]   It's the iPod.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:25.560]   The iPod.
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:28.560]   That's a good name.
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:29.560]   Hmm.
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:32.040]   A whole new category of pet appliances.
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:33.880]   I think a lot of the...
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:34.880]   Correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:40.160]   And I'm not the only person who's said this, but I think some of the negative response to
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:46.360]   the iPad is from people who don't like the idea of an appliance computer.
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:48.760]   And that's why I think it was a mistake to raise a netbook.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:50.520]   Because you can still buy a netbook.
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:54.160]   Buy a netbook if you want multitasking flash camera.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.160]   Buy a netbook.
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:56.160]   It's 250 bucks.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:57.160]   Not a computer.
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:58.160]   But this is not a computer.
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.160]   It's not a computer.
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:00.720]   And a lot of people are annoyed that it's not a computer.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:02.600]   It's, as you say, it's an appliance.
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:04.400]   It's a device.
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:06.920]   It's not a real computer.
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:10.520]   And some people will want a real computer and be disappointed.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:13.920]   Some people will not care and will be very happy.
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:18.960]   I think a lot of people, and I think by the way, contrary to past experience, the $4.99
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:21.200]   price point is the one that's going to sell the most.
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:27.160]   Well, I think part of what's happened too, people were, Apple has yet to fill a hole
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:33.120]   that people want, which is the MacBook Air for all its beauty is still a somewhat impractical
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:36.560]   sized small notebook for true portability.
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:41.680]   Because it's so broad and wide that the depth is really thin, but that's about it.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.800]   And we've got a touchscreen device already.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:46.840]   So it's like, oh, this is just a big iPod touch.
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:49.880]   So there's something missing from the Apple lineup and a lot of people's eyes.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:51.360]   They don't have a super light notebook.
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:56.600]   Plus, it's just easy to mock things that you haven't touched or used and people don't
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:57.600]   apply along.
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:59.000]   How much work do you do on the iPad?
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000]   How much?
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.480]   I'm just curious of your work.
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:02.480]   On the iPhone?
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:05.040]   What do you, on the iPhone, excuse me, on the iPhone?
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.960]   What do you guys do?
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.120]   I tweet.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:10.960]   I tweet.
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:11.960]   Everything.
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:15.960]   You know, I use mostly, you know, especially a lot of like live events.
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:20.000]   I go to a lot of events and I try to cover them in certain semi journalistic ways and
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.400]   sometimes comedic ways.
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:25.600]   Photo posting, using Facebook, Apple, regular basis, tweeting on a regular basis.
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:28.880]   So you're going to like this email.
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:34.760]   But there was a great post on a site called Emergent by Design, which a woman, Vanessa,
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:38.720]   I don't know how to pronounce her last name, a MIMIS, M-I-E-M-I-S.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:43.880]   She has a post called iPad, overhyped flop or case of great design thinking.
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:45.560]   And she waited to weigh in.
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:47.080]   But I think also a lot of people didn't do.
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:51.080]   They saw the keynote or they saw a live blog covering the keynote and they're like,
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:52.080]   I hate it.
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:53.920]   And just like, you know, you were saying, Kara, have you touched it?
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:54.920]   Have you used it?
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:55.920]   No, but it sucks.
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:56.920]   Like, I didn't know that.
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:58.160]   I didn't use facts.
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:02.960]   So she waited and read all of the top criticism and praise.
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:06.280]   And it was a really a smart and thoughtful post kind of in defense of the iPad.
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:09.000]   The key hook being it's not just the device.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.240]   You know, the iPod didn't explode in sales until iTunes was launched.
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:14.240]   It's all in there.
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:17.960]   It's a great way to connect content to the device and channel.
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:21.280]   So the iBook store will be an interesting test for this.
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:24.920]   The connection with the existing iTunes app store will be a big test.
[00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:30.000]   But we won't really know is the ultimate truth that no one can really ever admit to.
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.040]   Yeah, and it's got to be out in the wild.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:34.440]   I think people have to see people using it to see if they like it.
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:37.200]   I mean, there's one from plastic logic that's coming that's quite beautiful too.
[00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.680]   I mean, it would be great is a lot of these things.
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:40.680]   Well, there are.
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:42.440]   I mean, gosh, there were 12 of them in a T.S.
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:43.440]   That's great.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:44.440]   They're going to be great.
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:47.600]   And if they're starting to come down in price to a much lower price point, it becomes really
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:48.600]   interesting.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:53.520]   That's, you know, beyond the iPad and the Elite is attached to it.
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:57.680]   When these things get to be really inexpensive, it becomes incredibly interesting.
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:01.280]   And as they develop, I think personally in these in the pad.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:04.760]   Is mobility the key element here?
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:06.320]   Is that what is Cara?
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:07.320]   Is that what pushes you?
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:08.320]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:12.600]   Be able to move her on a house with one instead of being tethered to all kinds of things.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:15.560]   I think that's, you know, in a perfectly wireless world.
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:19.160]   I mean, it's got to sort of weirdly enough to get some credit because he's been talking
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:20.160]   about it.
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:24.440]   I found an old piece I did from a CES from a Badillion years ago where he kept pushing
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:25.440]   the tablet format.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:28.200]   And unfortunately, what his problem was he really did.
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:30.200]   He loved it.
[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:31.200]   I feel so sorry for Bill.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:33.560]   No, like off the stack case.
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:34.560]   He had a stylist.
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:38.120]   It was running Windows and don't feel sorry for the world's richest man.
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:40.120]   But he was really, he was really, way behind.
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:41.680]   That's just a little life.
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:45.120]   It was really behind the notion of mobility and portability.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.120]   Do you remember Cara?
[00:55:46.120 --> 00:55:50.840]   That CES was the one that they dropped a house like the Wizard of Oz in the parking lot of
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:51.840]   CES.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:55.440]   It was a whole house and they had an each room.
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:56.440]   Oh, the micros of home.
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:57.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:58.440]   And they had a mom in the kitchen with her tablet.
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:55:59.840]   They had dad in the living room with his tablet.
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:03.840]   They had junior in the bedroom with his tablet and they were all sitting there, these stepford
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:07.200]   people and the journalist would track through and look.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:11.280]   There is, there is a great video called future vision or future productivity vision.
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:16.000]   I'll send you the thing that's on YouTube that Microsoft did.
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:21.040]   I use it a lot in speeches because it really does show a world where a tablet is at work,
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:25.400]   a tablet and other devices, especially screens on walls everywhere, which I think is also
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:28.520]   a thing that is coming in a very big way.
[00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:29.520]   You should watch it.
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:31.800]   It's called Microsoft Future Productivity Vision or something like that.
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:33.440]   Is this the one from 2019?
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:35.200]   I think so.
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:39.440]   It's just because kids like kids in India and kids in the, yeah, that one.
[00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:42.720]   They're, you know, they're trading back things and then there's a really funny spoof that
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:45.560]   IGN did, you know, about the whole thing that was fun.
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:46.560]   Well, I've seen this.
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:47.560]   Yeah, I remember seeing this.
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:49.560]   Yeah.
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:52.040]   There's one where they have the guy with the little, anyway, it's a great video, but you
[00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:53.040]   should all watch it.
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:56.400]   I put it up as that one and then the spoof at the same time, which spoof was even funny.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:58.800]   AllthingsD.com if you want to see that.
[00:56:58.800 --> 00:56:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.800]   That's it.
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:03.480]   Microsoft's always been good at making concept videos.
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:05.920]   Not so hot at getting these products out of the market.
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:07.960]   They should maybe go into video production.
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:12.160]   They've, you know, they've always, always had that great.
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:15.720]   In fact, that was one of the things Dick Brass said is that he knew that the company was
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:20.480]   in trouble when they got the CEO of the company to wiggle his tush with Jerry Seinfeld in
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:23.720]   the commercial and it was like, this is not good.
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:25.880]   No, that was, man, those are bad.
[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:26.880]   This is not good.
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:31.640]   Hey, team, I actually, I've got to go comment on things that don't understand right now.
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:33.640]   It's time to play football.
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:34.640]   Okay.
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:37.040]   And that is web commenting on things you don't know.
[00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:38.040]   That's all.
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:39.040]   That's what we all do.
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:40.040]   Barretunde Thurston is it?
[00:57:40.040 --> 00:57:44.400]   Barretunde.com catches comedy act in, is it in Brooklyn?
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:45.840]   I perform all over.
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:47.920]   I host a weekly show in Tom's Square.
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:53.360]   You will check that out at Sagecomedy.com or just, you know, find my website, the latest
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:56.120]   gigs are up there under live appearances.
[00:57:56.120 --> 00:57:57.120]   And thank you again.
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:59.840]   It's always a pleasure, really an honor to be on here with you, Kara and Will.
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:02.080]   I've listened to you and read you both for a long time.
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:03.960]   So thanks for letting me play.
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:04.960]   Really great to have you.
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:05.960]   Enjoy.
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:06.960]   Enjoy.
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:07.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:08.960]   Hand, hand egg.
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:09.960]   Is that what you call it?
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:10.960]   Hand egg?
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:12.960]   Okay.
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:13.960]   Remember Kardashian, Kardashian.
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:17.960]   You have to, you've got a poisonous name and somebody hits the face.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:20.800]   She's, they're going to cut away to her a hundred times.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:23.120]   You know that her and her butt, they're going to do it.
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:24.120]   Well she's sitting down.
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:25.120]   Very good.
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:26.120]   Unless she's, unless she's, unless she's, unless she's, unless she's, unless she's,
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:27.120]   she'll get out, she'll get out, say something.
[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:30.480]   Knowing her, she will in fact get up, turn around and, and wait.
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:31.960]   Oh, she'll get up and cheer.
[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:32.960]   Oh yeah.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:33.960]   All right.
[00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:34.960]   Thank you.
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:35.960]   Thank you.
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:36.960]   Barretunde is great to see you.
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:37.960]   What is that?
[00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:41.840]   I was saying that's definitely the best thing about, about the Super Bowl is the cheerleaders.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:42.840]   Yeah.
[00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:47.880]   I just saw a study of NFL football that said that the total action on the field part of
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:52.600]   the three hour television broadcast is 11 minutes and the total amount of cheerleader
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:56.640]   time will you'll be that very disappointed to know is about 20 seconds.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:57.640]   Really?
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:58.640]   They don't sit out.
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:58:59.640]   It's like a wasted opportunity.
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:00.640]   I know.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:05.560]   I mean, they actually had a, last year they had a big NFL event in London at one of the
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:09.200]   big London stadiums to try and sort of, I don't know, turn, turn English people on
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:10.200]   to NFL.
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:13.960]   One of the big selling points was that cheerleaders and every one of my friends that I know went,
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:19.400]   went to go and see this sort of thing of American cheerleading, which, you don't have cheerleading
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:20.880]   in Britain?
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:22.080]   Not really.
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:25.240]   I think, I guess maybe it's sort of considered a bit ghost or something.
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:26.240]   Not at all.
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:27.240]   Can you imagine?
[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:30.240]   Also, maybe, maybe, no, I've always been a cheerleader.
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:31.240]   I have to say, cheerleader.
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:33.240]   Two, four, six, three, seven.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:34.240]   Oh, how exciting.
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:36.840]   You would be on then, actually, would be on then.
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:37.840]   Oh, of course.
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:40.840]   I guess the British equivalent, kind of, you know, sort of polo girls.
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:41.840]   What?
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:45.840]   Who sort of turn, you know, if you have such a turn, you're saying, you know, legions
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:49.560]   of sloney ponies, or in the post-slown rangers.
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:53.500]   So you're saying that in a, in a, whatever passes as the equivalent of high school in
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:58.280]   Great Britain, and the team is playing on the field, there are, there's no accompanying
[00:59:58.280 --> 00:59:59.280]   cheerleaders.
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.520]   No cheerleaders, they'll exist.
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:01.520]   They don't exist.
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:05.800]   And having played in quite a lot of high school sports teams, I was very disappointed to find
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:06.800]   no cheerleaders.
[01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:10.280]   I'm kind of, and so I wonder if this is only in America.
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:13.040]   I know Canada must have cheerleaders, because they're just, you know, there's actually
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:15.720]   a British cheerleading association I have to tell you.
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.880]   Look at Cara's, Cara's the reporter.
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.520]   She immediately Googled Britain and cheerleaders.
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:21.520]   Look at them.
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.520]   Oh, look at them.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:23.520]   Brititscheerleading.org.uk.
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:24.520]   Yes, indeed.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:25.520]   Dedicated to it.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:31.480]   Well, now that we've lost all our viewers, those who went to the Super Bowl at the end
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:34.000]   and those who went to the cheerleading site.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   I am on it.
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.760]   Is it correct, the reporter?
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:37.760]   I am on the story.
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:38.760]   You are so good.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:42.720]   I was impressed that you whipped out your flip phone when, when Walt is talking to Steve.
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:43.720]   Are you kidding?
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:44.720]   What are you kidding?
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:47.720]   I was like, Katie Cotton tried to give me an elbow, but I managed to put that back.
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:50.240]   Well, that's what I was wondering because Steve, first of all, Steve doesn't normally
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.240]   talk to people.
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:54.640]   He tries not to talk to people on the record.
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:59.440]   And especially, he's got a known antipathy to journalists, but then, did he not notice
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:01.280]   that you had a, probably he didn't even notice.
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:05.280]   You know, there was a crowd around him, and everybody was taking pictures, and I think
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:06.560]   he was trying to ignore it.
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:09.800]   And probably if he hip-checked, Walt's partner would be a problem.
[01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:11.800]   I don't know.
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:12.800]   They like Walt.
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:14.040]   There was a lot of people behind him.
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:15.040]   Yeah, Apple likes Walt.
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.600]   They don't want to mess with him.
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.600]   Right.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.600]   But I don't think he noticed.
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:19.600]   I actually tell you.
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:20.600]   I don't think he noticed.
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:21.600]   He noticed me.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:22.600]   I was...
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:23.600]   I am small.
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.760]   I am small and tricky.
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:25.960]   I am not small.
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:28.960]   And I was in the keynote holding up a laptop.
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:29.960]   Oh, really?
[01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:34.880]   I think he did notice me because he gave me the stink eye a couple of times.
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:35.880]   He may have given.
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:36.880]   I don't care.
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:37.880]   I won't be going back.
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:38.880]   I'm sure they won't invite me back.
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.080]   So, who has seen the Facebook redesign?
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.800]   Because maybe I've seen it and I just don't know.
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:43.800]   I have.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:44.800]   What does it look like?
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:45.800]   I don't notice.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:46.800]   Honestly.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:47.800]   The story is about Facebook's redesign.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:52.240]   I mean, I know it matters a great deal, but it's just, you know, every time they redesign,
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:55.480]   everybody hates it and then gets used to it, sort of, kind of thing.
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:57.560]   And it's just, it's not that big a deal.
[01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:58.560]   I don't think it is.
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:01.240]   Yeah, I would say, why does it matter a great deal?
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.240]   Why even say that?
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.240]   I mean, people matters.
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:06.040]   I guess to people who use Facebook constantly and they can't find a button.
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.040]   Yeah.
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.040]   So this is my Facebook.
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:09.040]   Is this the new designer?
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.040]   I can't, they look the same.
[01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.040]   What's the old one?
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.080]   And they made some tweaks in a variety of areas.
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:16.040]   I just, I think what's more interesting is the story is about them doing email, which
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.640]   they should have been doing a long time ago.
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:20.600]   And that's important because their email is just the most atrocious product on the planet.
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:24.800]   So, they're going to have, is it going to be like Yahoo or Gmail where they have a Facebook
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:25.800]   mail?
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:26.800]   I don't know.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.120]   It would be nice to be able to forward their mail.
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.640]   You know, it's, you know, I keep saying, you know, it's 2010.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:34.880]   You might want to have forwarded mail, but I don't know.
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:35.880]   I, we'll see.
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:40.240]   We have the crappy Facebook inbox is how they do it right now.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:41.240]   Yeah.
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:42.560]   I don't use it at all for mail ever.
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:45.320]   No, because stuff gets disappears and there's no way to manage it.
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.280]   It goes missing.
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:51.320]   So I guess if they had like real email, but it doesn't make any sense.
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:54.800]   If it's, I guess you could beef up the inbox or you could have a service.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.440]   Or you could have me mail come into it.
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:59.560]   I guess they could, you know, like regular email works, I suppose.
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:02.720]   I mean, that would be an improvement.
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.240]   Is Facebook as dominant as they were?
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:06.840]   I mean, last year it looked like it was a Facebook world.
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:07.840]   Yeah.
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:08.840]   Well, 400 million.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:09.840]   I don't know.
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:10.840]   What's it like?
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:11.840]   400 million.
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:12.840]   400 million users.
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:16.680]   It seems like everybody, everybody you know uses Facebook.
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:22.280]   I mean, there was a ridiculous statistic that, you know, was it last year sort of a third
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.600]   of all page views which generates on Facebook?
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.600]   Like on the internet.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:26.120]   Wow.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.120]   So I mean, I think there's definitely a lot of people.
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:31.120]   I mean, it used to be that sort of Google was the internet.
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.720]   It was where you started for everything.
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.640]   And that kind of seems like increasingly Facebook is the internet.
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:36.640]   Yeah.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:40.920]   Which is terrible, but kind of true when I, when I talk, you know, nine, I would say
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:46.440]   probably 90% of my friends use the internet 90% of the time for Facebook.
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:47.760]   So there's a guy named Larry.
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:48.760]   I don't know.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:49.760]   Is it Poni Mon?
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:50.760]   Poni Mon?
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:51.760]   You have the Poni Mon Institute.
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:52.760]   Pokemon?
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.000]   Sounds like that, but it's not.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   He's actually quite serious.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   And he did a study of what he calls the privacy centric population.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:07.760]   About 8% of the population don't sign up for super market loyalty cards, you know, stay
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.000]   away from all that stuff.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.360]   He did a study of them.
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:16.720]   Most of these will still post pictures on Facebook, will tell stories on Facebook.
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.600]   They do not go to their privacy settings.
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:23.680]   They don't spend more time than others tweaking their privacy settings.
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:30.720]   And there's an interesting article on MSNBC's Red Tape Chronicles about this.
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:34.400]   Bob Sullivan's talking about the fact that Facebook seems to encourage people who are
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:38.200]   normally private people to go public.
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.800]   Well, just your friends, right?
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:43.000]   Well, that's the illusion.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.280]   Is it really your friends though?
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:47.640]   I mean, this is part of the problem with Facebook is you get the feeling that only your friends
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:50.280]   are seeing it, but in fact marketers can see it.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:51.360]   Quizzes can see it.
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:54.800]   Your stuff is really wide open to everybody except people.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.120]   That is part of it, right?
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:59.880]   I mean, part of the original appeal of Facebook was that you could share all this stuff and
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:01.800]   you were only sharing it with your friends.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.320]   And so it wasn't like sharing with the internet.
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:08.360]   It's like, you know, it seems having a mobile phone text conversation or something.
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:13.600]   I think what Facebook has been, you know, arguably disingenuous in doing is opening all
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:19.680]   that stuff up to the wider world because now you kind of get a more web-like experience
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:23.760]   in terms of sharing your private stuff, but you think that you're sharing it in a much
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.760]   closer confines.
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:31.880]   Sullivan talks about one of the issues being in some studies they've shown that people
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:37.600]   will put information such as how many sexual partners they've had on Facebook, but not
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:42.920]   give it to a researcher to put on Facebook because they don't want a human to see it.
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:46.880]   So there's this kind of illusion that you're, well, it's not really a person.
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.680]   I'm just putting on a website.
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:51.560]   Yeah, I don't consider Facebook for a lot of privacy.
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:54.880]   I mean, that's interesting, but I mean, most people really don't care what they put on
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:55.880]   Facebook.
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:56.880]   They don't.
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:57.880]   Especially younger people don't care.
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:05:58.880]   They put everything on there.
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:05:59.880]   And it's where they live.
[01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:01.680]   It's their little address book of the internet.
[01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:04.040]   It's their little home on the internet.
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:08.640]   You know, I think someone like me who's been around for 109 years, I get Facebook fatigue.
[01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.280]   I don't have time.
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:14.600]   But certainly if you've grown up in that paradigm, it's the way you interact with the internet.
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:19.320]   It reminds me a great deal of how people used to interact with AOL a million years ago,
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.680]   because that was sort of your home on the internet for a long, long time.
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:23.680]   You wrote a great book on AOL, didn't you?
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:24.680]   Yeah, two of them, in fact.
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:27.520]   I'm glutton for punishment.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:31.240]   But I did the rise in the fall, pretty much.
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:32.240]   Right.
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.240]   Right.
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:35.160]   And, you know, AOL had all these things.
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:39.440]   A lot of the social profiles, they were very crude, but they had the buddy lists.
[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:40.440]   They had the chat.
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.760]   They had the, they had a wall kind of thing.
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:45.680]   So they really did start, you know, a lot of this stuff.
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:48.520]   It's just a question of if once people get used to it, they move off.
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:52.600]   They certainly did off AOL within seconds when something better came available.
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:55.720]   But they've, Facebook's been really effective at creating this home on the internet that
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.120]   I think is really interesting.
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:02.040]   I mean, I think it's a really, another interesting thing that's happened, that people do want
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:05.200]   to feel it plays that they're safe and, and, or at least they feel they're safe.
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.200]   Even if it's illusion, it's just illusion, but they have.
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.200]   Yeah, no, of course.
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.200]   That could be scraped so easily.
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:10.200]   Right.
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.200]   Right.
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:19.820]   So a few, a, a, a study came out, it's called social media and mobile internet use among
[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:21.800]   teens and young adults.
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:26.560]   They did two telephone surveys in September focusing on T-age, age 12 to 17, and then
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:31.320]   18 and older, blogging among teens and young adults is plummeted to half what it was three
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:33.120]   years ago.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.040]   Yeah.
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:38.000]   And they're using, basically they're using Facebook and Twitter.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.640]   Yeah, that's probably right.
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:41.560]   That's where everything is going these days.
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:42.560]   Yeah.
[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:46.280]   And there, I think there is this kind of lowered expectation of privacy.
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:48.000]   I think people just say, "Well, it's out there.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.200]   I don't care really if it's out there."
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:50.200]   Especially young adults.
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:53.200]   One of the reasons I'm paying attention, this is a, besides the fact that I have teenagers,
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:58.320]   I'm going to do a seminar in a couple of weeks off for families about what kids are doing
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:01.440]   online and what the consequences and risks might be.
[01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:03.360]   And we still don't know, do we, really?
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:04.640]   Well, they do a little bit.
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:07.960]   I mean, it's, it's like any kind of humanity, it's just a younger version of them.
[01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:11.840]   But I mean, one of the things that I just did in eighth grade class at my kid's school,
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:16.720]   or older kids, and you know, they, there was a lot of a name call, the name calling stuff
[01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:20.200]   goes on, on these things between the schools and stuff like that.
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:24.080]   You know, very typical of what you'd expect them to do when they had other means of doing
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:25.080]   it.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:28.120]   It just gives them super tools to be doing the things that they should and shouldn't be
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.120]   doing.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:30.560]   But a lot of it was just where you at.
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:31.560]   What are you doing?
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:32.560]   Right.
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:34.480]   Here's my picture that, you know, a lot of it's really mundane.
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:39.200]   And then it moves into dementia, like demented behavior in a very small group of people.
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:40.200]   So I don't know if it's so different.
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.400]   It's just, this tools are really good to be able to share.
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:47.600]   I want to talk about some, a grown up who used Twitter to resign his job this week in
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:48.600]   just a moment.
[01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:53.600]   But before I do, I want to mention our friends at Citrix who do a great product called Go
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:54.600]   to Meeting.
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:56.400]   You know, they do the wonderful remote access stuff.
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.840]   Go to my PC, of course, the high-end enterprise stuff.
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:06.120]   Go to Meeting uses that same backbone of technology to make it possible for you to meet, accomplish
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:12.040]   stuff without the numbing, mind numbing and bank book breaking travel that normally is
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:14.320]   involved in business.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:18.200]   You know, business travel could just be so expensive not to mention the stress and strain.
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:19.480]   I use Go to Meeting all the time.
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:21.600]   We actually use it on some of our shows.
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:26.320]   It's a wonderful way to share sales presentations, product demos for training.
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:28.760]   You can have the program on your system.
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.480]   The other guy doesn't.
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:33.480]   You show her how to use it on your system and say, "Okay, now I'm going to give you
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:34.480]   control.
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:38.200]   Go ahead and play with it," even though she hasn't installed it.
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:42.360]   The nice thing also is it's very simple for somebody to use if you don't want a client
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:43.360]   to be jumping through hoops.
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:45.840]   If you want to show them a PowerPoint sales presentation, you're not going to make them
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:48.520]   to say, "Go through three, you know, install software into all this."
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:49.520]   This is very easy.
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.040]   You send them an invitation and email.
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:53.400]   They click a link or you can even do it while you're on the phone.
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:55.000]   You say, "Go to GoToMeeting.com."
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000]   They're going to send you there.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   Okay, press the join a meeting button.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.160]   Now they're seeing your screen.
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:02.280]   They see your presentation just like you're there in real time.
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.760]   You can give them control.
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:07.040]   Mac, PC, doesn't matter.
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:10.200]   At $49 a month for as many meetings you want as long as you want, this is really going
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.200]   to save your company money.
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:12.920]   I want you to try it right now.
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:14.280]   Absolutely free for 30 days.
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:17.200]   You go to gotomeeting.com/twit.
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:18.300]   Give it a try.
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:19.300]   Show your boss.
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:20.300]   Do it with the clients.
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:21.600]   You can be unlimited meetings.
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:25.680]   By the way, also includes voiceover, internet and free teleconference with us.
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.640]   GotoMeeting.com/twit.
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:28.640]   I hear a dog.
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:31.080]   Yeah, that says to go to meeting.com/twit.
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:35.440]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.080]   Merit, Tally, yes, will.
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:38.080]   Go ahead.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:41.680]   I was going to say I actually was on a go to meeting last week.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:45.160]   I think more and more people are using it.
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:46.160]   Yes.
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:49.760]   You know, we've had pretty miserable weather here in London and the idea of trekking across
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.840]   London to go to a meeting with Street Grimm.
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:55.800]   And so I had a go-to meeting and I got everything done and it was pretty good.
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:57.200]   Cara, are you in New York?
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.200]   I'm in San Francisco.
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:10:59.200]   Oh, you're lucky.
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:01.160]   See those people back east.
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:02.160]   I don't care.
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:03.160]   Just snowed in.
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.160]   We don't care.
[01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.160]   Yes, they are.
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.400]   Walt sent me some great pictures of four feet of snow.
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:07.400]   It's amazing.
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.240]   Yeah, it looked like crazy.
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:10.240]   His driveway looked nuts.
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:13.600]   He sent pictures of his driveway in the walkway in the street and it was pretty.
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:16.680]   I used to live in DC, so it was a big snowstorm for them.
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:17.680]   Is Walt in DC?
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:18.680]   Yeah, he lives in DC.
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:19.680]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:20.680]   I used to cover the Defense Department.
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:21.680]   Overhillly.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:22.680]   I'm working on that.
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:23.680]   Yeah, he did.
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:27.840]   He just became sort of this geekish person and he was covering the Defense Department
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.360]   and wanted to do this instead and everyone thought he was nuts because that was like
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:34.440]   a big beat covering defense.
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:36.600]   And a good choice for Walt, I'd say.
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:37.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:40.880]   I always say that to technology, you've been very, very good to me.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.960]   Yeah, he covered national security more than defense.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:43.960]   He covered State Department.
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.440]   Actually, that's a fascinating beat.
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.440]   Yeah, he did.
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.680]   He covered Jim Baker, I think, during that tenure.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:49.640]   Wow.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:56.560]   So, it's been kind of sad to watch the transfer of power and the demise of Sun, which was one
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:58.680]   of the great companies.
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:11:59.680]   It was.
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:01.560]   Created by hippies.
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:05.960]   It had kind of this hippie mentality and yet did servers that ran the internet.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.640]   They still run much of the internet.
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:09.640]   Yeah.
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:13.880]   But just struggled in recent years and finally went out of, basically went out of business
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:15.800]   acquired by Oracle.
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:21.720]   The acquisitions now going, Scott McNeely wrote what I thought was surprisingly personal
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:27.560]   and, you know, a little indulgent, but that's what you'd expect from something highly personal.
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:28.560]   And Scott McNeely.
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.040]   Yeah, he was totally Scott McNeely.
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:32.200]   He's been so shy over the years.
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:35.000]   It was very funny to read it.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.200]   It leaked out, I guess, the farewell.
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.000]   It leaked out, yeah.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   Yeah.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.160]   Scott got leaked it out over his Facebook probably.
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:45.760]   Now he's sending that to like 400 or.
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:46.760]   Oh, did he?
[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:47.760]   Oh, I'm assuming.
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:52.440]   I got it from an employee, actually, of Sun.
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:55.680]   But you know, it was, let me see if I can find it because I could read some passages.
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:04.760]   But then the funniest thing is the CEO, Jonathan Schwartz, resigns via haiku on Twitter.
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:05.760]   I know.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:09.200]   My little pony was very amusing.
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:10.480]   Why do you call him my little pony?
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:11.480]   Oh, I don't.
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:12.480]   Thanks, Steve Jobs does.
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:13.480]   Oh, good.
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:14.480]   It's the ponytail.
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:15.480]   He calls him.
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:17.480]   Yeah, my little pony.
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:18.480]   It's a perfect nickname.
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.160]   It is kind of, you know?
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:21.160]   Yeah.
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:27.440]   Schwartz, Twitter, financial crisis, stalled too many customers.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:30.160]   CEO, no more.
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:31.160]   Yeah.
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:32.160]   Wow.
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:34.640]   Does that like haiku Thursday?
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:36.600]   It's like it's a new.
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:37.600]   I deeply moved.
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:38.600]   Yeah.
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:39.600]   I'm deeply touched.
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:40.600]   Yeah.
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:43.280]   It is set.
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:49.480]   You know, I have to say, Sun was started by very well-meaning people, brilliant technologists.
[01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:55.120]   That last line could be CEO at fault, but I don't, you know, have I say that?
[01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:56.120]   Good point.
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:57.120]   The same.
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:58.120]   It works the same.
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:59.960]   Well, that was interesting because Scott McNeely really threw himself on the sword a little
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:01.760]   bit more than Jonathan did.
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:05.400]   Yeah, well, we shouldn't have.
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.320]   Scott McNeely farewell gang.
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:12.320]   When I interviewed many of you for employment at Sun over the years, one commitment often
[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:17.400]   made was that things will change above, below and around you faster than any place you've
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:20.000]   ever been.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:26.240]   While it was never our primary vision to be acquired by Oracle, it's kind of an understatement.
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:29.600]   It was always an interesting option.
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:32.240]   So what do I say to you now that this is happening?
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:42.040]   It goes on for many more paragraphs of nostalgia and strange references to the Eagles, the dress
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:43.040]   code.
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:44.040]   It's quite interesting.
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:46.760]   Did you guys publish it on your blog?
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:48.840]   Well, John Lido, I don't, probably he did.
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:49.840]   Yeah.
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:50.840]   I think he probably did.
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:52.840]   It was a good note.
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:53.840]   I read it.
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:54.840]   I did read it.
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:55.840]   It was a good note.
[01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:56.840]   You know what I liked about it?
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:59.400]   It would have been very easy for him to write something impersonal.
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:00.400]   Right.
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.760]   He's always been a character.
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:08.600]   He's always, you know, remember when you posed in an outfit, like a superhero outfit?
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:11.960]   We had him on stage at D a couple of years ago, the very beginning, maybe eight years,
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:14.280]   a long time ago, seven, eight years ago.
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:17.840]   And he was, you know, he was this usual, hysterical and very forthcoming.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:20.560]   And at the time, it was just starting to really decline.
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:24.160]   And he was pretty forthright about the situation then.
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:27.440]   So I found him always to be that way, not that I don't know if they could have done
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:30.360]   anything about it, but they certainly didn't hide.
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:32.080]   From what was happening.
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:33.080]   What did happen?
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:37.520]   Oh, well, I think they got jammed really pretty much from both sides.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:39.080]   I mean, from all the different sides.
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:43.280]   Cheap, cheap PCs kind of moving up in power so that they could do what the service from
[01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:44.280]   Sunded.
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:45.800]   You know, his was the network as the computer.
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:46.800]   That was his famous quote.
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:48.080]   And he was right.
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:49.920]   I never got it until now.
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.080]   He was completely right.
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.080]   He had two famous quotes.
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:57.080]   The network is the computer and there's no such thing as privacy, get used to it.
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:58.080]   Something like that.
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:59.080]   Get over it, he said.
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:00.080]   Get over it.
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:02.760]   And by the way, both were right.
[01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:04.400]   Yeah, he was right.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.400]   I think they just got jammed.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.200]   I mean, it's hard to be in that sort of money.
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:10.880]   And any kind of business to be in that money middle is really tough.
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:13.760]   They probably should have gotten acquired on their terms many years before.
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:17.960]   There was some, you know, possibility of Apple buying at one point and IBM.
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:19.200]   There are all kinds of rumors.
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:22.720]   I think they definitely weren't talks with all these people for many years.
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:27.040]   And they just didn't take the opportunity when they should have because of all kind.
[01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:29.640]   They sort of were proud of themselves and thought a lot of themselves.
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:30.840]   So that always happens.
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:35.640]   Yeah, well, that's coming back to that discussion we had earlier about the fact that there's
[01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:38.120]   a kind of natural life cycle to technology companies.
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.760]   To some technology, to some technology.
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:44.200]   Certainly, I mean, Microsoft has been around for a long time considering, you know, since
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:45.200]   the early 80s.
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.520]   But it is moving faster, you know.
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:47.520]   Sure.
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:51.200]   I think that we're, it's accelerating so much that you cannot, it's very hard because what
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:55.640]   happened to Microsoft happens very quickly, it's happening to Google, which is you succeed
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:57.800]   wildly beyond your wildest dreams.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:01.840]   You grow immensely, you suddenly get huge market share.
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:05.160]   And then you find it very difficult to innovate because suddenly it's all about protecting
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:07.280]   what you've got.
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:10.720]   And a smarter, younger, brighter, hippo company comes along and...
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:15.000]   Well, I always subscribe to the Kenny Rogers School of the world, which is, you know, you
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.080]   got to know when to fold out.
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:19.240]   You got to know when to hold him.
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:20.920]   Know when to fold him.
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:21.920]   In Nice.
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:23.120]   Know when to walk away.
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:24.760]   Know when to run.
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:26.680]   That was a DJ for many eyes.
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:28.680]   But that is one hell of a song.
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:29.680]   It is.
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:31.200]   It's the best song ever.
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:33.280]   It kind of says it all, doesn't it?
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:34.280]   It does, man.
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:36.400]   I always never have thinking I'm like, no one does.
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.400]   Anyway, just saying.
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:39.400]   Let's see.
[01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:43.640]   Most E, this is a PC world article, this NPD group study that says, I was surprised
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:44.640]   this.
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.280]   Most E reader owners are satisfied 93%.
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:50.160]   They like that.
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:51.720]   They love them.
[01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:52.720]   Will, do you have an E reader?
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:53.720]   I don't yet.
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:54.720]   You don't.
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:55.720]   I used them.
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:57.960]   I don't like black and white and no touch screen.
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:58.960]   I'm sorry.
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:17:59.960]   I'm just not going to.
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:00.960]   Yeah, see, that's why you're going to love the iPad.
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:01.960]   What about you?
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:02.960]   Hi.
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:06.400]   No, I was tempted by a Kindle.
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:07.800]   You guys are a bunch of luddles.
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:08.800]   I helped.
[01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:09.800]   I helped.
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:10.800]   I used it.
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:11.800]   I tried it.
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:12.800]   I read every night on my Kindle.
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:13.800]   I love my Kindle.
[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:19.800]   But I currently the iPad, the iBook store is not going to launch in the UK alongside the
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:20.800]   iPad.
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:21.800]   Oh, that's too bad.
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:22.800]   That's a nice, beautifully scrolling.
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:23.800]   It's elegant.
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:29.360]   But although I talked to Philip Ryu who wrote the classics app on the iPhone, which is exactly
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:32.360]   by the way what the iBook store book reader looks like.
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:33.360]   Oh, interesting.
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:37.920]   And he said, no, nobody ever, he said, I looked at when I saw the announcement, I said, maybe
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:38.920]   I missed an email.
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:42.400]   He went back to his email saying, did Apple contact me?
[01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:43.400]   No.
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:44.400]   No, no, no.
[01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:47.760]   I don't know if you can patent page turning.
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:50.520]   No, and a wooden bookshelf, a wooden bookshelf.
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:51.520]   Right, exactly.
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:52.520]   Apple news.
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:56.480]   I think a little tip of the hat, give them a few bucks because it looks exact.
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:59.960]   However, now let me ask you this, Cara, because you and I have both held the iPad, but you
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:01.680]   spend a lot more time with it than me.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:07.000]   And I guess the one question people have is, is it going to be easy on the eyes?
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.600]   People say, no, an LCD is not easy on the eyes.
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.040]   You cannot read it for hours.
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:13.040]   The Kindle, that's his chief advantage.
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.040]   That is an advantage.
[01:19:14.040 --> 01:19:15.040]   Definitely.
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:17.240]   The E-ink technology is easy on the eyes.
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:18.240]   It's solid.
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:19.240]   Yeah.
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:20.240]   It's not easy on this.
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:21.240]   I don't know.
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:22.240]   I haven't used it for nine hours.
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:26.520]   But I've used my iPhone certainly for many, many hours watching.
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:31.400]   I watched all of Heroes across Europe one time, the first season.
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.960]   So I didn't have a problem with it.
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:33.960]   I don't know.
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:34.960]   I don't know.
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:36.960]   I haven't, reading is more onerous on your eyes.
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:37.960]   It is.
[01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:38.960]   But I love the page turn.
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:40.720]   I love the aesthetics of it.
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:41.720]   We'll see.
[01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:43.920]   I haven't used it for enough time.
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:50.160]   I can't imagine reading nine hours in a row, but I mean, I think more games, I think games
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.160]   will be interesting.
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:52.160]   I think it's quite beautiful.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:53.760]   The games are quite beautiful that I saw.
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:54.760]   We'll see.
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:57.200]   I don't know if anyone's going to use it for that long.
[01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:58.200]   I don't know.
[01:19:58.200 --> 01:19:59.200]   I don't know.
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.200]   I have to say for a long time.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.200]   Yeah.
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:04.400]   My suspicion is that it'll be easier on the eye for longer than I can sit still and read.
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:05.400]   Right.
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.400]   Yeah.
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:09.800]   Well, as Steve Jobs very famously said, and I'm sure he now, nobody wishes he didn't.
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:10.800]   Nobody reads any.
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:11.800]   Yeah, he does.
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:12.800]   He said a lot of things.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:16.120]   He said he wasn't going to do a phone at our conference and we pressed him.
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:19.320]   And he said, you know, nobody, he didn't want to deal with cell phone companies.
[01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:21.320]   He said, I don't like going through orifices.
[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:22.320]   Oh, geez.
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:23.320]   What a great line.
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:24.320]   I don't know.
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:26.800]   I just said nobody wants to watch video on a two inch screen.
[01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:27.800]   Right.
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:29.240]   And release the guy in part.
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:34.560]   You had, you had a great interview with Bill and Steve together.
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:35.560]   That was wonderful.
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:36.560]   That was awesome.
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:37.560]   Yes, indeed.
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:38.560]   Yep.
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:39.560]   We were lucky.
[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:40.560]   Yeah.
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:41.560]   I mean, that was a moment.
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:42.560]   And you handled it quite well.
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:43.560]   I mean, you really.
[01:20:43.560 --> 01:20:44.560]   Thank you.
[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:46.560]   Yeah, that's a potential minefield.
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:51.480]   Well, you know, we talked to them before because we wanted it to be bigger.
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:53.360]   You know, we wanted them not to have not to be.
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:57.600]   I mean, although, you know, a catfight would have been very entertaining for people.
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:59.960]   And I think there's definitely tensions between them.
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:02.200]   But I think that we wanted them to be on a higher level.
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:05.960]   And we thought it was important for historical purposes and because they hadn't been together
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:12.080]   in almost any interviews ever to really talk about the big, the big, the big ticket.
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.920]   I know I loved it.
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:16.720]   And there was a great bit of nostalgia talking about.
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:17.720]   Yes, very touching.
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:18.720]   I really enjoyed that.
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:22.200]   I like, I know my favorite line was when I said, is there a secret that people don't
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:28.520]   know about the two of you and Steve Jobs said, well, Bill and I have married for many years.
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:32.840]   And Bill Gates's face, he didn't know it was coming like turned like.
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:34.800]   But they both, you know what?
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:35.840]   Look, they're both smart guys.
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:36.840]   They're very successful.
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:39.000]   They have a good sense of humor sometimes.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.800]   And not always.
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:44.760]   Once in a while, I think if you got them in an ice relaxed state, which really worked
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:45.760]   well.
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:48.240]   We tried before because Steve Jobs has had some somewhat negative things about, someone
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:53.480]   asked why, I think Walt had an interview with them before our big interview saying, why
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:56.880]   do people use the eye, why do people use iTunes on Windows?
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:58.200]   Why is it the most popular app?
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:00.320]   And Steve Jobs couldn't resist himself.
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:05.040]   And he said, well, if you gave someone ice water in hell, they'd be happy to.
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:09.240]   And Bill Gates was sitting in the front row and I was like, oh no, like all about the PR
[01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:10.240]   is for Apple.
[01:22:10.240 --> 01:22:12.160]   We're like, oh, that's the end of that.
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:13.480]   The R interview is going to be ugly.
[01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:16.320]   And definitely Gates was not happy about that quote for sure.
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:19.760]   Oh, Steve said also, Steve said the problem with Bill Gates, he has no taste.
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:20.760]   Right.
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:21.760]   Well, yeah, he said that.
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:22.760]   So he does that all this.
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:23.760]   He likes to tweak.
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:26.920]   He's sort of like that kid in school that likes to tweak the other kids, you know.
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:29.200]   But then, you know, Jobs isn't a mute.
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:33.160]   You weren't going to look back at, you know, something like the iPod high-fi.
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:34.160]   Oh, God.
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:36.200]   The job saying, oh, I've replaced my own.
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:37.200]   I don't know.
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:38.960]   I mean, that was such a crop, wasn't it?
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:39.960]   I know.
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:40.960]   I know.
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:45.600]   I hope he didn't replace his high-fi with that because yeah, it was big mistake.
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:47.280]   He's a very tricky dude.
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:48.440]   Good and bad.
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:49.840]   He's a good, he's a brilliant marketer.
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:51.040]   He's a brilliant businessman.
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:52.280]   He has great taste.
[01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:54.000]   There's no doubt about it.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.000]   One last story.
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:23:00.040]   The Olympics are coming up, the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, the winter Olympics.
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:05.280]   And a number of athletes have said, I'm not going to be able to tweet because it's against
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:11.360]   the rules here, an article in Wired Magazine says, "American skier Lindsey Vaughn, one
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:15.720]   of the potential stars of the 2010 Winter Olympics, told her 35,000 Twitter followers
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:16.960]   she would not be tweeting."
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:17.960]   No.
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:21.200]   There is in fact no Olympic rule that sets up a blackout period.
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.200]   They are allowed to tweet.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:24.600]   They're just not allowed to act as journalists apparently.
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:29.040]   So they can't say like, the results are in from the, you know, hockey game and it was
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:30.040]   3-2.
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:31.040]   Why?
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:32.040]   That's a good question.
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.040]   Antiquated.
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:34.040]   That's ridiculous.
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:35.040]   There should be tons of tweeting.
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.040]   I can't imagine some of those athletes.
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:37.040]   Why would they do?
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:40.040]   Or whatever, not just tweeting, but putting stuff on Facebook.
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:41.040]   Logging post.
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:42.040]   I can't.
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:43.040]   They're going to do pictures.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:46.160]   There's going to be like a ridiculous flood vomiting of information.
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:48.520]   Well, that's what the, that's what one of the Olympic guys said.
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:50.440]   This is going to be the Twitter Olympics.
[01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:56.600]   But they did publish a four page document, the IOC blogging guidelines for persons at
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:24:03.160]   the 21st Olympic Winter Games and defines a blog, personal information, no sound or
[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:05.160]   moving images of the game.
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:06.160]   Oh my God.
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:07.160]   Bite me.
[01:24:07.160 --> 01:24:08.160]   Jesus.
[01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:09.160]   That's a good word.
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:10.160]   Come on.
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:12.160]   It's so, what if someone uses like a little flip camera?
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:13.160]   So what?
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:14.160]   No, you can't.
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:16.960]   Because they've sold those rights to Pepsi Cola.
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:17.960]   You can't.
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:20.880]   Yeah, but if some skiers behind the scenes where they go down the slope and they go,
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:21.880]   "Hey, I'm about to go down the slope.
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:22.880]   It gives me luck."
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:27.000]   Well, it reminds me of our discussion about adcritic.com, which is that the people are
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.240]   still not getting it.
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:29.240]   It's amazing.
[01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:30.240]   Well, NBC.
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:31.240]   What can we say?
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:33.160]   Kara, it's been so great.
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:34.160]   I hope you will come back.
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:35.160]   I hope we haven't done.
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:36.160]   Anytime.
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:37.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:38.160]   Bring your dogs.
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.160]   Bring your kids.
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:40.160]   I will have the dog.
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.160]   The dog is much more intelligent.
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.160]   No, really fun.
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:43.160]   Actually, you know what kids are.
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:45.600]   My kids are much more intelligent about technology than I am.
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:49.360]   Well, that's good to have kids because besides the fact that you can now go to Disney movies
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:50.920]   again, you do get to find out how.
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:52.840]   Oh, thank you so much for that.
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:55.400]   How many times have you seen up now?
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:57.360]   Oh, you know what?
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:01.280]   I was in a -- I went to see the Nutcracker this year.
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:02.280]   That's fun.
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:04.280]   Oh, for the 109th time.
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:07.600]   This woman in front of me got up and said to a person sitting nicer and said, "One more
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:13.680]   nutcracker closer to death."
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:17.640]   We have a Nutcracker in San Francisco called the Hard Nut.
[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:19.240]   That's the one you should go see.
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:20.240]   I go to the gay one.
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:21.240]   I go to the gay one.
[01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:22.240]   Yeah, that's a good one too.
[01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:23.560]   Yeah, that's a lot more fun.
[01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:24.760]   It still is.
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:25.840]   Is that the ballet track of Arrow?
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:26.840]   Who does that one?
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:27.840]   I don't know.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:28.840]   One of the groups.
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:29.840]   We went to that one.
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:30.840]   The drag one.
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:31.840]   The drag one.
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:33.720]   You can't go wrong with a guy in size 12 pumps.
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:38.200]   You know, they had it, interestingly, during my iPhone, the iPad launch.
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:39.200]   That's where they had it.
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:43.400]   And I was like, "Oh, this is where I went to the Nutcracker recently."
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:44.400]   That's right.
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:46.320]   It was the -- Erbil Bwettis Center for the Arts.
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:47.800]   That's right.
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:52.960]   All Things D, go to carer.allthingsd.com and it's all aggregated there.
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:55.320]   There's Jason coming by.
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:56.320]   There he is.
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:57.320]   iPod Prankster.
[01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:58.320]   Yeah.
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:01.720]   Jason Callackenas talks about tweets.
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:02.720]   Thank you, Carol.
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:03.720]   We really appreciate being here.
[01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:04.720]   No problem.
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:05.720]   Thank you so much.
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:06.720]   Will Harris, always a pleasure.
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:08.520]   I had to bring a Brit on because we knew you wouldn't care about that.
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:09.520]   What do you call it?
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:10.520]   Hand egg?
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:11.520]   Yeah.
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:14.160]   It's not big or minus the priorities.
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:15.160]   Hand egg.
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:17.720]   The big hand egg Super Bowl is tonight.
[01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:18.720]   Who cares about that?
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:19.720]   Good Colts.
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:20.960]   Oh, at least he knows who's playing.
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:21.960]   Go Colts.
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:22.960]   Are you for the Colts?
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:23.960]   Really?
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:24.960]   Not the New Orleans?
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:25.960]   How can you be for the house?
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:26.960]   No idea.
