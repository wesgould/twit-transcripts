[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.520]   I doubt it.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.520]   I don't even remember.
[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.520]   I just say that.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.520]   You know, it's like a comic.
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.520]   Oh, the audience last night.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.520]   They were awful.

[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.520]   I didn't laugh at anything.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.520]   Also with this, one of my favorite Raspberry Crazy Ants,
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.520]   Mr. Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle,
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.520]   who now has power.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.520]   That's right.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.520]   That's right.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.520]   After 11 days of not having power after Ike,
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.520]   we got it back about 11 days afterwards.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.520]   It was hell.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.520]   How does that affect a geek like you?
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.520]   Well, you cling to your iPhone.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.520]   And your guns and religion.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.520]   Yeah, I was going to say this.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.520]   That's right.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.520]   And when you can find a plug that has power,
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.520]   you plug all of your gadgets into it.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.520]   Yeah, charge.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.520]   There's a big mall here called the Galleria,
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.520]   and people were going up to the Galleria
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.520]   and finding the plugs where the cleaning crews plug in
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.520]   their vacuums and cleaning machines,
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.520]   plugging in their notebooks.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.520]   They were camping out in the Galleria.
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.520]   Why did the Galleria have power, but not residences?
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.520]   The way the power company here restored power,
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.520]   they went to kind of the key areas first.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.520]   So the medical center, the big commerce centers got
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.520]   restored power first, and then they kind of worked out.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.520]   And the Galleria was one of the areas that they brought up right away.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.520]   Because everybody needs to shop in a disaster.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.520]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.520]   Very important.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.520]   My wife learned to cook omelets on our gas fireplace.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.520]   Oh, my God.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.520]   I was very proud of it.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.520]   So we have a gas stove.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.520]   So we'd be okay, I guess, with that.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.520]   But still...
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.520]   That's the big main broke.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.520]   It's very scary.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.520]   And we're going to have a big quake, right, Sean?
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.520]   I know, you know, when the big quakes hit,
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.520]   I don't know how much you're affected up there where you are.
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.520]   I think it's not much.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.520]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.520]   We're actually near the San Andreas Fault here.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.520]   But we're on our houses on bedrock, but the Twig Cottage will
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.520]   actually sink below the surface.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.520]   Mm-hmm.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.520]   Of the sea, because we're on landfill here.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.520]   Oh, bedrock is, of course, the way to go.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.520]   I mean, a lot of people don't realize that most of San Francisco is
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.520]   on bedrock, and when they have a big quake,
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.520]   it doesn't damage a lot.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.520]   Right.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.520]   And the big quake in the 1906 was from the...
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.520]   The problem was the fire.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.520]   It wasn't the quake so much.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.520]   That's right.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.520]   On the last quake in '89, I was up on the hill where quite tower is.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.520]   And nothing.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.520]   And...
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.520]   But you go down to, of course, the marina, which is based on...
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.520]   It's basically the entire marina district of San Francisco is
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.520]   built on the foundation of ships that were sunk after the gold rush.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.520]   And mud.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.520]   And mud.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.520]   And so when it shakes, it liquefies and you just...
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.520]   Sink into it.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.520]   Yep.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.520]   So it's a...
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.520]   Anyway, you know, we're all facing horrible disasters before the
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.520]   show we were talking about epidemics, plagues.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.520]   Do you ever read Gina Colada's book, "The Coming Plague"?
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.520]   There's a cheery fireside book.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.520]   Her premises, we are on a brief...
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.520]   I ordered that book and got a penicolata so it's just...
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.520]   No, Gina Colada.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.520]   It's a...
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.520]   Their premises is that we are on a brief, very short, temporal
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.520]   interim in which we're winning the war against bacteria, but, you
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.520]   know, it's going to come back the way it was before and we're all
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.520]   going to die, basically.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.520]   Well, you know, maybe it wouldn't come back the way it did
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.520]   before if these pharmaceutical companies were working on
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.520]   antibacterial measures rather than various things like Cialis
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.520]   and Viagra and all these other...
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.520]   Look at the ads on TV.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.520]   It's all for erectile dysfunction.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.520]   Disfunction.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.520]   We're all going to be very sick but very horny.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.520]   [laughter]
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.520]   If...
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.520]   Yeah, well, never mind.
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.520]   I'm not going to make any jokes about four hours.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.520]   I just...
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.520]   I kind of am with you.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.520]   I think, you know, maybe we're all a little bit gloomy, a little
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.520]   bit of glum because the economy is just not, you know, looking
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.520]   too good, but an interesting post and I know you remarked on
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.520]   this in your tech blog at the Houston Chronicle, Dwight,
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.520]   interesting post.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.520]   I think it was in the New York Times saying maybe that the
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.520]   tech industry will miss this particular bust.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.520]   Why are we not...
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.520]   We're going to see a little bit this week.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.520]   Apple's results will come out.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.520]   Google's results though came out last week and we're very
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.520]   positive.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.520]   What's the story?
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.520]   Is the tech bust going to hit or are we going to dodge a
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.520]   bullet?
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.520]   Well, I think, you know, one of the things that...
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.520]   There were actually two stories in the New York Times.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.520]   One of them focused on Apple saying that Apple...
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.520]   Is it maybe able to avoid a burn from the recession.
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.520]   The other story talked in general about the whole electronics
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.520]   industry saying that this is the kind of thing that people
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.520]   cut back on.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.520]   That, you know, they don't buy iPods, they don't buy high-end
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.520]   cell phones, they don't buy the kind of things that are
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.520]   considered luxuries.
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.520]   But at the same time, you know, the next day they had a story
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.520]   that said Apple may not face it because it plays to a completely
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.520]   different niche market.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.520]   And one of the things that interests me here is just
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.520]   exactly how much this...
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.520]   The economic downturn, what we've seen on Wall Street,
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.520]   actually affects real people day to day.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.520]   I think people react psychologically.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.520]   They quit spending and that kind of pulls back on the
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.520]   economy because the economy is consumer driven.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.520]   And so the electronics industry ends up getting hurt.
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.520]   So if people just kind of ignored it and just said,
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.520]   "Yeah, those wacky folks on Wall Street" and just kept doing
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.520]   what they do with the economy survived.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.520]   I'll tell you where it is going to hurt.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.520]   I think we're already seeing this.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.520]   Is in all of these Web 2.0 startups that are venture
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.520]   capital based but have no revenue because they're going
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.520]   to lose their funding.
[00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.520]   They're just going to have to close their doors.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.520]   Didn't we kind of see this on the bubble, John?
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.520]   Kind of.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.520]   That's what happened.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.520]   Sorry, no more money.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.520]   See ya.
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.520]   Yeah, there were guys that were cut off right in the middle of it.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.520]   After they already announced they got the 30...
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.520]   You know, you don't necessarily, with a lot of these deals,
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.520]   get a check for $20 million when you're funded.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.520]   You can get, you know, they say, "We're funding you for $20 million."
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.520]   And then they start to dole out the money.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.520]   So they keep you from spending.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.520]   And at this point, this happened to Red Gorilla.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.520]   I don't even remember them.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.520]   Red Gorilla, they had this huge building downtown San Francisco.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.520]   And it was one of those personal management, you know,
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.520]   PIM, and the kind of in the cloud and kind of not.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.520]   But anyway, they just pulled the money.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.520]   Just right in the middle of everything.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.520]   The guys were doing fine.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.520]   Everything was on track to what they promised to do.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.520]   They weren't making any mistakes.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.520]   But the VCs just said, "You know, don't like what we're seeing.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.520]   We're stopping.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.520]   Your checks are not coming anymore."
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.520]   And they had to literally close up overnight.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.520]   Wow.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:12.520]   Twitter.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.520]   At this time, in 2000, October 17th, I found a story on it.
[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.520]   About this time.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.520]   Right, these things are cyclical.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.520]   So, and October is always the bad month.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.520]   So Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, the guy who invented the concept,
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.520]   we don't know, fired, quit, Eve Williams taking over.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.520]   This to me is a symptom of the beginning, right?
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.520]   We're seeing companies lay people off, eBay lays off a thousand.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:43.520]   Well, in the case of Twitter, Eve and Jack switch jobs.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.520]   Wow.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.520]   Jacks.
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.520]   So, I'm not sure that that's what you think it is there.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.520]   Well, you know, I'm not sure either.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.520]   No one's got to be the chairman.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.520]   Someone's got to be the CEO, right?
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.520]   But the CEO's running a day to day.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.520]   So, I think in a way it's a vote of no confidence for the way Jack was running it.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:03.520]   And some say, yeah, chairman, that's, you know, first step on the way out the door.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.520]   What do you think, John?
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.520]   Are you following this?
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:10.520]   You know, unless you're there, I don't think you can really know.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.520]   And the Twitter is in the company.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.520]   Completely true to Twitter form.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.520]   They're not saying a thing.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.520]   They're becoming the Soviet Union of startups.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.520]   I mean, just, we know what?
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.520]   What?
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.520]   What?
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.520]   What?
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.520]   They didn't have blog posts.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.520]   They did a blog post on it.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.520]   Well, but it was completely disinformation.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.960]   Well, it seems to me that at least the operation is still running.
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:40.920]   And then as part of the news rundown that we have today, Britney Spears has finally joined
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.120]   Twitter, which was something we've talked about almost a year ago.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:48.120]   What will happen when some big star finally goes on Twitter?
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.720]   Has anything happened?
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:55.200]   She's got about 1900 followers, but it's not really her.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.200]   It's her people.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.200]   Well, yeah.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.200]   No, you can read it until it's not her because it's written in the third person.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.240]   Is it Twitter.com/Britney Spears?
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.960]   No, curiously, it's the real Britney.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:07.960]   Oh, you know, why?
[00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.560]   Because somebody's got to look at there's two posts on Twitter.com/Britney Spears.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:16.680]   One is I think I'm going back to rehab and I can't remember any of this.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.120]   So that's not, that's not her.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.200]   The real Britney, just like the real Devorak.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.680]   Yeah, I thought that was an homage to me.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.880]   It is an homage to you.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.560]   Over a million hits in 24 hours on the new Britney Spears.com.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.760]   You guys really are the best fans in the world.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:40.000]   Well, there is a reason to visit the Britney Spears.com site because there's a couple.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.720]   They have a photo of her September cover on Allure.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.000]   And you can see why this woman is just got to be the most amazing person.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.920]   If you're like a makeup artist or somebody who just likes to make up women that have
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:56.360]   this kind of semi neutral face that could be made to look like anybody.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.360]   It's true.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.360]   It doesn't look like her, does it?
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:03.160]   No, it looks like some Italian hot, you know, like some hot Italian actress or something.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.080]   She's still got the honker though.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.040]   Well, you know, I've seen that nose made up.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.600]   First time I started noticing this with her, I was in Singapore.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.720]   And they had these pictures of this gorgeous blonde woman without this big nose because
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.320]   it was, you can make a nose look bigger or smaller if you're really a good makeup person.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.320]   You know what, John?
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.520]   No one's looking at the nose.
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.880]   So anyway, the point is that I said, who would that?
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.880]   Wow, look at that.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.960]   Is that some local woman who's a Degas Miles?
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.720]   And they said, no, and the guys matter of fact, I know that's Britney Spears.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.720]   And I swear to God, if you saw this picture, you would never recognize her in a million
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.720]   years.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.720]   Wow.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:42.800]   So well, the makeup artist is an artist in this case created like a different thing on
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.800]   the campus.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.440]   Well, actually the makeup artists, real makeup artists are indeed artists.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.120]   It's astonishing what they can accomplish.
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.680]   Britney now has a blog too.
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.480]   Not only is she on Twitter, she's got a blog, but you're right.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.120]   The blogs in third person as well.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.680]   Oh, is this the allure cover?
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.160]   You're right because she's got brown hair.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.360]   You are black or whatever color it is.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.760]   Yeah, I'm seeing it now.
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:05.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.960]   Well, it doesn't look anything like her.
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:08.960]   No.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.640]   No, but she looks good.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:16.560]   Do you think she'll date me if I say, you know, say hi to her on my Twitter and she gets
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.440]   a lot of followers?
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.600]   She, I guarantee that she'll never hear from you.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.600]   I'll never hear from her.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.840]   One of her minions will get back to you.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.400]   Maybe you'll have a fan that picks it up and she'll mention it to Britney and say, hey,
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.960]   you know, there's Leo LaPortz got all these people and he said hi and she'll go, who?
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:39.160]   Who is exactly what she'll say or it shares past the bomb.
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:44.440]   So Stephen Fry, I'm much more interested in the fact that he's on Twitter's and by the
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:50.120]   way, he's, he's Twittering from his African adventures, which I think is very cool.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.480]   And there's also a John Cleese or maybe it's John Cleese.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.480]   It's in Africa, right?
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.920]   Well, he's been on, he's been on Twitter for a while, has he?
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:00.360]   I mean, I think those are to me, those are the celebrities I'd much more be more interested
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.360]   in.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.360]   Yeah, but this is a hodgepon.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.840]   We can't forget hodgepon, absolutely.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.640]   Yeah, but these are all nerd celebrities.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.840]   We're talking about mass market celebrities that could bring down Twitter.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.880]   If all these little girls who think Britney's great all got Twitter accounts, even though
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.160]   I don't, you know, it may not happen.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.480]   I don't think they can.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:17.480]   That's the problem.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.840]   I don't think they know how.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.840]   He might be right.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.200]   MC Hammers on Twitter.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.640]   Hey, you know, hammer is actually hammer.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.120]   Hammer is like not, there's not his people.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.120]   He's doing it.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.120]   You could tell.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.120]   Right.
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.120]   Yeah, I think nothing else to do.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.400]   I think Cleese is, you know, okay.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.400]   So hodgepon has got 12,000 followers.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.320]   He says 7,000 followers.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.720]   Steven Fry, 7,000 followers.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.600]   Britney 2000 followers.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.600]   I don't know.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.600]   She just started this.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.920]   She just started brand new.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.920]   Give her time.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.720]   Should I worry?
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.560]   Is she going to be the next Kevin Rose to my lunch?
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.120]   Kevin Rose that should be worried.
[00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:53.120]   That's right.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:58.240]   I'm not, you know, who's almost, I think he's almost at a thousand now as a, as a bomber.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.240]   You mean a hundred thousand?
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.600]   I mean, what I say a thousand, a hundred thousand, absolutely.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.720]   So, you know, there's one way to challenge her, Leo.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.880]   How do you look in black hair and a push up bra?
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.960]   Oh, you've never seen anything like it.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.600]   That's all I'm going to say.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.280]   And you never got it.
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.400]   Yo, Bama is now 101,000, almost 102,000.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.400]   That's that.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.080]   See, and Twitter is responding very well to this.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.880]   I don't think the question anymore is can Twitter scale?
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:28.040]   I think the question is can Twitter monetize?
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.880]   Is there a way to make money out of this thing?
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:33.240]   Because if it's not, I think they're going to stop getting funding at some point.
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.600]   They've promised a business plan in 2009.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.200]   It may be too late.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:40.960]   No, you know, the thing is with these kinds of numbers is pretty hard to turn your back
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.400]   on it.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.400]   I guess so.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.720]   You couldn't, you wouldn't shut something down.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.720]   That's this successful.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.720]   Right.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:47.720]   What are the record real numbers?
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.840]   Does anybody know what the numbers really are?
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.240]   Nobody knows.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.200]   There are last numbers I saw published was 2.2 million.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.200]   That was in July.
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.360]   I think it's around three now.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.960]   There are sites that you don't try to track everybody.
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:00.960]   A day?
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:01.960]   No, no, a members total.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:02.960]   Oh, members.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.800]   I'm going to post the day, I wonder.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:06.800]   You know what?
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.880]   I think Jack said something when he came to bear hub camp.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.480]   I think it was 60.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.480]   Let's see.
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.240]   They will give you a feed.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:20.120]   There's an academic research feed that as I think 600 posts a minute.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.800]   And that's a small, that's a fraction of the total.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.000]   So it is, you know, it's probably 100 posts a second to it.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   I don't know.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.720]   He knows because nobody, you know, Twitter is not telling.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:35.960]   You can go to these sites that attempt to try like Twitter.com or Twitter counter.com.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.960]   Twitter counter.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.640]   Let me see how many people they are currently following.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.680]   They should have it here somewhere.
[00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.680]   They don't see it.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.600]   Twitter I think was 3 million people.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:54.080]   And these, I think they just scrape the site trying to find people, you know.
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.080]   Somehow I got that.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.080]   But you can't do it that way.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.440]   And that's not anywhere near a site.
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.840]   It would be, but it would be better than just the total number, right?
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.920]   Because the total number is, I mean, there includes a lot of people signed up and posted
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:06.920]   once.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:07.920]   Or never.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:08.920]   Or never.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.040]   What you'd really want to know is how many active users there are.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.360]   Isn't that what you care about?
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.720]   So what do you think?
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.560]   Is Apple Immune?
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.680]   I don't, I don't think we know.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.880]   I mean, it depends on kind of what kind of an economic downturn this is.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.040]   If it's real and even people who have the kind of money they want to spend on Apple
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.080]   computers decide they don't want to do it, then yeah, it might.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:36.120]   Apple announces this week not a $800 computer, not a $900.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.280]   A thousand dollar, their cheapest laptop.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:42.680]   And they go up to like almost 3,000 with the top of the line laptop in a way, thumbing
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.760]   their nose at the recession.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.760]   Thumbing their nose and also kind of saying who they really are.
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:53.480]   I mean, they decided that they, I think with this announcement that they really are a company
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:17:01.480]   that does premium products at premium prices, you know, they have been pushing to get Windows
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:02.920]   users to switch.
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:07.440]   And I think there's just so many Windows users who are going to switch and spend more money
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:12.160]   for an Apple machine than they would for some of these cheap Windows machines you can get.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.880]   And at some point that pool dries up.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:15.880]   Oh.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.080]   And so growth is limited.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.160]   Growth is limited, I think, in terms of the switches.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.840]   I think you'll continue to see it.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:21.840]   I think there's still some left.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:22.840]   But not much.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:23.840]   I don't think.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:30.200]   Have either one of you seen the new Apple ad, the new Hodgman ad that it attacks the Microsoft
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.680]   ads which I've been waiting for?
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.680]   Oh, no.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.920]   Oh, let's go.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.920]   Apple.com/switch.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.920]   Yeah, they just put these up.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.280]   They want the ad for people out there want to hear about it.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.280]   It goes as follows.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:46.200]   He got Hodgman sitting there with a big pile of money and he's going and he's got, and
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:50.320]   he's taken chunks of the money putting in this bigger pile and he, where he puts a pile
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.920]   of money and it says advertising.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:57.640]   And then he takes a little bit of money, puts it in fixed Vista, another smaller.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:01.760]   And then the Macintosh guy says, "Hey, what are you doing?
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:06.280]   You're not going to be able to fix Vista with just that little pile when you get all
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.680]   that money go for advertising."
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.080]   And Hodgman's punchline is, "Oh, you're right."
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.000]   And he takes all the money from fixed Vista and shoves it into the pile for advertising.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.920]   No, I have to say, let's play it.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.920]   I got to play it.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.920]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.920]   Apple's going to get it free.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.920]   Oh, Mac.
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.920]   I'm not going to be advertising advertising advertising.
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:23.920]   I'm advertising.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.920]   Fix Vista.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:25.920]   Advertising.
[00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:26.920]   Advertising.
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:27.920]   I'm advertising.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:32.640]   I'm just doing a little budgeting Mac with all the Vista problems that have been frustrating
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.640]   PC users.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.120]   I have to take drastic action.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.560]   By investing in advertising.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.560]   Yes, advertising.
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.560]   And I'm also putting something toward resolving Vista's problems.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:43.880]   Do you really think that amount of money is going to help fix Vista?
[00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:44.880]   I guess you're right.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.880]   I'll just put it all in advertising.
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.680]   Okay, that's brilliant.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:54.120]   And it's going to make Paul Therat go ballistic.
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.640]   He already hates these ads.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.880]   He says they're taking unfair shots at Vista.
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.560]   Is Vista really that bad?
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:01.560]   I don't think so.
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:02.560]   Anybody want to defend it?
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:08.480]   I think if you're on a machine that's designed for it, I think if it is, if you've got up-to-date
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:15.920]   drivers and you can put up with the user account control, I think it's fine.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.600]   I love the Arrow interface.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.200]   I would love to figure out a way to glom the Arrow interface onto OSX.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.200]   Really?
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.200]   Oh, it's tin.
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.200]   Yeah, I love Arrow.
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.200]   No, I love Arrow.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.200]   Sorry.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:27.200]   What's wrong with you?
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.200]   You're something.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.800]   I love that like glassy see-through.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.600]   I'm into eye candy.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:39.200]   I don't think there's anything wrong with attacking a competitor with what might amount
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.440]   to a kind of stretching the truth.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.360]   It's illegal and the United States to do that.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.360]   It's not legal.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.360]   It's written, by the way.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.600]   Apple ads have been pulled several times.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.760]   Yeah, no, it's not legal in Germany either.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.120]   But it's not legal in a lot of places.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:58.720]   But the point is, is that where it's legal, I don't see any problem with it because it's
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.560]   taking what people are perceiving.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:05.080]   In fact, Microsoft acknowledged this with that Mojave experiment, perceiving things
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:09.360]   is a bad idea and then milking it to promote your own product.
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.040]   I mean, this is just the way it is.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:15.960]   I heard that Vista has been paloring around with terrorists.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.800]   I just heard that.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.760]   I don't know if it's true or not, but I heard it.
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:26.040]   I got one of the, I was sent by Apple to review one of the new Macbooks.
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.000]   And I got to say, it is a pretty fine machine.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.560]   I have a black MacBook is my own personal machine.
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.880]   And I really, yeah, and I really like it.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.320]   I mean, it's a very impressive, I don't know if it's enough to make me want to give up
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.960]   my black MacBook yet, but it is well made.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.960]   It's really well made.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.960]   Oh, you did?
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:46.960]   I ran out and bought it.
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.280]   You know, actually the first one I have purchased, I've tried to figure it out and
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:54.640]   I can't count them, but I bought my first Mac in 1984, almost 25 years ago now.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.120]   And I probably owned several dozen.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.280]   Never had one DOA.
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.040]   This one was DOA.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.040]   It arrived.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.840]   It gave me just enough time to install everything, work like, you know, 10 hours getting everything
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.880]   just right then died, but they replaced it immediately.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.120]   I mean, I walked in and they said, okay, let's give you a new one.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.280]   And you're right.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.920]   I have to agree with you.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.800]   Sure, it really excels Dwight.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.360]   Besides the fact that it costs almost 3,000 bucks, fit and finish is spectacular.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.360]   It is.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:21.560]   But that price it should be.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:22.560]   I think it's a BMW.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:24.160]   Don't you think it's kind of a Alexis?
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.760]   It's a kind of a luxury, a status symbol of a computer.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.760]   Right.
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.720]   And, and, and you know, again, the question is like the question of the economy, are people
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.720]   willing to pay extra for that?
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.720]   It's risky.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:42.000]   Well, we said this when the air came out, would people pay 1,800 bucks for a kind of
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.880]   a computer that really wasn't very powerful and yet looked great?
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:51.800]   The air is probably more susceptible to getting slammed by a downturn than the other stuff.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:52.800]   It's been a success.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.040]   Yeah, but the downturn is in play now.
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.040]   Let's see what happens.
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:03.880]   What's interesting is, you know, these designs were done probably started 2 years ago, right?
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:09.040]   And, and so a lot of the, the planning and so forth, certainly for the way they market
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:12.680]   it the way they price it happened, say six months ago.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.680]   Right.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.680]   And so what you had no idea.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.680]   No idea.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.680]   In other words, right.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:21.040]   And so it comes out now what happens when they have these expensive machines, nothing
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:27.560]   to compete at the $500, $600, $700 area when the economy turns down, you know, what happens
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:32.480]   to that, particularly for those people who are interested in switching.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.480]   Your prediction?
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:37.680]   Oh, damn Leo, you would do that.
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.680]   No, you know what?
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.840]   Nobody, predict anything you want.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.280]   Dvorak's learned this years ago.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.920]   Doesn't really, doesn't really matter.
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.200]   Just say what you think and nobody will remember anyway.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.200]   Okay.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.200]   Here's what I think.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:55.040]   I think that Apple is going to probably have one more, maybe one more through Christmas,
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:59.080]   a quarter in which they kind of gain some market share.
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:04.240]   And then they begin to have largely replacement sales on older Macs and they, you know, what's
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.600]   going to happen ultimately is people who are looking to switch are going to look at
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:14.520]   the price when they don't have much money between a, say, $600, $700 Dell and the MacBook
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:18.160]   and they're going to go with the Dell and for go switching to the Mac.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.840]   And I think that's the risk that they run.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:25.120]   So I'd say I give them another quarter through Christmas and then start watching real closely
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.920]   in late, in early 2009.
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:27.920]   You agree, John?
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.360]   That's my reckless prediction.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:35.560]   Not completely because I think that once the presidential election is finished that we're
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:44.080]   going to have a, an upswing in the market in general that will eliminate this, this fear,
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.560]   this short term freakiness that's out there.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.520]   And I think Apple will be just fine.
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.360]   Typically that is what happens.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:56.880]   If the economy stabilizes and if everything is fine, then I think, yeah, I think you're
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.880]   right, John.
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.800]   It's interesting because you'll hear the pundits and even the economists say this is
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:08.360]   the worst economy since the Depression, which took a decade to solve.
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:12.720]   And yet in our recent history, these kinds of things do seem to kind of resolve themselves
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.720]   fairly quickly.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:17.160]   Well, you know, you got the one thing that's always being overlooked with this particular
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:23.560]   situation or for one thing to me, it's a panic, not a depression and the panics are used to
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:27.160]   be very common in the 19th century, but we haven't seen too many recently.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:31.760]   The thing that's always being overlooked is that in a real depression, the public at
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:36.720]   large is hurt as much or more so than the professionals that are in the business.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.200]   The public was not in this market.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:43.280]   And in fact, my one of the employees that we have at the deli was remarking to my wife
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:48.160]   recently that, you know, she got up and she was depressed about this whole thing, this
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.600]   market crash and all the rest of the engine, she's dawned on her.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.880]   She said, you know, I don't have any stock.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:53.880]   I got no stock.
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.880]   I don't care.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.280]   I don't know if people have them in their retirement accounts and their 401ks.
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:59.880]   I talked to a lot of people who say, what am I going to do when I retire?
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:03.120]   Yeah, but that's not money that they were going to spend anyway.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:07.160]   And if they have more than a few years left, as Jim Kramer said, if you got more than five
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:08.920]   years, nothing to worry about.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.560]   And they look at it and say, Oh, my guy lost half of my 401k.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:19.200]   What this is actually going to manage to do to the detriment of people who believe otherwise,
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:23.400]   it's going to eliminate the probability or even possibility at some point that social
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.960]   security is going to be privatized because it just shows you that the, that, you know,
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:32.480]   this is not a safe way to go to do to manage these, these little accounts by yourself.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:40.200]   I think the one caveat is that people do use stock based funds and investments to save
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.200]   for other things.
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:48.200]   So for example, we have a fund that we're using to save for our kids college and we're
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.840]   coming up on having to spend that.
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.840]   And it suddenly has about half the money in it that it had before.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.960]   That's all paper money if we wait, but, but we're coming up on, you know, next September,
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.360]   trying to get our kid into college.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:03.720]   So it has a real impact in those kinds of situations.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:08.080]   Yeah, it just depends where you are, I guess, on the, on the scale.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.080]   I'm with you, John.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.160]   I think it is kind of a panic.
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:16.800]   And in fact, I think this is probably a good time for a company like Apple that has, what
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:17.800]   do they have?
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:18.800]   20 billion in the bank?
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.760]   They have no significant debts.
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.960]   Yeah, no, they're in great shape financially.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:27.040]   By the way, Warren Buffett came out and said, and if anybody wants to read this, my column
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:33.920]   that just ran in market watch discusses the, what I believe are some good ideas in terms
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.440]   of investing in tech.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.240]   But Buffett came out and said, Hey, you know, this is the time to buy.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.240]   I mean, what's over thinking?
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.640]   Now if it was, if we were sliding into a, to a depression, it wouldn't make any difference
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.160]   because it's just going to, you're going to be screwed in one way or another anyway.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:54.760]   But I still believe that until the public is fully in and the market is skyrocketing,
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:27:00.840]   where you can actually have a crash that there's, I just don't see it so wimpily falling
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.640]   into a long 10 year depression.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.800]   And we've just been in a 10 year downturn since the crash and then 9/11.
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:10.680]   So I mean, there's nothing has ever gone on for 20 years.
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:15.440]   So your prediction, John is, it's not going to be six months and then recovery.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.440]   You think they're in good shape.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.440]   I would say the same thing.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:22.480]   I, in fact, I'm probably the most bullish on Apple and the tech sector in general.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.080]   Look, the tech sectors with suffering.
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.160]   Look at Dell for the last two years has been suffering.
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:33.120]   But that's because of razor thin margins and PCs, a company like Apple with great margins,
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:40.080]   great cash position, no significant liabilities, I think is in great shape.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:46.800]   I think we're also in a situation where we have enterprise, a large enterprise operations
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.440]   going through cycles where they buy new hardware.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.160]   We're coming up now at this point on one of those cycles where they would hurt the PC
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.760]   business badly, wouldn't it?
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.760]   If they stopped that.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:02.680]   Now I got to tell you, we were in the process of upgrading our systems at the Chronicle
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:07.560]   to do Dell's and that's kind of been put on hold for the moment because of economics.
[00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.880]   And so we were kind of watching that.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.800]   We were about to do this paper industry, you know, as its own issues.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:16.000]   You got your own cyclical problems and the cycle is all one way.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.600]   I'm sorry to say there's no turnaround for print.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.760]   Yeah, suicide is an option.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:26.880]   Well, but you've done, you've done any, any sensible reporter at this point has done
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.600]   what they can to transform themselves into digital media.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.640]   And the Chronicle, I think has done a pretty good job.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.720]   Is it poster boy for this?
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:35.720]   Right.
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.720]   Right.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:44.720]   So we're going to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:48.520]   bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a
