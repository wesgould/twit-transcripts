[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   This is TWiT, This Week in Tech, Episode 201, for June 28, 2009.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Hi, Leo Laporte for Throatbeards!

[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   [Music]
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   This is TWiT, This Week in Tech, Episode 201.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   And we are gathered in the newly air-conditioned Twitt Cottage with John C. Dvorak.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   I really couldn't make John come here anymore in the heat.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   And then he says, "It's blowing on me, it's cold."
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I came up here because it's like a hundred.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   It's a hundred. Yeah, it's great. It's a hundred. And you like that?
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   You know what's really cool about this kind of hot temperature that anyone who has ever ridden a motorcycle knows this.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Normally you're going to motorcycle and kind of cool off.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   But every once in a while you get to a temperature that's hotter than the cool off temperatures.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And so you're like in a convection oven, so the faster you go on the bike the hotter and more miserable you get.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   That doesn't sound like fun. That's what it's like out here right now. It's fantastic.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Brian Brushwood, who has taught me how to eat fire, is also here.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Yeah, they're daring me to try to teach John in the chat room.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Do you have your implements? They're out in the car. We might be able to work something out.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   John, you want to eat fire? I wouldn't mind learning how to do that.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   It's not hard and it's fun. Yeah, well I don't know how much fun it would be.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   It's great. You have to wash your mouth with all that stuff.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   The good news is the air conditioner leaks a little bit so you can just stand under it.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And if we didn't start the fire but the air conditioner put it out, how about that?
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   So we have a number of stories, not very many frankly because I was lazy this week.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   This is my last show before I head to China.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   I should mention next week John will host. He's going to take over the show.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And if you watch live on live.twit.tv, John will be here early, about two in the afternoon Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   He's going to do about an hour of wine before twit. I do about an hour of wine and we're going to have a great show afterwards.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   It's going to be great. And I think we have Becky Worley coming up to join you for twit.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And you can invite of course anybody else you want. I think we should get Jason on.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   You want? Really? That would be kind of amazing.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Actually you know Jason can't do it. I asked Jason if he wanted to do either the fifth or the twelfth.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   And at the same time as I asked you and he said he's in the World Series of Poker on the fifth.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   And he may, if he continues to succeed, be playing on the twelfth.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Well maybe he should be tweeting us.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   He should tweet from the table.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   I think he was doing that. He was talking about some of the preliminary games he's been playing.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Sounds like he was doing pretty well.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I see him tweeting from the table and then seeing what he looks like with broken fingers.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   You were tweeting. There are probably some things that are just not allowed.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   You could tweet almost anywhere. I have a jury summons the day I come back from China.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And I was thinking maybe I should tell the judge, Your Honor I'd like to live blog while I'm here in the trial.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   What could possibly go wrong with that? It sounds brilliant.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   He'll love that.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   So this was the week, a sad week for celebrities because well first, who's first? Ed McMahon was first.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   No, no, no. But even before him.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   David Carradine was that?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   David Carradine. That was a couple weeks ago.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   So he was kind of the warm up act.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Yeah, he was the warm up act.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   The precursor.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Poor David.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Oh Dom DeLuis be honored.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Dom DeLuis be Arthur. Then Ed McMahon and then in fast succession.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   The beautiful Farrah Fawcett.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Totally overshadowed.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Three minutes after she dies, Michael Jackson goes and of course that, yeah she lost all.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And he was the happiest guy in the world?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Who?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Sanford, the governor from South Carolina.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Yes, the big winner here.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   He's the big winner. All the cameras were taken off him immediately.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Oh, he loves that.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   When we did the site on MSNBC, Princess Diana died.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Oh yeah, which killed.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   It killed the site.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Because MSNBC went to wall to wall Diana coverage and it was so successful they said why are we doing this stupid stuff for?
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Let's just keep, maybe if more celebrities die we could have ratings.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Wow. Speaking of, and the ultimate celebrity, the ultimate pitch man, Billy Mays.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   And then today, Billy Mays.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Very sad.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   There is.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   By the way, that is a true story about the MSNBC.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Oh yeah, they canceled the site and that was it forever.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   I know exactly when the site was canceled.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   They didn't cancel, they put us on quote hiatus and then it just never brought us back.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Yeah, that's what hiatus means.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Yeah, hiatus means you're canceled.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   So, there's a site, billytweets.com, and I don't know if it's for Billy Mays or for Michael Jackson.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Click the green play button to begin it says here.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Uh oh.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   What could go wrong?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   I don't even see a green play button.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   I think you already clicked it.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   I don't know what it looks like.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Yeah, there's a.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Well, maybe just click, or maybe it's not the bottom.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   This is one of those sites that has the play button so small.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   When I refresh it, it jumps and it goes away.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   That looks good.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   You can't do it.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Yeah, it's a winner.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Billytweets is, oh well.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Not functioning.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   Nevermind.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Oh good, I click one link and it gives me a JavaScript tutorial.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Well, at least you got something out of it.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   That's probably a mistake.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   And our tech angle is complete.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   A Twitter tribute to Michael Jackson.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Oh, please.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Okay, that's enough.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   I think we've seen enough.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   All right.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   So, how did you find out that Michael Jackson passed away, Brian Brushwood?
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   On the Twitter.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   On the Internet, right?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Well, and what's great is it used to be, I used to be so mad because the way I'd find
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   out celebrities died was you had to figure it out because you'd look on Google News and
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   it would say something vague like, "Billy Mays was a great man."
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   You're like, "Well, what does that mean?
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Did he die or something?"
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And then you have to intuit and figure out that he died.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   I was one of the first of the five Twitterers that nailed this one, by the way.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Which one?
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Michael?
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Michael Jackson.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   There's plenty to go to.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   So, you were reading TMZ and you said, "Hey, this is a big story."
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   You were reading TMZ.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   No, actually, Eric called me up and told me he was reading TMZ.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   That's what I found interesting.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   I got a text message from my 14-year-old son and a phone call from my 17-year-old daughter
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   that Michael Jackson had died.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   They didn't even remember him.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   All they would remember of him is the freaky years, but I guess they knew that this was
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   a big deal.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   He was the Elvis of this generation.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   This is as big as Elvis.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   I don't know.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I mean, it's the same kind of thing.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   It seems.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   You know what's really weird?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   The minute Billy Mays passed away, everybody forgot about Michael Jackson.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   Well, it is.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   It is the pain.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   It amongst us, amongst the techies.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   I don't think the general public.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   This is all they're talking about on Twitter is Billy Mays.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Well, I think it's the techies again.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   I don't think it's the general public.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   I think they're still, I think you're going to see Michael Jackson specials for the next
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   two or three days on all these shows.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   You're not going to see any Billy Mays specials.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Well, it's already the top, like seven of the top 10 on iTunes are Michael Jackson singles.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   He owns iTunes all of a sudden.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Not singles too, albums as well.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Somebody suggested that it may in fact be a scam.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   I don't know.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   That would be a good one.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   A Michael Jackson scam?
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   He wakes up and he's just like, "No more debt for me.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Thank you."
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   I'm back.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   No, he's not going to be back.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   No, that's true.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   But it is, I agree.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   What an idea.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   It was really interesting to watch the split between the people who were-
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Sick, but good idea.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   I still don't think that Andy Kaufman's dead, but that's just-
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   I think that's done.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   He's not coming back now.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   He's dead of old age if nothing else.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   He's not coming back.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   We shouldn't joke about this.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   This is serious stuff.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   What was interesting though is to see the split between people who were very deeply
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   moved like, "Oh no, I'm such a fan," blah, blah, blah.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Then other people, like I remember one of the guys from Dad Labs, he just tweeted out, "Dude
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   dangled his kid off a balcony."
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   He'd also just as positive and negative.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   There was a split.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   There were the people who remembered him as a pederast, as a child molester, who said,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   "Well, why would you mourn the loss of this guy?"
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Yet I mourn it because I'll never forget 1983 watching Apollo.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   You're too young, but John, you must have been like 10 or 11.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   For me, it was Thriller because I was in elementary school when Thriller came out.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Before Thriller, well, no, I guess it was roughly the same timeframe.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   It was the 25th anniversary of Motown at the Apollo Theater.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Jackson comes out, does Billie Jean, so I guess it was Thriller.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   That's the first time we saw the moonwalk.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   He threw his hat.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   It was electrifying.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   That's what I remember.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   I don't remember.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Everyone's doing the moonwalk after that or trying to for the next two or three years.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   How many shabby moonwalks do we all have to endure?
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Do you know how to do, as part of your scam school, do you know how to do a moonwalk?
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   I know how to make other people try to do moonwalks and laugh at them.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Did you see that Jackson had a patent?
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   On the moonwalk?
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   No, he had a patent on shoes that had a special grip on the bottom that you would slot into
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   an attachment on the stage that would allow you to kind of slide up to it, be suddenly
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   gripped, and be able to lean all the way forward.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   You know why he didn't sell many of those?
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Why?
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Because he didn't have Billy Mays selling it for him.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   If he had Billy Mays, you can move yourself to the stage and fall all the way forward.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Look at this.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   It's amazing.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   You're getting there.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   It's not quite, you're not there.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   He never stopped shouting.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   You haven't nailed it yet.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   I think that's pretty good.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   It's close.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   I think I sound just like Billy Mays.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   It's amazing.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   So, let's get to some real news stories.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   By the way, is it true?
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   I think the plan is on Monday to celebrate Billy Mays.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Everybody's going to type in all caps for the entire day.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Everybody should type in all caps all day on Monday.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   It's Billy Mays Day.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   They'd say, "Wear blue.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Wear blue and type in caps."
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   You know what?
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   It's getting better.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   It's growing on me.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Your Billy Mays is getting better.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   I can't stop this, obviously.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   All right.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Pick a story.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Any story, Jon.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Well, let's do Guy Kawasaki since we talked about Twitter.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Guy Kaka-- Guy Kaka-- Guy Kaka-- Guy Kaka story.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   We have not had a single drop of liquor.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   I want to tell everybody no wine.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Maybe that's the problem.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   This is smoothie.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   I thought it was sugar.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Anyways, Twitter account was hijacked.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Okay, everybody eat for a moment.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Well, it doesn't surprise me with--
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Well, that was fascinating.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Let's see what other stories we got.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   How scary is it?
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   How often we give our Twitter information to all these sketchy--
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Did they say how he got hijacked?
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Had he fallen for a scam?
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   They assume that's what it had to be that he gave his info to some Trojan.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   Twitter has been nonstop and, of course, because it's a target--
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Do you think that that shrimp looks like it's safe to eat?
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Yeah, I hope it's safe to eat.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Would you like some?
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   No.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   God, no.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   I shouldn't be eating while I'm doing the show, but I didn't have lunch yet.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   That's okay.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   You're going to China.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   You're going to be eating a lot.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   I don't care.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   I know.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   What kind of food?
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   You've been to China.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   What kind of food do they have?
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   They got--let me think.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   They got Chinese food.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   If I go to China and I say--
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   You will not get egg foo yung or chop suey.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Yeah, and actually, yeah, there's that whole TED talk about how what we think of as Chinese
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   food is totally bogus.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   It's American food.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Yeah, they go around--in fact, she went around handing out fortune cookies, and they were like,
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   "What the hell is this?"
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Yeah, well, actually, fortune cookies were invented in San Francisco.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   But the fact of the matter is--
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   But can I go to Chinatown in China and have fortune cookies?
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   No.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Chinatown in China?
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Is there an American town in China?
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   The joke of Chinese food in the United States is that it actually is Chinese food from 1850.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Because all those coolies came over to build the railroads and such, and they did--and Chinese
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   food is a living cuisine like French cuisine, Italian cuisine.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   It changes.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   And so from 1850, yeah, they probably had an egg foo yung or something like that.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   But that's frozen in time in the USA.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   And then you go to China, it's like, "Holy crap, this is--this is nothing like Chinese
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   food."
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   So, but remember there was a Sichuan fan and a Hunan fan that swept through at least the
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Bay Area.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   I don't know if it swept through all of America.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   But that would be more current Chinese food or no?
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   In those areas.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   The regionals are pretty--
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   So where have you been?
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   I've been to Beijing, outside of Beijing.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   I've been to Sichuan.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   I've been to Xiamen.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   I've been to Shanghai.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   You've been there a lot.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   You've been all over.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Were these junkets so you went to tech companies mostly or did you actually get to--
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   In Xiamen, I went to--there's an art dealer that I had to visit.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Did you get little Japanese-Chinese lions that go on either side of your team?
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   No, he makes copies of monnaies and things like that.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Oh, he's a copier.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Outstanding, by the way.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   All right.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   So I never thought I would be the one to tell DeVore to get back to the--can we talk about
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   tech, please?
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   Oh, man.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Guy Kawasaki's Twitter got hacked.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Yeah, I don't know that there's much to say about it outside of I think it's kind of crazy
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   that we're still just blindly giving out our logins to every--
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   I think you said that.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Every set, yeah.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Okay.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   I tell you what I would really love to talk about is Amazon stepping up and laying the
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   smackdown on the state of North Carolina.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Is this a wild story?
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   So North Carolina's not the only state.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   A number of states have proposed taxing--you'd think, of course, they're going for taxing
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   the purchases, sales tax off of Amazon.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   And that's certainly one of the things they want to get.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   But what they're talking about is taxing--
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   We're not being taxed enough in this country.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Right.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Tax protester John C. DeVorek, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   I'm happy to play my taxes.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   We pay over 55% of our income in taxes in one way or another.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Wow.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   I don't believe that.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Should I be outraged by that?
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   If you're happy with that, that's fine.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   Well, am I getting my money's worth?
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Well, let's see.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   We're paying that kind of money, and the state of California is what, $20 billion in debt?
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   California not doing so good.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   And we have a 10% personal income tax in California plus property tax plus 10% sales tax, and
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   we're in debt?
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   How does that work?
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Where's the money going?
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   That's a good question.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   It's going into somebody's pockets.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Why are we so broke?
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Anyway, apparently Amazon is upset because the state of North Carolina is considering,
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   it's expected to be passed any day now.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   Hasn't been passed.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Not anymore.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   I guarantee you it's not going to happen now.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Here's the way it works.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   In 1992, US Supreme Court ruled in the Quill decision that it was unconstitutional for
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   a state to make another company that has no warehouses, no presence in their state.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   They don't do business in the state.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   Right.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   And so, if you're a business owner, you're not going to be able to make a business out
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   of your own business.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Right.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   And so, if you're a business owner, you're not going to be able to make a business out
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   of your own business.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   Right.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   And so, if you're a business owner, you're not going to be able to make a business out
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   of your own business.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Right.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   And so, if you're a business owner, you're not going to be able to make a business out
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   of your own business.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Right.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   And so, if you're a business owner, you're not going to be able to make a business out
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   of your own business.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Right.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   And so, if you're a business owner, you're not going to be able to make a business out
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   of your own business.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Right.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   And so, if you're a business owner, you're not going to be able to make a business out
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   of your own business.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   Right.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   And so, if you're a business owner, you're not going to be able to make a business out
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   of your own business.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   Right.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   And so, if you're a business owner, you're not going to be able to make a business out
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   of your own business.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   Right.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   And so, if you're a business owner, you're not going to be able to make a business out
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   of your own business.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   Right.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   And so, if you're a business owner, you're not going to be able to make a business out
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   of your own business.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Right.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   And so, if you're a business owner, you're not going to be able to make a business out
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   of your own business.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Right.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   And so, if you're a business owner, you're not going to be able to make a business out
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   of your own business.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   Right.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   And so, if you're a business owner, you're not going to be able to make a business out
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   of your own business.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Right.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   And so, if you're a business owner, you're not going to be able to make a business out
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   of your own business.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Right.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   And so, if you're a business owner, you're not going to be able to make a business out
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   of your own business.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Right.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   And so, if you're a business owner, you're not going to be able to make a business out
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   of your own business.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Right.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   And so, if you're a business owner, you're not going to be able to make a business out
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   of your own business.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   Right.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   And so, if you're a business owner, you're not going to be able to make a business out
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   of your own business.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Right.
