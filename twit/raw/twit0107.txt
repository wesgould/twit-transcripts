[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   more to come I believe.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.920]   Patrick Norton and Robert Herron should be in fact
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.280]   wait a minute here I see Robert on the horn so let's get him in here.
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.800]   We haven't talked to Robert in ages.
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.080]   Also Patrick Norton should be showing up any day now.

[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.280]   How old is your baby now Molly?
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.800]   He is almost five months it's unbelievable.
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.920]   Oh man it seems like it was just the other day you had him.
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.480]   I know I agree.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.480]   Five months.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.520]   Hey that's I recognize that laugh at Steve Gibson.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.120]   Yay from security now.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.680]   Here on the Twit mothership show.

[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.640]   In fact people say all the time I miss the days when Devorach and Gibson would have at
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.640]   it.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.640]   Well here we are.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.640]   When was that?
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.920]   That was the I get no spam episode.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.280]   Yeah what what what what do we say?
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.600]   I don't remember it.
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.160]   You went off on me because I bounced some email that was all right because you used one
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.000]   some little ring key thing system to minimize your spam.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.200]   I was like so lame.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.280]   Yeah of course I did.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.800]   That I was bouncing anything that had HTML and sending a message saying if you know please
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.560]   just use text because so much spam is HTML and you know that's where this I get no spam
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.760]   game but you know that technique still works because a lot of the mail now the bad mail
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.880]   is now has gifs in it.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.040]   Yep so it's still do you still do it?
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.840]   No I turned off all filtering and we changed our addresses and everything's happy every
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.840]   year.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.240]   I was effective in my complaining.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.880]   John that's what it was.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.440]   Inquiring ones want to know do you still get no spam?
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.720]   Yeah well I get me I get like one piece of spam like I'm in my box now and let's see.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.200]   Nothing.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.960]   Most of my email reading now is just going through the box to delete spam that cuts it
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.320]   by about 15-20% and then I just ignore the rest.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.160]   I was going half half to 70% spam.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.160]   I feel like I'm getting something done because I've deleted the spam.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.680]   But you also are having heavy filtering done Leo.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.080]   Oh I have huge filtering.
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.920]   Yeah so if it weren't for that.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.080]   Leo actually gets no mail.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.160]   I get no mail.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.600]   I get no mail.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.640]   So there's a lot to talk about.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.200]   I think we should probably start at least once again pandering to the audience because
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.280]   so many people sent me the link to John's article about using a Mac.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.680]   John C. Devorek is this true?
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.520]   I feel so alone in the world that's all I have to say.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.720]   Are you the last Windows user now Molly?
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.720]   I think I am.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.280]   Yeah and I'm the last unashamed Mac Basher.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.280]   Oh wow.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.920]   Now you know I haven't changed anything.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.640]   I mean basically I'm using a Mac.
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.640]   I went as you know we talked about it before.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.920]   I'm at Podshow and they asked me what I wanted to use.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.880]   And it's a Mac house and in fact the guy who is the head of the who handles all the
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.640]   individual computers is a guy who used to work for Apple at the retail level and he's
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.280]   a Mac expert and they offered me a Mac or a Dell.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.120]   You know I'm thinking first of all I like to get a NPC noise.com machine from those
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.120]   guys up in Washington which is my favorite computer.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.920]   No no we do everything with Dell.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.920]   I said well okay.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.840]   John what do you think this is?
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.440]   You can just write your own ticket here.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.440]   You're a back in the corporate.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.120]   I'm thinking well it wasn't Dell like sponsoring the Twitch show for a while and then they
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.320]   bailed out and they gave it a bail.
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.360]   No wait a minute they did they ran for a few months they may come back they did a quarter.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.600]   Okay well I want to kill the deal but anyway I'm thinking hey Mac I'll take a Mac with two
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.120]   screens and I got you know.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.120]   You got two screens?
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.120]   Oh yeah.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.120]   I'll run two screens.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.120]   Two 30s?
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.120]   No no I don't know.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.120]   It's in the other screens of some of you sonic thing.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.120]   There's more than enough for power for little old John C to work at org slash blah.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.120]   So I'm using it and I'm playing with it.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.120]   You know I have a few issues here and there and I asked this guy about how do you do this.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.120]   This doesn't make any sense.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.120]   You know it cracks me up is that supposedly if there's such a Mac family, why do you do
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.120]   a family?
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.840]   Why is cast blaster in windows?
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.080]   I don't think Adam Curry uses a Mac.
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.240]   Ah that's why.
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.480]   So Adam is not a Mac guy.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.520]   No actually Adam Bloom the CEO doesn't use a Mac either.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.760]   The only it says that everybody else in that office uses a Mac except for now maybe there's
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.840]   one or two PCs but it's pretty rare and the weird thing is this is what's kind of interesting
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.080]   to me because I'm trying to you know I don't normally work for a living.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.840]   So I'm working in office once in a while and what's odd is that most of the Mac users in
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.280]   these environments where you have an office with people using a Mac they mostly use laptop
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.280]   Macs.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.480]   Yeah because the power book the Mac book sorry is where it's at if you're cool.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.480]   Yeah the laptops are.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.480]   I guess so.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.680]   I'm like the only guy with the big clunking iMac dual screen thing everyone else has got
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.400]   laptops and they move them from here to there and they're just scattered around and I use
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.440]   that little laptop I just don't like it that much.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.200]   I mean when he's a Mac he's a big Mac I don't know.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.240]   So poor Molly she's all alone with window.
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.600]   I am all alone and it's you know I used to at least be able to say yes it's true I'm
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.440]   a nanoshame Mac bachelor but I have a Mac at home so I know what I'm talking about.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.440]   But now I have PCs at home.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.880]   Yeah I just bought a new Dell laptop and I'm selling my Mac.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.280]   I couldn't take it anymore.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.360]   What do you like about it?
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.760]   You know what it is.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.560]   I'm refreshing.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.920]   I know I hear hyperventilating I feel a little sorry and I'm maybe this is about it.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:48.360]   I primarily used my Mac for the things that Steve told me Steve Jobs told me that it would
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:55.640]   be great for the iLife and the digital media manipulation and that drove me absolutely
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:56.640]   up a wall.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.440]   I found the iPhoto was completely unusable and would just crash all the time and it was
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.000]   just ludicrous and unbelievable to me that you can't just I don't know cherry pick some
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.200]   photos off of your camera and put them into iPhoto you have to load up the whole thing
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:15.680]   and that OS 10 of all operating systems would not offer some sort of film strip view in
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.640]   the finder like you can't if you have a bunch of photos and you just want to scan through
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:26.560]   them quickly you cannot you have to open each one in preview and look at it which is unbelievable
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:33.040]   and I just I don't know I just found it too aggravating and I found that the most unstable
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:39.560]   apps on the entire thing were the iLife apps mail true forget it i photo forget it did you
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.400]   see the joy of tech column I think I write a comic about you John no I have to go check
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:50.440]   it I did read the fake Steve Jobs blog he talk about you yeah I'm a freak I'm apparently
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.800]   a frigger hard a frigger to but I don't know what a frick Tard is to some explain that to
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:01.180]   me what a frigger Tard is my son was throwing dirt clods over the fence in our neighbors
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:06.000]   yard in the neighbor who's this crusty old guy got mad and we sent my son over so he
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.940]   could chastise him and that's what he called him my son a real hard time not laughing
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:15.080]   in his face and he came over and came back and said you know what he called me actually
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:20.160]   called him the another kind of Tard but anyway an F Tard but and we said what he said and
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:27.400]   I said actually that's not unusual I think the fake Steve Jobs uses that anyway it's
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.940]   the joy of tech and here's a you know it's a nitrous act and snaggies who do our great
[00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:36.500]   album I would be my second my second victory in the joy of you've been in there several
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:43.420]   times anyway enjoy a tech just a typical day hell freezes over pigs fly and of course
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:48.880]   this is all illustrated chickens get lips beautiful lips chickens all because John
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:55.540]   C. de Vorex says I'm using a Mac and surprise I like it but John you wrote a book about
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.100]   the Mac I know you've had him you've been a Mac user for I've been in it out of using
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.060]   the Mac is that it's only the Mac community of things I'm a Mac basher yeah hey by the
[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.060]   way hey by the way I think you know it just proves there's a bunch of psychos over there
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.940]   which is kind of this good disconcerting to be honest about it don't believe me Windows
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:14.240]   fanboys can be just as mean nasty and psychotic I've never run into that just aren't as many
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:20.420]   of them and they're not as loud and they're not as proud yeah maybe that's it oh yeah
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:29.220]   I don't just fanboy and I don't just like the thing I mean I never I never thought I would
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:33.140]   is very snappy that's one thing I like it does take a little longer to boot I like the
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.380]   fact that the Mac boots and pretends it's booted and is not well Windows does that Windows
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:41.980]   invented that no Windows doesn't do anything not come on no Windows invented that comes
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:46.420]   right up I mean with Windows you got that stupid logo with that little things no but Microsoft
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:54.500]   Microsoft you'll get your desktop there and then and click on something nothing happens
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.220]   because there's still 18 different things that have to start up that's that's that's
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:01.860]   that's but anyway it's all operating systems do that this is Sisadman day by the way so
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:07.260]   kiss a Sisadman today actually was the last Friday of July so this is airing a couple
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:13.220]   of days later eighth annual system administrator appreciation day and actually I got a intel
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:19.020]   sent me a star by five dollar Starbucks card actually I think you're a system well I'll
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:26.460]   be honest they sent it to Patrick Norton care of me what does that tell us I'm confused
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:32.900]   they guess apparently they think Patrick is a Sisadman and that he has my address so I
[00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:37.780]   don't know what the heck but I guess apparently Intel sent out I don't know how many but quite
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:42.420]   a few I think that's a nice thing to do five dollars it's not you know that's one quinty
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:51.780]   vent a latte but Steve Gibson beverage yep other big stories today gosh there's so many
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.740]   I don't know exactly where to start we could talk with we can do a reprise of this Google
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:03.020]   story that we did last week you weren't here for this Molly nor Steve nor Robert but John
[00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:08.100]   and I were talked a little bit about Google's announcement that they would buy into the 700
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:14.580]   megahertz spectrum auction if they had some conditions if we're an open auction if anybody
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:19.740]   could buy into it there if ISPs could buy in wholesale a number of stipulations that
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:24.180]   the FCC is highly unlikely to agree to I want to correct myself by the way I apparently
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:29.900]   at one point confused the 700 megahertz spectrum which is a UHF spectrum with the VHF spectrum
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:34.780]   I know they're different so this is the VHF spectrum I'm sorry see I did it again this
[00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:41.260]   is the UHF and so what's the presumption that Google wants the spectrum for well that's what
[00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.620]   we were talking about last week and that's the fun part my hope is that they want us kind
[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.500]   of getting a competition against the wireless companies and do their own wireless thing
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.420]   correct me if I'm wrong but it seemed that it was kind of an altruistic move on their
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:57.420]   part where they were they were basically gonna buy it and and free it up true for open use
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:04.380]   rather than you know exactly what's kind of unlikely to me that it would be a truly altruistic
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:08.740]   move though I mean wait they've you know there has to be money made but there's got to be
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.220]   money made they've got the dark fiber it seems to be that done talking amongst yourselves
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:19.100]   I'll tell you what's going on now wait a minute okay let's discuss it that John can tell us
[00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:23.900]   the truth Verizon doesn't like this idea they said the spectrum is not as valuable if it's
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:28.620]   open so I mean on the face of it it sounds altruistic you think that Google has a secret
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:33.980]   plan not you know I know you know I'm asking Molly then you could talk to them right I'm
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:40.460]   gonna save save the truth for later well I don't know that it's necessarily super secret
[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:44.940]   I mean Google also has a bunch of dark fiber it wouldn't I think they are probably trying
[00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:50.500]   to create a more competitive landscape but I think they're probably doing that by you
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:55.180]   know make creating their own network running their own devices on it who knows under I'd
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:01.620]   love to see them undermine Verizon and then AT&T Verizon that doesn't want any open access
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:08.540]   but but interestingly seeing that the commissioner Kevin Martin and most of the commissioners are
[00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:14.260]   in support of some form of open access both AT&T and Verizon have said oh okay I think the
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:19.980]   Google thing scared them we'll live with the with the official FCC version I'm not sure
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:25.660]   exactly how what the FCC wants is different from what I think Google's is just more extensive
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:32.220]   yeah Kevin Martin said he only wants to open up about a third of the spectrum I see and
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:38.900]   he said that he opposes the idea of it being sold wholesale licensing yeah yeah he said
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.900]   that's what Google wants wholesale prices allowing ISPs to interconnect freely to the
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:47.380]   network at any technically feasible point which admittedly sounds a little bit like a Jerry
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:52.620]   Rig kind of solution in any event I hope Google look it doesn't look like Google's gonna get
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:57.220]   what they want but I hope Google can live with these not exactly the same rules but at least
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:01.660]   some openness it looks like the FCC will at least require some openness on this which is
[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:08.420]   good it sounds like a good compromise all right now John C. de Vorek what's really going on
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:12.300]   well if you read today's news and by the way I have a column on this exact same subject
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:16.300]   running in market watch which runs today it's probably up now oh look at it oh I'm sorry
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:20.300]   we're actually this comes out on Sunday so we'll be up by now yeah so cut that out anyway
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:27.340]   so there's market watch column from last week I'm thinking about moving our tape data Sunday
[00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:32.300]   by the way if it because this happens all the time where John's plugs I don't think anybody
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:38.300]   cares okay but any but the way you know there there's a story in today's financial news that
[00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:43.500]   apparently Google and Sprint are now doing some sort of a secret deal this is a separate thing
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.580]   yeah they're gonna do a wine separate thing is a separate thing is a wine but is it really
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:52.860]   a separate thing because if anybody remembers back in the late 1990s Sprint had a thing called
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:57.980]   Sprint Broadband Connect which is what I use right it's a point the point ISP that they
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:04.700]   decided to kill it was microwaves it was a microwave and I have I still have the gear and they
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:14.300]   work kind of you know it was about 750 mega it was 750 K right bits per second it's best I could get
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:19.100]   MMDS I think was what they called it micro yeah maybe distribution anyway the point is is that it
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:27.260]   seems to me that ever since the early of last year 2006 when that kind of bonehead CEO of AT&T
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:32.540]   mouthed off about Google getting a free ride and we can you know we should probably charge
[00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:36.940]   them more money because they're making money off of our network as well you invented the internet
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:41.500]   I think that freaked Google out and I think from that point on Google was looking for a defensive
[00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:46.540]   series of moves that they could make that would protect them from ever really getting
[00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:51.660]   screwed by AT&T because of AT&T wanted to we all know they could have set up like a search engine
[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:58.300]   system of some sort and and kind of put the put a put a break on Google search I agree with you I
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:02.860]   think this is Google's response to net net neutrality now here's what the long-term thing they want
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:07.900]   to be their own backbone yeah so Google decides to do this now they bring out an aggressive price
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.940]   because they can supplement things all kinds of different ways and are making things they could
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:15.580]   give it away for crying out loud they give everything away they could if they wanted to now so let's
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:19.660]   say that Google and Sprint already knows how to do this kind of thing so Sprint is their partner now
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:24.220]   so it's a Google Sprint network or a Sprint Google network whatever we're gonna be a
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:28.300]   spherical panza which a dog is on top spruggle I want so now instead of instead of turning instead
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:34.140]   of having AT&T put the screws to Google Google can output the screws to AT&T saying look I think
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:39.420]   we're going to take our search off your system altogether right and what we're going to do is
[00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:44.060]   that Comcast is going to have Google search and then Sprint Google is going to have Google search
[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:48.780]   but you're not going to have it unless you pay us which is the kind of way that it works in the
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:53.340]   kind of the cable TV business where one guy takes over and the other guy you know says well you
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:58.140]   have to pay to be on our network no no you have to pay to take us kind of thing it goes back and
[00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:05.340]   forth so Google can really really put you know unless between now and 2009 some other search engine
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:09.820]   comes up that's worth a crap Google could like really put the screws of these guys and make them
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:17.020]   pay to put Google on their thing anyway and then on top of that I think in order to not restrict
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:22.220]   their delivery at all they would I think that they essentially want to be their own backbone to set
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:27.580]   up their own network whether it be the dark fire network spectrum yes that they're
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:33.180]   they guarantee delivery no matter what well but the key is that they would have a big network
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:38.300]   themselves that they could fall back on and but why do they need Sprint well the interesting thing
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:45.260]   about the Sprint deal is not just the Y Max thing actually it's that it is uh it's Sprint being
[00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:51.100]   open to third-party applications like Verizon and AT&T have refused to be so Sprint is basically
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:55.500]   saying kind of for the first time that Sprint customers will be able to use Google apps like
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.940]   Google Talk they've even kind of hinted around like maybe they would let people use Skype on
[00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:04.620]   Sprint phones so it is kind of Sprint getting on seeing which way the wind is blowing in terms of
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:11.340]   them not being able to have the same sort of exclusive and Sprint has been an ISP Sprint knows
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:16.540]   how to do this what you know instead of starting from scratch well AT&T has been an ISP for
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:20.460]   Verizon as an ISP not by saying but Sprint has been one if you're going to partner with some
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:25.020]   you're not going to partner with these guys are trying to screw you like AT&T so you partner with
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:29.980]   Sprint one of the enemies of AT&T and you can go from there and the fact of the matter is a clever
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:34.140]   move by the print it's a clever way to say hmm when we see the business changing maybe we
[00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:39.260]   should quickly shift alliances and you know there's a merger in the in the works if you think about
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:43.340]   it too I mean there's no reason that those two companies can't join hands although I can't see
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:50.220]   Google yeah does Google need Sprint you know what does that mean I guess what Google buys the 700
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:55.340]   megahertz spectrum do they start making devices like do they start making phones or web devices
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:19:00.860]   of some sort I mean it's crazy but yeah let's Sprint do it I yeah they can collaborate on hardware
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:06.780]   like Google branded hardware or Google something's up something's up I'm I'm I might be a descending
[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:12.860]   opinion and just think that this Sprint Google thing is a side show and uh and a lot you know just
[00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:18.060]   some sort of you know alliance that isn't really relevant to the long term everything's relevant
[00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:24.140]   Leo everything's relevant Google has a master plan well we know that much well I'll tell you if you
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:28.700]   wanted to what sounds like somebody's opening the master plan box to look what's that mean like
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:34.140]   can I add one more thing here yes you know as and I do all this kind of these these analyses of
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:39.340]   Google and some of the things they do and the curious thing about it is those guys never invite
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:45.980]   me to any one of their events you say this every darn show that unbelievable maybe they don't
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:51.980]   like you I don't know ludicrous here's an enjoy attack for crying out wouldn't yes now maybe they
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:58.060]   will now that you're in a comic no they won't never happen they'll never invite me I want to
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:02.860]   write those segues from one building to another yeah I didn't even know they had things that's how
[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:06.540]   I'm gonna buy things they have you're uninvited there's a lot of people that don't get invited
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:10.140]   they stiff you know they have a big Christmas party and they invite most of the media but they
[00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:15.420]   don't invite certain people that they hate really you know why they hate us too because that news
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:21.340]   dot com story about Eric Schmidt yeah you're you're seeing it you're dead mate your history man
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:26.860]   seen it no cnet reporter will have a darkened google's door and I used to work for cnet so as
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:30.700]   possible that's why I'm on that list they think no you know what it is they think that zdnet is
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:35.100]   seen it and so they're just confused they should just google it
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:42.860]   uh let's move on I think this is that's a fact I think that's probably the most interesting
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:47.420]   story of the year probably and I'm very curious to see what happens as it develops but here's
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:53.500]   another story Nevada's governor accidentally posts the password to his outlook email on his
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:21:02.060]   website ah by the way his uh his username is governor his password by the way this is a
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:08.140]   kenny seagway with the you or no just spelled normally g o v e r n o r and kenny seagway in
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:15.260]   the republican the governor of uh Nevada is password kenny se well no see that's the funny thing
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:19.820]   kenny seagway is the former wait a minute that's the former governor the current governor is
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:24.540]   Jim Gibbons it's Jim a Gibbons and they couldn't even be bothered to change the password so is the
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:29.580]   old yeah poor Jim he's pat this shows you that Jim never uses outlook because he wouldn't be
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:35.580]   typing kenny seagway he logs in you would think not he wouldn't really want to although he is also
[00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:42.220]   republican or the field was just saved as pardon me i you just saved it yeah that's right it's
[00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:45.980]   just saved and it didn't you know he just takes return it's just a bunch of stars to him he doesn't
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:52.140]   know it's kenny seagway doesn't do any typing they put they posted this file on uh a microsoft
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:56.780]   word file giving step-by-step instructions on how the how the aides should send out the governor's
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:06.860]   weekly email updates on their website this is so sad oh and out uh oh people that govern us
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:12.940]   well they need these the people who are now calling for a universal internet filtering yeah oh that's
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:18.860]   right congress now now who this was at the end of the day somebody just stepped up or was it a big
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:25.340]   group of congress people's it was at the end of a it was at the end of a session of a hearing a
[00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:29.500]   set of hearings that they had on the whole problem and of course it was our wonderful
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:35.980]   Ted what's his name from Alaska Ted Stevens the best of the reasons for us from that man not a truck
[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:41.340]   it's not a truck we ought to filter it just like a sewage plant filtering
[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:48.540]   the sewage it's so it's so funny too because they're they're talking about the problem of child porn
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:54.620]   which is obviously um you know photos of children being posted on the internet and then they're
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:23:01.020]   talking about protecting the children from internet predators which to my mind are two
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:06.460]   entirely different no it's all the shame it's you mixing they're mixing them all together and
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:11.740]   it's like well I mean we know how well internet filtering works I mean it you just you can't do it
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:18.060]   commerce committee chairman daniel k anyway of hawaii democrat Ted Stevens the uh senate commerce
[00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:25.260]   science and transportation vice chairman republic in alaska argued the internet is a dangerous place
[00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:31.020]   where parents alone will not be able to protect their children so the government's gonna do it
[00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:36.860]   going to come out of the screen it's gonna come and get you thank you like horror movie what's
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:42.540]   terrifying is this about this is the idea of congress trying to literally take the protection
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:47.980]   of children out of the hands of parents right like just send them all to a little government run
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:51.980]   camp I guess where they'll be protected the good news is we can completely ignore this it's
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:57.820]   unconstitutional never happen they can't even they can't even get a you know kopa through the
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:02.060]   supreme court I don't think that there's any chance this is just grand somebody salami
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.220]   kahya kopakopakota
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:09.900]   that's what i thought dude get get go to visit mmm i am starving hey robert heron must be following
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:16.540]   this with interest this hd dvd versus blue ray another blow against hd dvd target says it won't
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:22.620]   carry anything but the blue ray players and apparently that's just completely false
[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:29.340]   and that story is completely false i was about to say that really i mean it jumped out i mean
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:34.380]   immediately uh the hd dvd group came back and said that it's simply a case of the blue
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:39.100]   blue ray camp buying an end cap within all target stores throughout the holidays all right so
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:44.380]   this is getting this is a vicious battle admit though that target only sells the hd d they tell
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:49.740]   it toshiba player but only on target dot com i mean i was in a tour story about a week ago and
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:54.460]   they had both formats available and lockbuster only sells the only rents blue blue ray though right
[00:24:54.460 --> 00:25:00.300]   unless you go online and then you get either one okay and i think that sells both and i have to say
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:07.500]   that unfortunately the toshiba hd dvd player which i own is just a piece of junk i mean you have i've
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:29.240]   got the latest the second the j
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:36.120]   thing it's like all of the the way a consumer would hope their appliance works is just gone you
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:41.640]   press the door open button and literally a minute can go by oh give you must have the first generation
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:47.640]   it's better now isn't it Robert i because the latest gen doesn't run linux and the latest gen
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:53.160]   it's granted boot up times on both set top boxes are pretty slow no doubt however once it's fired up
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:58.280]   you know what the funny thing is the fastest blue ray and hd dvd players are the game cons
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.680]   right because they're power open about 15 seconds and disk access times or zippy because they're powerful
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:07.880]   computers i'm a target dot com and they list the toshiba player as available online but not in stores
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:14.360]   and then what to what the hd dvd guy said is that they sell the xbox hd dvd player all right i'm not
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:19.000]   sure about what's the top box they sell but as far as the discs for movies they still have both
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.160]   so i think they still have both but they only sell the one player and it's the xbox one so it is sort of
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:28.840]   i mean obviously the hd dvd camp was going to have to say no it's not that bad but sort of bad but
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:33.960]   hd dvd also said that they have similar deals in place with uh like circus city and other why would
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:40.040]   target do that i'm sure they were paid then i think they probably just want to start selling
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:45.000]   stuff like they want to get into the game and pick a side i would think so i think it's just very
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.640]   odd right they were paid off paid off something and it's a different too i probably sits them apart
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:54.520]   a little bit from the walmart who went with the hd dvd camp for the low prices for the set top
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:59.320]   players in addition to the players it's just a vicious battle to well and unfortunately it is the
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:05.160]   case that it seemed if you believe the reports blue raised numbers are substantially higher than
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:11.560]   hd dvd disc disc yeah however you want to spin that if you look at just set top box players
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:16.280]   according to even seen its own article that's online right now 1.5 million to only a third
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:22.360]   no but it's 50 percent more hd dvd set top players than blue ray players so if you ignore the game
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:29.480]   if you take fps theory yeah so yeah it's only a third of the 100,000 and i just don't care about
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:34.520]   either form i use them both i love them both i have both players it's just enjoy there's no
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:39.320]   difference ladies and gentlemen patrick norton is now in the house swelling this panel to a
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:45.400]   vast six people hello patrick hey what's the frightening number of twitter we've never had so
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:51.800]   many twists in the same room actually we have at the legendary live apple show yeah which
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:59.080]   shall live forever infamy infamy yeah you're right we've had we had was a too big a panel
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:03.560]   this is too big a panel but everybody's gonna get a turn to talk here were you on that one molly
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:08.520]   i think so i was on an apple and i got to sit next to steve las nieck it was very exciting
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:14.520]   oh that was fun that was at the apple store yeah by the way i i i made a mistake i said molly was
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:18.920]   alone and the only windows user no it's not true in fact according to steve balmer there will be a
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:27.320]   billion machines running windows by the end of the year one billion machines wow does that include
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:32.760]   like os seven and the apple food i'm sure i'm sure it includes everything they can count
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:38.200]   when billion machines does something happen when that when that magic number you know it is a
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.440]   critical mass is a world blow up i think balmer buys a big white fluffy cat
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:47.880]   balmer i just you know balmer makes such good copy what was the latest thing he said we are not
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:55.640]   going to be defeated in online ads we will be victorious it's so bizarre in online
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:29:01.720]   line ads well is that a failure in advertising since they began with all those online magazines
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:08.600]   and then microsoft sidewalk and one thing after another so now they're because google is doing
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:13.000]   it we have to do it well more than that i think this this is part of it all in fact it even said
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.920]   they even said this at the analyst day that this is part of their transformation
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:21.720]   into a software plus services company they will they really they are looking at what google's
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:26.600]   doing and they say we want to be there well they sure are serving os patches quickly
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:32.600]   oh and what what friend of the show dumped google ads in favor of microsoft as mr dig
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:36.440]   mr dig big that's a big acquisition i guess for microsoft
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:40.520]   they didn't drop google as they dropped federated media well google is asleep
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:46.600]   and drop google google also and uh and this now it's facebook and dig are both using microsoft
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:51.640]   sad platform now you got to figure microsoft well that's the thing you got to figure microsoft
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:57.320]   said we'll give you 100% of old revenue for the next yummy yummy profit yeah or something the
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:01.240]   problem google's always had with its ads is they won't disclose what percentage of the money they're
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:07.000]   getting they're giving to the advertise the not much and i have a feeling it probably isn't a very
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.720]   big percentage that's why they don't disclose it microsoft might be more transparent about that
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:16.920]   or maybe maybe they just say not we'll give you more money
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:24.040]   doesn't really matter if they do context sensitive ads do you as a as a website reader care who's
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:30.840]   serving the ad i've always been yeah how would i ever know yeah ads say again patrick i've always
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:35.640]   found the superior targeting of google ads more relevant to me if the website can suit google ads
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:39.560]   are terribly targeted actually not the only one that just strips every ad out of every web page
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:45.240]   i visit what do you use adblock for firefox or yeah i think i've run into one too many times
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:49.240]   where there's an ad server that's bogging down the rendering of a page that just drives me nuts when
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:54.360]   i'm in a hurry so yeah there was a story in the um somewhat alarmistory in the wall street
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:31:00.920]   journal the other day about viruses now and in web ads very alarming web ads and being you know
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:05.480]   launched on your system without you taking any action that's got to strike a little bit of fear
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:09.960]   steven i talked about that on security now this week it's happened both to tom's hardware and to
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:15.480]   uh my space my space it when it happened to my space uh they estimated a million people got
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:21.160]   infections from just not works and aren't these sites also with the little lock our website is
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:26.280]   protected and checked and verified it's nothing oh yeah that works i want to know how it works
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.760]   steve steve steve steve steve steve steve steve lodro yes steve steve steve steve
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:31.240]   steve steve steve steve steve steve steve steve steve steve steve steve steve steve
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:36.120]   explain how do you know how these ads can infect you well leo and i were talking on security now that
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:41.720]   i mean even a responsible site like com's hardware you think okay well you know isn't there something
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:47.640]   that they could do except that the way the way third party ads work is the page that their server
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:56.040]   is serving contains sort of a generic u r l to someone else's server to the advertising content
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:02.040]   provider server so what happens is the page goes to the user's browser the browser parses wait wait
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:07.240]   wait wait steve can you start over let's see i'm i'm on tom's hardware now where does this begin do i
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.840]   like that there's a little ad that's being served that banner ad that graphic that jumping
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:16.600]   long is it is a flash ad or a regular ad any kind of ad um it it certainly has to involve
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:23.720]   and and exploit an unpatched or unknown exploit in the o s for example there have been some for just
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:29.800]   jpeg files we're just displaying a jpeg on your mind the way i just say well i just want to get this
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:35.880]   this the architecture this correct i got let's say my page devork.org/blog okay now let's say i've
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:40.520]   got a little ad on the left hand side of somebody bought is that thing itself just when someone's
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:46.680]   looking at my blog page serving evil things into a reader it could right some have to click on it
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:53.960]   no no no the the idea is just the process of rendering the image if the image rendering code
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:33:00.280]   has any flaws and and those are discovered just the process of displaying the image on your web
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:06.200]   browser will allow um malicious code to run in your machine so this is what happened on my space
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:11.000]   and on tom's you just go to my space that ad banner that's there could carry an infection
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.520]   and in fact here's here's google thinking that they've got this sort of foolproof
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:20.200]   model like we'll get into every you know microsoft busy patching their operating system all the time
[00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:24.040]   we'll just do this advertising thing we have to worry about viruses and all that all of a sudden
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:28.280]   they have a huge security issue on their hands now if they serve text ads it's not a problem and
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:33.320]   then let me ask one more question here to steve yep what if you're using a mac
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:42.040]   nope you're safe you're safe if you're using a mac or windows 98 or linux or linux no it's
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:47.080]   targeted at windows machines well when i was hearing when i was hearing leo talk about the billion
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:52.440]   windows machines i couldn't help thinking yes a billion infectable platforms who
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:34:01.160]   the hackers are going yeah baby one billion machines but yes john you're probably a lot safer over on
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:06.280]   a mac because it's cur it's still currently not nearly a target as the the of the likes of windows
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:11.960]   well what is the well we saw if tom's hardware and then what was it my space or yeah second life or
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:18.280]   whatever my space uh yes i guess this is something to be concerned about yeah uh y'all yeah well
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:25.160]   and and my point was that those sites are really they're not able to do anything to prevent this
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:31.640]   unless they were to fetch the ads run it through some av assuming that the av knew about this
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:37.560]   particular exploit and then they serve it themselves to the to the users browser but of course that's
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:41.800]   not the traditional third party model right well let me ask one more question then
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:47.880]   let's say you're selling ads on your website the tom's hardware let's say and within the contract
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:51.880]   it makes very stipulate stipulates very strongly that if anything like if you're doing anything
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:58.360]   like this as an advertiser you're liable for you know some sort of damages ah the d and we leon i
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:04.760]   also talked about that the problem is that the advertisers themselves are are allowing images
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:11.560]   to be uploaded from clients so all the advertiser the of course the advertiser doesn't themselves
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:17.560]   create the images they're just a third party aggregator for all the images the ads from their
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:26.680]   clients so you could argue that even the advertiser can't be responsible for the the virility of of
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:31.880]   its own ads because they're just accepting ads from their clients so storing them on their server and
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:36.920]   then redistributing to the web the website and that's exactly what happened is that these systems
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:41.720]   are often automated so the the ad server that was on my space and tom's hardware was automated
[00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:45.400]   somebody just bought an ad they didn't validate the person and put it i think you can have an
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:49.480]   indemnity clause in a contract like that that would cover them i mean it would seem to me that
[00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:54.200]   these guys have to push it one step further push it out farther so you keep this from happening
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:59.000]   it sounds the way you're describing it this is a disaster potentially and it sounds like one to me
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.720]   potentially this is i think this is the first chink that i have heard about in google's armor
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:08.760]   that that seems legitimately dangerous to them from from two perspectives one is the ad serving
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:13.080]   platform perspective because it's terrifying to think that you might be receiving ads that are
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:17.000]   infected but the other is from the search perspective because if we find ourselves in
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.760]   situation where you can only go to a few trusted websites then what do you need search for let me
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:27.400]   understand me underscore that this has not happened to google this isn't a google problem it was
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:33.000]   another ad service that was doing this and google's tech stats are not vulnerable it would only be
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.240]   image-based ads or worse ads that had javascript which many do unfortunately
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:44.360]   yeah that was gripping a lot of advertisers actually flash job is in place so they can actually
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:49.800]   track right right you want job-saving attractive the the true numbers but what would this is there
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:55.320]   any way of doing this with flash not that any not that i know of their i don't know think of any
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:59.880]   flash exploits out there right now we're going to see it you know we're going to see and i have a
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:05.080]   feeling we'll see exploits we're going to see a i think a quick move to flex which is adobe's new
[00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:10.360]   flash like platform that's really a java killer and i think you see flex everywhere on the net
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:15.960]   you're already seeing in a lot of places what's microsoft's you know want to be silver light oh that's
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:21.080]   right yeah but and this is you know steven i have this battle on security now because steve says turn
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:25.480]   off all scripts no scripting that's a problem inherently and he's right it is inherently a security
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:29.640]   issue but i say but then you're turning off all the function at the reality of the new web i mean
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:36.120]   all of that stuff age x and all require scripting yeah back to carved tablets yeah that's safe
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:41.480]   nobody ever got a virus you can hurt yourself you hit yourself with a hammer this is my new slogan
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:49.000]   no one ever got a virus from papyrus i think this is this is the thing every we should be pushing this
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.320]   i'm not sure that because most papyrus is made from sheepskin and there's an anthrax issue here yeah
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:58.360]   or bovine encephalitis you could get you know hey i love this remember the life lock ad where
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:04.360]   the ceo comes on and says this is my social security number i am protected by life lock hack me
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:12.680]   you got hacked i love it it seemed like it doctor doctor it hurts it when i do this stop doing that
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:16.920]   this is a company that sells identity theft protection that basically
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:21.240]   abundant stuff that you could do for yourself for free but the these ads were very compelling
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.920]   because this the guy comes on and said let me let me tell you i'm protected by life lock in fact i'm
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:30.600]   so confident i'm going to give you my social security number so uh so so this guy somebody took
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:37.560]   out a five hundred dollar loan uh using the guy's social security number wow but worse awesome
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:44.120]   worse the ceo showed up at the fraudsters house with a film crew and coers to confession out of the
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:49.880]   guy the police say the guy's mentally disabled and and that destroys their case because it's an
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:55.000]   illegal confession so now they have no plans to arrest the guy he's off scot-free thanks to life
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   lock free wow he's safe yeah they went through all that trouble for a five hundred dollar ripoff
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:07.160]   well i can buy a blu-ray player now yeah there you go i like to devore i got a bit of a scoop you
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:13.320]   were sitting in a giants game with the ceo of uh seagate bill wackens and yeah we've been talking
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:18.280]   a lot on twitter about the hybrid i know i feel bad about it now this is the idea is it's a hard
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:23.240]   drive that uses both disc and solid state is that the idea well a hybrid hard disk yeah it's got a
[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:27.800]   flash memory right typically right and up to for the desktops it was i was told it's going to be like
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:33.320]   a gigabyte or more or two and then for the laptops it's like two fifty three hundred is this the ready
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:37.400]   the ready drive stuff that's from no it's just kind of like that but this is the real hybrid
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:42.520]   hard disk is all part and so i was told by these guys a couple years ago by the experts including
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:48.600]   seagate people that microsoft vista's like design for these discs it's gonna ready drive it's gonna
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:53.720]   do all this cool stuff and so then i get wackens and he's telling me and you know it's vista's got
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:58.440]   all these issues and actually that the little thing i posted on my blog that little video is only
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:03.080]   part of the whole chat i had with him i'll tell you what else he said anyway he first he says that
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:06.760]   you know that vista's so screwed up that it doesn't work that well with these hybrid hard
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:10.680]   just to begin with even though they're supposed to and so they have to wait for that fix which is
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:15.720]   a year away because sp1 is not coming out this year yeah so they say that that's the only thing
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:22.680]   more annoying than my mac is vista the truth comes out you guys don't like it doesn't work good it's
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:29.720]   ugly it's well it's pretty i know but it's funnier if i say work good like i think different yeah so
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:35.160]   anyway no issues with it but i'm afraid anyway he went on and he said that the you know the the
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:41.640]   the real winner for these hybrid hard disks is going to be people like google and all these other
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:47.560]   google again google wins i know how does google always want to buy more google stocks dane buy
[00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:53.000]   me some more google stock he says that if with these discs to save so much energy because they work
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.040]   on a laptop to save energy right save battery life they save so much energy in a server farm
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:04.440]   that he says you could take and fill the place up with with terabyte hybrid hard disk and throw
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:09.880]   away all the 500 you know megabyte hard disk and all the drives that are in there currently and
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:16.120]   make almost make it up overnight in what you'd save an energy turn off the ac the idea is that the
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:22.680]   the turns out the axis patterns of hard drives is as we know much more reading than writing and
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:29.480]   the distribution is that you have well the distribution is such that you're also reading the same stuff
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:35.080]   much more than you're reading everything so if you have a if you have a sufficiently large cash
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:41.320]   then that is in the drive then you then it's able to hold the stuff most people are wanting to read
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:46.840]   most the time allowing the drive to spin down and if that's non volatile then you're able to also
[00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:54.600]   to accept rights and it's only as that begins to get full that the drive says uh oh i better flush this
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:42:01.560]   now large non volatile memory onto magnetic so that it's it's really secure so the idea is that
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:09.320]   the the duty cycle of the drive spinning is reduced dramatically so the drive is no longer hot because
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:14.840]   it doesn't spin enough it's almost like a giant ram cash then yeah exactly it's sort of spins up
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:19.480]   dumps the cash and then spins down now now we shouldn't confuse this with solid straight drives in fact
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:25.880]   alienware and i don't have patrick have you guys seen or reviewed these as now shipping uh laptops
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:31.480]   gaming laptops well there's there's been there's been uh solid state hard drive shipping and laptops
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:37.640]   mostly from more sort of vertical commercial vendors for like a year it's really expensive still right
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:41.880]   oh it's extremely expensive and yeah you get up with a capacity considerably lower than what you're
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:47.000]   going to get at a rotating so these are the uh these are the area 51 and the aurora uh notebooks
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:53.240]   they'll have this what they call ssd or solid state drive options but they're not huge uh you have
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:43:01.160]   you can get a i think it's a 32 or a 64 gig drive and the 32 gig i'm sorry the 64 gig is in raid 0
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:06.200]   which is kind of interesting it's a little strange would it be faster or just more efficient
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:10.200]   your product is gonna be awesome what say again Robert?
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:15.320]   boot times would just be awesome so these are faster than hard drives uh some of them are not
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:19.560]   faster than the hard drives they should be faster than hard drives but some of them we've seen are
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:26.120]   a little mediocre in the performance okay so yeah the problem is that the the technology of the
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:31.640]   non-volatile memory is still so slow even by comparison to hard drives oh so they aren't faster
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:39.960]   than the the other thing if you do a study and use zero the the amount of time required by the drive
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:48.120]   an OS like windows still spend so much time just organizing itself that even if you remove all of
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:53.240]   the read time you still have a substantial boot time because it turns out the drives are not any
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:58.120]   longer really that much slower than all the nonsense that windows is going through remember
[00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:04.920]   on the screen savers patrick we kept trying to make a uh giant ram hard drive we made it i mean i
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:10.120]   it's the we've we've done it we finally got to work in yeah i mean but i used to use i mean we used to
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:16.040]   use ram drives like you know i remember my duo 280 because i could get a big heap in in uh
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:22.120]   battery life edition by doing a ram drive in my 12 megabytes of ram on the
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:27.000]   since instead of 15 minutes you get 18 minutes of battery time with the email of gigabytes some
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.920]   impossible number of gigabytes of ram at the time for anybody other than a server you know uh farm
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:38.120]   right into four gigs yeah but kah yeah four gigs or more of cash every the entire operating
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:43.560]   system into ram you have this insane performance boost um i'm still old enough that i remember
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:49.880]   when uh going into a uh egghead store and the guy at the counter talking about having eight megabytes
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:56.520]   of ram and he have two megs for the operating system two megs for cash this cash and you never
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:45:02.520]   fill that up two megs for flash a ram drive and i guess two megs for op applications and you'd
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:09.240]   never fill that up eight megabytes so to follow in our continuing saga of all of mp3 it looks like
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:15.720]   it's finally coming to a crashing close the prosecutors in russia are demanding jail time
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:23.960]   or denis kavasov the owner of all of mp3 for massive copyright infringement i wonder what
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:28.200]   happened to do all the royalties that that they've been putting aside for the artists and uh all of
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:35.480]   mp3 no they really nice boat yeah you get a really nice boat uh prosecutor has asked the court
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:40.440]   descendants kavasov to three years in prison and ordered him to pay 15 million the rubles
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:48.040]   to emi warner and universal 15 million rubles is like 12 dollars and 98 cents but it's a lot in russia
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:53.960]   anyway that's the end of all of mp3 that just shows how badly russia wants to join the uh world
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:59.000]   trade organization and one that's not the all of mp3 end of all the mp3 because they basically
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:05.320]   flipped the entire operation to another url and the mp3 sparks is that running mp3 it's still running
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:10.280]   wow apparently yeah it's two reportedly run by the former operators of all of mp3 so so the
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:15.800]   kavasov is gone but uh but they just kept the code and they they continue to take money he's not in
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:22.280]   prison yet leo it is all far from over he's not over yet mousins mousins quil could take over
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:30.280]   because really he could still flee he could flee he could flee with all leo voices mousins quil
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:38.440]   uh let's see at 22 year old intern who uh is being is being held responsible for uh giving up the
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:44.920]   social security numbers of seven percent of the entire state of a uh hio well not giving up losing
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:49.560]   losing in his car he's the scapegoat well he says he's escaped goat because he says
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:57.800]   this is this is a actually a fascinating article at blorg.com tech.blorg.com he says the
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:02.760]   extent of my instructions and what to do after i removed the backup tapes with all of these social
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:07.800]   security numbers on him uh and took the tapes out of the building was bring him back tomorrow
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:15.720]   so uh he left them in the car unencrypted they were stolen uh and then and then this is good
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:21.080]   i'm sure somebody's gonna get in trouble for this the intern says that the $125 an hour consultant
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:26.360]   told him not to tell the police that sensitive information had been stolen
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:31.080]   which is why he was the prime suspect for the theft in the first place
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:36.840]   uh it's just some tapes anything on there it's my berry manlo collection it's okay
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:41.720]   we're the laws making that a crime eight steel berry male types
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:49.960]   no just playing them play that's a crime 800,000 social security numbers left in his car parked
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:54.440]   outside his apartment who would steal i guess they just must be emptying his car i mean i
[00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:58.120]   did they got there typically they they steal your radio or something they thought they were
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:04.040]   cassettes uh believe i don't know i've heard that people i've heard that these increasingly are
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:08.120]   looking for identity information specifically so they look for laptops in the back of cars
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:12.520]   they look for anything that looks like it might be like a computer thing right now in the hopes
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:16.440]   that there will be personal information i still think they thought they were berry manlo tapes
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:20.680]   they didn't know it springs eternal those things look like no they probably thought they were
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:25.720]   videotapes right because they look look like well they look like dv tapes don't they nowadays i
[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:31.640]   guess i'd write hey take back ups though like the dlts one and five online americans view video on
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:36.200]   the internet in any given day thanks to patrick norton and john c de vorack and molly wood
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:42.680]   it's your fault thank goodness thank goodness they're all watching you because we're promoting
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:46.680]   the idea because you do it you remember that thing called cranky geeks that's what they're watching
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:52.440]   dl.tv i wish one and five adults would be watching that show i'd be in an easy street
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:56.920]   cnet tv in a typical day 19 percent of you this is one of another one of those pew
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:02.680]   i love the name pew internet and american life project i think that i think the pew stuff stinks
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:08.680]   it's pew just remember no one ever got a virus from papyrus uh they
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:10.680]   oh that's not true this is the answer actually
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:18.680]   half of half of video viewers 18 to 29 watch clips on youtube 15 percent site my space but
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:25.000]   only 7 percent turn to a cable or network tv site how much of this happens at work that's what i'm
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:30.760]   all of it that's another study we saw that what was it 20 percent of their workday is spent
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:38.120]   uh digging around basically yeah yeah i have no doubt i hate those stories though because
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:42.600]   20 percent of your workday is spent digging around no matter what that's what the water cooler
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:47.560]   is for yeah it doesn't matter if it's fantasy football or i have an anecdote related to this
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:53.000]   so you know uh philip but con remember him oh yeah he's still you know he's a he's done very well you
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.200]   know yeah he's done better out of the computer business than he did and well he had this thing
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:00.040]   to tell he thought of this thing was you know the problem these people have in these offices is that
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:03.800]   yeah people are on the internet a lot and they're doing a lot of their home shopping by going to
[00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:08.680]   amazon but he says normally in an office environment they'd be sneaking off work right and we're
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:13.320]   taking a lot longer to go buy a book at a store than it would to click the one click buying on
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:18.360]   amazon it's actually a more efficient world to have them be doing all this stuff at work otherwise
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:24.760]   they're at benny hana or somewhere long lunch i agree with that 100 percent i'm still you think
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:28.920]   it's still the case that people wait to go to work to use the internet because their connections
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:33.320]   at home are still so it's not not so much anymore i don't think yeah i don't remember that uh the
[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:37.320]   black friday for the internet you know the the biggest shopping day of the year which used to be
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:41.960]   the monday after thanksgiving because everybody would go to back to work and shop and that and
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:46.360]   in the last few years it's been just as the brick and mortar stores it's been the friday after thanks
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:51.960]  giving right they're home they're home shopping i think people just wait to get to work because
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:58.200]   they get up late i just miss those power lunches we used to have a tech tv the four hours of blow
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:04.200]   fish sushi oh oh those are good old days when i'm sorry i never got to code any of those what
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:10.040]   oh you were working on the show see i was in between old lee old the client mums the word
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:17.960]   we once had a make a wish kid uh this is the the the kid i guess he actually was fine he's not
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:23.800]   gonna hand well i know already it's a bad start sake it was already it's a bad start he's like
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:29.320]   ten or eleven so he had been based he had been very seriously ill but i but the good news was he's
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:33.160]   feeling fine but still he had a wish and his wish was to come to the screen savers you don't
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:37.800]   remember this Patrick well that i remember and then they took us all out to blow fish and we had we
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:44.360]   had a huge she bill get the go to blow fish you had to you know that's because you said you could make
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:51.160]   uh you know i don't know what a hard drive uh out of a frisbee and and you had you hadn't finished
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:56.200]   it yet so you had to do that he was still silver coating the frisbee and we all went to blow fish
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:52:02.520]   that's why that's why it's okay he wanted to go to lunch with leo not blow fish was a little
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:07.880]   expensive it was very expensive but it was good it's okay hey john you seem like the type have you
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:13.880]   ever had blow fish real blow fish fugu in japan i did once that's the that's the thing if it's not
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:18.840]   perfectly prepared he'll kill you yeah well they have their license it's really not that
[00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:26.040]   dangerous but it tastes like uh it tastes like uh halibut if you find one of these the chicken
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:31.000]   of sushi bar that has a good halibut and they can slice it just like fugu i i don't think the taste
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.240]   is that much different so there you go fugu makes your mouth a little numb so i think if you have
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:41.000]   some halibut and maybe some novicane there you go you just put the food in i think you'd have the
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.680]   same thing so it's interesting so the mouth numbing is actually the nerve poison but there's just
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:51.960]   not enough to kill you i think it's throughout the meat wow and it's just concentrated in the gall
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:57.000]   bladder or some little thing and if that's that that's concentrated if you have that you'll drop
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:01.640]   dead you know there's a bird that lives in caves that makes its nest entirely out of saliva
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:06.520]   yeah then they make it that's where birch nest soup comes from that's right somebody's been
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:13.160]   watching planet earth yes by the way that is a tasty soup oh i'm not ever eating it after seeing
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:18.360]   that bird make the nest out of saliva unbelievable was that is that a great is that the best dv
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:25.000]   hd or blue red dvd ever made i have a ball you that is i really agree i completely agree so much
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.960]   fun to watch just spectacular that little worm that spits out the string and then the fly flies into
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:35.640]   it my only complaint is the a little doesn't include any of the uh how they made it oh really
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:39.960]   that's on the blu ray it's on the right now it's on the regular dvd it's not on the there's no
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:45.560]   room we already have you know that's too bad because that well and it's it's also great family viewing
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:49.720]   i mean something do you think you can really get the kids around with i mean because they're i mean
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:54.440]   they'll be as fixated with it as adults although henry will no longer eat bird's nest soups what
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:59.640]   you guys talking about planet earth planet earth series oh yeah i watch it all the time
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:06.440]   yeah bc he's busy working on his level 60 we've done that priest he doesn't have time for planet
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:12.040]   earth did you see this the senator in gwam yeah senator i i think i stole this from you actually
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:20.040]   from buzz out loud senator ray tenorio is a level 70 uh dwarf priest in world of warcraft
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:25.560]   loser there's not a lot to do it gwam yeah not a lot of legislating that happens in gwam he looks
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:33.000]   like a nice guy he says he says yeah you never know where you're gonna find him he says he says what
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.880]   i like about world of warcraft it's a great way to be able to reach out and connect with other people
[00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:44.680]   you know how many months of time it took to do that level 70 oh that's like too much time on the line
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:49.160]   can't you pay somebody to get to be a level 70 for you they'll do it a day for you that's what i'm
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:52.920]   gonna do because i want a flying mount but i don't want to do any work i think can't you get a flying
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:57.640]   mount after at level 40 i believe you can oh no you should ask a little bit of a
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:03.160]   flying mount you're like you're like mocking the entire world of warcraft community yet you want
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:09.480]   to be able to impress them with your flying mount you gotta get the epic flying mount epic
[00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:13.800]   flying mount my brother is my brother is super into wow and so i was like well so what if i paid
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:16.840]   someone to get me a flying mount and then i just showed up and i had my flying mount and i was
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:21.240]   level 70 but then i couldn't play it all with that matter see that's what i worry about that's
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:25.320]   what i worry about it and what if i was like it doesn't matter because i'm a girl say i'm a girl
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:32.840]   i fight like a girl so i'll just stand here and look cool yeah with my mount and all the level 70s
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:37.720]   like have all this armor and stuff i mean they just look so cool oh the the thing everyone likes to do
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:41.320]   is just go in one of the major cities take off all your clothes and run around with nothing on
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:45.720]   that's really what people like doing okay let's stop right here this is this is a part of this is a
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:49.640]   part of the game i've never actually experienced this is kind of something we shouldn't be discussing
[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:59.000]   and Robert you need to talk to this. Hey char i canceled my wow account finally hr did you uh did
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:03.240]   you see that second life was down for two days i imagine the jonesing that was going on that this
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:08.520]   you guys must have experienced this i know i know uh cnet had a rolling blackout right we did have
[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:12.360]   the blackout yeah and game spot was one of the sides that was down because it was it toasted in
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:18.120]   that colo a whole uh what was down craigslist was down a second life was down
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:25.160]   Netflix was that is that why Netflix was down yeah six apart from what i understand six apart was
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:30.200]   down that means colo yeah a lot of people basically the a lot of people actually had to completely
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:36.680]   rebuild the databases or servo um behind the assistant i actually would happen one up had to
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:41.400]   rebuild their uh you're kidding they're basically their database uh my understanding is craigslist had
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:48.200]   to come because he crashed the hard drives or what well a lot of time yeah it's well servers
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:52.520]   aren't supposed to in some cases i don't know how much hardware damage might have been done wow
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:59.160]   but we were actually spent a bunch of time uh garnet lee uh posted dltv this week uh with me
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:04.680]   and he won up uh he's the managing editor for one up and he he talked about exactly they got a
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:09.480]   really detailed letter because one up's hosted a 365 main talking about the sort of chain of events
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:14.120]   that brought power down to uh a couple of the colo you know you put you punch you once you got
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:19.320]   once you guys explained to the people outside of california in the bay or what happened okay so
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:25.400]   365 main is a co-location center that's used by some enormously popular websites and a co-location
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:30.520]   center basically means it's got a whole bunch of power and a whole bunch of locked rooms with
[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:35.160]   and air conditioning and air conditioning with giant connections to the internet and in theory
[00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:43.160]   a battery a generator to back it up yeah it's supposed to be like you know impenetrable impervious to any
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:49.160]   event outside right which is a running joke about you know why would anybody build a you know
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:55.320]   colo center in in san risisco or los angeles or and the reason they do that is because you know
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:59.640]   large corporations they want immediate access they want to be able to send their IT staff out there
[00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:04.120]   you know it's like banks are the ones that have sort of the giant underground bunkers inside
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:08.200]   coda that's why you do a colo because you own the hardware but they provide the facility and you
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:13.960]   want it to be nearby and colo means colocation for anyone who doesn't know that these buzzwords
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:21.240]   it's also a form of rectal cancer so bummer about that let's put the buzz kill on the whole
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:27.880]   so anyway so the power goes out in san francisco because it's so hot is that why the power went out
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:32.840]   there was a what has to happen is there was a basically there was an explosion in one of the
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:37.800]   the underground you know basically i don't know whether it was under account cable centers or
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:44.040]   power switching areas uh uh for uh pg it's a pacific gas electric i can never remember i just
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:49.160]   have a gas collector uh so basically there was an explosion you know underneath the manhole cover
[00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:53.720]   down on mission street uh that must be called the power the manhole cover goes straight up in the
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:59.160]   air nobody really knows that would have been gurl maybe it's on google earth the uh
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:04.920]   stryker street view you know i i think we need to point out that that google's not constantly
[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:09.720]   taking pictures of the entire united they got a picture of you crossing the street patrick we
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:14.360]   know that much that's the funniest thing i ever saw that was the that was the most random thing
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:19.640]   they did they got yeah that's how merit to they got time merit smoking i think i just i think they
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:26.120]   just ran up and down you know second street from so funny world the cnet to the zip building and
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:31.000]   back again anyway i'm sorry i didn't mean that this disraeli do you rail you so the power went up
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:35.560]   and literally the power went on and off south of market six times basically about 50 that would
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:40.200]   nod people and businesses had literally like six like mini power out well that's what would have
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:44.920]   killed the hard drives that's that's that's as bad as bad as you can get on a hard drive really
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:50.840]   bad well but you also they also have power conditioning in between and in theory the grid power the
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:54.600]   it's not a theory the grid power actually never touches the computers inside of the colo but we
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:58.920]   know that's not true because no actually we do know that's true because they have a ups system in
[00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:02.840]   between they have one of those inertial flywheel systems okay but what happens a couple things
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:07.000]   happen like the inertial flywheel system starts to slow down and if basically if the power stops
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.040]   running it's like power goes into a motor for the inertial flywheel system that powers up uh
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:16.200]   either a generator that feeds a battery not a battery but a capacitor and that's what keeps
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:20.840]   basically the current inside the building never touches its consistent right okay right so if
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:26.680]   there's a if power stops flowing to the the flywheel ups is for 15 or 30 seconds it kicks on the diesel
[01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:32.760]   generators right so they have two backup diesel generators like eight main diesel generators and
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:38.520]   they had like i think three or four generators fail oh like the two primary generators went they
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:43.640]   went to the backup generator the first back generator didn't go you got to check the gas levels guys
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:48.520]   fill it up all the way well you laugh right but there's there you know there's lawsuits flying
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:53.720]   right now because there should be yeah contract everybody you know every major company that
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:59.240]   that does it'll work at a co-location center or any kind of ISP or you know anybody's paying for
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:03.400]   connection to the internet they're very specific standards of performance and you know one of those
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:09.080]   at a is a colos center is that the power doesn't go out right that's kind of fundamental well and
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:15.560]   a lot of colos a lot of colos have a 99.9 percent uptime agreement like a service level agreement
[01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:21.960]   exactly as far as i understand 3365 main had because they're crazy a 100 percent SLA
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:26.920]   yes not their service level agreement specified 100 percent uptime and they'd even send out the
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:31.960]   speak press release that said that red envelope had been up for two solid years without an interruption
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:37.320]   and you know what there are no icebergs in the north Atlantic either exactly they better get
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:41.640]   a little fly they should be sunk they have to get a bigger flywheel
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:48.680]   or more squirrels well it's kind of added to Netflix woes i mean Netflix announced that they had their
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:56.520]   first losses in their history stock tumbles and then the same exact time power goes out for 24 hours
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:01.960]   not good and nobody could get on i love Netflix and you know i was watching uh
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:08.520]   twitter and uh jiku and uh pounce and people were saying i'm jonesing and it wasn't for second life
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:15.320]   it was for Netflix yeah is Netflix in trouble is that a big deal that they are they got their first
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:20.760]   losses in history if you're working on a flick stock it is yeah it's bad for the stock but
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:26.920]   the stock but you know what i heard today just today uh a buzz out loud reader or listener emailed
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:31.320]   us and said that he got a letter from blockbuster saying that their online rental prices are going
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.920]   up which i think is kind of because one of the things that hurt Netflix so much is that all
[01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:40.040]   there was all this insane competition from flocked buster and they were cutting the prices to
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:44.440]   practically zero and having the in-store returns and stuff and so some analysts speculated the
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:49.480]   Netflix could just wait it out and wait for blockbuster to raise prices and they did and now they are
[01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:53.800]   so of course Netflix lowered its prices which is probably part of the reason they had lower
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:59.480]   revenues yeah you know when i i saw the blockbuster ad on the super bowl and so i signed up
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:03.400]   because i'm a Netflix customer and i thought well i'm gonna compare the two and the the
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:07.400]   selling point on blockbuster is you can take that envelope in and get another movie so you could
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:10.520]   really kind of you know you're willing to go to the blockbuster store you could kind of always
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:15.880]   be in movies but i never did that because i don't want to go to the store and uh it took a lot longer
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:20.840]   for the blockbuster movie turnaround you know my Netflix turnaround is a day same here
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:24.840]   well we're in we have a San Francisco distribution center but frankly most of the country is near
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:28.600]   a distribution center there aren't that many places where you can't get it in a in a day or two
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:33.080]   and blockbuster just couldn't compete and frankly after well plus their interface on their website
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:37.880]   i mean Netflix's Q system and everything is so much better i like the friend system
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:42.840]   friends is great friend's system so that's a good compare how does that work robber you you
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:48.680]   you sign in you you can send your friends or anyone you want a little email link with a custom little
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:52.120]   link and when they click on that that adds them as a friend of yours and they're of course
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:56.360]   Netflix subscribers and then after you go through and rate a bunch of movies and your friends have
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:01.000]   rated a bunch of movies it doesn't comparison to see what percentage you are similar or not
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   or that's mean to each other and it's and then it gives you trivia based on your friends
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.480]   likes and dislikes it says of these four movies your friends said this one was a two star movie
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:13.720]   and the others were four better and it's it's kind of fun i play with that on Facebook because they
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:18.440]   have some they have a kind of a Netflix app on Facebook that does some of that stuff too and it's
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:24.280]   hard hey hey how many movies do you guys watch anyway oh i never watch the movie sound like a
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:29.400]   bunch of movie junk we just ran them and return them oh okay or they sit at my house for a really
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:34.920]   long time i go this is me like Netflix any less i go through spades like i won't watch anything
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:40.360]   for a month and then i'll watch ten movies in a month has is any are any of you uh one of those
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:44.760]   heavy users and Netflix slows down have any of you been braced by Netflix you know what they'd
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:49.640]   break or break by the net you have Patrick so you know people who have been you could tell
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:53.960]   that they're not they're not responding to you as quickly as they used to or at least it certainly
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:59.400]   feels that way to them that's kind of why i go to a local video store i have the least expensive
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:03.320]   plan that netflix offers so it's there's no way i could ever fall into that trap right i have the
[01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:08.760]   most expensive plan that's like but you're already in it right yeah well it's like i'm limited to the
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:13.800]   number it's not an unlimited plan and that keeps me in line i really don't need more than two movies
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:21.320]   a month really no a month or at a time a month oh well it's for some of you like movies and i watch
[01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:26.120]   more than that four or five bucks well i've also got a bunch of hd titles and stuff too so i'm
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:29.960]   constantly looking at something but speaking of facebook they've been in the news of course
[01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:36.680]   mark uh zuckerberg who uh started facebook as a uh harvard sophomore is being sued
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:44.200]   by a company called connect you which says we we were in the dorm room with mark and we and we
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:49.880]   talked about the same idea and uh we hired him and we and he did some stuff for us and then he started
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:57.240]   facebook and like uh killed us uh the founders of connect you uh twin brothers Cameron and tyle
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:07.880]   vinkle vos and it's not making us up and divianarendra uh sued the judge says guys you know it's if you
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:13.480]   had a contract written or oral okay but just like you kind of talked that's not gonna do a dorm room
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:21.000]   talk is not enough although if i i imagine that connect you's probably figuring at some point
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:28.040]   mark will pay him just to go away and mark has so much money no you have things uh i don't know
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:31.400]   you have to start paying everybody for some reason the judge didn't throw out what i can
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:35.800]   understand is why the judge didn't throw out the case because it was i think it was dismissed once
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:41.000]   and then refiled and then in this this last hearing the judge said your your case is ludicrous it's
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.080]   gossamer thin you couldn't have less evidence why don't you go get some yeah come back he's
[01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:49.160]   giving him a chance he's saying you you better come up with something here better than what you got
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:54.760]   they have to august eight and i mean i think you're i think you're right i think this is basically
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:07:01.480]   saying it's over i guess so i don't know why i wouldn't just say it's over well i think you know
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:07.880]   probably you know hey john what's that word for when you have like legal things that are supposed
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:14.920]   to happen in a particular order um but i mean it's due process yeah by the way how did your day
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:20.440]   and court go john yeah i was fighting a traffic ticket or no just speeding ticket actually did you
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:25.400]   win oh no you had my my ladda lawyer by the way if you're going to go to court for any of these
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:30.280]   things because you want to just say say just get a lawyer it's weird because they fast track you
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:34.200]   oh they there's like 50 people in there and you know they all listed but with the guys with the
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:37.960]   lawyers there's only like three or four yeah because they don't want to hear the blowhards doing
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:41.880]   their own well no it's because they actually have to also show up they show it that this the word
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:46.120]   part was i haven't been had a ticket for so long i didn't know any half of this stuff but the weird
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:50.360]   thing is is that first week before you can go up there and say you make your case they make you
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:56.200]   watch this long movie about you know your rights and all this other crap and it's like it really
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:08:01.960]   is an american but anyway with the lawyer doesn't need this because obviously the lawyer you know
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:07.240]   is representing you and they know by the fact that they have a you pass the bar so they rush all the
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:11.880]   people with lawyers in and out so you're you get there early and you're leaving and then these
[01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:16.840]   poor saps that are stuck there they'll be there like for four five six hours sometimes into the
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:21.880]   afternoon did the ticketing officer show up uh in your case so i got up at nine you got in there
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:27.240]   at nine i got out at nine fifteen um i got you know i find in nine so then they say you want you
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:30.280]   know i you take you get traffic court because you want to do that because you don't want
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:34.440]   insurance is going to go flying high right so they say to me would you like online
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:39.640]   oh yeah online traffic court okay or traffic school oh yeah so i said sure so they give you
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:44.600]   about a sheet of paper and there's like a hundred and fifty choices of these online traffic
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:49.960]   schemes chuckle hut traffic school it's unbelievable oh yeah and so i'm thinking and they all do things
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:53.960]   differently you know some of them make it come in and take a test and some do this and some do that
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:58.280]   but anyway so i think i'm thinking now reviewing them review it it's turned into a state welfare
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:02.920]   system it really has it does right well here wait the why you're talking about that subject just to
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:09.880]   get one last thing before you know we're done here to gripe about so my car is like needs a uh
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:15.480]   a smog certificate because for us you know every two years in california they make you
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:21.320]   smog your car and it's a scam and so i go into this place smog and test uh do a smog in repair
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:24.440]   it's our testing and repair shop it's like there's two of them right down the street from me so i
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:29.320]   go in there and i say i i need the smog certificate you know what's it gonna cost is so let me see
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:33.880]   here's your sheet and so i give him the sheet from the DMV and it says you i have to go to a testing
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:39.240]   only oh yeah because i go to testing and repair oh yeah did the guy says i mean no you can't go here
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:45.080]   this is testing and repair you can't do it you have to go to an eight form twenty seven stroke b
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:50.360]   there's like it says there's two layers of of of small what wait wait wait if he could do
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:55.000]   smog testing and repair why can't he do smog testing without the repair hey john never been
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.240]   screwed over by a mechanic i mean i know you get no spam but have you ever had a mechanic
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:04.520]   tried to do work that was not necessarily but why do they even allow smog testing and repair
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:10.040]   if they're gonna require smog testing and no repair no apparently one year you get smog
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:13.960]   testing and repair or it depends on the car or whether you've failed the test before there's
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:19.160]   these two categories now one smog testing only and the other one smog testing and repair
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:25.480]   there's two separate uh no it does it it actually does make sense and they do smog testing only on
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:31.240]   a lot of older vehicles specifically i believe uh so what they do scam to avoid
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:35.400]   to avoid being mechanics scamming uh to avoid mechanics scamming customers
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:41.160]   well you figure one place that's advertised as a testing no hold on patrick what if i i go i think
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:46.120]   i want the most one of the most honest repair shops right down the street from me and he loves
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:51.480]   them and he knows them i love my norm and they do testing and repair but they can't do testing
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:57.720]   well please don't hold on it's a little strong i'm there's there's there's a couple
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:02.120]   justifications offered for the test only centers is one is i understand the test only centers is the
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:09.000]   question is why they have both i don't know it's forcing us to waste gas driving to other facilities
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:12.600]   i mean i i i know what you're saying patrick and the test only center makes sense and i only go to a
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:17.560]   test only center because then if repairs are needed i know they're not going to you know jack me around
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:22.680]   but why do they then allow testing and repair
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:27.560]   it doesn't make any sense at all all right my i'm just gonna interject here to say that my
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:32.120]   baby's home so i have to go oh but we had so much more to talk about all right thank you so
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:37.320]   lucky to get rid of the girl if we talked about cars yeah yeah it worked on me you know what
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:43.000]   talking about the bus driver fired for 38 000 text messages deserved it i do like that one you

[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:18.440]   guys next time take care bye bye bye and that makes it a little easier to talk about cars and other
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:25.000]   boy things well um what's this article in slash dot u_s government checking up on vista users vista
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:31.640]   is is is connecting to halliburton now this idea i wanted to run this by you because this
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:38.760]   it i don't know who this guy is that claims this and whether it's credible but it's a little
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:43.160]   i found it all suspicious it seems a little suspicious but i'd love to get maybe steve you
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:48.120]   could look into this for us his claim is that uh vista was slowing down
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:56.280]   and uh as he was using it and um so he decided to i guess put a packet analyzer on it after all
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:01.160]   that file sharing he was doing with it a little slow down yeah something was going on so he puts
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:07.000]   a packet analyzer on it and it's it's uh now by the way the guy's name is paris the pirate i just i
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:14.520]   just want to point this out uh the article is at uh white dust dot net uh but he says his logs say
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:18.440]   that vista was connecting to the department of defense information networking center
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:23.160]   the united nations development program and the halliburton company i don't buy this do you think
[01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:29.480]   this is i think it's completely bogus i mean it just it just can't be the case i mean if this
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:34.920]   were going on on any larger scale we would absolutely already know it and you know there are lots of
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:39.640]   security conscious people running vista who'd be looking at their logs or their firewalls would be
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:44.520]   you know screaming and yeah i think they're just there can't be anything to it everybody should
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:50.520]   uh to put a little packet analyzer on their system and and tell us get back to us who who's
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:59.480]   your vista calling nobody it's unplugged nobody maybe that's why yours works so well Robert
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:04.520]   smooth like a baby politicians did charge on tuesday that peer-to-peer networking poses a
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:10.680]   national security threat oh this pissed me off so bad security threat from profit maybe but
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:15.240]   government reform committee chairman henry waxman democrat of california
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:19.160]   said he's considering new laws aimed at addressing the problem he's troubled by the
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:24.280]   possibility that foreign this is this is once again another story showing how clueless
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:29.960]   members of congress are the possibility that foreign governments terrorists or organized crime
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:34.920]   could gain access to documents that reveal national secrets using peer-to-peer networks
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:39.320]   please huh huh yeah you could use that you could use postal mail too
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:44.360]   uh part of us needs to be banned the chairman of limewire mark gorton
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:49.720]   was assailed for allegedly harming national security through offering his product
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:53.240]   yes the terrorists use limewire
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:15:00.360]   but what an ignorant statement what an idiot yeah well the other thing is it was funny it
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:04.840]   was like you know let's not assail the corporate you know government IT department
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:10.120]   that's exactly right departments yeah or employees who are so bloody ignorant that they put
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:15.880]   peer-to-peer file sharing services on computers that are that carry you know secret information
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:20.120]   you know what i mean it's like let's blame it it just it smells of like somebody like you
[01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:25.080]   know they're having a chat with the r_a_a_ lobbyists over lunch and the r_a_a_ lobbyists went you know
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:30.520]   peer-to-peer threatens national security and that's you know to be that the senator with
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:36.120]   i smell a headline you know just pathetic dihydrogen oxen or what is it dihydrogen oxide
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:39.000]   kills thousands of people every year really what is that
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.200]   send the birds there is water yes
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:49.000]   oh oh 40,000 americans are killed every year by something that can be bought in any state
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:55.080]   county or town in the union i never need to stop these cars now you know it was this news at 11
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:16:00.440]   no kia buys uh twango for a hundred million dollars adding uh social networking site to their
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:07.640]   portfolio for reasons no one can understand i don't get it uh no kia for some reason is building
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:11.640]   these software services if they're a cell phone company i don't know why they think they need
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:13.560]   software services maybe they're gonna get out of it
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:18.360]   helio have an impact at all on these companies to where they feel they have to do these kind of
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:22.520]   maybe that's it offerings but helio interfaces to my space to existing
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:27.800]   social networks i understand why they think they need to white no kids doing all sorts of odd
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:32.920]   things they they have a podcasting service you know no no kia has changed is you know one of the
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:37.000]   things you've ever visited these guys and or just look on the website and look at the history of
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:41.640]   no kia it was like a coal mining company for five six years that was this it was that it was a
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:45.240]   monitor company recently it was an electronics company it's been all these different things and
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:48.840]   they jumped from one business to another more than any other company i've ever seen maybe they're
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:53.560]   ready to get out of the cell phone and that's it because they bought loud i which is a digital music
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:58.840]   distributor they bought uh gate five which is a navigation software company and now they bought
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:05.240]   twango they probably just have a lot of money can't get that much cast rich and strategy poor
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:11.560]   you know we didn't mention uh the uh quarterly results from microsoft and apple out apple made
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:18.600]   a ton of money microsoft made like ten times the ton of money huge quarters for both companies both
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:25.000]   both almost record quarters i think apple's three billion uh net profit in the quarter was a record
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:30.040]   for it but microsoft kind of dwarfed it by i don't know i was like eighty one billion or
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:35.800]   some huge amount of money so it's been a good ironically stock still doesn't move and the stock
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:42.760]   still stuck in uh neutral it's you know the story is that it a lot of pcs were sold but profits were
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:49.640]   not up profits were not up because or not up as much as they ought to be uh because the costs of
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:55.160]   these pcs are so low the razor thin margins yeah you know Leo this one story here that i just think
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:18:00.840]   is like it's got to be the dumb idea of all time is sisco deciding to kill the lintsis brand name
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:07.320]   and and they'll be selling you know forty nine dollar blue toy router that's a big mistake i
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:13.560]   think it is a horrible mistake i mean at at this point you can say oh that's a sisco router and it
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:21.160]   actually means some sisco's quality well exactly in land lintsis is you know a blue toy yeah i just
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:25.800]   i just can't i just don't want those guys are thinking mixing up their high-end commercial
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:33.160]   networking you know brand with with you know consumer end cap stuff uh well because the markets
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:37.240]   the markets are so different than the markets the targeted marketing in the way they would
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:42.120]   advertise those the markets are so vastly different i don't think they consider it to be threatening
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:46.920]   to their brand no i actually i know i agree with patrick on this it's that it's almost like uh
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:51.240]   when digital equipment came out with uh personal computers is and they said well you know everyone
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:54.600]   is gonna know who we are nobody know who no the public doesn't know who these people are and the
[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:58.440]   public doesn't know who sisco is so i don't think there is going to be any confusion i agree on
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:04.280]   her set but i disagree with the fact why would they take a could an established exactly name like
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:10.120]   lintsis and throw it away yeah that's that's that it is much stranger well it's strange in both
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:15.160]   cats and there's no reason to do either thing even if you don't believe it hurts the sisco brand
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:19.880]   why i mean if there's a chance it does why get rid of it well none of us work at lintsis or
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:25.480]   sisco or do marketing or do sales analysis or have a particular that's never stopped us before
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:33.320]   patrick well that's a good point this is our job is to make up crap and i wish my job were buying
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:38.440]   job that's my job that's your job john we're just following in your footsteps i wish i'd had a good
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:42.200]   sense to buy business dot com when it was uh nine dollars and fifty cents a year
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:48.680]   r_h_ donally bidding against doubt jones the new york times in news court pays three hundred
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:55.800]   forty five million dollars upfront cash plus performance based uh over the next three years
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:20:04.200]   for the name business dot com oh three just for the domain for the name this pains us all
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:09.960]   how you know that somebody registered it for oh maybe they paid twenty five bucks
[01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:16.040]   some time ago i was twenty five or seventy five i think early on even even 75 i think they made
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:21.000]   some money there well i think it's bounced around a few times i mean that halsey was buying when he
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:26.600]   was running scene that he was buying these domain names like that for forty grand a piece which was
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:31.560]   kind of the going price all the i remember when art dot com came out i had the guy in my zd tv show
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:36.600]   and he said that they paid a million dollars for art dot com for a while it is this is a ninety
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:39.080]   nine and sex dot com went for a while but for a while
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:44.760]   it was um people realized that generic domain names which everybody thought were going to be
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:50.040]   good weren't that good you know news dot com no this is an idiotic art dot com business dot com it's
[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:56.120]   too generic actually i business dot com is currently as of right now profitable and is
[01:20:56.120 --> 01:20:59.960]   is expected to generate more than fifty million dollars in two thousand so they bought the company
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:05.000]   not just the name uh... yeah business dot com advertising network uh... or business dot com
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.680]   makes money from its sites including business dot com work dot so there's more than just buying
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:12.040]   the domain all right i misunderstood i thought they were just getting the domain that's better
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:16.600]   all right it's it's search and advertising provider business dot com which was originally
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:21.480]   set up by skydayton and jake windbound back in ninety nine and they paid seven and a half
[01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:27.480]   billion for it really for it yeah skydayton now doing helio no slouch
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:34.600]   real quickly before we wrap up i want to mention uh... there's a great study uh... in gizmodo about
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:38.760]   hdmi cables i'm gonna ask robert about but before we do that i want to mention audible dot com
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:42.760]   our sponsor this week uh... sponsoring most of the twit network we really appreciate their
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:47.000]   support they do audio books you can download it couldn't be more convenient if you've never
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:52.120]   listened to a book uh... on your ipod or mp3 player are on your cell phone you've got a
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:56.040]   try audible dot com it's amazing they support hundreds of devices including all the ipods
[01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:01.720]   uh... and it it's just a great way to listen to a book we've recommended many books in the past
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:06.120]   uh... in fact at some point i've got to put up a page with all our recommendations including
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:10.600]   uh... what is it my life as an economic hitman which i've added to my list that's john's uh...
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:14.200]   it here is he wondered off during the ad
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:19.240]   he's a difer and drink uh... uh... but uh... this week i want to mention a great book from
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:25.160]   malcolm gladwell that i just adored reading on uh... audible uh... it was it's called the tipping
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:29.320]   point and it is a very insightful i think very interesting
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:35.480]   insight into why some things become big it's about that that that's an auto auto
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:38.680]   that book is so small you can read it in five minutes the tipping point
[01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:42.920]   yeah you just read it and it's over no it's like it's a really short book
[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:48.200]   and carry it was a couple hours but he talks about uh... i mean it's it's wonderful i just did
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:53.240]   you read it or you just looked at it and said it's true right it's just it seemed like you know
[01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:57.800]   it's a lot of it's not a fan of that book i loved it three hours and four minutes
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:03.080]   i loved it talking about uh... a white crime drops in new york city in the mid 90s
[01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:04.840]   it has to do with a squeegee men
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:10.280]   uh... it has with julie onnie putting getting taken out of it was bratton it was bratton
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:15.080]   uh... yeah but i mean basically whoever was responsible and i you know i think that julie
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:20.520]   on a concert share share share credit on that yeah but i but they got they they got cops out
[01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:24.360]   of the cruisers and put them on the street and when they did that
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:28.920]   you know for whatever sort of fascist environment it did create in certain neighborhoods it
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:34.200]   definitely cleaned up the streets and made them safer i had a dishearication of of of the whole
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:39.240]   time square area that whole maulification disheification of you also talks about how they get
[01:23:39.240 --> 01:23:42.680]   their graffiti off the you know what what they did to get the graffiti off it's the
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:46.280]   bro the one thing i like is the broken window theory you allow one broken window in a neighborhood
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:49.160]   you're you're effectively telegraphing we don't care
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:55.080]   and so having a zero tolerance attitude towards even minor crime like squeegee men broken windows
[01:23:55.080 --> 01:24:00.680]   graffiti cleans up everything because you're saying we care anyway it's a fascinating book i think
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:06.280]   it's really very germane to the whole issue of of viral marketing and how things take off and
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:10.440]   what it is that makes them take off malcolm gladwell's the author john hates it i love it but you

[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:47.400]   i didn't like blink as much as next book i thought that was a little obvious
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:55.000]   okay okay okay i still i'm re i still have confessions of an economic hitman on my list i downloaded i
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.800]   just haven't gotten to it i'm reading harry potter right now or listening to it whatever i've seen
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:03.960]   so many people reading harry potter books in the last couple of well i realized i hadn't read the
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:09.080]   last one so i'm actually listening to the last one so i can catch up and read the my daughter has
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:15.560]   stolen the last book she took it out of my hands so did you see that she's reading did you see that
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:21.080]   she's reading it is oh she's look at my daughter as a reader as though she she actually the our
[01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:27.160]   book bills are out out of control good that's a good addiction though oh yeah yep did you see the
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:31.880]   story robert and i'm curious what you think on gizmodo and actually they're quoting uh
[01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:37.240]   tests from um another site which i will quote to you in a second on
[01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:43.720]   hdmi cables the i did comparing the three hundred dollar monster cable to the
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:49.000]   fifty dollar mono price cable exactly what do you think i i think they're right on the money
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:55.240]   it they're stating the obvious uh but they did the tests which is nice they did and there is no
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:26:00.440]   difference between these cables literally for the shorter runs there there is no reason to spend
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:05.160]   extra on a on a specialty cable yeah the only thing they found on the really long cables it could
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:10.040]   make it and he was doing like everything wrong like coiling it up well the other thing is to say
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:15.000]   it's like it's it's a great test they were using you know monsters lab equipment and they were using
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:22.680]   35 and 50 foot cables right really long cables yeah which is highly would be highly unusual to find
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:26.520]   in your home the cheap cables worked every bit as well on the short runs it's only in the long
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:31.240]   runs it makes you literally want the shortest cable possible right yeah and the short run though i
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:35.640]   mean i i want to make sure people understand it the the short run which like failed the meter
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:43.560]   test did fine in the real world the short run was 35 feet yeah according according to this test
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:48.360]   basically the bottom line at short distances up to two meters or six feet you could pretty much
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:54.520]   get away with any cable you don't need to buy the expensive hdmi cable this is an old old scam
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:58.440]   that's been going on forever you talk to audio engineers they'll always tell you about this cable
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:02.920]   thing where they you know these very expensive cables for the stereo oh you get so many more decibels
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:06.600]   from our cable than somebody else's colorful wire for that was made it may be in that way back
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:10.680]   in the day but in analog anybody who really knows what they're talking about says that you should
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:14.520]   that's the last thing you ever spend money on is the cable it's like those tubes that are supposed
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:20.760]   to make you sound warm oh yeah what about those jens edivic the works on tubes today thanks to Ted
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:26.200]   stevens i'm on the tubes no but i mean you could make that case in analog but the thing that
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:30.440]   gripes me is that these companies are still charging those premium prices in digital cables
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:35.400]   oh yeah digital is where it makes no sense at all it's no sense at all it's a it's a great way to
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:39.800]   make profit for when you've already bought the tv and you're about to leave the store they'll
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:44.440]   shove up a hundred dollar cable in your face saying you need it and or or you're just lazy and you
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:48.360]   know what if you're lazy you deserve to get suckered well it's also but i mean if you think about it
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:54.600]   right even here in san francisco and there's i mean where you have just an unbelievable number of
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:58.840]   sources both the high end and at the low end for buying electronics you know if you're buying an
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:04.440]   hd tv finding you know they're going to have this the the sixty five dollar six foot cable which is
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:10.840]   still unreasonably expensive is in a is far far away from the hctv's and all of the you know all
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:16.360]   of the electronics that has an hdmi output and the cables that are right next to the televisions
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:19.400]   so that you can grab them because you know you're going to need to connect your new
[01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:24.920]   high definition stuff your new hd tv they've got the big collection of you know enormously expensive
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:29.560]   cables right there and you know what if you just drop three thousand dollars on a tv
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:33.240]   it doesn't hurt so much does it it tends for a cable yeah but they are pretty
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:37.560]   ear it's like that three years it's like the three-year warranty plan they try to sell you
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:42.360]   right what is the last minute it's like uh no thank you and then they really you know they're
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:45.960]   not happy when you say no you know the word thing what's good is they get a piece of the action
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:50.040]   the sales do you actually get a percentage but the thing is those half those warranties they
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:54.200]   said they don't you know if you actually had a problem late they still want they're they're fake
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:59.400]   it's a speed ticket depends on over and over it's a warranty so i mean some people have had an okay
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:06.600]   time with those guys i'm gonna wrap it up because we could talk forever we love talking and uh and
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:11.640]   but at some point we've got a we've got to let john make a stake and get steve back to work on his

[01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:32.680]   people buy more crap and watch porn that was that he doesn't actually i i know bill
[01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:36.360]   raw i've known him long enough that he wouldn't say something like that to me for attribution
[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:40.440]   because he he knows he knows you know he that's for the you know that's a good line though
[01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:44.680]   it's a good one but it's been around he said it a lot that's the ceo's ceo's he's kind of a wild man
