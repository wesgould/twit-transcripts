[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   It's time for Twit this weekend Tech.
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.040]   I know you're looking at the play bar on your podcast client.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.240]   You're saying two and a half hours, but let me tell you, it's going to be the best two
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.400]   and a half hours you ever spent.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.000]   Greg Ferro is here from the packet pushers network Ian Thompson from the register.co.uk.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.520]   The reason we went so long is we had so many great discussions about Apple and its iPhone
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.080]   about the new Amazon Echoes.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.920]   What are they up to about the new Blade Runner movie?
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.240]   And ultimately we talked about the fundamental problem Silicon Valley is having as people
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.440]   start to turn their back on tech.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.040]   It's all coming up next on Twit.
[00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:44.320]   NetCasts you love from people you trust.
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.160]   This is Twit.

[00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.560]   This is Twit.
[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:08.080]   This weekend Tech, episode 634 recorded Sunday, October 1st, 2017.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.280]   And Apple Watch walks into a bar.

[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.240]   This week at Tech, the show where we cover the week's tech news.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.920]   And really this show is going to be a remedial show for me because I've been gone for the
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.920]   last two weeks.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.320]   I have no idea what happened.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.560]   But thank God we have two of the best in studio with us.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.040]   They just happened to both be from, well, the colonies.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.040]   No, or the colonies.
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.280]   You're the empire in Thompson.
[00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.080]   Ah, such is at the moment.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.560]   I mean, sort of for small post box in Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.560]   And that's pretty much it.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.560]   It's not a huge empire.
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.800]   Former colonies.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.280]   Now a nation state on their own, but he does live in the UK.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.320]   Greg Farrow from the packet pushers network.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.320]   Hello, everybody.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.000]   We're sorry that you're not in the studio.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.120]   You were supposed to be here, but you broke your ankle or something.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.400]   Yeah, so I've been getting healthy and I decided that I would walk more.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.600]   And in the process of walking, I fractured my ankle and ended up in hospital with a plastic
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.080]   cast and blah, blah, blah.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.080]   Just got two exercises on healthy.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.080]   Yes.
[00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.640]   I believe that the evidence might point to this.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.840]   So it's not a good thing.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.840]   Look at some of us Adams.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.640]   If he'd never have gone into that gym, we might have yet another hitchhiker's book.
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.240]   No, that's the world needs more of that.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.240]   That's good.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.720]   Hey, where's my, did you steal my iPhone eight?
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.760]   I put it right here.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.640]   I was going to show that I have the latest and greatest thing.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.440]   But it is, I don't anymore.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.080]   I had a note eight in an iPhone eight.
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.080]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.080]   I'm sitting on them.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.880]   Not recommended, but there you have it.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.080]   From what I've heard, you're lucky you haven't cracked it.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.840]   So the, so while I was gone, Apple shipped iPhone eight to some lucky members of the press,
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.440]   as well as some actual users, this I've been playing with for a couple of days.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.200]   I had the note eight right before I left.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.520]   But none of this matters one bit because on Wednesday, Google's going to announce new
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.840]   pixels.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.400]   And someday this year, maybe next year, Apple's going to start shipping the iPhone 10, which
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.640]   the world resolutely calls the iPhone X.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.720]   Yes.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:18.160]   Do, is there a consensus yet on whether Apple's selling any of these iPhone eights?
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.880]   It feels to me, it was so easy to walt waltz into the online store at 12 or one Pacific
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.880]   time and buy this.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.280]   It feels like it's not selling like hotcakes.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.000]   I don't think it's flying off the shelves by any matter of means.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.920]   I mean, it's, there's nothing in there that is a must have, you know, it's just different.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.480]   It's like a tick or a, you know, you've got ticks and talks in, in evolution.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.840]   And this is just a slight tick.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.320]   And it keeps a lot of the things that people didn't like about the last iPhone and it doesn't
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.920]   really add an awful lot more.
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.560]   So I'm going to be at the Pixel event on Wednesday.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.680]   I'm curious to see what they've done, although it does look as though they too are abandoning
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.880]   the 3.5 mil jack, which is unless they can give me a damn good reason for that.
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.440]   I'm going to hammer on it.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.680]   That's why I think the note eight might be the phone of choice, despite the bizarrely
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.160]   positioned fingerprint reader.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.160]   But you've got an essential.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.160]   How you found it?
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.360]   I have an essential in the other room.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.880]   It cracked the different day.
[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.880]   That was one problem.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.960]   Ooh, this amazing ceramic and titanium impervious design cracked without any impact.
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.440]   It just cracked.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.200]   That's not good.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.040]   So I think that I don't know about.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.920]   Five thousand phones they've sold through Sprint.
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.160]   Now that's not the only source.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.960]   But I think that this is a phone without a market.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.520]   Well, I mean, five thousand phones is a rounding error compared to our lower androids.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.680]   Here from Slice Intelligence.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.240]   So Slice, as you know, that's that app.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.960]   I use it that tells you when you're getting stuff on its way.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:56.040]   Slice has five million users and iPhone 8 sales.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.680]   Not good.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:04.680]   These bar graph here shows sales in the first five days following lunch, playing lunch.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.640]   I told you I'm a little punchy.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.320]   iPhone 6, wow.
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.320]   Big.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.320]   There's no scale on this.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.400]   So I don't know how big big is.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.120]   N equals 146,556 shoppers.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.320]   I don't know what this any of this means.
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.320]   I can't read it.
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.760]   iPhone 7 plus the next big is selling in the 7 and the 6 plus the success.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:31.280]   And then the same at the bottom, the iPhone 8 plus and an even smaller wedge, the iPhone
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.280]   8.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.280]   Now that's not Apple's stat.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.800]   Apple won't tell.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.280]   But that is a slice of stat.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.240]   Ming Chi Quo, the analyst, also said sales have been sluggish of the iPhone 8.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.880]   And the stock market seems to think so Apple's stock has been going down.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.880]   Yeah.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:51.440]   The question really for us is is that because people are waiting for the iPhone 10?
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.720]   I think the kind of saying, sorry, I agree.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.560]   I really, yeah, no, I really think so.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.000]   I think that there's a bunch of early adopters where money's not a problem.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.760]   It's all about having the latest and greatest phones.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.960]   And there's people in the Android space for this as well.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.080]   And, you know, back in the days of Microsoft Windows phones, etc.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.760]   They wanted the latest and greatest.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.760]   And so I think Apple's made a fundamental flaw here introducing the iPhone 8 and the
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.760]   iPhone X or 10 at the same time.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.760]   Right.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.760]   The eyes won't.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.760]   What they should have done.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.760]   Almost, right?
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.520]   Yeah, they should have released the iPhone 8 and said, this is the best phone.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.680]   We've ever made.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.900]   And then come around for another announcement in three or four, five, six months time and
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.520]   said, here's the iPhone 10.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.920]   This is our step change.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.760]   But how annoying would that be for people who bought the iPhone 8 to find out six months
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.760]   later?
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.760]   Oh, it's already obsolete.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.240]   Well, why I think Apple is a challenge.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:48.720]   Why did they even bother doing an iPhone 8?
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.240]   Because they couldn't make enough X's.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.840]   Well, also because there's a very limited market for people who are going to spend 12
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.840]   grand on a phone.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.640]   See, I says 12, 12,000, 12 hundred, sorry, 1200 on a phone.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.480]   Even a smaller market for 12 grand.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.480]   But yeah.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.480]   I'm not sure about that.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.840]   I think that here would be my guess.
[00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.240]   The iPhone 10 is going to end up if they can make it.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.240]   And that's.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.240]   And make it work.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.640]   Not an insignificant if.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:16.080]   If they can make it is going to sell as well as any other iPhone.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.120]   That's the one people want and are waiting for.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.720]   And what it really, to me, points out is that the iPhone is not about technology.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.480]   This is marginally the aid is marginally better than the seven none.
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.480]   Anything to write home about.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.560]   If you have a seven, you know, unless you absolutely have to have wireless charging or
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:34.480]   that goofy portrait stuff that they're doing, there's no reason to upgrade this.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.200]   Yes, it's an incredible.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:43.560]   Oh, Malek wrote this P and to the A11 bionic processor and Apple's amazing ability to do
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.720]   its own fabs and to do its own GPU now for the first time and do its own amazing chip.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.000]   And this chip is so fast.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.680]   It's comparable to a MacBook Pro, but in the.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.120]   But you don't need it.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.520]   It's it's it's like driving a Ferrari on a local city street.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.720]   You talk three things people use these for a browsing the internet navigation and making
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.760]   calls and there is no significant improvement with the iPhone 8 in that.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.640]   And I got to say also with the iPhone 10, there's not a real signal.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.000]   I mean, they've got rid of the home button.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.280]   Well, that's going to be more irritating than not.
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.000]   It's a definite negative.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.120]   The facial recognition thing, unless that works flawlessly out the box, they're going
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.520]   to lose a lot of goodwill on that.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.560]   And by all accounts, it's a fairly fragile piece of kit as well.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.320]   So and repairability is not good with Apple products to put it mildly.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.320]   So I don't know.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.920]   I think they could actually be heading for fall on this one.
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:38.400]   They may have kneecapped themselves by doing these three phones in this kind of odd strategy.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:45.920]   By the way, they offer still an iPhone SE at 350 and iPhone 6s at 450 and iPhone 7 at
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:52.360]   550 and iPhone 8 at 700 bucks and iPhone 10 at $1,000.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:57.440]   This is exactly what Steve Jobs when he came back after leaving Apple said was wrong with
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.440]   Apple.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.440]   They had too many skews.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.360]   This is so I think there's a few things going on here.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.400]   And then some of them are economic and some of them are market driven.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:12.200]   So the idea is that the iPhone 10 shifts the price for the premium phone up from $700
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.880]   to over $1,000.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.280]   And that's key to getting the RPU average revenue per user up for Apple.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:22.200]   And they haven't been able to shift above because they've always had just one phone.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.600]   And when you have just one phone, it has to be a price that appeals to the widest possible
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.600]   audience.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:32.360]   So by running multiple product lines, you're now able to ship more products to more price
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.360]   brackets.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.440]   And in theory, you should be selling more and you also should be selling more at higher
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.440]   values.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:43.200]   Now, keep in mind also that the iPhone 6s and the previous generations, the production
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.200]   processors have been maximised.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.200]   They're efficient.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.200]   They've been working.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.160]   They know how to make those phones at high profit margins now and produce them in volume.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:57.400]   So the average profit margin on those phone, those older units is rumoured to be very high,
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.680]   much higher than it was say three or four years ago.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.160]   And they can produce them on mass.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:06.440]   So they're increasing the average sale price per unit by jumping in with the iPhone X without
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.680]   disrupting all the stacks underneath.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.560]   And I think this is the trick is I think Apple was trying to be greedy here.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:16.880]   They're introducing the iPhone X in time for the holiday season, the Christmas period where
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.080]   everybody says, I can buy myself a new iPhone because I can buy myself a Christmas present
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.560]   or I can buy one for somebody else and so forth.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.560]   They really should have taken a step back and said, well, we'll ship the iPhone 8 and
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.360]   then we'll come back for the iPhone 10 in March next year or something like that.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.960]   What about I would skip the eight and just go straight to the 10.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.600]   I don't think it makes sense to do that.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.520]   Too many people are used to the yearly cadence and they're expecting to see an upgrade.
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.760]   The iPhone 8 is a perfectly acceptable upgrade.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:51.000]   And no, if you're coming from a six or earlier, yes, seven, yes.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.920]   And in the same way that I don't think it's a suitable upgrade from a seven, it's too close to a seven.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.200]   But nobody who's own well, let me restate that.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.840]   There are people who are early adopters who will buy whatever apple ships to have the latest phone
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:04.560]   for this year.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.880]   And those people are not going to rush out and buy the eight.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.760]   They're going to go and buy the iPhone 10.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:15.120]   And so this is really my real question is, isn't that what's really going on?
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.160]   Is that Ben Thompson breaks it down.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.640]   There's two people who buy iPhones.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.520]   He actually has an excellent article on Stratecary talking about the strategy.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:35.760]   One of the keys, there's, he says the two of the markets identified are customers who want the best possible phone
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:41.880]   and customers who want the prestige of owning the highest status phone on the market.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:48.920]   For those customers, the iPhone 10 is really the only option, right?
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.560]   And I even think Apple's very well aware of this.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:58.920]   That one of the controversial features of this iPhone 10 is this bizarre notch at the top.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:04.000]   You know, Samsung managed to make a screen as big, in fact, a little bit bigger with better resolution
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.800]   with no notch at all.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.520]   They just made it start a little bit lower on the screen.
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.440]   It seems to be the normal front.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.640]   That seems a normal way.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.320]   But I think there's a reason why Apple won the notch.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:15.600]   It's not for technical reasons.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.800]   It's not because it needed to be there.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.520]   It's because it makes it so that you can have one.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:24.400]   And immediately it's apparent you have the newest latest hard to get phone.
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.320]   Yeah, you see it.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.160]   The red fins.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.160]   I mean, the reds we call this the cupidino idiot tax.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.840]   It's it's basically, you know, there are a bunch of people who no matter what
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.640]   it costs will buy the latest and greatest Apple kit.
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.320]   It's and it's not just Apple.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.040]   It goes across some other firms, but Apple uses a fanatical about this.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.040]   And they're not going to buy the eight.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.080]   They're going to wait until the 10 people who have just bought a seven a year ago,
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.800]   probably aren't going to buy the eight for 106 months.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:57.120]   And what he is worrying is that Apple now has this long line of products.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:01.800]   And as we saw with Apple before jobs actually came back, that was what was
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.680]   killing the company.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.200]   You had a plethora of different computers, all of them not particularly good.
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.240]   And I do think this exposes a real problem with that.
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.000]   That's my question.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.400]   Isn't this confusing consumers?
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.360]   No, I think I think you're assuming that the cost of the old phones is actually
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:19.440]   holding old inventory or producing old inventory or having too many schools is
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.240]   hard.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:24.040]   And yet Apple's still producing the same success that it's already shipped
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.560]   150 million units off.
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.800]   So the robots that make it out, the production lines that produce the screens,
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.640]   the chips that are inside it don't cost them a lot of money to get a handle on.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.200]   So it's not like keeping those lines running, kills them.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.080]   No, that's true.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:39.880]   Right.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.640]   It's not it's not that Apple can't do it.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.080]   Clearly Apple has logistics down.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.040]   It's it's a question of whether it confuses the market.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:51.160]   Now Ben does point out there's a third Apple phone by our customers who want to
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.040]   own a top of the line iPhone, but can't afford one.
[00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:58.000]   And it's his position that that's what these other ones are for, particularly
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.600]   the six S and the S E.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.560]   Oh, yeah, if you go to my book and you bought into the entire, you want to be
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.120]   Apple, then you want to be part of the group, but you can't quite afford the,
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.840]   the 10 or even the eight.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.200]   It's so that makes sense.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:17.240]   He says that Apple's taking a pretty significant risk in particular with the
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.240]   iPhone eight.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:24.400]   He says, we know the company could succeed selling the best phone, but he
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.280]   points to the five C, you know, the one with the plastic color back.
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.400]   The example of building a less than best phone was underwhelming and hardly sold.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:36.560]   So how many, he asks, how many iPhone buyers will forego the eight to wait for
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:36.960]   the 10?
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:41.280]   It's my suspicion that that's what's happening is that a great many people either
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.560]   are that third category and they're going to buy or stick with their, most of them
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.600]   will stick with with their iPhone.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.600]   If they're buying an iPhone, they're going to get a lower and less expensive
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.360]   iPhone and the rest are status conscious people.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:51.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:56.480]   People who want the best phone, really, it's the best iPhone because I would, I
[00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.560]   would argue that the 10 isn't it particularly spectacularly technically advanced.
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.560]   This is what kind of is worrying me about Apple's strategy at the moment in
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:09.040]   that since jobs died, they haven't come up with a groundbreaking product.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.080]   It's just been iterations of what came before.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.720]   Well, look what's happening with the watch now.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:19.000]   They released the watch that has massive technical issues with connectivity.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.600]   And also is a really bad deal for consumers in terms of data costs.
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.320]   Because you're not actually adding that much to your data course, but you have
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.000]   to pay an extra 10 bucks more a month.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.520]   It just like, you know, there's only so long you can squeeze sheep before, you
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.040]   know, things start going out of hand.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.320]   Here's the interesting thing.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.480]   I don't think it's going to hurt Apple.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.080]   It hurt any other company.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:41.800]   I don't think it's going to hurt it.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:46.080]   It would be difficult to hurt Apple, but, you know, Apple used to be, you know, the
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:50.120]   same God mode technology company and they lost it in the mid 90s.
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.520]   They're just, they've pivoted.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.120]   They used to be a God.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.000]   Tell me you use the pivot word.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.320]   How they're a fashion.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.800]   No, they're a fashion company.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.320]   They're a status company.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:06.680]   And I tell you what I see among affluent people who can afford them.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.400]   I phones completely dominate, right?
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.480]   If you can afford an iPhone, you buy an iPhone for the most part.
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.080]   Only a few geeks like us prefer Android phones.
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.080]   And I think that they continue to own that.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.640]   They don't own it for technical reasons.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.640]   What was the whole, the whole noise about AR?
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.920]   Like these phones were going to be the next breakthrough in AR.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.280]   I downloaded all the AR apps.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:27.840]   There's nothing.
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.200]   This is not a breakthrough in AR.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.880]   But you see there's the same thing with the Samsung and their VR headset.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.680]   You know, I tried, I got, got, got, got a unit of that, tried it out.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.360]   Actual, the amount of good VR stuff out there that wish you can
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:44.120]   realistically download, put onto a phone and run is minimal.
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.240]   You know, we're still in the hype cycle upswing on this one.
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:51.680]   The funny thing is that the hardware you need to do really good AR is actually
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.760]   on the iPhone 10, it's just facing you.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:58.200]   It's facing the wrong way and it's used for two and only two things.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.440]   This is very typical of Apple.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.440]   They put NFC in, but they didn't allow anybody to use it.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:01.840]   Yeah.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.880]   They put all this, you know, super duper connect technology with the
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:11.760]   thought painting projection lights and the infrared sensors at pointed at you.
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.680]   So you could do face ID because they, they would decide it unaccountably to
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:20.600]   remove a perfectly good biometric authentication that everybody liked.
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.640]   I've gotten used to it was very effective.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.800]   It's easy to use.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.640]   It's going to use.
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.720]   You can't hold it in front of you.
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.520]   They removed it.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.080]   So they had to put this face recognition in.
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.760]   So that's one reason you get this.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:34.000]   And the other reason is so you can do animated emojis and you're not getting
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.160]   any of the AR benefit.
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.160]   They put that on the other side.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.320]   That would be a tango like high quality AR engine, but they don't.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:40.760]   They didn't.
[00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:45.800]   So just putting it on the iPhone 10, they're not putting it in the iPhone 8.
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.120]   They could have put it in the iPhone 8 and sold it to the mass market.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.000]   The iPhone 10 is intended to be a test.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.080]   There's a vision of the iPhone 10 as a trial.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.920]   Can we produce enough OLED screens?
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.640]   Can we produce units with the face ID?
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.120]   Capability.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.240]   Can we producing the OLED screens?
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.960]   They're not producing any of these components.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.960]   They're buying the Samsung.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.080]   Sure, they are, but can Samsung produce them at Apple iPhone numbers?
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:11.400]   Right.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:17.000]   Can can Samsung produce a million units a month or scale up to 10 million units
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.240]   enough and Apple didn't think that Samsung can do that.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:24.640]   And I think the challenge is that if they tried to put an OLED screen into the iPhone
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:29.120]   8, that the fear is that Samsung wouldn't have been able to produce enough screens
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.800]   to meet demand any time in the next year, no matter how many robots.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:38.680]   I mean, you've seen Apple spend like $4 billion pre-ordering components, which is
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.160]   giving those companies enough money to go and buy the robots.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:45.840]   Some of those robots are like $250 million each to make some of these parts inside of here.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:48.120]   We should thank Apple because it's this kind of thing.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:52.600]   It's since 2007 that's propelled so many other markets because Apple has made it easier
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.080]   and cheaper to make all sorts of these components.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.520]   That's why we have drones.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.360]   And so we have so many amazing technologies.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.920]   Frankly, it's why we have all these other good smartphones is because Apple put all the
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:05.400]   money in upfront to make the pipeline.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.080]   Well, if you look at how they've dealt with some of their suppliers, it's been slightly
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:10.080]   less than ethical.
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:10.680]   They're cutting in.
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.040]   Yes.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.600]   But at the same time, you're right.
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.960]   I mean, Apple didn't invent the smartphone.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.080]   It just made it sexy.
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.960]   It made it something that people actually wanted.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.520]   And they sold them in massive quantities.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.400]   Absolutely.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.320]   And they deserve credit for that.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:23.960]   But I just--
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:28.680]   Ben, actually, Ben has an interesting theory about the iPhone X that it's really intended
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:33.600]   for China where the number one-- first of all, Apple's been suffering in China.
[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:38.960]   They've been beaten by the Chinese, by Huawei, by ZTE, by Xiaomi.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.800]   They're doing very well in China and iPhone sales have plummeted.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.680]   But it's a very-- apparently, a very status-conscious market.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.040]   And Ben's in Taiwan, so I think he has some insight into this.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.200]   And he thinks-- he says the iPhone X will be a massive hit in China.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.840]   In particular, I wouldn't be surprised if most of the early iPhone supply--
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.000]   iPhone X supply-- were earmarked for China.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:20:59.600]   Makes sense.
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.320]   There's a lot of money sloshing around there.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:05.400]   And Apple would love to come back and get that market back.
[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.560]   They're not going to be able-- we heard Wall Street Journal had a story that two
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:16.960]   of the components in the iPhone X, Romeo and Juliet, as one might expect, are a pair.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.040]   The kill each other or--
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:19.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.880]   They both die at the end.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.600]   No, they're a pair of components that are needed in it.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.040]   And one of them is behind-- I can't remember if it's Romeo and Juliet.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:31.200]   And that's what's going to hold up-- this was a story earlier this week--
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:38.280]   "Embalance with modules fuels concern about widespread sales shortages."
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.280]   You see, they're not going to sell--
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.400]   It's part of the Facebook.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.840]   They're going to keep-- if they want to keep this as a premium product,
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.600]   make it fairly difficult to buy.
[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.600]   Have long waiting lists.
[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.200]   If you want to flood into China and put a bunch of stuff there, that's fine.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:54.520]   We could end up with a situation where you actually get people queuing up in China
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.360]   to buy iPhone X and sending them back to the US rather than the other way around,
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:00.040]   as it was five years ago.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:00.920]   So I don't know.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.320]   It could work in China, but it just--
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.400]   it's a lot of money to spend on a phone.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.560]   And yeah, $1,000 for the base spec model.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.920]   That's not pushing it.
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:13.120]   But at the same time, Apple's not abandoning those other users.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.960]   It's keeping the seven, the six, and the five for those customers who want it.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.680]   And it's not producing a cut-down version of it.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:25.080]   It's still producing the same premium phone that it was producing just two or three years ago,
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.600]   which, you know what, for a lot of people is actually perfectly functional.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.120]   I want to come back to the China thing.
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.320]   I think there's one thing you need to realize about China too,
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.200]   is that most of the American tech companies have actually
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.760]   been booted out of China.
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:41.440]   No Google, no Facebook, no Netflix, no Amazon, right?
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.800]   All of those have been chased out of China because they won't conform to what the Chinese
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.000]   government wants.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.600]   And Apple is almost the last of the American tech companies that are still there.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.680]   We'll talk later on about Scott Galloway, who's talking about how the US tech giants
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.240]   are starting to face a lash back.
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.400]   I hope we talk about it.
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.400]   Yes.
[00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.400]   It's one of my favorites.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.600]   Yeah, I really want to talk about that.
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.600]   Yeah.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.600]   And you know, so Apple is one of the last US tech companies that's doing business in
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.600]   China.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:09.520]   So if it does something specific for the Chinese market, that makes absolute perfect sense.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.520]   They already did.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.520]   And they're the yank, the VPN apps from the app store.
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.520]   Yes.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.200]   No, they've shown themselves quite willing to play ball when it comes to dealing with
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.520]   the Chinese authorities in a way that you write.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.720]   So don't go approach Chinese here, right?
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.720]   Right.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.720]   Because that's what you're effectively doing.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:29.360]   Remember that Apple has been cow-towing to any legally legitimate challenge from any
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:34.560]   government anywhere in the world, be it Australia, be it the UK, be it the US.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:39.200]   As long as the challenge or the requests are legitimate and formed by the duly elected
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.240]   or the government in charge, Apple will always do that.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:44.240]   And it always has done.
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.040]   I don't even think it's a bad strategy.
[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:52.760]   I think that, I mean, it's, you might have political qualms about it, humanitarian qualms
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:53.760]   about it.
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:58.120]   But, and I'm glad Google, for instance, decides not to play that game.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:04.200]   But if you're from a purely capitalist business point of view, I understand why Apple's doing
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.440]   exactly what it's doing.
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.960]   I think the thing that's hard for me and I think the thing that we have to recognize
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.520]   though is that Apple isn't really a tech company exactly anymore.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.040]   It's a jewelry company.
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:17.040]   It's a fashion company.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.720]   It's a lifestyle company.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.360]   It's a marketing company.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.760]   And that's a perfectly fine thing for it to be.
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:25.760]   It's a good business.
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.760]   Nice working.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.080]   It's a popular business.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.720]   It's a very popular business model.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.720]   Don't fail.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.720]   Nothing wrong with it.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.720]   It's sad to me.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:33.720]   It's a single right, the same business model.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.840]   I know, but it's sad to me because I'm a geek.
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.160]   I want it to be a tech company.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.720]   I don't want it to be a fashion company.
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.720]   A lifestyle company.
[00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.440]   No, the last 10 years, most tech companies have been fashion companies or image conscious
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.920]   or about selling.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.320]   How about monetizing tech.
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:50.000]   Well, that doesn't explain why the Google Pixel is so damn ugly.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:57.040]   And also, if this is Google's fashionable statement, they got a problem.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.160]   They got to hire Angela Aron, somebody.
[00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:02.240]   Well, it's really weird what they've done with a pixel line because, you know, when
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:06.280]   they started off with the Nexus line, they were cheap bare bones.
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.280]   They were really developed.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.280]   They were developed.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.280]   They were developed at units.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.120]   And then they brought out the Pixel last year.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.880]   They jacked the price up nearly 40%.
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:15.360]   You didn't get a lot extra for it.
[00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:17.840]   You got a reskinned version of Android.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:21.000]   You know, they, and they're like, well, you know, we want to compete with the iPhone.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.560]   We want to be a fashionable phone.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:23.560]   And you're right.
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.560]   It's butt ugly.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.560]   And compared to a lot of the-
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.240]   Well, you see Wednesday, what they can do.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:31.520]   And the early leaked designs look a little bit better.
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.520]   Full bezel.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.520]   I agree with you.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.960]   I'm really disheartened if they take the iPhone, the headphone jack out.
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:41.080]   But yeah, unfortunately, that seems to be the way of things at the moment.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.520]   Headphone jacks are becoming rapidly extinct.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.040]   What is Google doing?
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.480]   They bought, they spent a billion dollars to buy some of HTC's assets.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.480]   HTC's stuff, yeah.
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.560]   Remember that they bought Motorola.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:52.640]   It didn't go well.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.240]   They sold it at a loss.
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.800]   They tried to be in the phone business.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:57.640]   But they kept access to the patents.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.000]   That really what they wanted was the patents.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   That was what that was.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   So they got the patents.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.520]   But they weren't trying to be in the phone business.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.680]   But now apparently they really are trying to be.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.680]   What did they?
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.480]   HTC says, oh no, we're going to still make phones.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.800]   That I find hard to believe.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:15.640]   Well, we've seen a rash of articles this week about people talking about how Apple's integrated
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:21.240]   supply line because it owns its chips and designs its own CPUs and gets them manufactured.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:25.800]   And because it has complete control of the iPhone assembly, even though they outsource
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.680]   the assembly to Foxconn or in China, they're still very heavily involved.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.920]   And people are saying this vertically integrated supply chain.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:33.920]   Really?
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.040]   Last week we saw them get into the Dixibadil.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.240]   It's Tim Cook's greatest creation.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.240]   Yes.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:44.640]   And we're now seeing them get into the partnering with Bain Capital or rumored to be partnering
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.520]   with Bain Capital to drop a few billion dollars into buying Dixibis so they can get control
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.280]   of the DRAM supply.
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:54.680]   And I wonder if, I just wonder if Google's saying, you know what Apple's doing this?
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.000]   We have to start thinking about doing the same thing before they get too far away from
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   us.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.640]   If Apple gets too far away, gets this integrated supply and their leadership, Apple's already
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.480]   three, four years ahead of Samsung.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:11.160]   If they continue to be able to do this, then where does that leave Android?
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.520]   And operations are traditionally Tim Cook's strong point.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.080]   Oh, this is where he comes from.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.080]   Yeah, this is his background.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.880]   This is what he's done very well.
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:22.520]   He's very good at taking over the whole supply chain, squeezing suppliers to my office.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.520]   And this was D.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.520]   Jobs vision.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.520]   Hmm.
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:29.880]   And they said, if you want to succeed, you have to own the whole stack hardware and software.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.200]   And taking it one step farther, you have to make the chips.
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.200]   You have to make all the parts.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.760]   And they have shown that they can make the, you know, the benchmarks, as I said, for the
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.040]   A11 Bionic are astounding.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:44.520]   Well, this is why they run rings around the Samsung Note 8, for instance.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:48.400]   But this is why I don't understand why Apple isn't playing to its strengths up to a point.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:52.760]   Because I mean, if you look at the security aspects of it, owning your own software and
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:57.760]   stack, proper code checking before it goes into the store, this is, there is a great
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:02.800]   selling point for Apple phones on security because Android, in the play store we've had,
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:10.360]   let's see, malware outbreaks in January, March, April, July 2 in September, it's getting silly
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.760]   at the moment.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.440]   And Android users are disproportionately getting hit by viruses.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.840]   So they should use this as a selling point.
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.040]   It's a huge opportunity.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:23.320]   Ironically, they're not selling to the technically literate, they're selling.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.440]   It's their life, it's a lifestyle.
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:27.840]   It really is a lifestyle.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.680]   But this is, which works.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:34.480]   So the transition here is that the integrated supply chain fires in the face of everything
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.720]   we've done for the last 20 years in tech.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:41.720]   So if you go back to where Microsoft started, their value was that they disaggregated the
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.480]   operating system away from the computer.
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:49.680]   And the PC disaggregated the supply chain of the hardware because it used an Intel CPU
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:55.320]   and somebody else's chips and somebody else's bus, the iSa bus and the power supply was all
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:57.040]   stock off the shelf.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:01.240]   The idea was that we should be disaggregating everything into pieces and we should be having
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.920]   each company bid to make the piece.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.360]   And now all of a sudden Apple's integrating it back together.
[00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:11.800]   So if you continue to follow Ben, he talks a lot about his theory of aggregation.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:16.320]   What he's saying now is you disaggregate and then what you do is you bang it back together
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:17.320]   in a different way.
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:20.600]   You aggregate or you bond it back together in a different way, making sure that you now
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:25.440]   control that, some element of that, that new aggregation, now you own it.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:32.400]   And if that theory of aggregation holds true, then what you're seeing is that Apple's now
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:36.840]   stabilizing or morphing into a solid lock on the thing that it's got.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.960]   But somebody's going to come along and disaggregate it in the future.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.000]   And this is what's happening in China.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.920]   Ben Thompson from Strutekery says, "In China, the point is that the aggregation happens
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.400]   in WeChat above it."
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.000]   Like every Chinese citizen uses a software.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:56.840]   So the phone underneath, whether it's iOS or Android or Windows or whoever's operating
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:03.640]   system, actually matters less to a large enough audience as it does, say, in Western markets.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:08.440]   And so there's actually a different transition in the Chinese market to the Western markets.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:13.680]   It's a complicated world we live in.
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:16.800]   I don't even pretend to understand what these companies are doing.
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:18.920]   I think a lot of it now is coming down.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.760]   As you say, the hardware is less and less important.
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.560]   It's coming down to which ecosystem you buy into.
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.640]   And Android is not really an ecosystem.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.640]   It's just too fragmented.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.720]   It's now a Samsung or a Google ecosystem.
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:35.360]   No, I mean, if you use say, like many companies do use Google Apps in the office, you know,
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:36.360]   you're a Gmail user.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.560]   It's kind of a loose lee.
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.080]   So there is an incentive to stay with Android in that thing.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:47.280]   If you're using MacBook Pro and Mac OS all the way along the line, there's a massive
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.440]   incentive to go with an iPhone.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.960]   I mean, my wife has just upgraded her phone and I tried her out in a couple of Androids
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:58.360]   and she's just like, "Yeah, but then when I've tried linking in and thinking at my iTunes
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:02.520]   and getting everything else done, there's going to be an enormous amount of work in changing
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.760]   ecosystems."
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:09.360]   So, you know, it's increasing the getting locked into these things.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:13.920]   I think it's certainly possible that just asking people to change is actually incredibly
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:14.920]   hard.
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.640]   So humans are not very good at change, as we well know.
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:21.120]   And once they've walked down a certain path, that's very difficult.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.400]   So recently I bought my wife's parents some iPhones.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:28.080]   But the reason I bought them iPhones instead of some low cost, you know, they can barely
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:33.120]   use it to send an SMS message, much less surf the internet on it, much less take photos
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:34.520]   or listen to music.
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:37.680]   But the reason I bought them iPhones is just because I have to support the blasted things
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:40.040]   and I just can't be bothered working out what Android to buy.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.640]   It was just too hard.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:47.080]   And you know, all the Android phones that I wanted to buy for $300 were all running Android
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:51.400]   4, which was just so basically insecure that it wasn't, you know, I was just not willing
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.040]   to give it to them.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.120]   It's fascinating to watch.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:05.320]   I think that I was at a tweet, I think it was this morning where the guy was talking about
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:09.680]   all the pundits who think they understand why a company does what it does.
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:13.840]   And when pundits who are not running the companies say things like, well, I don't understand
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.600]   why Apple's doing this.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.840]   It's very likely they don't really understand what Apple's up to at all.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:22.480]   And I would say that Tim Cook probably knows a lot better what he's up to.
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:28.280]   Oh, yeah, but it's fun to kind of try to penetrate the Kremlin wall and understand a
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.040]   little bit better what their long-term strategy is.
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.960]   It's not it's becoming less and less a tech story though.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:34.960]   And oh, yes.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:42.240]   Yes, but I mean, but ironically, it's funny because in the process of controlling all
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:46.960]   the components in an iPhone, they've actually put a processor that's well ahead of anybody
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.920]   else's processer in here.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.520]   And I would submit unnecessarily.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:56.960]   It provides power to well beyond anything that you need.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.560]   And yes, they make it themselves.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:01.640]   So maybe that's the benefit, not the power.
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.720]   But maybe there's some gold down the road.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.640]   Maybe this phone is that's what we thought at first.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.640]   Well, that's all going to be for the AR.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.640]   But there is no.
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:10.640]   I think they're seeding.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.640]   I think they're seeding the market.
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:16.200]   The point is is that, so for example, I have an Apple Watch 3 it arrived earlier in
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.600]   the week.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.920]   I'm not a huge Apple Watch fan.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.120]   I'm a modest user of one.
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:24.640]   I had an Apple Watch 0.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.640]   And it was fine.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.920]   It wasn't bad, but I wanted something that just ran a little bit faster.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.600]   But particularly, I wanted something a little bit lighter.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.880]   So the new Apple Watch 3 is quite nice.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.680]   And what I've discovered is I now get two days charge out of it.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.560]   I only have the other.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:40.600]   That's impressive given that they have always new radios and so forth.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:41.600]   Mine comes tomorrow.
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:46.920]   I got the idea that by the way, support my thesis that it's all about fashion.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:51.040]   It's indistinguishable from the other Apple watches except for a very visible red dot
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.640]   on the stem.
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.440]   And that's that there by accident.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.840]   That's to say, I have the latest Apple Watch.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:57.840]   Right?
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.560]   That's the part you pointed people.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.800]   So I have the LT version, but I don't have it connected to the LT network and probably
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.240]   never will.
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.800]   I just wanted the other stuff that was in there.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:10.120]   So just because there's technology in something doesn't mean that it gets used.
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.120]   I think that's the case.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:15.920]   It's a bit like the FM radios in the iPhone, which was an issue that came out.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:19.600]   I want to take a break because I would like to know what you all think about this with
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.960]   the American pie shooting his mouth off again.
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.400]   But maybe not, but maybe not.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.400]   I don't know.
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:31.160]   Apple says, well, there's no radio in there except that there is sort of kind of well,
[00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:34.320]   let's, but I'm not convinced that Apple's wrong right on this one.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.320]   I'm not sure.
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:39.040]   That's why I want the smarter minds who are here to explain it to me.
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:43.520]   Ian Thompson from the register dot go dot UK.
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:48.400]   Greg Farrow from the packet pushers network, an excellent technical podcast network.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:54.000]   And of course, at ethereal mind on the Twitter.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.240]   Our show today brought to you by my, my, my host actually the company that hosts 28% of
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:02.200]   all the websites in the world WordPress dot com 20.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.560]   Well, is that that's not strictly fair?
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:09.160]   28% of all the internet sites in the world run on WordPress.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.520]   Some of them hosted themselves.
[00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.200]   Some of them use WordPress hosting.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:16.440]   Some of the biggest companies in the world run on WordPress.com using their VIP plan,
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.880]   including courts.
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:22.200]   Courts when it came out, everybody said, this is the most amazing website.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:23.360]   Look at the technology they're using.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.200]   It was WordPress.
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:30.480]   My blog, not anywhere close to courts is using WordPress and your business should be using
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.640]   WordPress every day.
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:36.280]   Millions of people go online doing one thing, trying to find out about local businesses,
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:40.480]   trying to find about your business, even if you're a plumber, if you're selling, you
[00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:46.720]   know, dishes, if whatever your business is, it doesn't exist without a website.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:51.320]   And it's not enough to say, Oh, we got a Facebook page or we've got a Twitter account.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.320]   That's not your page.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.960]   You need to have your own website.
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:57.200]   And I know why you don't, if you don't, it's because it's too much trouble.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.040]   So I don't want to become a web guru.
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.840]   You can do it on WordPress.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.840]   It's easy.
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:06.400]   It'll make it easy for your customers to find you to connect with you, to hear how you
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:07.920]   can help them.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:12.600]   Your business must have an online home and you don't have to be a web expert to do it.
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.720]   You just need WordPress.com website.
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.880]   Choose from hundreds of beautiful designs.
[00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.280]   It's got built in search engine optimization.
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.960]   It'll boost your visibility.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.960]   Social sharing is automatic.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:28.320]   So your visitors can help promote your business on their Twitter and Facebook.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.840]   You can activate other WordPress plugins for the functionality, your business needs.
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:34.080]   It's all the goodness of WordPress, but you don't have to worry about keeping it up to
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.080]   date.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.120]   You don't have to worry about keeping it secure.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.600]   They do that for you.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.400]   And with a WordPress.com plan, you can get expert support.
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.240]   You focus on your business.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.360]   They'll make your website the best.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.520]   That's what you want.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:52.040]   WordPress.com is also a community, a community of people who can help build your traffic because
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.200]   they've got a follow button on there.
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.600]   I'm a huge fan.
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.080]   It couldn't be easier.
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.080]   It's a great way to start.
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:01.640]   And because it's such a dominant platform, if you do decide, I want to hire somebody to
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.840]   help me with my site.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.360]   There are plenty of experts out there.
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:08.440]   All the software out there supports the WordPress API.
[00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.880]   It's just the king of the hill.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:10.880]   WordPress.com/twit.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:14.280]   If you go there right now, you can get 15% off any new plan purchase.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:19.720]   That's WordPress.com/twit, 15% off.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:24.680]   We thank WordPress so much, not only for supporting Twit, but for helping me keep my
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.800]   website going.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:34.240]   So Adjut Pai, chairman of the FCC, joined in on something actually I agree with.
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:37.720]   And many phones have FM radios.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:41.960]   And in other parts of the world, there's FM radios are on the phones.
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:46.840]   The carriers in the United States make these companies disable the radios if they're in
[00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:52.880]   the phones, disable the radios because they don't want people listening to free broadcast
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.880]   music.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:57.840]   They wanted to use expensive streaming services.
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.440]   That's a business model for them.
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.680]   And so the United States, most phones, even if they have the hardware, don't turn on the
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:04.680]   radio.
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:05.680]   I agree with Adjut Pai.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:09.840]   In fact, it's not just Adjut Pai, the National Association of Broadcasters and others have
[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:13.480]   said there's been a whole movement to turn these radios on.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:16.080]   They're useful, particularly in cases of emergency.
[00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.280]   Forget what the carriers want.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.840]   Forget their business model.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:19.840]   The hardware is there.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:20.840]   Turn them on.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:25.200]   Now, now, Adjut Pai said Apple should do this.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.680]   Put the safety of the American people.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:29.600]   First step up to the plate.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:33.640]   Apple is the one major phone manufacturer that's resisted doing this.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:40.680]   I hope the company will reconsider its position, activate those FM chips to which Apple responded.
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:46.440]   Apple cares a lot about our users, especially crises that we've got emergency services
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.520]   and medical ID information on the lock screen.
[00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:54.520]   We enable government emergency notifications, but iPhone 7 and 8 models do not have FM radio
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.720]   chips in them.
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.440]   Or do they have antennas to support FM signals?
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.440]   That's the key.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.640]   It's the antenna, I think.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:03.880]   You might be able to job an FM radio.
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:07.200]   Mind you, I should imagine they've built them out of the design spec fairly early, but you
[00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:12.080]   got to have the antenna to make it worse.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:14.520]   I think there's an FM radio in there.
[00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:20.080]   I'm not convinced that there isn't the hardware to do it.
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:24.440]   I understand the antenna because on all these other phones, the antenna is the headphones.
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:27.040]   Apple, of course, has no headphone jack.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.880]   That's why, notably, they mention the iPhone 7 and 8 models.
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:32.880]   You tell me that it is...
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:33.880]   So tell me that it is...
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:36.280]   You're in Britain, don't all your phones have FM radios?
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.280]   No.
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.280]   No?
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.280]   No.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:44.280]   So the way I think it works is that every FM radio is fundamentally a thing called a
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.920]   DSP or a digital signal processing...
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.160]   Yes, software radio.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:51.200]   So what is in every iPhone is a chip.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:55.360]   We usually call it the baseband modem, but a baseband modem is basically a gaggle of
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.000]   DSPs that receive the signal.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.520]   So that signal is normally 2G, 3G, 4G, LTE, LTE plus blah, blah, blah.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:08.600]   And every iteration of the iPhone includes a new version of the baseband modem chip.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:12.520]   And one of the things that I believe, now I'm not an expert here, but I believe that you
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:17.440]   can often program the baseband modem to be an FM radio because there's no difference
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:22.200]   between an FM radio signal encoded onto that chip.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.640]   You can use basically just a piece of software to decode it.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:29.440]   And then you can then use the DSP functionality.
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:34.840]   So it's possible that the baseband band chips that are in the iPhones have DSPs that are
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:38.160]   capable of being used for FM radios.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:43.520]   It does not mean that they are necessarily enabled in the chips that Apple has purchased.
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.160]   So that is they may be crippled at factory.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:49.880]   If indeed, I suspect at the volume that Apple's making those chips, they've been designed
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:55.280]   out in a custom design in the same way that the A11 bionic chip, an A10 and all that sort
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.320]   of stuff is really, really customized.
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:02.440]   You don't want to DSP in your baseband modem burning electricity.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.960]   What you probably want to do is just shut it off.
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:08.360]   So usually the way you do it is when you design the chip, you burn the links in there so that
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:11.680]   that part of the chip just gets isolated and it doesn't draw current.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:14.920]   And so it's not creating heat that you have to get rid of and it's not drawing current
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.400]   so that your battery runs down.
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:17.920]   So that's part one.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.280]   In for a lot of phones, it is true.
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:23.000]   There are DSPs that can be repurposed.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.040]   There is no guarantee that those DSPs are actually enabled or even in the silicon that
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:34.200]   Apple buys point one point two, you must have an antenna to feed the signal into the DSP.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:40.000]   Every antenna must be custom designed to receive the frequencies on which you are receiving.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.880]   So that is why in your iPhone around the top here is your 2.4 gigahertz.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:49.880]   The side down here is your 5 gigahertz and over here is your 2G3GLTE.
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:54.440]   Every Apple iPhone for the last five years has the steel band around the outside is the
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.440]   antennas.
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:59.160]   And you see these little divots around the side, the plastic bits which actually separates
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.360]   the antennas.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:04.000]   There is no antenna in here that will receive an FM signal.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.440]   Has to be a very precise, like has someone who did antenna design at university.
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:12.720]   The physics that goes into this is just mind bogglingly arcane.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:19.640]   Isn't it the case though, Greg, that many phones use their headphones, the wires in
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.640]   the headphones is antennas?
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.120]   Those are not specially designed.
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:25.080]   Well, your headphone jack has to take that signal out.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:29.360]   Apple uses the TRRS or the four way jack to be the headphone controller.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:35.120]   So you can't use it for, you know, you need to have something that's going to pull the
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:37.440]   FM signal out of that and then decode it.
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:40.920]   And that means again, there must be chips inside the phone decoding that off the headphone
[00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:41.920]   jack.
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:45.080]   I know that Apple says, Apple says seven and eight.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.840]   It doesn't mention other iPhones that it sells.
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.160]   No, I don't know.
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:53.760]   I'm not convinced that Apple's being, I think Apple may be a little disingenuous.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:56.400]   No, and then the third thing is licensing.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:00.840]   If you're using an FM radio inside the BMC, you'll probably have to pay a licensed fee
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:02.160]   for it.
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:05.280]   And because the company whose intellectual property produces those chips.
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:09.120]   And then the fourth and final thing is, of course, is there must be software in the operating
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:11.360]   system to drive the FM radios.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:16.800]   And if it's not in the operating system, if it's, you can't just suddenly turn it on because
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:21.600]   you would have to write that software and then deliver it as an over the air update.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:26.560]   So there are four, four very sound reasons as to why there would be no FM radio in any
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:30.240]   iPhone for the last five to 10 years that if ever, I don't think.
[00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:33.720]   You see also, I think Pi is kind of being slightly disingenuous about this because his
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:39.200]   whole argument is in the event of emergency, an FM radio is a really useful thing.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:44.880]   Well, yes, if you've got a dedicated, I mean, we've got an hour with quick, a kit, a hand
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.520]   crank FM radio.
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:50.200]   But if you're relying on your phone, whose battery life is probably not going to last
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:54.640]   more than about a day or so, and you've got no power to recharge it with, at the end of
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:57.400]   the day, it's just a very expensive doorstop after a day or so.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.800]   And it doesn't help save people's lives.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:03.800]   So rather than trying to mandate that, you know, handset manufacturers have to include
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:08.200]   this functionality, give people a tax credit for buying emergency radios, easiest way to
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.200]   solve this.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:14.320]   Yeah, I mean, that's ultimately it's a little bit of a tempestinity because, well, it just
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.520]   happens also to be coming out.
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:20.520]   You probably have an AM and an FM radio and you should probably have a standalone dedicated
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:21.520]   radio.
[00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:25.120]   But he's also bringing this up at just the time when he's trying to ram through the
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.480]   killing of network net neutrality.
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:30.520]   And this is a really good way of distracting from talking about those issues.
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:36.480]   Well, I remember being at the NAB show last year and broadcasters were asking Apple and
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:40.320]   other phone companies to turn on those FM radios.
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:46.240]   There's been a move to do this even prior to Adjutpie under the previous FCC commissioner.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:47.800]   Under Wheeler, huh?
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.680]   However, I mean, that makes sense.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.640]   If you can't do it, you can't do it.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:56.880]   If you're a government and you've got a citizenry who doesn't like to pay taxes and you've got
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:01.880]   an existing system that's built around FM radios to deliver emergency information, what
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:02.880]   are you going to do?
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:06.560]   Are you going to go out and start building a new emergency system to notify people that
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:07.800]   something's gone wrong?
[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:11.800]   And then you become dependent on your carriers like the government gets screwed over by Verizon
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:14.800]   and AT&T even more than it currently is.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:18.960]   So what you want to do is start saying, well, I need to use the existing stuff that's already
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.600]   bought and paid for.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:24.320]   FM radio ultimately actually requires is very good for emergency.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:25.800]   AM radio is actually much better.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:29.920]   They'd be much better off saying, let's put AM radios in because those transmitters go
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:31.880]   for hundreds and hundreds of miles.
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:35.480]   Yeah, you're not going to put an AM radio on a false, relatively low power as well.
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:37.480]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.880]   Your phone will last a lot longer.
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:40.880]   We do have AM.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:45.480]   I mean, the good news is as Apple quite rightly points out, there are now emergency notification
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.040]   systems built into phones using things like messaging and other things.
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:51.960]   On Tuesday morning, everyone in our office is phones just started.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:52.960]   It's very annoying.
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:56.040]   Yeah, they're warning us it was going to be 85 degree temperatures.
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.040]   I know.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:00.920]   I have to say people in Arizona were just like, well, you mean it's nighttime?
[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.320]   You know, it's just it's hard.
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:08.040]   I mean, I mean, the thing about FM AM is also moot because the government has already recovered
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:13.000]   most of those frequencies and then resolved them off to the carriers to use for LTE.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.720]   So the 700 megahertz range that AM was using, which is around television and stuff has already
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:18.920]   been recovered.
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:22.240]   And now they're flogging it off for billions to the telephone companies.
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:26.200]   So it's a bit disenbit generous to suddenly, you know, quite too faced really.
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.480]   I mean, there's a few things here.
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:34.240]   First of all, Adjut Pie is obviously an ignorant nut job because this is fundamental technologies.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:35.960]   I was, did you see that?
[00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:39.320]   I was really polite.
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:45.640]   And it's obviously kicking the Apple here in particular, any of the phone companies, any
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:50.360]   of the handset makers is an instant win because anything he says they can't exactly get on
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.480]   his case and make his life miserable.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:55.720]   So he's really, you know, taken a shot at somebody who can't shoot back.
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:59.440]   And the fact that Apple's responded, I think, is actually quite interesting.
[00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:02.760]   And normally they would have just ignored him and gone, you're an ass.
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:05.080]   Why am I even listening to what you're saying?
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:08.200]   And but what they've actually done as responded and just pointed out, you know, and like I
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:12.320]   said, four technical reasons that I believe any one of those four is a killer, but there's
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:16.880]   four quite reasons why there'll be no FM radio in any phone unless the government sits down
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:18.840]   and mandates them and makes it a condition.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:21.840]   And that's not going to happen in the US with the current political climate.
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:22.840]   So.
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.840]   All right.
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:26.840]   Bye.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:28.400]   Everybody should buy go on by an AM radio.
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:29.400]   You can crank.
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:32.400]   Exactly.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.400]   Shutter right here.
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:34.400]   Just, you know, you don't.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:35.400]   But you have a phone is not a good place for that.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:37.200]   You haven't got a crystal right on you.
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.200]   You made it yourself.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:39.200]   Everybody has one of those.
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:41.640]   I actually have an AM transmitter in the studio.
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:42.640]   I don't know what.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:43.640]   No, no, I know.
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:44.640]   I know.
[00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:45.640]   I'm.
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:46.640]   I'm right.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.040]   So in other words, when civilization breaks down with an expeg earthquake, we're all
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:51.520]   coming up here and starting up the new United States.
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:56.440]   Broadcasting for Petaloa.
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:57.440]   Let's see.
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:03.720]   What thoughts on this Bluetooth Wi-Fi issue in iOS 11?
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:06.280]   There is a button in iOS 11 in the control center.
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:10.440]   Would you quite logically look for it to turn off the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi radio, except
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:12.760]   it doesn't.
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.560]   It took it.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:16.960]   And even if it did, I'll introduce it off to him next morning.
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:18.800]   Apple knows best, Leo.
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:19.800]   Come on.
[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:22.600]   Shane, when you were thinking just because you bought a product, you should actually have
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:25.840]   any rights to say how it works.
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:26.840]   It's not a mistake.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:29.440]   You can, by the way, go into settings and really turn off.
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.480]   Well, you can put an app, you can put an app, like, a mode.
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:37.080]   The real big issue is that there are good security reasons why you might wish to turn
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.840]   off Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:46.880]   And if a company puts a button on their phone that says turn off Bluetooth or turn off Wi-Fi,
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:49.040]   then it should do that.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:53.360]   So if you force press the Wi-Fi button, it'll open up the Wi-Fi settings.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:54.360]   Yes.
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:56.360]   And then you could turn it off.
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.360]   Yes.
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:00.880]   So now it actually shows you a much more detailed breakdown.
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:04.960]   The reason that the Wi-Fi and the Bluetooth stays active is because you might be using
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:08.360]   the Bluetooth as a hotspot or you might be using it for an Apple.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:10.800]   But why have that button?
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:15.840]   So if you turn off Bluetooth, you're turning it off for connectivity or maybe for your,
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:20.600]   but you might want to keep it running, so if you're using Bluetooth to run your HU's,
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:25.040]   for example, your home automation system, you might want to keep that local network
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.440]   connectivity running.
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:27.440]   So what they're actually doing here.
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:31.160]   So really they're saying you're just too stupid to know why that seems to be, you might
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.160]   want to leave this on.
[00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:37.440]   So we're just going to give you a dummy button that makes you feel more ways than one.
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:38.440]   Yes.
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:42.160]   So when you turn off Bluetooth, you probably didn't mean I actually don't want to airdrop
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:46.120]   photos to my, or I don't want my watch to talk to my smart to my iPhone.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.120]   Well, maybe I did want it.
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:48.680]   I was going to say I turn off Bluetooth.
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:52.160]   I almost never have Bluetooth on on my phone.
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:55.440]   And I only have Wi-Fi on where I'm in a trusted network situation.
[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.680]   You're because you know about bad guys.
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:58.680]   You go to DevCon.
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:02.760]   If you leave Bluetooth, I mean, I was at DerbyCon last weekend in Kentucky.
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:03.760]   I can't leave your Bluetooth.
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:08.120]   I know the things these guys can do with Bluetooth is just really kind of, you should
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:13.240]   have that stuff off and lock down as a match, of course, and only turn it on when you need
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:14.240]   it.
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:18.840]   Because yeah, any kind of wallet, same with Wi-Fi up to a point, but Bluetooth, because
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:23.120]   of the complex nature of the Bluetooth stack and the amount of code that different manufacturers
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:26.160]   and different people in the SIG managed to cram in there.
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:30.160]   It's an incredibly unwieldy standard riddled with security holes.
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:35.920]   So unless you absolutely have to have it on, shut it down and also save the battery life.
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.920]   Yeah.
[00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:41.200]   Wow, that did not sound good.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.200]   Jesus.
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:44.680]   I take it you're an iPhone user, Greg Ferra.
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:50.440]   Well, I have the whole suite, the panapole of Apple stuff, just literally because the idea
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.680]   of futzing with the technology just drives me.
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:53.680]   I like to futzing.
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:54.680]   I'm a futzer.
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:51:01.240]   I don't mind futzing, but when I've got stuff to do, let's just say that the idea of trying
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:06.040]   to make my Android talk to my Windows machines just like a life shortening experience.
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:08.760]   I just don't want to go through it anymore.
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:13.440]   So the idea here is that the phone is going to do what most people would think it would
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:14.440]   do.
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:18.120]   I'm disconnecting from my Wi-Fi, but I might actually still want to talk to my watch.
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:20.760]   I'm not expecting my watch to suddenly stop working.
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:23.080]   So that's what they're trying to emulate.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.880]   Unfortunately, they didn't communicate it very well.
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:28.880]   They should have done better icon design and usability to get that transition from the
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:29.880]   old to the new.
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:31.560]   But then again, what do you expect from Apple?
[00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:36.600]   Over the years, Apple's done all those things consistently made decisions and you've just
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:37.880]   had to suck it up.
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:41.920]   So why are you whining about something that Apple's done consistently for 10 years?
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.720]   Apple knows best.
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:44.800]   What's the story with the watch?
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:50.440]   Now, the connectivity issue is kind of interesting on this new series three watches with LTE.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:54.280]   It turns out that you...
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.080]   I understand why this happened.
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:57.880]   I understand how this bug crept in.
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:01.520]   What I don't understand is why no one noticed it until they actually get it.
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:03.200]   They sold the product.
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:08.000]   But the problem is if you have a Wi-Fi...
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.920]   If you have a Wi-Fi access point that uses a captive portal and you've already logged
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:19.080]   into it on your phone, and then you reenter that place, let's say a Starbucks, minus your
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:20.080]   phone.
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:21.400]   The phone has the password.
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.080]   Your watch says, "Oh, I know this one.
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:24.560]   I can join it."
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:29.000]   And immediately loses all connectivity, including LTE, because it turns off the LTE radio to
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.280]   save battery.
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.640]   The Wi-Fi is not actually connected to anything.
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:36.640]   So you walk into a Starbucks, it sounds like a joke.
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:39.800]   And Apple Watch walked into a Starbucks and lost all connectivity.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:42.160]   This is an easy thing to fix, obviously.
[00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.040]   I'm so amazed they didn't pick it up in testing.
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:45.040]   That's what I understand.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:47.320]   Why do they not know about this?
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:48.320]   Why?
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:50.240]   Have you guys ever built a Wi-Fi network with a portal?
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:51.240]   No.
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:53.080]   This captive portal is a broken system anyway.
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:54.600]   It's a terrible idea.
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:59.040]   So there's a massive transition going on in a Wi-Fi.
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:01.520]   Up until now, we've always used HTTP portals.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:06.120]   That is, if you go to a web page, it's usually been HTTP, which is cloud text, which has
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.560]   been very easy to intercept.
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:11.600]   You just capture it, you divert it off to somewhere else, and then you type in, you use
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:15.120]   the name and password, or you hit the OK button and away you go.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:19.600]   And that means that if you're in the Apple Watch and you want to test what you used to
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:22.400]   do is send out a web request.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:25.480]   And then if the connectivity didn't work after that, you knew that there was a portal
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:26.480]   there.
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:31.720]   Everything is a transition to TLS 1.3, the new HTTPS, the security standards, no longer
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:32.720]   HTTPS.
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:35.080]   It's correctly called TLS 1.3.
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:39.880]   And if the portals are shifting, if you're trying to attach to an encrypted website for
[00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:43.480]   connectivity, then there's no way for the portals to appear.
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:45.920]   There's actually no way for a portal to be captured.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:51.640]   There is a bunch of work going on in the ITF to try and get captive portals coming up.
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:56.320]   But it's not reliable to predict whether there's a captive portal in the Wi-Fi that
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:57.400]   you've just connected to.
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:03.200]   So you can't actually know easily or reliably whether your connect, all you can do is connect
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:05.720]   to the Wi-Fi, but are you connected to the internet?
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:06.720]   How do you test that?
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.080]   And at the moment, there's not a reliable test for that.
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:10.080]   That's interesting.
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:13.160]   So my description of the bug is accurate, that that's what's going on.
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:19.120]   Your phone knew about this access and had the password, had the connectivity associated
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:22.720]   with it, but the watch with it minus the phone couldn't do anything with it.
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:28.160]   So if you go down to your favorite fast food junk store and you log in with your appropriate
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:32.120]   details and so forth, then your phone has a cookie in here that's caged to say that
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:34.840]   you've signed up to fast food portal.
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:38.560]   And next time you would turn up there, your Wi-Fi connects in a way you go.
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:42.560]   But your Apple Watch doesn't have the cookie.
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:47.200]   So the details for the wireless for the watch come from the phone.
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.960]   I'm thinking you could.
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:53.720]   I mean, so the watch knows if there's a phone present or not.
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:55:01.360]   So a watch walks into a bar, sees Wi-Fi, tries to connect, knows though that at this
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:04.200]   point it doesn't have a phone next to it.
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:06.240]   So it's a potential problem.
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:09.320]   It can't test whether there's internet access or not.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:11.520]   Should it just not join that Wi-Fi?
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:12.520]   Pretty much.
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:16.040]   Well, it's a legitimate Wi-Fi that your phone knows.
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:18.600]   It got a list of Wi-Fi that you have connected to.
[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:24.920]   The phone knows though it was a captive portal as opposed to a standard WPA or password.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:29.360]   You should be able to think that data across so that the phone knows what reliable network
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:30.360]   is.
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:34.080]   By the way, folks, if you're puzzled as I am, what we're trying to do is figure out how
[00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:35.800]   hard it would be to fix this problem.
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:37.080]   We know the problem exists.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:39.840]   How hard Apple says it's working on a fix.
[00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:43.960]   It sounds like Greg, you're saying this is actually pretty hard to fix.
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:45.840]   So there are different ways for portals to work.
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:49.400]   If you've signed on to the portal, then it might have stored the MAC address of your
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:54.440]   phone and said this MAC address is allowed to go through.
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:57.360]   It might have stored a cookie in your web browser.
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:00.480]   It might have caged some other, this is quite complex.
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:02.400]   I'm going to keep it fairly similar.
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:05.760]   There are many different ways of storing some sort of credentials to say yes.
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:10.720]   You've been to the junk shop, junk food restaurant, shall we call it?
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:13.920]   And you've signed up to the Wi-Fi and passed it all and they're going to caged that for
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:16.720]   a month or so before they force you to re-log in.
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:20.480]   Well, your iWatch, your Apple Watch connects to the Wi-Fi.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:24.040]   Wi-Fi preferred because it doesn't want to use bandwidth over the LTE.
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:27.720]   And it connects to the portal quite blindly thinking this is a perfectly legitimate Wi-Fi
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:31.680]   network, but it doesn't have any of the validation that you would see.
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:32.680]   So it's unusual.
[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:33.680]   The phone can have it.
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:38.040]   It turns in the process, it's turned off LTE and now it has no connectivity at all.
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:42.800]   It prefers to find your series three watch every time you walk into somewhere with open,
[00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:49.520]   with a captive portal Wi-Fi setup is going to fail and it's nothing we can do about it.
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:53.560]   I imagine that Apple is going to put a post-connect validation.
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:56.160]   They'll probably set up an apple.com web server.
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:57:01.360]   Well, they do now, by the way, when you get a captive portal, you go to capital, capital.appled.com.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:06.400]   Apple actually just resolves, yeah, actually does that work for you.
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.400]   It's such a broke it.
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:09.880]   The captive portal system is such a problem system.
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:13.160]   Yeah, but it's what we live with and it's everywhere.
[00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:16.200]   That's why it's a matter of concern because you leave your phone behind, which is the
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:18.800]   promise of the series three LTE watch.
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:20.280]   You should be able to do stuff with it.
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:21.920]   All of a sudden it's booked.
[00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:25.040]   You walk somewhere and it's not working anymore.
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:29.320]   So there is a working group in the ITF working on captive portals.
[00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:34.600]   I did a podcast with them, I think, about it's published somewhere in the packet pushes.
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:37.560]   We publish four shows a week, so there's an awful lot of them.
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:39.800]   It's still very early days they're working on it.
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:42.480]   There are some answers, but they're very arcane.
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:48.640]   And because of the way that TLS 1.3 is built so that nobody can man in the middle it, it's
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:50.200]   very difficult to suddenly do have to.
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:51.200]   No, I understand that.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:56.000]   So you would understand the theory behind TLS 1.3.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.360]   So all of a sudden to say, I've got to capture that and divert it to a captive portal requires
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:04.640]   some really deep cryptographic changes and that's going to take several months, maybe years
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:05.640]   of work to get started.
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:13.120]   And on our vacation we were using the Wi-Fi on this riverboat and in order to use it,
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:15.080]   it was some kind of captive portal system.
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:21.240]   But in order to use it, you would attach to the Wi-Fi and then a page would come up with
[00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:27.760]   a QR code and then you had to go to the front desk and they would scan the QR code and
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.520]   it was per device by the way.
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:31.040]   This sounds like something the French would do.
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:37.640]   And at that point they set a cookie or they did a MAC address or something and yeah, I
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:39.040]   think it was a Swiss company.
[00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:40.040]   Oh, why?
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:42.040]   Okay, the nice feeling.
[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:43.040]   Okay.
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:48.120]   And then you would be, you're okay and you can use that Wi-Fi.
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.120]   That seemed like a good system.
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:53.560]   So I guess what they're doing there, the QR code is picking up the MAC address of your
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:55.640]   Wi-Fi and by scan.
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:57.560]   And they're registering the MAC address.
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:58:58.560]   That makes sense.
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:02.000]   You know how there's like a hexadecimal character, 16 hexadecimal characters.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:03.440]   Perfect QR code, yeah.
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:07.360]   And then the front desk can just scan that and then the MAC address goes into a database
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:09.800]   and says this MAC address is permitted for 24 hours.
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:13.120]   That's easy to fix though because you could spoof MAC addresses like nobody's business.
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.320]   That's a simple thing to handle.
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:16.240]   Yeah, but the risk profile is very low.
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:17.520]   You're only holding it for a day.
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:18.520]   You're on a boat.
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:19.520]   You're in the middle of a river.
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:20.520]   You're in slobbar.
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:22.520]   You're busy drinking wine, sausage.
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:25.520]   You know, you got no time for that.
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.320]   I got no time for that.
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:28.320]   I just want to sense of Instagrams.
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:33.200]   I mean, for all the dissing on this, the watch, the new version of the watch does have something
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:35.560]   which is really quite interesting.
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:40.960]   In the last, Apple has embraced the Qi wireless charging standard because in the past it's
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:42.760]   always used wireless charging pads.
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:44.320]   It was inductive charging.
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:48.720]   Yeah, but it was the Qi standard but they bugg it around with a firmware.
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:49.720]   That's right.
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:51.840]   I remember the work with Apple products.
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:54.160]   I could use a Qi device.
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:55.360]   I can remember.
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:56.840]   It went one way but not the other.
[00:59:56.840 --> 01:00:01.280]   Yeah, you couldn't charge an Apple wireless charging device on a Qi standard charger.
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:02.280]   And now you can.
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:03.280]   They've finally embraced the standard.
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:04.280]   How will you?
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:07.720]   Because now there is a standard and there were competing standards.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:09.360]   There's PowerMat and other stuff.
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:15.560]   So just by virtue of the new iPhones and the new watches supporting Qi makes Qi it.
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.120]   A Qi basis.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:18.120]   That's good news.
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.840]   Yeah, I mean, it's already on 90% of the wireless charging.
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:23.000]   It's funny because Apple doesn't even make a Qi charger yet.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   No.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000]   Well, no, it doesn't.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   Do you have to go buy a milk and?
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.480]   One of the things.
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:29.480]   It worked but this works with everything.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.640]   It works with all my Qi charges.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:34.640]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, but somebody was on Twitter this week saying that every time the phone
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:40.280]   vibrates, it actually rotates off the Qi charger.
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.720]   Because the Qi charger is actually you've got to be just so.
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:43.720]   You have to be just so.
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:46.920]   I use a charger from Tilt that is a easel.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:47.920]   Yeah, same as me.
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.040]   It's very nice and it works perfectly.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.040]   It doesn't fall off.
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:52.040]   It doesn't vibrate off.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.560]   No, I got one of those for my Nexus and then Google stripped one is charging out of the
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.560]   mixer.
[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.560]   I know that drives you crazy.
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:58.560]   Well, let's talk.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:02.400]   Let's take a break and talk about what we expect Google will announce on Wednesday.
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.120]   I'm excited.
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:07.280]   And then sadly, October 4th was also the day.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:10.280]   Sonos said we're going to make some announcements, but I don't think it was going to.
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.280]   Nah.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.440]   They're not going to pay attention.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:15.240]   It's not quite as bad as doing your announcements on Apple Day.
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.240]   No, no.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:19.520]   Although a couple of companies did use Apple Day to borrow some bad news.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:20.520]   That's how you very bad.
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:21.520]   Yeah.
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:22.520]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:25.840]   Apple Day.
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:28.360]   Did you go to the spaceship?
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.360]   Oh, you kidding?
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:33.920]   We've been blacklisted by Apple for the last decade.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:39.560]   We had one of our journalists actually did a piece a couple of months ago where he applied
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:42.600]   to go to an Apple event seven months in advance.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:46.920]   And then we just printed out all the emails and the responses that we get from Apple.
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:50.480]   Just trying to get into it and get into a black list exists and then never going to
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:51.480]   do it.
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:52.840]   I highly recommend you read that.
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:56.440]   It's one of the few articles literally have people crying with laughter.
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:58.080]   As long as you know, Apple's pay.
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.080]   Oh, that's his.
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.080]   In advance.
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.400]   We'll take a break.
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.760]   Greg Farrow from packet pushers.net.
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:05.760]   That's the right address, right?
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:06.760]   Yeah.
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:07.760]   I see it right behind the packet pushers.net.
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:11.520]   You've got one of those little signs churches have.
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:18.440]   You need a little, you got a lot of little statements there, little, bomo's epigrams.
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:21.440]   Trust me, you can dance.
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:22.440]   It says beer.
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:23.440]   Yeah.
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:29.480]   I think you should have every time you every time we come back from a commercial, have
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.000]   something different on that little sign behind you.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.480]   You know, I've got, I had this massive passion that I would actually have lots and lots of
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.160]   different things to hang up there.
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:40.480]   And then I got all those hung up and then guess what?
[01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:41.480]   No room.
[01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:42.480]   What?
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.480]   I just stopped by.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:44.480]   I just stopped.
[01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.480]   I just stopped.
[01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:46.480]   So one day I'm going to get out.
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.680]   I designed all these myself and got them all printed.
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:49.680]   Oh, neat.
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:50.680]   So, yes.
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:53.080]   Do more of, I can't tell because your head's in front of it.
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:55.840]   Do more of what makes you happy.
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:56.840]   I like that.
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:57.840]   Yes.
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:58.840]   Dream big.
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:01.320]   Oh, these are affirmative positive messages.
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.200]   Wow, a little bit.
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.840]   When it makes losers, why play?
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:06.840]   Yes.
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:08.240]   Well, I have to think of that one.
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.240]   Think about that.
[01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:11.600]   Yeah, that was, that's my anti-corporate rant.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:12.600]   Winning losers.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:16.200]   One of the things about, you don't like the NFL either, do you?
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:17.200]   I prefer eagle.
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:19.760]   I'm not a big fan of large corporations.
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.280]   And one of the things is they always took it and say, like executives are like, crush
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:25.080]   the opposition and kill the opposition.
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:26.080]   No, no, no.
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:30.000]   I'm going like, you do realize that every time you win someone loses.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.440]   And so every time you lose a deal, you're a loser.
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:33.680]   You know that you're not a winner.
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:37.120]   And they go like, no, capitalism is not a zero sum game.
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.120]   Yeah.
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:39.120]   Well, my favorite.
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:40.120]   I love upsetting him.
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:43.320]   My favorite came from a Microsoft engineer who just had an his wall, eagles may soar,
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.680]   but weasel sells them, get sucked into jet engines.
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:50.840]   Or my favorite three turkeys doesn't make an eagle.
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:52.640]   No, I have that.
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:53.640]   Is that okay?
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:54.640]   I hadn't heard that one.
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:56.640]   Actually, I don't think I have either.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.840]   You guys just came to me again.
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:03:59.840]   It just gave me that.
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.400]   I haven't had a lot of sleep.
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:04.040]   Our show today brought to you by my mattress, man.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:08.200]   Oh man, you know what I have to say, traveling is nice.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:11.160]   One of the things I like about traveling is it's great to get home, isn't it?
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.160]   With your bed.
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:14.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:16.160]   Oh, man.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.800]   I'm going to be home on Friday evening.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:21.800]   And I'm just thinking I can't wait to lie down on my Casper.
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.480]   Oh, yes.
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:26.640]   And it was a great feeling until about two in the morning when my eyes are like, boom,
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.920]   because it's daytime in France.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:30.960]   Boom, you were missing the wine.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:32.520]   I was missing the wine.
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:34.720]   I need another bottle.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:39.480]   Casper makes these great mattresses designed and made in the United States by a team of
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:43.840]   20 engineers and perfected by a community of, well, now it's half a million, nearly half
[01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:44.840]   a million sleepers.
[01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:45.840]   I love this.
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:46.840]   I love this.
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:52.560]   Obsessive engineering makes a great mattress, not just the Casper, but the new Casper wave,
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:56.080]   which features a natural geometry support system and a new top layer.
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:00.080]   I've got the Casper wave in my house, the box.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.040]   I was so tired.
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:03.040]   I just went to bed.
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:04.040]   You slept on the boat.
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.640]   You slept on the box.
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:10.400]   But I will open it tonight and let you know how it is.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:13.960]   Casper mattress is delivered to your door and it's a surprisingly compact box.
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:16.280]   We have a King mattress in the box.
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:17.800]   Actually, we had that video.
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:19.560]   You've seen it where we open up the box.
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:22.080]   It just opens up.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.080]   It smells great.
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:25.680]   There's no, you don't have to air it out.
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:28.480]   By the way, I've had mattresses where you couldn't really sleep on them for a couple
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:29.480]   weeks.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:31.360]   You had to let them breathe.
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.360]   Not the Casper.
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.360]   I don't know what they do.
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:35.000]   They do something magical, but that's the Casper team.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.120]   There are a bunch of engineering nerds digging into the science of sleep and technology
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:44.840]   to give you an amazing mattress that delivers pressure relieving, supportive memory foam
[01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:47.800]   with a breathable open cell layer for all night comfort.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:48.800]   That's one of the things I missed.
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:49.800]   I just love it.
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:52.400]   How cool sleeping the Casper is.
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:56.880]   Casper is named Fast Company's most innovative brand of 2017.
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:01.760]   Free shipping to the US, Canada, and now the UK.
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:04.400]   I also should point out that there's free returns too.
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:05.400]   This is really important.
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:09.240]   A lot of people are reluctant to buy a mattress without lying on it first.
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:15.920]   Casper gets his prices so low because it doesn't have that network of middle people
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:20.440]   who double, triple, quadruple the cost of the mattress.
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:22.640]   That's how they keep the cost low.
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:23.640]   They don't have those showrooms.
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:25.160]   Actually, I think they have one in New York.
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:28.400]   They have a couple of them, but most people don't get to lie on it.
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:29.400]   Don't worry.
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:31.240]   You've got a 100-day trial period.
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:35.080]   That means you can sleep on that mattress for more than three months.
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:37.480]   Then then, you could say, "Yeah, maybe not."
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:39.840]   They'll get it.
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:41.840]   They will pay you back every penny.
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:44.600]   You will absolutely no cost to you.
[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.720]   Free shipping, free returns.
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.440]   There is no risk here.
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:51.520]   I guarantee you, though, you're going to love this mattress.
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:55.000]   Considering you spend a third of your life lying on it, it's important that you have
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   one you love.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.120]   That's why Casper gives you 100 nights to try their mattress out.
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:02.760]   Look at the reviews.
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:06.720]   Seriously, I get email all the time for people to say, "Thank you.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.920]   I love this mattress.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:08.920]   Man, is it affordable?
[01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:09.920]   Want to know more?

[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:26.920]   I have Casper pillows.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:27.920]   Casper dog.
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:28.920]   They make dog beds.
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:29.920]   They're really nice.
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.440]   They have a Casper dog, then, for a second.
[01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:33.440]   Although, I really is branching out to you.
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:34.440]   I need a Casper dog.
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:36.160]   Actually, our dog passed away.
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:37.160]   I don't have the Casper.
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:38.160]   I'm so sorry.
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:39.160]   I know.
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:41.160]   I don't have the Casper bed anymore.
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:44.200]   It was nice for Aussie.
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:45.960]   Casper.com/twit.
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:54.360]   What are we going to get here with this new Pixel?
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:56.440]   I am actually excited.
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.600]   There are a number of phones I'm very interested in.
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:59.760]   Of course, the iPhone 8.
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.920]   The essential phone was very exciting until I got it.
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:09.040]   Well, it's not bad except the camera is just broken.
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:12.160]   I launched the camera app and I thought, "Oh, they must have fixed it by now.
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.720]   They took long enough to get it out to me.
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.280]   They shipped it."
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:18.640]   It immediately rebooted the phone.
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:22.720]   The next time it just froze it, so they're getting better.
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:24.200]   Although, I've had-
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:27.160]   It's on my desk, John, which essential is not in this box.
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.360]   He brought me the box.
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:33.000]   I opened it up and it's gone.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.160]   I think it's on my desk.
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.640]   It's very pretty.
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:39.160]   Are you running Oreo on any of your phones at the moment?
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:41.400]   Yeah, I'm running Oreo on my Pixel.
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:43.040]   I'm running on my Pixel.
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:46.120]   I'm getting a reboot once every two days.
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.120]   Spontaneous reboot.
[01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.120]   I have not on my Pixel.
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.920]   I can't work out whether it's a third party app or whether it's-
[01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:52.480]   Actually, that's a feature on Samsung phones.
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:53.480]   There's a setting.
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:55.960]   I kid you not to reboot every night.
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:09:00.760]   You know why, right?
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:04.080]   Because it'll crash if you don't.
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:05.080]   I turned that on.
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:06.080]   Reboot every night.
[01:09:06.080 --> 01:09:08.360]   How much did you pay for that experience?
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:09.800]   Oh, $830.
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:10.800]   Why?
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.800]   It doesn't want to sleep.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:17.240]   How the hell can you pay $830 for a faulty product?
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:19.840]   Then smile and tell me that it's actually okay.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:22.440]   Hey, Windows 95, you had to reboot every day.
[01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:23.440]   What's the big deal?
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:29.360]   Yeah, but there's a reason why we remember Windows 95 as a really lousy operating system.
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:32.520]   Do you think that's an Android flaw or a Samsung flaw?
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:36.880]   Windows 95 was still a hell of a lot better than Linux or PICOS or a whole bunch like
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:40.160]   those- Those fighting words, Greg, and I'm not going to take them.
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:42.400]   How are the operating systems of the days?
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.080]   They were a hell of a lot worse.
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:45.360]   Essential phone has the notch too.
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:49.960]   I have to say, even though it's a teeny-weeny notch, I don't like it.
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:55.480]   I'm really worried about this notch in the iPhone X, which is big.
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:56.480]   Why?
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:57.480]   Why not?
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:05.800]   I don't believe it was dropped, but these are crack right there in the glass.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:07.920]   This is supposed to be titanium and serum.
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:10.000]   Anyway, not selling that well.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.320]   That's the essential phone.
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:12.320]   So then the Note 8 comes.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.320]   I'm excited.
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:14.320]   It's got a stylus.
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:16.600]   It reboots every night just like it's supposed to.
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:22.080]   This must control fist of death.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:23.680]   You know, it's got a beautiful screen.
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:25.680]   But how often do you actually use the stylus?
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:26.680]   I'm genuinely-
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:27.680]   Absolutely never.
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:32.960]   But if I ever were to go to a bar and want to get a young lady's phone number, instead
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:36.160]   of putting in a soggy napkin, I could just whip out my nobody.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:38.160]   Don't cut a bars you're going to.
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:39.160]   I'd never say.
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:41.160]   Would you mind giving me your phone now?
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:45.800]   You know, you really need to have- Your teenage children mustn't have taught you exactly
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:48.640]   how they do it this day as it's called airdrop or texting.
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:49.640]   Or Tinder.
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:50.640]   Why would you?
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:51.640]   Yeah.
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:52.640]   Yeah.
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:56.640]   If you're going to swap phone numbers, it's not going to be using it.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.640]   It's a fantasy.
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:02.680]   I might, you know, in fairness back when I was growing up, it was lipstick on the chest.
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.680]   You know, the number was- Oh, look at that.
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:06.160]   It's very, very romantic.
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:10.520]   There was a really unfortunate trend in London for a while of people using the receipt slips
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:11.520]   from their ATM.
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:14.600]   And what they would do is check a load of money into their account.
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:15.600]   Oh, smart!
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.600]   Yeah, so they have $80,000 in my account.
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:18.600]   Transfers and like that.
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:19.600]   Yeah, here's my number.
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.640]   And the minute it's turned over, whoo, he's got a lot of money in his account.
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:23.640]   Yeah, he's a rich bloke.
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:25.960]   Then we got the iPhone 8 Plus.
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:29.680]   I like, actually I like the white or silver, I guess it is.
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.520]   It's okay, but it's a bit meh, you know.
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:33.880]   It's meh, it's just like the, you know, I liked it.
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:34.880]   It's a good camera.
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:37.760]   It's very much like the 7 Plus, like the wireless charging.
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.480]   Glassback, that's going to break right away.
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:40.480]   Yeah.
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:42.520]   Gonna break right away.
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:45.840]   But I'm still waiting, I'm interested in the LG V30.
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:46.840]   Mm-hmm.
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:47.840]   Good, good report to that.
[01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:51.640]   They put the, they have a fingerprint sensor and they put it in a sensible spot.
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:53.840]   Right in the back and the middle, like, same as a pixel.
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:54.840]   Yeah.
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.760]   It has a headphone jack, I believe.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:01.160]   I am going to be very mad if the pixel, uh, X2 does not have a headphone jack.
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:03.480]   I'm going to be furious, particularly if they can't justify it.
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:06.160]   Because one of the reasons I want to go to this is to get courage.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.160]   I have not yet.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.160]   It's courage.
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:11.480]   Had a reliable answer as to why the jack has to go.
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:12.840]   Well, that's my point.
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:17.160]   If you can put a jack in a Note 8, which is jammed with technology.
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.160]   Yeah.
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:21.360]   And, and, you know, there's enough real estate to put a jack in there.
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:22.360]   Why can't Apple?
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:23.360]   I know.
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:24.360]   I know.
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.360]   I have two reasons.
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.360]   Oh, okay.
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:27.360]   What a proof.
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:28.360]   You can't hit IP68.
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:29.520]   This is IP68.
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:30.520]   This is IP68.
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:31.520]   Yeah, sure.
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:35.360]   Well, I'm going to drop it in a bucket of water.
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:36.600]   Let's see how it's going to go.
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:37.760]   I mean, it already doesn't work.
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:39.200]   You might as well drop it in a bucket of water for you.
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:40.200]   It works.
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.200]   It's not only that.
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:42.200]   It's not like it's going to go.
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:43.200]   It's going to go.
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:44.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:45.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:49.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:50.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.200]   I know it's going to go back to the side.
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:54.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:55.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:56.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:57.200]   I know it's going to go back to the side.
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:58.200]   I know it's going to go back to the side.
[01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:05.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:08.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:09.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:10.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:12.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:13.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:15.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:16.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:17.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:18.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:19.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:20.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:24.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:29.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:36.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:43.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:50.200]   It's going to go back to the side.
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:55.200]   You're asking for a 3.5mm jack with a TRRS.
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:14:01.200]   You're asking for this much space inside of the phone.
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:04.200]   When you break the outside of this thing,
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:07.200]   just getting the speakers in is okay because all you're doing
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:10.200]   is emptying out the drilling small holes in the stainless steel
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:11.200]   outer rim.
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:14.200]   It does make a big difference to the manufacturing
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.200]   and the structural integrity of the device.
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:19.200]   You say Apple has not said that because that's the first compelling argument I've heard.
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:21.200]   They said we needed the space.
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:22.200]   That's what they said.
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.200]   That's the problem guy having people who have got liberal arts degrees
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:26.200]   writing about technologies in the world.
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:29.200]   But also coming back to your waterproof point,
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:33.200]   it's not a really big selling point for most Apple buyers.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.200]   Also, I'm going to play Devil's Advocate here.
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:37.200]   If you drop your phone into a bucket of water,
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:39.200]   you deserve to lose the bloody thing.
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:41.200]   It's just like...
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:45.200]   You've never walked like a gotten rained on and then had your phone ruined
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:47.200]   because it got wet in your pocket.
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:49.200]   You had to walk through the rain for 30 minutes.
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:53.200]   You've never lived in a tropical country like Australia or Philippines.
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:54.200]   I'm from Britain.
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:59.200]   I moved to California which has pretty much the same weather in the Bay Area.
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:04.200]   Apparently your personal experience is a representative of the entire global population.
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.200]   No, we've got about 5-6 million readers.
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:10.200]   Just tell me that you've never had this problem.
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:13.200]   From your experience that nobody else ever has.
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:15.200]   No, no, no, because I teach sailing in the Bay.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:17.200]   A lot of people take their phones out there.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:19.200]   Even those people will say,
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.200]   "I'm not trusting a manufacturer's waterproof racing.
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:23.200]   I'm getting a waterproof case."
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.200]   Actually, that's the truth.
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:27.200]   Just as you were saying, Greg, about the so-called IP68 rating,
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:30.200]   which I have no reason not to believe on the Note 8,
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:33.200]   you're still not going to take a chance, are you?
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:35.200]   No, you're going to be able to get a case for a race.
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:37.200]   They're not waterproof down to 30 meters.
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.200]   They never have been.
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.200]   If you're going down to 30 meters, it's bugga dead.
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:43.200]   How are you going to get it back?
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:44.200]   I'm going to get a say.
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:46.200]   Bell diving home and on it.
[01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.200]   I'm going down to get my phone.
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:51.200]   You should be able to sit in your pocket and get the rain for an hour.
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:53.200]   And it'll survive.
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.200]   That's the point of the IP16 rating.
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:56.200]   So.
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:58.200]   I know it's down here somewhere.
[01:15:58.200 --> 01:15:59.200]   You know what?
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:03.200]   That's what happens to real people sitting at bus stops waiting for buses to come by
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:05.200]   and pick them up and take them to work.
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:07.200]   Which brings me on to my point.
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.200]   Have you seen Google's new connected jacket?
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:12.200]   Oh, you've got only washed 10 times.
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:15.200]   It's the most pathetically useless weight of technology.
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:16.200]   You have 300 years.
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:18.200]   Well, it's a proof of concept.
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:22.200]   No, I think honestly, if I saw somebody wearing one of those jackets,
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:26.200]   I would be immensely useful because you know they've got a more money than sense,
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:29.200]   no fashion style and zero.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:32.200]   Fewer people are going to buy this than the essential phone.
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:35.200]   I don't actually think this is actually meant to sell.
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:36.200]   No, it's not.
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:37.200]   I think this is one of those.
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:40.200]   You know, it's meant to suck in all the idiots who have the liberal arts degree
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:43.200]   people who ride at various media sites around the world as if,
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:45.200]   because they can understand it, right?
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:50.200]   So this is, you know, this is Google's, is this their thread technology or no,
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:51.200]   it's jacquard.
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:53.200]   It's a connected apparel platform.
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:54.200]   Goodness.
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:58.200]   And it's, I guess, what do you do with it?
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:16:59.200]   Why is it connected?
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:01.200]   There's buttons on the jacket that you can.
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:03.200]   Fast forward your iPod.
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:06.200]   What they've done is put some threads in the cuff.
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:11.200]   And if you swipe down across the threads, they electrostatically pick up your fingers.
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:17.200]   And certain of these actions can be translated via an app on your phone to do things like play music,
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:20.200]   fast forward, rewind, answer, and this is better.
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:21.200]   Why?
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:22.200]   It's not.
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:23.200]   It's stupid.
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:27.200]   This is clearly a technology in search of a problem.
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.200]   Yeah.
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:32.200]   And you mentioned it because it's so stupid that we should just tell it say it's stupid and move right along.
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:33.200]   It's $350.
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:35.200]   And you can only watch it 10 times.
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:38.200]   And then if on time 11, it stops working.
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.200]   I mean, we've had so much time.
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:41.200]   We had a CES.
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:46.200]   They had an internet connected hairbrush, which would monitor the number of strokes saying,
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:52.200]   "No, no, no, whether your hair was wet or dry as though you'd never mirror in front of you when you were doing this."
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:56.200]   But isn't this the way it is that you've got to try all these things and see what it is?
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:02.200]   Well, here look, for example, Amazon, which announced a variety of Echo devices this week,
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:07.200]   which it really looks like they're just throwing crap at the wall to see what sticks.
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:08.200]   It doesn't--
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:09.200]   Quite literally in this case.
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.200]   Yes.
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:11.200]   There's a--
[01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:12.200]   Let's say, yeah.
[01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:13.200]   Have you seen Amazon's website?
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:15.200]   It looks exactly like somebody threw stuff at the water.
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:16.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.200]   So we've got a--
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:18.200]   That's ugly.
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:22.200]   --the Echo Spot, which on the surface looks like a good idea.
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:24.200]   It's kind of round and adorable.
[01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:25.200]   It's an alarm clock.
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:26.200]   It's a little bit of a green.
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:27.200]   You put it by your bed.
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:29.200]   You know what time to get up with the weather is going to be like.
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.200]   You can listen to music.
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:31.200]   And how handy.
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:33.200]   It has a camera in it.
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:35.200]   Yeah, because that's what I really want.
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:36.200]   I've looked at my bed.
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:37.200]   It's just--
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:38.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:41.200]   --particularly with a kind of lousy technology that these things--
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:44.200]   a lousy security technology these things have in.
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:45.200]   And just--
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:46.200]   Mm-hmm.
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:47.200]   Why is the camera in there?
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:48.200]   Did they say?
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:49.200]   I was--
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:52.200]   I was away when this announcement came out.
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:53.200]   To feature.
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:54.200]   You know, we can't question the people.
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:55.200]   Do you think--
[01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:59.840]   I mean, do you think they're really kind of nefarious and they just really want to put
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:01.200]   cameras everywhere so they can just--
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:02.200]   They're not going to spy on you.
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:08.200]   No, I think it's a low cost add-on that you can put in there and make people think that
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:09.200]   you're getting more for your money.
[01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:10.200]   I ordered one.
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:11.200]   And, you know--
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:12.200]   --mediately.
[01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:18.200]   --nine times out of ten, the security on these things is disastrously bad.
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:19.200]   It just--
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:23.200]   We don't know what we should say of any issues with people--
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:24.200]   With this particular camera--
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:26.200]   You don't know what we're turning on the camera, I think.
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:30.760]   Last weekend I was in a presentation being given at the DerbyCon hacking conference and
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:36.200]   there's like a million-- just one manufacturer has spuffed out a million IP connected cameras.
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:39.200]   A lot of these cameras are terribly easy to hack.
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:40.200]   Yeah.
[01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:43.200]   You know, it just takes a couple of packets and that's it.
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:44.200]   You're in.
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:45.200]   So when you're supposed to--
[01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:47.200]   Ironically, this was the best product.
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.200]   Yeah.
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:52.200]   That Amazon announced-- they also announced a product-- I don't understand it all.
[01:19:52.200 --> 01:20:00.200]   A $35 box called the Echo Connect that turns your Echo into a landline phone, but it requires,
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.200]   guess what?
[01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:04.200]   A landline Jack!
[01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:05.200]   Yeah.
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:08.200]   So as far as I can tell, it's a speaker phone.
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:12.200]   You should imagine the planning meeting went very-- it was held in a pub or something because
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:14.200]   you know, that's the only way you can get it and get that stuff.
[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.200]   It's got a back-- a jack on the back.
[01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:17.200]   It's an RJ45.
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:18.200]   Where was it?
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:19.200]   RJ11, right?
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:20.200]   It's RJ11.
[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:23.200]   It's like you were the phone line.
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:27.200]   So I think what's happening here is that Amazon's, you know, A, throwing spaghetti at the wall and seeing
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:28.200]   what sticks.
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:29.200]   Yeah.
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:33.200]   What you also need to know is that Amazon has a service called Chime, which is a Slack-type
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:37.200]   functionality, and they also have another one which is a unified communications, which is
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:38.200]   an IP to left-neaservice.
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:44.200]   So first of all, you get these boxes into people's homes, you give them video cameras and speakers,
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:48.200]   then you play music on them, then you get them used to having video cameras wherever they
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:53.200]   are, you get them to start using these for telephone calls to communicate over Echo, and
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:57.200]   then Amazon can come back to a smartphone and maybe round that out.
[01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:59.200]   So there's a few different agendas going on here.
[01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:04.200]   One, if you can get them connected to the landline, you can get them to start using an Amazon
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:07.200]   service, IP to left-neaservice, instead of using the landline.
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:12.200]   Oh, they did turn that feature on as well that you can call a phone directly from your
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:16.200]   Amazon Echo, giving it parity sort of with the Google home.
[01:21:16.200 --> 01:21:20.200]   But only in the US where the telco rules are set up, because in the US the way that it
[01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:24.200]   works is the caller and the receiver both pays for the call.
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:29.200]   So that means that in the US it's possible for Amazon to make money by calling people.
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:30.200]   What?
[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:31.200]   Yeah.
[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:34.200]   So they actually can get a profit deal.
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:35.200]   Yeah.
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:36.200]   Yeah.
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:38.200]   If they make a call, then they get money out of that.
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:39.200]   Wow.
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:43.200]   So that's how all of the free conferencing services in the US work, because everybody calls in
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:46.360]   the conference service and they make money out of it by charging you to call into their
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:48.200]   service just from the telephone call.
[01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:51.200]   They also announced the Echo button.
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:52.200]   Yeah.
[01:21:52.200 --> 01:22:02.320]   Um, they're hockey puck shaped devices that cost $20 and they have colors and they light
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:03.320]   up.
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:05.200]   It's kind of looks like the staples easy button.
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:06.200]   Yeah.
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:07.200]   But it does something.
[01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:10.200]   This is the big weakness with this.
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:14.760]   The big weakness with these devices is that they have to be slaved off a main of a full
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:15.760]   echo.
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:17.560]   So you can't just use them a lot.
[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:19.120]   But what am I going to do?
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:23.200]   So all Amazon says, well, you could play trivia games with it.
[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:24.200]   Great.
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:25.200]   Yeah.
[01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:28.360]   You know, we have a toddler next door who can do that as well and doesn't cost money
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:29.360]   quits.
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:36.000]   It doesn't feel like there's a unified strategy here, but maybe you've come up with one, Greg.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:41.000]   You just, they just want to have sensors everywhere in your, in your environment.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.600]   What I think what they're doing is trying to immunize the customer base to get used to
[01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:50.000]   the fact that there's an echo everywhere that you could talk to your Alexa thing.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000]   Okay.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   You've played with these.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000]   Both of you have.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000]   This is the buttons we use for the game.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000]   The game of gigs.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000]   It looks exactly.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:03.800]   In fact, it's indistinguishable from an echo spot.
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:09.480]   The probably, yeah, probably the same whiteless manufacturer.
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:11.840]   It's the me first game show buzzer.
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:12.840]   Yes.
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:17.800]   So I think they're immunizing the customer base again, having these in the house that
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:21.240]   you talk to an echo, wherever it might be, where there's an echo in the wherever.
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:22.240]   I love it.
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:23.240]   I don't want to live with that.
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:24.240]   I miss Deco.
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:26.040]   Well, see, I refuse to have them in the house.
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:28.040]   Oh, I have them everywhere.
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:32.280]   When do you stand on the, on Greg, this on Greg's, we've got full time user, complete
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:33.280]   boycott.
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.480]   Where are you on this?
[01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:39.960]   If I could get Siri to actually answer a query intelligently, I might actually use it.
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:43.880]   Why would you prefer Siri if it doesn't work?
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:44.880]   I don't prefer Siri.
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:46.360]   Oh, I just don't like them.
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.040]   I'm not a big fan of the speaking things.
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:50.680]   I'd rather have an apple.
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:53.600]   You trust Apple, but you don't trust Amazon or.
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.160]   I do like Apple's privacy policy.
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:59.240]   So they're very upfront about the fact that we don't keep your data infinitely, whereas
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:05.560]   Amazon absolutely is mining everything that I ask them or would send to them to haul products
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:09.040]   at me and make me spend more money with them and love.
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.040]   I'm curious.
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:13.120]   Do you really think that Apple's not data mining you?
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:16.880]   I believe that at a fundamental level, they're not.
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:20.320]   That doesn't mean that they're not extracting data about you at various levels, but they're
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:24.360]   not doing it to the extreme that Google Amazon Facebook are.
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:29.160]   Boy, I mean, I have no evidence more than the other, but I actually find that hard to
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:30.160]   believe.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:31.160]   I don't know.
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:35.160]   I think that does make a level of extensive because they wouldn't get as much value out
[01:24:35.160 --> 01:24:37.240]   of it as Amazon or Google would.
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:38.240]   That's true.
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:41.680]   But I am finding, particularly with Google and the later builds of Android, they're getting
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:46.120]   really, really pushy about the amount of data that not only are they taking, which they're
[01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:47.280]   pushing out to you.
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:50.680]   But that's one of the reasons there's many, but that's one of the reasons Siri is less
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:54.120]   functional because they don't know anything.
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:56.520]   They have less context and they have to train.
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:57.680]   So they're not keeping the training data.
[01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:58.680]   They also have less training.
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:24:59.680]   Right.
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:00.680]   They have less information.
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:01.680]   Yeah.
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:05.980]   But Apple's been, so for example, with FaceTime and the iPhone 10 that's shipping, the Face
[01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:08.580]   data never leaves the phone.
[01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:12.160]   So they're not shipping that up to the cloud and storing it and analyzing it to improve
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:13.160]   FaceTime.
[01:25:13.160 --> 01:25:15.160]   The FaceTime data never leaves the phone.
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:17.800]   They said that and I'm glad because that's kind of a requirement.
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:22.480]   We just learned that Russia has decided to use Face recognition on all of its many thousands
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:23.720]   of cameras all over the across the ground.
[01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:27.800]   You can't go, but it's been trialing it as well with very poor results.
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:31.120]   But Face recognition is a solved problem, isn't it?
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:32.120]   No.
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:33.120]   No, no.
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:34.120]   It's going to waste to go.
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:35.120]   Oh, I thought they were pretty good at it.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:37.040]   It's about 90% accurate today.
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:38.040]   Getting up.
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:39.040]   Yeah.
[01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.040]   It's not.
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:42.400]   When the false positive leads to getting cuffed and thrown in the back of a van.
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:43.400]   Well, that's a good point.
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:44.400]   And it's kind of...
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:45.400]   You kind of want to be 100% accurate.
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:46.400]   Yeah.
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:47.400]   In the case like that.
[01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:51.400]   But the way they say it is that starting at 90% accuracy and iterating over the next
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:52.400]   positive changes.
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:53.400]   And it's better than a human.
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:54.400]   That's right.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:57.200]   I mean, what they've been doing now is they have humans looking at these screens going,
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:58.200]   "I think I recognize him.
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:25:59.200]   I don't know.
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:00.200]   Maybe it looks like...
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.200]   It's so...
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:02.200]   No, I don't know.
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:03.200]   Is that you, so I guess?
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.200]   It's like...
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:05.200]   Yeah.
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:06.200]   I think it's you.
[01:26:06.200 --> 01:26:10.560]   So one of the best airport security systems in the world is in Israel because they've had
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:12.040]   that much practice.
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:13.040]   Right.
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:14.040]   And they don't go on facial recognition.
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:16.200]   They don't go on biometrics.
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:21.240]   But by the time you get from the airport door to the plane, you will have met two or three
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:22.240]   people.
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:23.240]   It works very well too.
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:24.240]   It works very well too.
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:28.280]   Yeah, body language signals that you are under stress or that there is something going on
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:29.280]   there.
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:30.280]   And it works.
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:34.640]   There's a reason why flight don't get hijacked because they take it seriously.
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:38.400]   We've got the dreaded SSSS on our tickets.
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:39.400]   Oh, no.
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:40.400]   It's really the E-Thrope for the United States.
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:41.400]   And that means you're...
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:43.400]   Welcome to the shoulder marigolds.
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:48.080]   You've been selected for a secondary security search.
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:49.080]   Which means right...
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:51.200]   Oh, that process really works then, doesn't it?
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:52.200]   That's great.
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:53.200]   Yeah.
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:54.200]   I'm just...
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:57.240]   The eight of us who were selected were sitting here going, "Huh."
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:01.000]   But it's funny because the Brits who were doing it said, "Yeah, the Yanks are making
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000]   us do this."
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000]   They didn't care.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.920]   What do we got to do this for America?
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:07.920]   And...
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:08.920]   For freedom.
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:09.920]   Freedom.
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:10.920]   Freedom.
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:12.920]   And I was very proud because one of the other passengers said, "Yeah, it's a security
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:13.920]   theater."
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:15.560]   I thought, "Well, the message is getting through."
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:16.560]   It is.
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:17.560]   It is.
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:18.560]   Message is getting through.
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:20.160]   Amazon has a new echo.
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:21.160]   Plus?
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:22.160]   Cut.
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:23.160]   It's busy.
[01:27:23.160 --> 01:27:24.920]   Busy, busy, busy.
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:29.600]   That looks a lot like the HomePod, Apple's competing device.
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:31.600]   What a surprise.
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.400]   Is lower cost, of course.
[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:36.360]   Yeah, I mean, Amazon's done a lot to drive this market.
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:41.280]   It's a logical step for them, but it just, you know, how many of these things do you
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:42.280]   have in your house?
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:43.280]   How about this?
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:46.600]   Do you want Alexa in your BMW?
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:47.600]   You will.
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.360]   Starting next year?
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:50.840]   Yeah.
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:54.560]   There are many, many more reasons to buy a BMW than Alexa.
[01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:56.520]   Yeah, it's got...
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:57.520]   Engineering.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:03.080]   If you get Android Auto or Apple's CarPlay in your car, and many cars in our sport is,
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:07.360]   don't you get the voice assistant that goes with the respective platforms or no?
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:09.240]   You can't use Siri on carplay?
[01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:14.480]   If I'm spending $70,000 on a car, it'd better have more than Alexa in it.
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:17.560]   That'd better be a car in there.
[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:18.560]   That's an expensive...
[01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:21.600]   No, no, but I mean, you buy a BMW with the engineering.
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:28.200]   I test drove the latest Ford Mustang recently, and it had build quality that make a BMW's
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:29.200]   engineers fist-sitch.
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:32.240]   I mean, the door panels weren't aligned properly.
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:36.520]   Acceleration was ludicrous, but it couldn't corner for anything.
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:40.000]   There are reasons you buy a BMW and I'm not sold on Alexa is going to be a major.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.160]   Are you a BMW fan?
[01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:42.160]   I think you are.
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:44.240]   I grew up with them, yes.
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:45.240]   Ah.
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:46.240]   If I could afford one now, I don't.
[01:28:46.240 --> 01:28:47.240]   But I...
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:48.240]   It's slight bias.
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:51.440]   I went instead for the economy version of Ball of Prius, which is...
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:53.360]   So, we were excited about...
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:58.360]   Actually, I'm not that excited, but now that I'm seeing the reviews, I'm getting excited
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:00.240]   about Blade Runner 2049.
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:01.240]   The reviews are great.
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:02.240]   The reviews are really good.
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:04.760]   I thought, Ryan Gosling, this is a bad...
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:07.120]   So exciting, so exciting.
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:11.680]   We've seen all the shorts, and then they've released a bunch of...
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:12.920]   The director's talking about it.
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:19.600]   There's a pre-short with Jared Leto lining up the transition from the previous movie to
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:24.720]   the new one, and then there was a 15-minute anime release this week, padding out more
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:28.160]   of the storyline about what happened in the gap between the two movies.
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:31.840]   So, if you're a real Blade Runner fan, get out there onto the YouTube Warner Brothers
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:32.840]   and watch more.
[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:33.840]   And I am.
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:34.840]   You'll be just like so excited.
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:35.840]   Yeah.
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:36.840]   Very excited.
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:38.000]   Watch it on the biggest screen possible, apparently.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.880]   All the reviews I'm seeing are saying basically it's such a visually stunning film.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:45.280]   That you want to get really, really big screen.
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:47.080]   But Ryan Gosling.
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:48.080]   Yeah.
[01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:49.400]   He's not that bad, huh?
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:51.280]   Yes, he is.
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:53.560]   Look at him.
[01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:55.760]   It's as bad as Keanu Reeves.
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:56.760]   It's...
[01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:57.760]   Okay.
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:58.760]   I know Kung Fu.
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:29:59.760]   Yeah.
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:00.760]   Whoa.
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:01.760]   Like the shorts that we've seen.
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:02.760]   I mean, just look at the color.
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:03.760]   Are you a red look at the man?
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:04.760]   Oh, dude.
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:05.760]   Oh, is that Jared Leto?
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:06.760]   Yeah.
[01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:07.760]   It's creepy.
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:11.800]   But yeah, for once, they're going to do a reboot, which doesn't take a massive dump
[01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:12.800]   on my childhood.
[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:14.480]   And I'm ecstatic about this.
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:15.480]   Yeah.
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:16.480]   If it's good, then fine.
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:19.960]   Because after what they've been doing with the Alien franchise, and let's not mention
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:23.400]   Star Wars, there was only the original three films, nothing else matters.
[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:25.560]   You guys Star Trek Discovery fans?
[01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:27.240]   I haven't seen it yet.
[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:28.240]   I'm not going to get...
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:33.800]   I don't want to get hooked because I don't want to pay CBS whatever it costs to get CBS
[01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:34.800]   all access.
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:35.800]   Yeah, I think it was on Australia.
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:36.800]   You have to buy it.
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:39.880]   Yes, to boldly stream that no person ever wanted to stream before.
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:42.880]   You could boldly stream it on Netflix in the UK.
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:43.880]   Really?
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:44.880]   Yeah.
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:47.880]   Oh, that sounds like a thing.
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:51.200]   To boldly stream where no man has streamed before.
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:52.400]   It sounds like a...
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:53.400]   Star Trek.
[01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:55.040]   Something happens behind a bar.
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:56.040]   So exciting.
[01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:57.040]   So exciting.
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:58.200]   All right.
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:00.200]   This is the one that excites me.
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:01.200]   Amazon, back to Amazon.
[01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:03.840]   Good thing we're not hearing the same studio, mate.
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:04.840]   Because we're all on the phone.
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:05.840]   This is right.
[01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:09.640]   They're going to make a TV show placed on one of my favorite sci-fi novels, Neil
[01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:10.640]   Stevenson's "Snow Crash".
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:12.040]   How about that?
[01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:16.160]   It's either going to go reasonably well or catastrophically badly.
[01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:17.160]   And I love that book.
[01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:18.160]   Oh.
[01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:19.160]   Now, don't get me wrong.
[01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:20.160]   Great book.
[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:23.080]   It's good for serialization as well because Neil Stevenson can't do endings for toffee.
[01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:24.080]   I know.
[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:25.080]   It's such a funny thing.
[01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:26.080]   I agree with you.
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:27.080]   Yeah.
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:31.040]   This has the best first chapter of any book I've ever read since the tale of two cities.
[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:32.040]   But it has the worst ending.
[01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:33.040]   Oh, I know.
[01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:34.040]   It just papers off.
[01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:36.040]   It's just dire.
[01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:39.600]   But everybody should read it because the metaverse...
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:45.800]   ...described in "Snow Crash" is really, I think, powering all of this ARVR nonsense.
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:46.800]   People are trying to recreate it.
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:47.800]   And I wish they would.
[01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:53.360]   I'm ready to plug it into the back of my brain and go into, you know, a special space.
[01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:55.760]   Hey, I'd get wet wear as long as it's pretty bright.
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:32:00.080]   But, I mean, the "Snow Crash" was, you know, it was a very pivotal book, particularly in
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:03.200]   terms of how Silicon Valley saw these things.
[01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:07.720]   You know, there were reports of, you know, somebody coming into a VC's office throwing
[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:11.760]   down a copy of "Snow Crash" and saying that's our business plan, which is probably a good
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.680]   idea not to fund them, but still.
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:15.360]   But it's a really great book.
[01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:16.360]   It starts off strong.
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:17.360]   It's got lots of plots.
[01:32:17.360 --> 01:32:18.360]   The first chapter.
[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:19.360]   The first chapter.
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:20.360]   It's read the first chapter.
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:21.360]   Yeah.
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:22.360]   Pizza delivery girl on the skateboard.
[01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:23.360]   Yeah.
[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:24.360]   Great chapter.
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:25.360]   It moves.
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:29.280]   But unfortunately, Hollywood has a way of mucking up science fiction.
[01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:31.800]   Well, it's always been my opinion.
[01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:34.640]   Science fiction is always better when you're reading it because you have a much higher
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:37.960]   budget in your brain than any Hollywood spectacular, right?
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:38.960]   Yeah.
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:43.840]   It's much harder to create this for real than what you see in your mind.
[01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:44.840]   Let's take a break.
[01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:45.840]   Come back.
[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:50.800]   There's lots more to talk about, including, is it all over for Silicon Valley?
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:53.160]   Are they, Greg Ferra wants to talk about this?
[01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:54.160]   Is the end of the line?
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:59.560]   It's the end of the line for Silicon Valley, as some say.
[01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:02.000]   They might have to pay tax.
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.720]   Yeah.
[01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:04.720]   Good luck on that.
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:05.720]   Greg Ferra is here.
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:06.720]   The packet pushers net.
[01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:08.760]   You got to listen to the packet pushers podcast.
[01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:09.840]   They're fabulous.
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:16.520]   Ethereal mind of the Twitter, which is, I guess, a play on ethernet and the ethereum,
[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:17.520]   or I don't know.
[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:18.520]   What is it?
[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:22.520]   Well, you know, back in the day, ethereal, the idea was that there was a spiritual aspect
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:24.360]   to the being ethereal and the mind.
[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:25.880]   So it was meant to be spiritual mind.
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:26.880]   Oh.
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:29.640]   And then it was a double play on words because there used to be a thing called ethereal,
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:30.800]   which was a packet sniffer.
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:31.800]   Yes.
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:32.800]   So I'm a networking computer.
[01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:33.800]   I'm a network engineer.
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:34.800]   Oh, I get it.
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:40.560]   And so it was sort of meant to be a play between spiritual mind and packet, my brain.
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:43.960]   And some along the line, I've long since forgotten which one of those it is.
[01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:46.520]   And now it's just become a handle.
[01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:47.520]   That's the problem.
[01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:48.520]   Yeah.
[01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:53.520]   There are Genesis so far in the past that now it's just a random set of letters.
[01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:54.960]   What is your handling?
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:34:00.760]   Oh, like on, if you went in IRC or my, I'm not your hacker name.
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:03.920]   I'm not sure I should say that because it might appear in various things.
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:06.680]   And I'm here at the guest as a guest of Homeland Security.
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:08.440]   Oh, that's fine.
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:09.600]   Just stop right now.
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:13.960]   I would say basically I changed my handle about once every 10 years.
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:16.920]   So this is actually Jermaine because Marcus Hutchins.
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:17.920]   Yes.
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:18.920]   And we talked about this.
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:20.320]   You were very upset when this happened.
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:23.120]   And actually we haven't, we haven't kind of circled around on it.
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:27.920]   He is the security researcher who stopped.
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:28.920]   The one of crying.
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:30.680]   And it's tracks.
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:36.520]   Somewhat suspiciously, he happened to know while I was reading the code, I figured it
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:39.920]   out how to stop it.
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:42.160]   Well, basically he found the trigger.
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:47.520]   Well, no, what he found was that they were using a particular domain as they command,
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:51.080]   a host, they command control servers, but they hadn't registered it.
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:52.600]   They had registered it because spent one time.
[01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:54.080]   He registered, took that domain over.
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:55.480]   It stopped one and it stopped it.
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:56.480]   It stopped it in deadness.
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:57.480]   Yes.
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:01.800]   And then the kill switch built into WannaCry apparently, which I think is a little suspicious
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:05.560]   that he says it's kind of suspicious that he knew it.
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:08.800]   In any event he was arrested was out here for, was he out here for Defcon?
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:10.240]   He came out for Defcon Black Hat.
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:11.240]   Yeah.
[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:13.880]   He was going to go back and as he's about to board the plane, which is where they always
[01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:17.480]   arrest people on the way home because it's easy to get them in there.
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:18.480]   He got lots of guards around.
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:20.080]   It's locked down environment.
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:24.920]   He's arrested, thrown in the jail department of justice, accuses him of hacking crimes.
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:27.920]   Kind of, have we seen you?
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:28.920]   He was not met yet?
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:29.920]   A lot of it is redacted.
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:31.080]   So we don't know the details.
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:37.760]   They say they have evidence and that he was behind the manufacturing sale of the Kronos
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:43.560]   banking malware and then said that the one they arrested him, he was held for 24 hours
[01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:47.000]   without access to any outside legal counsel.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:51.040]   And they've also said that during that time he admitted it to them.
[01:35:51.040 --> 01:35:52.520]   Well that would be illegal.
[01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:58.240]   He of course is denying this completely and he's, it's a really weird case because when
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:02.800]   he was put out on bail, usually with stuff like this, if you're out on bail for computer
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:07.160]   crimes, one of the key things to say is you cannot touch a computer.
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:09.880]   And the only restrictions, I mean he can use a computer.
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:13.880]   He just can't access the servers that he was using for malware research.
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:15.800]   He's going to wear a GPS cuff on his leg.
[01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:18.280]   But other than that, he's fine to get on computers.
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:19.280]   He's fine to, you know.
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:24.680]   Did you read Brian Krebs article in which he kind of, he's kind of implies that Marcus
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:29.960]   Hutchins had a change of heart that he was in fact a teenage hacker, a malware creator.
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:33.560]   And then as he aged, as many of us do, he thought better of it.
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:34.840]   He had a change of heart.
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:38.840]   And it's these earlier crimes when he was 15 years old.
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:43.720]   Well I read Krebs's article and he kind of puts two and two together and makes 222.
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:47.720]   You know, there's an awful lot of inference there but no direct proof.
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:50.880]   And let's face it, it wouldn't be the first time that that had happened.
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:52.960]   You know, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:54.360]   Yeah, they sold blue boxes.
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:58.880]   They sold blue boxes, Gates dumps to dive.
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:36:59.880]   There's a whole bunch.
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:05.600]   And speaking from security researchers perspective, a lot of researchers got interested as teenagers
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:07.520]   by saying, oh, this malware is really interesting.
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:08.680]   I wonder how it works.
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:11.720]   And then applying that to security research.
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:16.720]   I mean, if you talk to any bunch of security researchers off the record and after a few
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:21.120]   drinks, which always really helps, you know, they will say, look, some of the coding I
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:26.200]   did just moodling around, didn't release it or anything, but that could technically
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:28.640]   be considered to be making malware.
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:36.880]   And I think the only evidence I've seen is really of that level of involvement.
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:39.880]   And if he had been this sort of former hard girl, he wouldn't really put it.
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:41.440]   15 years old, that doesn't.
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:42.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:45.600]   But you know, I think the government would have had a lot more evidence that he could
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:48.480]   have thrown at him if it was that clear, that one cut and dried.
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:49.840]   Well, we'll follow it with interest.
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:54.520]   The reason I brought it up is because you mentioned that sometimes handles can be a problem.
[01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:55.520]   And oh, yes.
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:59.360]   And part of the reason Brian Krebs was able to dig this stuff up is the relationship between
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:02.360]   Marcus Hutchins and the handle flippity jobkins.
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:03.360]   Yes.
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:05.920]   And I'll leave that for you to know.
[01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:07.680]   Now, I mean, the rest.
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:08.680]   Handles should change.
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:12.480]   I mean, in the interest of your rights to know the last time I'm willing to tell you
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:13.720]   was Grandmaster Fluffles.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:18.240]   It's no flippity jobkins, but it's good.
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:19.240]   Grandmaster Fluffles.
[01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:23.480]   You got to have fun with these things after all.
[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:25.280]   That's no name for a hacker.
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:27.440]   Thanks for that.
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:28.440]   Thanks.
[01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:31.920]   I'll show you today.
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:33.960]   We're going to you by stamps.com.
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:40.080]   If you do mailing of any kind, whether it's brochures, invoices, or maybe you're an Amazon
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:44.000]   seller, an eBay seller, an Etsy seller, you really need stamps.com.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:50.760]   It makes your all of your email, US mail, more professional looking, makes it easier
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:51.760]   for you.
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:53.320]   You don't have to spend any time at the post office.
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:55.240]   You can do everything you would do.
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:38:59.680]   All the services of the US Postal Service right at your desk with stamps.com.
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:03.200]   That means, yes, of course, buy and print official US postage.
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:07.360]   But for any letter, any package, any class of mail, your computer and printer, you don't
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:11.560]   need to buy a postage meter or any special thing or anything like that.
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:13.920]   What's cool about this, you can print right on the envelope.
[01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:16.960]   You can actually feed envelopes through your printer.
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:19.200]   It will automatically put your return address in.
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:23.040]   It'll put the recipients address and pull it out of your address book and it works with
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:24.840]   a variety of different platforms.
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:27.320]   Then it prints the postage right on the envelope.
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:28.840]   It looks very professional.
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:30.440]   Your logo, everything.
[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:34.560]   If you're mailing packages, we're going to give you a USB scale.
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:35.840]   You plop the package on there.
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:39.040]   You get exactly the right postage and you're adding a little extra to make sure it's not
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:40.680]   postage due.
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:42.440]   No more licking stamps.
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:44.200]   I get packages.
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:48.160]   Sometimes I get packages from people with like 100 stamps and it's wrapped in brown twine
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:50.920]   and not with stamps.com.
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:52.000]   It's going to look great.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.920]   It's going to show you off well and you're going to get discounts you can't even get
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:55.920]   at the post office.
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:57.120]   In fact, we have such a good deal.

[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:07.440]   Click the microphone and use "t-w-i-t."
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:09.360]   This is one for you, Greg Ferro.
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:18.880]   Microsoft and Facebook just laid 4,100 miles of cable across the Atlantic, capable of
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:23.280]   160 terabits per second.
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:26.840]   Now, this is really, really important.
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:31.440]   I just want to highlight some of the secrets behind this that a lot of people haven't thought
[01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:32.440]   about.
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:36.320]   One of the reasons for net neutrality and the fact that the government wants to tear it
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:40.840]   down is because the carriers want to be able to not install bandwidth.
[01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:46.200]   What they say is we need to be able to shape the traffic on the internet to protect users
[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:48.760]   because we can't create enough bandwidth.
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:49.760]   That's why.
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:50.760]   Why?
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:51.760]   Because we know what we are.
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:53.760]   It is an outright lie.
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:55.080]   Absolutely outright lie.
[01:41:55.080 --> 01:42:02.680]   What we have now seen is that Facebook and Microsoft, aka not AT&T or Verizon or Tata or
[01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:09.560]   Level 3 or any of the telcos in the world, ran a submarine cable across the Atlantic.
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:16.400]   It is actually a leading example of high speed, just so much bandwidth across the ocean here.
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:20.080]   They did it in less than two years and it was financed just out of the cost.
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:25.720]   This is literally going to be a private network just for Facebook and Microsoft.
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:30.520]   Now, this is my argument, is this whole argument about removing net neutrality so that carriers
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:32.160]   can sustain the network for growth.
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:36.160]   It is literally just a way for them to avoid investing in their networks.
[01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:39.400]   Of course, if they don't have to spend money upgrading their network backbones, if they
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:44.760]   don't have to spend money replacing routers or dense wave division multiplexers and installing
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:49.600]   new fiber or overhauling the electronics gear at the end, then they make mega profits and
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:51.600]   stitch up their customers for nothing.
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:56.720]   It is why we have such a crap internet in the United States compared with other countries.
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:58.240]   You don't have a competitive market.
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:02.880]   You've got one where the company's browbeat regulators into doing exactly what they wanted
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:06.680]   and at the end of the day, we all end up paying through the nose.
[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:07.680]   Exactly right.
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:11.720]   So, if you want to look at the source, the source is on Microsoft's blog.
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:14.520]   I'll post the link into the chatroom.
[01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:18.640]   But this one here talks about the fact that it uses an open design.
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:20.240]   It's not using closed technology.
[01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:24.800]   So, not only has Microsoft and Facebook partnered to build a cable, they've actually taken the
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:29.360]   technology, kicked out the normal bunch of losers that make this technology close.
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:33.600]   Again, proprietary and closed, they're building open technology that can be.
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:37.880]   And they're actually expecting to get this running literally within another year.
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:41.800]   So, two years to roll the cable across and then another year before it's lit up.
[01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:46.960]   It's just a huge amount of bandwidth, just so much faster than we can possibly have imagined.
[01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:48.480]   You don't need net neutrality.
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:52.920]   What we need is to kick the carriers into investing in the networks and rolling out
[01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:57.080]   upgraded backbones and new access technologies to give us the bandwidth that we want.
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:44:01.360]   Which they were supposed to do when they got the tax break a decade ago, which we all gave
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:04.320]   them for, oh, this money's going to be used to connect up the US.
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:08.240]   And instead, they took it and gave it back to shareholders or spent on useless, you know,
[01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:09.240]   make work projects.
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:10.800]   I think this is a great thing too.
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:13.960]   Although, I was suddenly interested that they're not actually connecting this to the
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:14.960]   UK.
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:15.960]   They're connecting it to Spain.
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:21.120]   And I wondered whether GCHQ's fondness for tapping overseas cables might have led them
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:25.240]   to think, you know what, maybe we'll just not put it into Cornwall like we usually do.
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:28.960]   We'll take it down to Spain and see if that's any better.
[01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:29.960]   Interesting.
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:34.160]   No, a lot of cables actually land down in Spain.
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:35.160]   So it's a choice.
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:37.440]   You either want to run the cables up around it.
[01:44:37.440 --> 01:44:39.960]   What you actually want to do is get them on the mainland Europe because that's where the
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:44.040]   bandwidth can be sold off and is actually where you want it to be.
[01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:49.320]   So, I think cables on to Lands End in the UK just means you then have to trunk the bandwidth
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:54.240]   across the UK and then usually up to Amsterdam because Amsterdam is the main internet exchange
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:55.640]   or the main exchange point.
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:45:00.480]   So bringing it down south into Bilbao is not a bad idea because it gets you on to the mainland
[01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:01.480]   and you can trunk it up.
[01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:02.480]   That's the way the fiber networks.
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:07.600]   If you go to a website called Teluguography, they have a graphic which will show you the
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:09.440]   fiber runs under the ocean.
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:12.240]   And you'll see quite clearly that a lot of cables would either go north around the UK
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:15.160]   to Amsterdam to get right into the backbone.
[01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:19.520]   And that's the super low latency ones that you want for fin trading.
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:21.880]   And then you want the other ones.
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:24.960]   Some of them come on to the UK, but therefore the UK market.
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:29.720]   But the UK is not usually a place if you want to get up to Ireland to where Amazon and
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:34.120]   Apple and all those guys are landing it on the UK soil is quite popular.
[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:37.840]   And then the rest all land down in France or down in Spain because that's the fastest
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:40.440]   way to get on to the land and the lands where the bandwidth is.
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:43.480]   And don't forget that Spain then takes you on into the rest of the world.
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:47.600]   So Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt into the North African companies and then also the rest of
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:48.680]   southern Europe.
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:51.160]   Land cables in the Mediterranean is a popular pastime.
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:55.640]   Yeah, and unfortunately also catching them on ships anchors is a reasonably fairly popular
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:58.720]   pastime for some awkward buggers.
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:02.280]   We had a couple of big breaks a lot was that 18 months ago.
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:03.920]   It happens all the time.
[01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:05.080]   It's fairly constant.
[01:46:05.080 --> 01:46:07.320]   The cables are breaking fairly regularly.
[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:13.640]   It's not just anchors, it's also animals under the ocean, ship sinking, currents, cyclones,
[01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:15.040]   all sorts of things.
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:16.480]   They break fairly regularly.
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:20.280]   The one about the anchor was that it broke the only cable that was running into Egypt
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:21.600]   at the time.
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:25.000]   And it was when the revolution was on and it was originally seen as a terrorist act.
[01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.080]   And that's why it made the press again.
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:31.400]   Liberal arts people, not with no technical competence being asked to comment on the technology
[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:33.800]   industry is a real disruption for us.
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:35.680]   It's a real bug back to the liberal arts thing.
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:40.880]   Is it easy to I have a liberal arts degree, excuse me.
[01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:42.280]   Is it actually, I don't even have the degree.
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:43.280]   I just started.
[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:44.280]   I started.
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:45.840]   I tried.
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:46.840]   Is it easy to repair these?
[01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:49.200]   Is that's why it's not a big deal that they break?
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:51.960]   It's partly it does.
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:52.960]   It depends.
[01:46:52.960 --> 01:46:56.880]   It's mostly about whether how many vessels there are available to repair cables.
[01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:00.720]   There's only about a half a dozen in the world and they're being used to repair cables.
[01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:03.280]   It takes like two or three months to repair a cable.
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:06.880]   So it's not something you want to have happen.
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:07.880]   Yeah.
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:12.440]   Well, the boat has to steam to where the cable is, then it has to send divers down.
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:15.480]   It's not complicated in the sense that we know how to do this.
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:16.480]   And this is done.
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:18.200]   Yeah, watch them splice fiber optic cables.
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:19.200]   Kind of interesting.
[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:20.800]   You can actually splice it.
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:21.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:22.800]   Yeah.
[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:26.080]   Well, the undersea cables are quite radical because they're like this thick, like can
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:27.160]   be a half meter across.
[01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:30.880]   This Microsoft article says that it's actually one and a half times the size of a garden
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:31.880]   hose.
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:36.640]   It's a kind of an amazing technology that they're just fascinating.
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:37.640]   Yeah.
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:39.480]   Fascinating history as to how they develop these initial cables.
[01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:42.760]   And first, I thought, wait, if you just put a cable down and they could go nothing but
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:44.200]   almost nothing but junk out of it.
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:50.240]   And then it averaged depths of 11,000 feet active volcanoes, earthquakes, own squirrel
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:55.920]   reefs, eight pairs of fiber optic cables circled by copper, a hard plastic protective
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:59.640]   layer and a waterproof coating.
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:01.760]   And boy, do they get bandwidth out of this thing?
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:09.560]   It's the highest speed sub trans sub-seat cable ever made.
[01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:10.560]   Incredible.
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:11.560]   Incredible.
[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:13.720]   So because it's so small, think about this because it's so small.
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:15.520]   It doesn't have a lot of weight.
[01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:16.520]   Yeah.
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:18.360]   So there's lots of interesting things about small cables.
[01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:21.240]   So that as they go down, they don't have a lot of resistance.
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:25.040]   And once they hit the bottom, they don't actually sink as hard into the into the ocean
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:28.840]   floor, which causes lots of problems because normally you actually want them to sink into
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:29.840]   the floor.
[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:32.600]   Anyway, there's a really good article on the telegraphy website.
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:34.560]   I posted a link into the chat room above this map.
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:35.560]   This is fabulous.
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:37.480]   Thank you for that link.
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:39.520]   This is really cool there.
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:40.520]   You can buy this map.
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:41.520]   It's expensive.
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:44.960]   It's $280 bucks, but they have an interactive online version.
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:45.960]   It really is.
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:49.560]   You know, and I might get this map just because it's so it'd be so beautiful to have that
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:50.560]   on the wall.
[01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:52.880]   Yeah, they release it every year.
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:56.280]   There's a new version of it, which doesn't change a lot from year to year because, you
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:59.880]   know, and it takes several tens of millions of dollars to hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:00.880]   to run those cables.
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:04.240]   One of the interesting thing that's happening here is of course that Microsoft and Facebook
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:09.080]   are now replacing carriers and building their own bandwidth, which is also an interesting
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:10.600]   market transition.
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:12.760]   So instead of, you know, it's not anymore.
[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:20.840]   It's not a AC, not Verizon or Tata communications or BT or, you know, any of those carriers,
[01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:22.960]   these companies now carry so much of the bandwidth.
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:27.760]   So Google, for example, says that its network carries 25% of the internet traffic today
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:30.200]   on its own internal network.
[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:35.840]   So they're actually building their own free writing on Verizon's back.
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:40.120]   Well, this is the international stuff, not so much inside of the US.
[01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:41.520]   Keep in mind here, there's a whole world.
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:46.520]   The backbones in the US, the backbones of the US still are telco, mostly, right?
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:51.800]   Increasingly they're owned by a bunch of investment banks who've been digging, trenching in dark
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:53.880]   fiber all around the United States.
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:56.520]   So speculatively investing.
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:50:02.040]   And what we have now is there are various, this starts to get really arcane.
[01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:04.040]   So I won't go on for very much longer.
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:06.720]   But there was a real investment trend about five years ago.
[01:50:06.720 --> 01:50:10.600]   There was a bunch of tax breaks to be issued around ditching fiber into the ground and
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:14.200]   then, and now there are companies going around buying up those fibers and gone loading them
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:16.440]   together and to sell them off into packages.
[01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:22.320]   So in the same way that we've seen RF bandwidth or spectrum created by the government and
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:24.560]   then sold off, we're now seeing dark fiber do the same.
[01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:27.800]   So there's plenty of cable in the ground for the back hole.
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:31.520]   It's just not being done by AT&T and Verizon's being done by other companies.
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:35.320]   But this was the primary reason why Google tried to get into fiber and tried to get that
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:41.680]   to work was that they were sick of, you know, entire areas of the US having very, very poor
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:44.840]   instance access and figured, right, we're going to see if we can do it.
[01:50:44.840 --> 01:50:46.080]   And they ran into so many problems.
[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:50.200]   It now appears they were pretty much abandoned large scale plans for that.
[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:54.200]   But I think the technology companies are basically getting sick of being given the run around
[01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:55.200]   by the telcos.
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:51:00.000]   Well, what's happening is again, comes back to what we said about open technologies.
[01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:03.600]   So the technologies that they're using to propagate the signals down these cables are
[01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:06.720]   not owned by specific vendors.
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:09.880]   So there's traditional companies that make these technologies.
[01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:14.120]   What Microsoft and Facebook are doing is they've designed their own technology using off the
[01:51:14.120 --> 01:51:16.400]   shelf components to drive this fiber.
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:17.960]   And that's what they mean by open.
[01:51:17.960 --> 01:51:22.120]   Somebody in the chat room is asking that question.
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:23.360]   There are a few flip sides here.
[01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:27.040]   One is Google and Facebook and Amazon are now actually substantially larger than most
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:28.380]   of the telcos.
[01:51:28.380 --> 01:51:32.320]   The reason that Google's giving up on Google fiber isn't because they found it technologically
[01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:36.720]   unfeasible or even legally or even legally unfeasible.
[01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:41.080]   The short answer is that 5G will probably replace the need for cable in the ground in
[01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:43.880]   the short term.
[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:50.280]   So 5G is going to give us gigabit to the house most likely and even at sub rate.
[01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:54.600]   So if you're talking 50 to 100 megs, it's going to be much easier to put up a tower than
[01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:57.520]   it is going to be to try and ditch put cable in the ground.
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:00.960]   You see, I'm slightly skeptical about that because that was the story we were told with
[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:05.320]   4G originally, you know, and it was going to be super fast and the rest of it.
[01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:10.320]   And 5G, they're still, I mean, 4G, they bugg it around with the standards so much that
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:16.800]   YMAX was 4G and LTE was 4G and enhanced 3G could possibly be sold as 4G.
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:23.680]   5G was saying, you know, like I say, I'm skeptical, but that's purely based on past
[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:24.680]   experience.
[01:52:24.680 --> 01:52:27.000]   Maybe you're right.
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:32.720]   So the difference between 3G, 4G and 5G is substantially to do with the spectrum allocations.
[01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:37.400]   At 5G, they're starting to talk about using 5 gigahertz and also there's a bunch of spectrum
[01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:40.760]   around 40 gigahertz to 50 gigahertz will fundamentally junk spectrum.
[01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:43.720]   Isn't spectrum though a limited resource?
[01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:46.040]   I mean, doesn't that get in the way?
[01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:47.040]   You can't.
[01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:49.120]   You don't have an infinite spectrum.
[01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:50.120]   You don't.
[01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:58.240]   But what we're seeing now is so for example, with in Wi-Fi today in the 802.11ac standard,
[01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:00.640]   they're now talking about some of the numbers.
[01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:01.920]   I'm getting a bit late over here.
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:03.840]   So some of my numbers are getting a bit stuck.
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:08.360]   So we're talking now about companies being able to use 40 kilohertz channels.
[01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:14.880]   There are 60, 40, 60 channels of 40 kilohertz in the 5 gig standard and some companies can
[01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:16.880]   do three MIMO channels over those.
[01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:22.640]   So you can actually start to do multiple streams over multiple radio frequencies simultaneously.
[01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:27.200]   Now those are standards that are emerging and devices that support those and there are
[01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:32.080]   challenges around running three antennas to propagate signals at speed, blah, blah,
[01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:33.720]   blah, but we are seeing some iteration.
[01:53:33.720 --> 01:53:38.360]   Now if you think about doing that in a broadband context from a base station, so today 3G,
[01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:45.000]   4G uses older encoding mechanisms and they are not often able to do what they call spatial,
[01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:46.440]   multi spatial streams.
[01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:53.360]   So use multiple pieces of bandwidth in various directions for, so hard to explain.
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:56.840]   But anyway, the answer is that the way they're working forward with 5G is they're not building
[01:53:56.840 --> 01:53:58.960]   the standards to be fixed and locked.
[01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:02.760]   So it's not meant to be 5G is this and that's it for time or more.
[01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:05.920]   There's a group of standards that form it and there's meant to be an evolutionary thing.
[01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:11.920]   So in the same way that HTTP 20 has now just been called HTTP and it will continue to
[01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:18.360]   evolve in part for the rest of time, but they won't be a 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 because otherwise
[01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:24.280]   it forces this punctuated equilibrium sequence where things we work with this protocol until
[01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:25.320]   it doesn't do what we want.
[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:27.960]   So then we leap forward to the next level.
[01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:32.440]   What we're looking at is 5G is meant to be a group of standards to do things like mesh
[01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:37.360]   back hole, mesh forward hole, use a range of different spectrums, a range of different
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:38.360]   mediums.
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:41.160]   Some of them are designed for handsets, some of them are designed for Wi-Fi, some of them
[01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:43.840]   are public spectrum, some of them are private spectrum.
[01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:48.080]   It's a far more, and this is why the 5G standards haven't crystallized in some ways is because
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:53.600]   there's so many withty-waffty, because we're not locking in on a specific area, it's sort
[01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:56.120]   of very amorphous and it's, you know, it's those experts.
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:59.800]   I wonder if this sounds like you're going to have warring stakeholders here.
[01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:01.280]   I wonder if you're ever going to disagree with it.
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:03.560]   Well, it's the experts deciding what an element, you remember they put the, you ever seen that
[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:06.560]   joke about the scientist with the blindfold and they're feeling the elephant?
[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:07.560]   Yeah.
[01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:08.840]   The person feeling the leg and yeah.
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:10.440]   So 5G is very much that.
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:12.920]   How do you decide which part of 5G do you go forward with?
[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:16.760]   And yes, there's a whole bunch of intellectual property and patents and stuff that are stopping
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:19.640]   it from moving forward to, but that's usual thing.
[01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:23.560]   Well, it's just one of many choices.
[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:24.840]   We shall see what happens.
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:28.640]   So quickly, a couple of highlights I want to take a break and then we will talk about
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:29.720]   Greg's favorite story.
[01:55:29.720 --> 01:55:31.960]   I can't even remember what it is anymore.
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:33.400]   Is, no, I do remember.
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:39.160]   Instagram has 800 million monthly users, 500 million daily active users.
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:42.840]   Not one of the, well, it continues Facebook's dominance, right?
[01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:43.840]   Because they own Instagram.
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:47.480]   If you don't want to use Facebook, use Instagram.
[01:55:47.480 --> 01:55:49.640]   We've had so many lies come out Facebook around this.
[01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:50.640]   That's true.
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:52.200]   Can always trust those numbers, can you?
[01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:53.200]   I'm fine.
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:56.840]   Also Facebook counts a video view as if you watch it for three seconds.
[01:55:56.840 --> 01:55:57.840]   Yeah.
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:55:58.840]   Yeah.
[01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:02.360]   And then they announced, remember a few weeks back, they announced that there was 35 million
[01:56:02.360 --> 01:56:07.560]   18 to 35 year olds in the UK, but there's only 60 million people in the country.
[01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:08.560]   Yeah.
[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:11.120]   Numbers, it can be hard.
[01:56:11.120 --> 01:56:14.360]   Equifax's CEO says, I give up.
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:15.360]   Equips.
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:17.360]   I'm sorry, retires.
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:18.520]   No, they didn't quit.
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:19.520]   They didn't even fire him.
[01:56:19.520 --> 01:56:25.480]   It was the CIO, the CIO and the CEO have all retired with nice golden power shoots and
[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:28.920]   not been fired and have the nurses kicked out of the door as they should be.
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:29.920]   Nice.
[01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:30.920]   Sorry.
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:31.920]   There's no part of this.
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:35.640]   There's no part of the Equifax thing that just, you know, as a security professional, an
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:40.040]   ex-security professional for financial institutions, there's nothing but incompetence coming.
[01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:41.040]   There's no experience.
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:42.040]   Think of incompetence coming off.
[01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:43.040]   This is just unbelievable.
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:44.040]   Yes.
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:46.040]   How about the Deloitte hack?
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:47.040]   Tell me about that.
[01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:48.840]   What do we know about Deloitte and Tush?
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:54.880]   It's a very well-known consultant for management consultant, right?
[01:56:54.880 --> 01:56:57.760]   They were Gartner's Security Consultancy of the Year for the last five years.
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:57:00.080]   They are also a security consultant.
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:01.080]   Yes.
[01:57:01.080 --> 01:57:02.880]   Well, that's not good.
[01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:03.880]   Yeah.
[01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:07.640]   Well, particularly when you consider they got 12,000, the day after this, people started
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:08.640]   looking into it.
[01:57:08.640 --> 01:57:11.360]   12,000 open-facing systems around the world.
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:14.480]   They haven't instituted basic lockdown facilities.
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:22.800]   One of their guys was even posting admin logins and passwords on his public Google+ page.
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:23.800]   Now...
[01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:25.960]   Once it's easier to find them that way.
[01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:27.160]   Well, yes, it is.
[01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:31.480]   But, you know, we were discussing this in the office and like, is it incompetence or is
[01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:34.280]   it deliberately trying to run a honeypot?
[01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:37.120]   We took Occam's razor and said, "Yeah, he's an idiot."
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:38.120]   Wow.
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:44.960]   So, when you see this kind of incompetence, especially from a firm that supposedly specializes
[01:57:44.960 --> 01:57:53.360]   in security, you really have to wonder what's going on.
[01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:57.520]   I think part of the problem is that nobody knows what's going on within the company.
[01:57:57.520 --> 01:57:59.880]   You've got the salespeople promising the moon and the stars.
[01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:04.000]   You've got the IT department who's probably under budget and underfunded and not taken
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.600]   seriously by management.
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:08.920]   And you've got the layer 8 problem of a whole bunch of users that really don't know what
[01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:09.920]   the hell they're doing.
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:14.280]   So, I mean, this is typical with large companies in particular, but you would have thought,
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:19.560]   a security consultancy selling these services at very high cost might have wanted to get
[01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:22.960]   their own systems sorted out before trying to fix other people's.
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:23.960]   Oh, no.
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:24.960]   Gosh, no.
[01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:25.960]   They don't do that.
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:27.600]   They send their best consultants out to their customers.
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:28.760]   Well, this is it.
[01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:29.760]   You know.
[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:30.760]   So...
[01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:34.360]   As somebody who's worked extensively for institutions, and I use the word institutions with the
[01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:39.720]   word mental in the back of my head, these people really are that retarded, that they
[01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:43.120]   would take their best security people and send them out to the customers for billable
[01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:46.440]   hours instead of actually securing their own systems.
[01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:50.600]   And internally, keep in mind, if you've got a bunch of really bright IT people inside
[01:58:50.600 --> 01:58:53.920]   your organization, guess how they treat their internal IT?
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:54.920]   Yeah.
[01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:55.920]   It's not a value.
[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:56.920]   They're a problem.
[01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:57.920]   So...
[01:58:57.920 --> 01:58:58.920]   So...
[01:58:58.920 --> 01:58:59.920]   This makes Equifax look good?
[01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:01.920]   No, nothing can make Equifax look good.
[01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:02.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:03.920]   That was just...
[01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:04.920]   Equifax is bad.
[01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:07.440]   This is what I don't understand.
[01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:11.600]   They've had 40 days before they went public to sort this out.
[01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:14.560]   The first website they stick up for people to check...
[01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:15.560]   Horrible.
[01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:19.160]   ...and they must have known it was going to get spammed heavily because everyone was panicking.
[01:59:19.160 --> 01:59:20.920]   Horrible website.
[01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:23.280]   The catalogue of failure after failure just goes...
[01:59:23.280 --> 01:59:29.120]   I mean, they were linking out to a spoof site set up to show how easy it was to fish the
[01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:30.120]   site.
[01:59:30.120 --> 01:59:31.120]   And they started re-thinking it.
[01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:32.120]   And the glinking...
[01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:34.840]   The social media things started tweeting this thing out.
[01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:38.120]   I mean, it was just a catalogue of absolute...
[01:59:38.120 --> 01:59:41.080]   The lack of competency at every level.
[01:59:41.080 --> 01:59:44.280]   There's fundamentally four things to a security policy.
[01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:45.280]   Don't get hit.
[01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:46.280]   So don't be penetrated.
[01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:49.640]   If they get in, detect that they're in, right?
[01:59:49.640 --> 01:59:53.560]   And if they're in and moving around inside of your organization, don't let them extract
[01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:55.040]   the data, right?
[01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:58.640]   And then fourth, have a media strategy ready to go for when you get done.
[01:59:58.640 --> 01:59:59.640]   Yeah.
[01:59:59.640 --> 02:00:02.600]   So if those four Equifax failed at all four.
[02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:04.800]   Not just a little, comprehensively.
[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:10.200]   They got owned to a basic vulnerability announced by Apache in March.
[02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:13.520]   They failed to patch it for over four months or to mitigate it.
[02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:15.680]   They should have had a mitigation capability.
[02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:18.960]   When the data was being stolen from their site, they didn't detect it.
[02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:23.840]   And I mean, you're talking about multiple gigabytes of data, probably hundreds of gigabytes
[02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:26.520]   of data being stolen over a period of time.
[02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:27.960]   They didn't detect when they were in.
[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:31.840]   They didn't detect the exfiltration and then they completely fumbled the media response
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:32.840]   afterwards.
[02:00:32.840 --> 02:00:38.400]   There's no reason for anybody to believe that Equifax can ever be an organization that's
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:42.880]   worthy of trust because nobody at any level of the organization clearly knew what they
[02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:43.880]   were doing.
[02:00:43.880 --> 02:00:44.880]   What's the solution?
[02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:45.880]   Do you make a law?
[02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:46.880]   Do you make these?
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:48.080]   Do these people have to go to jail?
[02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:49.080]   Do you?
[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:50.400]   I mean, how do you solve this?
[02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:55.400]   How do you enforce security in companies that hold very personal data about it?
[02:00:55.400 --> 02:01:01.960]   The problem with the credit checking companies is that we're not actually customers of theirs.
[02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:02.960]   They just grab our data.
[02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:03.960]   Which is their victims basically.
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:05.240]   We are their bitches basically.
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:08.240]   They grab our stuff, they sell it off to everyone else.
[02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:10.920]   And we don't really have a comeback on that.
[02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:14.720]   So the only way I can see you to sort of say, "If you're going to be a credit reference
[02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:20.000]   agency, you're going to be holding the keys to the kingdom when it comes to financial fraud,
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:26.160]   then you better have mandated, checked, and constantly checked security."
[02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:28.520]   Now you're never going to stop an intrusion.
[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:33.640]   You know, even the NSA could stop them so their own system is being subversive.
[02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:35.400]   But you've got to have a frame.
[02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:39.560]   You can't just say, "Well, it's less if these things will sort themselves out."
[02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:40.560]   No, they won't.
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:41.560]   No, absolutely not.
[02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:42.560]   But what is the consequence?
[02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:43.560]   What is the consequence?
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:44.560]   I mean, how do we make this happen?
[02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:49.000]   I think that we need to see credit reference agencies or any sort of...
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:54.160]   Forget credit, our information is spread out over hundreds of companies.
[02:01:54.160 --> 02:01:59.840]   So any company that's a surveillance company, Facebook, Netflix, Google, Amazon, credit
[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:06.000]   reference agencies, medical institutions need to all be defined as critical infrastructure.
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:09.440]   And the government needs to define a bunch of rules around critical infrastructure.
[02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:11.520]   As important as the grid, I agree with you.
[02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:12.520]   Yes.
[02:02:12.520 --> 02:02:13.520]   Exactly right.
[02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:14.520]   And they need to be treated as such.
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:17.920]   And then in the grid, if the CEO fails, then he is criminal, right?
[02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:20.280]   There is criminal negligence inside of those.
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:26.320]   And that fundamentally, I believe, is ultimately leads into our discussion around what's happening
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:29.760]   with Scott Galloway and what he's been talking about.
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:33.040]   Why people have lost faith in Silicon Valley?
[02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:34.040]   Yes.
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:35.040]   Exactly.
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:36.040]   We're going to take a break.
[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:38.040]   And do it.
[02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:39.040]   Patience.
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:40.040]   Young break.
[02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:41.040]   Patience.
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:42.040]   And...
[02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:43.040]   Thanks.
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:45.320]   He's literally...
[02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:48.480]   If he had a bit, he'd literally be champing at it.
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:50.640]   Fortunately, he has no bit.
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:51.800]   That's pretty obvious.
[02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:57.440]   Our show today, Greg Ferro, PacketPusries.net, Ian Thompson, registered.co.uk.
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:00.040]   We intentionally booked no one else on this show.
[02:03:00.040 --> 02:03:01.200]   Now you know why.
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:02.840]   Normally, we'd have a panel of four.
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:08.280]   We decided with Greg and Ian and me jet lagged, that's just exactly right.
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:09.600]   Perfect, perfect harmony.
[02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:14.080]   Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks, the ridiculously easy to use cloud accounting
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:15.080]   software.
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:16.320]   It's really not accounting software.
[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:20.480]   I had to even use that phrase because it starts with invoices.
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:24.440]   If you are a freelancer, if you have a small business, the very first thing you have to
[02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:30.840]   do is collect your payments, collect your money by invoicing.
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:34.040]   And frankly, it was always the thing for me that was the hardest.
[02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:35.040]   I just...
[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:38.720]   I dreaded the end of the month getting all the spreadsheets out and all of this.
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:39.720]   Thank goodness.
[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:46.280]   In 2004, I found FreshBooks was at the time just a little Toronto startup and they saved
[02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:47.280]   my life.
[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:49.240]   It made it easy for me to send out invoices.
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:52.520]   And whoa, lo and behold, if you build people, eventually they pay you.
[02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:59.280]   In fact, on average, you get paid 11 days faster with FreshBooks.
[02:03:59.280 --> 02:04:04.560]   But this has become a great accounting system kind of automatically now because, okay, you
[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:06.280]   send out the invoices.
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:10.160]   You collect the money, you know which invoices have been paid, which haven't, what you're
[02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:15.720]   receivables, what you know what your expenses are because it also handles expenses, whether
[02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:17.840]   you build them to the client or not.
[02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:22.120]   Pretty soon you realize that the information they have, they're giving you on their dashboard
[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:26.320]   a beautiful crystal clear look at how you're doing.
[02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:28.960]   Something small businesses and individuals rarely know.
[02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:31.280]   Are you making a profit right now?
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:34.720]   Usually, we have to wait till tax time to figure that one out.
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:37.800]   People know at every moment how you stand, how you're doing.
[02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:38.960]   And there's so many nice features.
[02:04:38.960 --> 02:04:39.960]   They're always adding features.
[02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:41.480]   It's a web app.
[02:04:41.480 --> 02:04:45.440]   So you can always, you know, I mean, there's more every week.
[02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:48.520]   Sticky headers allow you to scroll through a page while the headers shrink and remain
[02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:49.520]   at the top.
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:50.520]   It's really slick.
[02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:54.040]   So, you know exactly it's easy to view which pages or columns.
[02:04:54.040 --> 02:04:56.160]   You can see which invoices have been sent, which have been paid.
[02:04:56.160 --> 02:04:57.880]   You can even see which invoices have been viewed.
[02:04:57.880 --> 02:04:59.280]   So no more run around.
[02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:00.280]   I didn't get your invoice.
[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:01.280]   Yes, you did.
[02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:02.280]   You read it.
[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:03.560]   I can see that right here.
[02:05:03.560 --> 02:05:08.960]   You can reward prompt clients and encourage customer loyalty by adding discounts automatically
[02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:10.720]   in your recurring templates.
[02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:15.600]   Build for time by client, by project, assign services to projects and designate different
[02:05:15.600 --> 02:05:20.400]   rates for each service, press play to track your time to the minute in the app or on the
[02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:21.560]   website.
[02:05:21.560 --> 02:05:25.520]   And all your time entries are sort of chronologically on the invoice for you automatically.
[02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:27.280]   It's beautiful.
[02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:28.920]   Your customers, your clients, look at this.
[02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:30.400]   They go, oh, this guy's got it down.
[02:05:30.400 --> 02:05:32.160]   This gal knows how to run a business.
[02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:35.640]   They pay you fast because, well, you're professional with them.
[02:05:35.640 --> 02:05:37.800]   They're going to be professional with you.
[02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:41.640]   The full, see receipt attachments when you view invoices in the iOS app.
[02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:45.840]   Employees can log into the FreshBooks mobile app for iOS so that they can take care of
[02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:49.840]   business wherever they are offloading you a little bit.
[02:05:49.840 --> 02:05:53.280]   The full description of every line items now visible while visiting viewing an invoice
[02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:55.440]   on mobile.
[02:05:55.440 --> 02:05:56.640]   It's just getting better and better.
[02:05:56.640 --> 02:06:00.240]   FreshBooks was included in the Forbes Small Giants list this year, 2017.
[02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:04.400]   And so, this is a great company making a great product that's getting better all the time.
[02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:07.720]   No wonder 10 million people now use FreshBooks.
[02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:09.000]   You could be one of them.

[02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:14.280]   FreshBooks.com/twit.
[02:06:14.280 --> 02:06:15.400]   FreshBooks saved my life.
[02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:17.280]   Let it save yours.
[02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:18.280]   FreshBooks.com/twit.
[02:06:18.280 --> 02:06:26.480]   We thank them so much for making Twit possible.
[02:06:26.480 --> 02:06:28.600]   So what is going on?
[02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:32.800]   I actually first became acquainted with this when our friend Mike Elgin wrote an article
[02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:34.960]   for a fast company.
[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:37.360]   And I think this is what you're talking about, right?
[02:06:37.360 --> 02:06:43.000]   Greg, why the public's love affair with Silicon Valley might be over.
[02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:44.880]   But you're referring to somebody else.
[02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:49.720]   Yeah, I think this article is loosely based off something that's been discussed by Professor
[02:06:49.720 --> 02:06:50.720]   Scott Galloway.
[02:06:50.720 --> 02:06:53.600]   Now, he works for New York University.
[02:06:53.600 --> 02:06:54.600]   He's a tenured professor.
[02:06:54.600 --> 02:06:56.600]   He's a company called L2 Inc.
[02:06:56.600 --> 02:06:59.600]   And he has a pretty amazing YouTube channel.
[02:06:59.600 --> 02:07:04.480]   And one of the messages, he also has a history of being right about this sort of stuff,
[02:07:04.480 --> 02:07:06.080]   also by the way.
[02:07:06.080 --> 02:07:08.200]   And his point is that the worm is turned.
[02:07:08.200 --> 02:07:13.040]   So for the fast 10, 20 years, we've all said that, you know, Amazon, Apple, Facebook,
[02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:15.120]   Google, they're all doing amazing things.
[02:07:15.120 --> 02:07:16.600]   They're bringing humanity forward.
[02:07:16.600 --> 02:07:20.800]   The former horseman of the technology apocalypse.
[02:07:20.800 --> 02:07:21.800]   That's right.
[02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:25.000]   And but what's happening is we're now suddenly falling out of love with Facebook.
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:26.920]   We've got the Russian hacking scandal.
[02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:29.840]   We've got Uber having its license pulled in London.
[02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:34.880]   We've got Google suddenly the do no evil starts to look like a bro boys club where women
[02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:35.880]   aren't accepted.
[02:07:35.880 --> 02:07:39.600]   You know, James DeMooray and that sort of stuff.
[02:07:39.600 --> 02:07:41.120]   You know, this whole surveillance thing.
[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:44.560]   Look at the Equifax thing is a part of this, these so called technology companies, which
[02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:51.000]   is, but we've seen the Proceiro juice debacle, all these startups that have just pointless,
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:54.960]   you know, tech nerds who thought that, you know, tech nerds who could probably come
[02:07:54.960 --> 02:07:55.960]   out of love with the technology.
[02:07:55.960 --> 02:07:58.960]   And so we've got a lot of people who are going to be able to do that.
[02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:01.960]   And so we've got a lot of people who are going to be able to do that.
[02:08:01.960 --> 02:08:04.960]   And so we've got a lot of people who are going to be able to do that.
[02:08:04.960 --> 02:08:07.960]   And so we've got a lot of people who are going to be able to do that.
[02:08:07.960 --> 02:08:10.960]   And so we've got a lot of people who are going to be able to do that.
[02:08:10.960 --> 02:08:13.960]   And so we've got a lot of people who are going to be able to do that.
[02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:16.960]   And so we've got a lot of people who are going to be able to do that.
[02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:18.960]   And so we've got a lot of people who are going to do that.
[02:08:18.960 --> 02:08:21.960]   And so we've got a lot of people who are going to do that.
[02:08:21.960 --> 02:08:27.960]   So if you're a government and you're looking at the $64 billion in tax paid since 2008
[02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:33.960]   from Walmart and the $1 billion paid in tax from Amazon, who do you start legislating for?
[02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:34.960]   Yeah.
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:35.960]   Right.
[02:08:35.960 --> 02:08:40.960]   If you're Apple in the Europe and you're looking at the European Union coming after you for tax revenue,
[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:45.960]   and you're going, "Oh, but we, you know, and you've only paid a billion dollars instead of $20 billion
[02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:47.960]   over the last 10 years."
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:50.960]   And then all of a sudden you say to the governments, "But you should protect us.
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:51.960]   We need help."
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:53.960]   The governments are going, "You're not paying tax.
[02:08:53.960 --> 02:08:55.960]   You're not actually a citizen here.
[02:08:55.960 --> 02:08:58.960]   You're not paying enough money to participate in modern society."
[02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:04.960]   So here in the UK, you now have the UK government starting to get after Facebook and Google and Netflix
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:09.960]   and saying, "If you don't start paying tax in this country, we are going to have to create tax lawyers
[02:09:09.960 --> 02:09:10.960]   specifically to get you."
[02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:12.960]   How is this different than the same thing?
[02:09:12.960 --> 02:09:14.960]   Then, Ludditeism.
[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:19.960]   How is this difference than the traditional fear of technology that government and other people
[02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:24.960]   and government and other slow-moving incumbents have always had?
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:30.960]   Look, there is an element of this in that the tech community is, as Grog has pointed out,
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:36.960]   we're building technologies like self-driving cars, like smarter, smarter systems, which are going to put
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:40.960]   enormous numbers of people out of work in the next decade or so.
[02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:42.960]   And there is no plan to deal with this.
[02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:45.960]   And if you talk to the technology, I mean, I've talked to you.
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:50.960]   I would blame politicians for that.
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:51.960]   Who was it?
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:53.960]   The Treasury Secretary said, "Oh, no.
[02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:54.960]   Automation.
[02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:56.960]   We're not worried about that."
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:09:59.960]   They don't want people to know that this is coming.
[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:01.960]   They don't want to have people retrain.
[02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:07.960]   They want to pretend that coal is coming back, that there's going to be jobs for you as a minor.
[02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:09.960]   That's a lie.
[02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:12.960]   And it's not fair to people.
[02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:15.960]   So there is more to blame than technology.
[02:10:15.960 --> 02:10:17.960]   Technology is going to solve these problems.
[02:10:17.960 --> 02:10:19.960]   Well, no, technology is creating some of these problems.
[02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:22.960]   But that's, if you speak to anybody on these, this is called progress.
[02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:25.960]   I've spoken to numerous self-driving cars.
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:27.960]   Get rid of self-driving cars.
[02:10:27.960 --> 02:10:30.960]   What we need is more children in the factories making cheap.
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:33.960]   None of them have even a clue as to how to deal with this.
[02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:35.960]   And they don't care because it's not their problem.
[02:10:35.960 --> 02:10:41.960]   And as Grog was, particularly, and this is less though in this country, but certainly back in the UK,
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:44.960]   when it came out that Google had paid, what was it, Grog?
[02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:45.960]   It was something like...
[02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:46.960]   30 million.
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:49.960]   Yeah, 30 million in tax.
[02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:52.960]   Out of an 8 billion in tax on an 8 billion of revenue.
[02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:57.960]   It just, you know, you can't do that and expect to say, "Well, I'm a good citizen.
[02:10:57.960 --> 02:10:58.960]   You should...
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:00.960]   I can match every point on this list of negatives."
[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:02.960]   And there are many, obviously.
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:05.960]   With positive points, things that technology has brought us...
[02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:06.960]   Thank you.
[02:11:06.960 --> 02:11:09.960]   And our life span is longer.
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:15.960]   Amazon has paid, since 2008, Amazon has paid $1 billion in tax to the US government.
[02:11:15.960 --> 02:11:21.960]   And yet, Amazon is totally dependent on roads, businesses, electricity, workers, health care...
[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:23.960]   Well, and we should all be upset about that.
[02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:26.960]   So is that just reformed tax reform?
[02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:29.960]   So what we've seen is that technology companies have started...
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:35.960]   They're taking advantage, by the way, of loopholes created by the incumbent companies who all along haven't wanted to pay taxes
[02:11:35.960 --> 02:11:37.960]   and take advantage of any infrastructure.
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:39.960]   These are tax laws that are on the books.
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:40.960]   Google comes along.
[02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:41.960]   It's not Google's fault.
[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:42.960]   They're not Apple's fault.
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:47.960]   They're taking advantage of tax laws that were created, not by them, but by their predecessor.
[02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:49.960]   But they industrialized the abuse of those systems.
[02:11:49.960 --> 02:11:54.960]   So where before the systems weren't being abused at multi-billion dollar scale, they're being done at a minor scale?
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:57.960]   Well, like everything with technology, they're just better at it.
[02:11:57.960 --> 02:11:58.960]   Yeah.
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:03.960]   But the flip side of this is that in the US, Amazon has actually got a competitive advantage over it.
[02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:04.960]   Yeah.
[02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:08.960]   By just choosing not to make a profit, you only pay tax when you make a profit.
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:13.960]   So if you build a business that doesn't make profit, you don't pay tax.
[02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:17.960]   So now all of a sudden, Amazon can out-compete Walmart because it never has...
[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:20.960]   It doesn't have the... to carry that liability on its books.
[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:21.960]   Yeah.
[02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:22.960]   So...
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:23.960]   So...
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:24.960]   So...
[02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:25.960]   So...
[02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:26.960]   So...
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:27.960]   So the governments have a problem.
[02:12:27.960 --> 02:12:28.960]   They need the revenue to sustain the internal systems.
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:33.960]   I mean, in America, in particular, they need the revenue to sustain the internal systems.
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:39.960]   I mean, in America, in particular, there's not enough money to fund a police force that's going to keep society secure.
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:45.960]   The reason that the police force has been part of militarizing is because they're frightened, because there's not enough of them.
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:49.960]   How would you feel if you were like, you know, what is the policing ratio in the UK?
[02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:52.960]   I think it's one to 100,000, something like that.
[02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:55.960]   And in the US, it's even much, much smaller.
[02:12:55.960 --> 02:13:00.960]   If there was any sort of significant societal upheaval in the US, this simply...
[02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:01.960]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:02.960]   This autoplay could get to me every time.
[02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:04.960]   So I think there's a whole bunch of things here.
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:10.960]   One is that they don't pay tax or they're pursuing strategies which deliberately avoid paying tax and maximize growth.
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:16.960]   And at some point, Amazon, by never, ever paying any tax, is going to become so large and so dominant
[02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:20.960]   that the governments are just going to have to say it's a monopoly and break it up.
[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:21.960]   That's...
[02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:27.960]   The logical extension of this is if Apple continues to get any larger as a nation-state, like a corporate nation-state,
[02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:33.960]   the only way governments are going to be able to tax it or to control it is if they force it to break up as a monopoly.
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:40.960]   And what Professor Galloway is making the point is that Amazon and all of these companies can't continue as they are,
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:45.960]   because they're just not paying enough, not contributing enough back to the societies that they take from.
[02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:46.960]   I think there's also...
[02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:48.960]   He says we're barreling toward regulation.
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:49.960]   Yes.
[02:13:49.960 --> 02:13:53.960]   That's basically the message here, is that governments are going to...
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:56.960]   Their backbones are going to stiffen, you're going to get greater regulation.
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:13:57.960]   Well, I think that would...
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:13:58.960]   What does that mean?
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:01.960]   Does that mean break up the Amazon or is it tax Amazon appropriately?
[02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:05.960]   No, we're already seeing this in the European Union, where they're coming up with tax plans and they're saying,
[02:14:05.960 --> 02:14:12.960]   "Right, we're going to tax you on revenue that you make in our country, not on profit, because that is a better way to do it,
[02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:17.960]   because at the moment, you're licensing your technology off to people in Amsterdam, in Holland or in Ireland."
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:18.960]   They can bury the revenue.
[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:20.960]   Yeah, you can bury it that way.
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:23.960]   So the European Union is saying, "Right, we're not..."
[02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:29.960]   And they've moved astonishingly quickly on this in the last month or so, saying, "We're going to go after...
[02:14:29.960 --> 02:14:30.960]   Yeah, we're going to go after revenue."
[02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:32.960]   Is it there a risk, though?
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:34.960]   I mean, do Amazon and Amazon might risk it?
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:36.960]   Well, Amazon's going to suddenly not going to sell in Europe.
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:38.960]   You know, it's never going to happen.
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:43.960]   They need customers, and they need the internet backbone and the infrastructure...
[02:14:43.960 --> 02:14:46.960]   When you submit to Europe needs them as much as they need Europe?
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:47.960]   Europe's not really...
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:50.960]   Don't look okay for the last 2,000 years before Amazon, you know, I think we'll knock on.
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:51.960]   I think it's terrifying.
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:55.960]   I think the idea of governments deciding, "Oh, these technology companies suck.
[02:14:55.960 --> 02:14:56.960]   They're not paying enough taxes.
[02:14:56.960 --> 02:14:57.960]   Let's just happen with them."
[02:14:57.960 --> 02:14:58.960]   Let's get rid of them.
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:14:59.960]   We don't need them.
[02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:00.960]   That's terrifying.
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:01.960]   Which one would you prefer?
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:02.960]   Which one would you rather have?
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:05.960]   The governments we've got out there or the companies we've got out there?
[02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:08.960]   I think the companies are doing a hell of a lot better job.
[02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:09.960]   Really?
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:10.960]   I think Uber is...
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:12.960]   Not Uber, but Amazon, Microsoft?
[02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:13.960]   Maybe not Facebook.
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:15.960]   Facebook, Sussins, Google.
[02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:20.960]   So the point is that I think the usefulness of these companies has reached the limits of what they can achieve.
[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:22.960]   And we now need to reevaluate where we are.
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:29.960]   For example, there's a law that's now enacted across the whole of the European Union called the GPDR, the general protection data act.
[02:15:29.960 --> 02:15:36.960]   It's a nightmare for Facebook because they have to delete user data after two years.
[02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:37.960]   Mandated.
[02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:38.960]   Absolutely not unequitable.
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:39.960]   Why?
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:40.960]   No.
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:41.960]   Why is it ridiculous?
[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:42.960]   It's not ridiculous.
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:43.960]   It's not ridiculous.
[02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:44.960]   It's not a big thing.
[02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:47.960]   It's an excessive burden on the business.
[02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:48.960]   It's ridiculous.
[02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:54.960]   It's a fundamental misunderstanding of how technology works, I think.
[02:15:54.960 --> 02:15:57.960]   No, it's actually quite a well-written piece of legislation.
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:00.960]   It's not perfect and it won't be because...
[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:07.960]   But what we do have is companies in Silicon Valley that go broke and pick up their data and sell it off to another company in the disposal.
[02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:17.960]   You don't think there's a peril that they're doing this at their peril that this will be so damaging to techno companies that it will take place.
[02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:22.960]   It's a recipe for a dark age.
[02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:27.960]   This is a recipe for a dark age.
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:34.960]   No one is saying, is no one proposing putting Jeff Bezos up on a spike and burning his corpse.
[02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:37.960]   Although I can know some of his competitors who really quite like that.
[02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:46.960]   At the same time, they've had a free reign for so long and there's a certain arrogance creeping in which is Tim Cook in Congress last year, for example.
[02:16:46.960 --> 02:17:00.960]   He was talking about, we had the Trump tax plan come out this week and Trump said they would be doing a once in a lifetime, one off tax break to allow the $2.5 trillion being stored outside the US to be brought back in.
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:03.960]   They do a special love tax rate.
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:13.960]   In promise, we did this in 2004 with the Hohne investment act and all that money just went directly to shareholders apart from Dell who built a very small factory in Texas.
[02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:17.960]   Is your complaint that capitalism is failing?
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:22.960]   No, I think politicians need to grow a pair and start making sure that everyone plays by the same rules.
[02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:26.960]   If I went to the IRS and said, well, my outgoings were pretty bad this year.
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:29.960]   Don't forget about the salary. I made a bit of a loss.
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:31.960]   So just can you give me some money?
[02:17:31.960 --> 02:17:38.960]   You feel that the Department of Justice prosecution of Microsoft in the late 90s helped our situation?
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:39.960]   You think it made things better?
[02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:46.960]   I think it was a classic example of why the US situation was so bad because at the end of the day, Microsoft got a slap on the wrist with the DOJ.
[02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:54.960]   The real impetus on Microsoft to move was the EU, which didn't take such a less-a-fair attitude.
[02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:58.960]   The DOJ settled with Microsoft for a slap on the wrist.
[02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:00.960]   The answer is the answer.
[02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:04.960]   Look at the EU. We got the browser ballot.
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:11.960]   What's wrong with getting people the choice to get this insane cookie message that is completely meaningless?
[02:18:11.960 --> 02:18:15.960]   We get crap from governments that don't understand technology.
[02:18:15.960 --> 02:18:22.960]   I'm not going to disagree with you that the technologists are arrogant and that these companies are running roughshod.
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:33.960]   But I'm not convinced that any government, even the wonderful Margarit Vistiger, knows what to do with these guys in a way that's going to be responsible and work.
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:37.960]   I think the GDPR is going to end up being a nightmare.
[02:18:37.960 --> 02:18:43.960]   This is why you need that counterbalance because if, say, for example, the government has said on the Internet Explorer case,
[02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:47.960]   well, it's your operating system. You do what you want with it.
[02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:49.960]   And that's what they did do initially.
[02:18:49.960 --> 02:18:55.960]   We ended up with Internet Explorer having 90% of the market and then Microsoft just said, "The market took care of it, not the DOJ or the EU."
[02:18:55.960 --> 02:19:02.960]   Well, no, Microsoft putting sleep near on the ballot for browsers did not fix that problem.
[02:19:02.960 --> 02:19:07.960]   No, but at the same time, it was completely reasonable for Microsoft to put a browser in its operating system.
[02:19:07.960 --> 02:19:13.960]   Yeah, but not then once it got a monopoly position in the browser market to say, "Yeah, we're not going to bother developing that for a few years."
[02:19:13.960 --> 02:19:17.960]   And before you know it, they got a massive security problem, which the end user was paying for.
[02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:26.960]   It took Mozilla to come along and actually forced Microsoft to do some development work and later Chrome before that change.
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:32.960]   So what is the end game on this? Do we get a negotiation and a balance between these two mighty powers?
[02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:35.960]   I think there's a couple of things. I think we're going to see a few things happen here.
[02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:42.960]   One of them is I was listening to a podcast this week with a group of economists arguing over what the future of capitalism looks like.
[02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:50.960]   And the point that one of them was trying to make is that companies like Apple and Amazon have actually found ways to hack capitalism in their favor.
[02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:55.960]   I don't think it's a hack. I think it's the nature of late-stage capitalism, but go ahead.
[02:19:55.960 --> 02:19:59.960]   This is what free market capitalism drives toward.
[02:19:59.960 --> 02:20:05.960]   Yeah, effectively it drives late-state capitalism. And it's not unlike what happened in the 1700s in the Europe right at the time.
[02:20:05.960 --> 02:20:10.960]   But let's not try and pretend that everything repeats exactly the same because it doesn't. Everything's different.
[02:20:10.960 --> 02:20:12.960]   There's a chance to do it better.
[02:20:12.960 --> 02:20:17.960]   Yeah, so what we're now seeing is that the tech giants are basically becoming the robber barons of the modern era.
[02:20:17.960 --> 02:20:24.960]   They have so much data, they have so much funding, so much capital, just so much ability to move in any direction they want.
[02:20:24.960 --> 02:20:30.960]   There's no regulations or restrictions. There's no competitive situation for them to be normal.
[02:20:30.960 --> 02:20:34.960]   And so now we have a situation where they're uncontrolled.
[02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:41.960]   And importantly, they're now in a position where they can move governments, but they're not paying any taxes to governments.
[02:20:41.960 --> 02:20:47.960]   So governments now in a situation where they can go and squash these organizations because there's no tax money coming from them.
[02:20:47.960 --> 02:20:50.960]   There's no penalty. All there is is what's happening in public.
[02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:57.960]   And increasingly, the public perception of companies like Uber and Apple and Facebook is switching against them.
[02:20:57.960 --> 02:21:00.960]   And once they lose public opinion, they lose everything.
[02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:07.960]   There's no support behind them because they don't pay taxes, they don't participate in society, they're not contributing to the ordinary people.
[02:21:07.960 --> 02:21:11.960]   They take everything and consume it and generate profits for themselves.
[02:21:11.960 --> 02:21:14.960]   They're not actually a valuable part of society more widely.
[02:21:14.960 --> 02:21:21.960]   You don't think we have benefited from the powers and hegemony of these companies that they...
[02:21:21.960 --> 02:21:32.960]   I mean, we talk about Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon and Microsoft, but really, there are a thousand tech companies doing incredible innovation, changing the world in dramatically good ways.
[02:21:32.960 --> 02:21:36.960]   And there's no reason why that should stop. They just have to play by the same rules as the rest of us.
[02:21:36.960 --> 02:21:39.960]   They're playing by the exact same rules as the rest of us.
[02:21:39.960 --> 02:21:40.960]   No, they're not.
[02:21:40.960 --> 02:21:41.960]   Are they breaking the law?
[02:21:41.960 --> 02:21:43.960]   But Uber, definitely.
[02:21:43.960 --> 02:21:45.960]   Uber is a really bad example.
[02:21:45.960 --> 02:21:47.960]   I will grant you that Uber...
[02:21:47.960 --> 02:21:49.960]   They're Theranos.
[02:21:49.960 --> 02:21:51.960]   There are companies that are bad.
[02:21:51.960 --> 02:21:53.960]   I'm not saying they're aren't.
[02:21:53.960 --> 02:21:55.960]   In fact, I'm kind of like with Greg.
[02:21:55.960 --> 02:21:57.960]   I'm not a big fan of giant corporations either.
[02:21:57.960 --> 02:22:01.960]   But I'm afraid we're going to throw the baby out with the bath water.
[02:22:01.960 --> 02:22:06.960]   I'm afraid that we are going to over regulate technology out of existence and we're going to create a new dark age.
[02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:10.960]   I don't want the EU to be running the world.
[02:22:10.960 --> 02:22:12.960]   The point is we don't have a choice.
[02:22:12.960 --> 02:22:16.960]   We're now at the point in this cycle where we have to throw the baby out with the bath water.
[02:22:16.960 --> 02:22:18.960]   All these people are going to...
[02:22:18.960 --> 02:22:20.960]   You guys are all going to be out of jobs.
[02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:24.960]   That's the risk we have to take because these people are so out of control.
[02:22:24.960 --> 02:22:26.960]   I mean, at the end of the day...
[02:22:26.960 --> 02:22:28.960]   How are your physical labor skills?
[02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:30.960]   Are you good at making things with your hands?
[02:22:30.960 --> 02:22:34.960]   I'm a reasonable job in carpenter, but I see...
[02:22:34.960 --> 02:22:39.960]   Look, we have this argument every time the corporate tax rate comes up.
[02:22:39.960 --> 02:22:42.960]   It's just like, well, in Britain, there was this big thing.
[02:22:42.960 --> 02:22:51.960]   Vodafone was due to pay like $6 billion in tax and they reached a deal with the UK tax authorities that they only pay $1.5 billion.
[02:22:51.960 --> 02:22:55.960]   Now, a company like Vodafone isn't going to say, "Well, we don't like your tax rules.
[02:22:55.960 --> 02:23:00.960]   We're going to stop doing business in the UK because it hurts them more than it hurts the authorities."
[02:23:00.960 --> 02:23:03.960]   But governments are now just rolling over to these people.
[02:23:03.960 --> 02:23:07.960]   I mean, look at the number of tax breaks that are being offered to host Amazon's next...
[02:23:07.960 --> 02:23:14.960]   I think they do that because they feel like there is a benefit in the long run to fostering technology.
[02:23:14.960 --> 02:23:16.960]   This is how we move...
[02:23:16.960 --> 02:23:18.960]   This is progress. This is how we move into the future.
[02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:23.960]   Yeah, but I mean, okay, the Fox Con factory, which is supposedly supposed to be being bent.
[02:23:23.960 --> 02:23:27.960]   That's costuming a $100,000 job, maybe even a million.
[02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:28.960]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[02:23:28.960 --> 02:23:30.960]   I think the...
[02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:32.960]   I agree with you. That we should stop.
[02:23:32.960 --> 02:23:34.960]   But that doesn't mean we need to...
[02:23:34.960 --> 02:23:36.960]   We don't need to regulate the amount of existence.
[02:23:36.960 --> 02:23:41.960]   But something like GDPR is a perfectly reasonable thing to say to companies.
[02:23:41.960 --> 02:23:43.960]   We should do a show on GDPR.
[02:23:43.960 --> 02:23:44.960]   Yeah.
[02:23:44.960 --> 02:23:45.960]   No, I'd be well up for that.
[02:23:45.960 --> 02:23:48.960]   It's a complex law and there's a lot of consequences.
[02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:50.960]   I think the point here is that...
[02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:56.960]   I agree with is that you own your data and that these companies should be compelled to delete your data periodically.
[02:23:56.960 --> 02:23:58.960]   To protect your data.
[02:23:58.960 --> 02:24:00.960]   I'm not against that. I'm really not against that.
[02:24:00.960 --> 02:24:01.960]   I think that...
[02:24:01.960 --> 02:24:07.960]   It does offer some technical challenges, though, because the Internet is a fundamentally global system.
[02:24:07.960 --> 02:24:10.960]   It's not in Germany or France or the UK.
[02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:12.960]   But no company invented the Internet.
[02:24:12.960 --> 02:24:14.960]   No company invented the World Wide Web.
[02:24:14.960 --> 02:24:15.960]   No.
[02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:16.960]   No, it's...
[02:24:16.960 --> 02:24:17.960]   Well...
[02:24:17.960 --> 02:24:19.960]   It's all government. The government invented the Internet at every level.
[02:24:19.960 --> 02:24:21.960]   We need government investment. I'll grant you the science.
[02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:22.960]   A lot of science doesn't get...
[02:24:22.960 --> 02:24:24.960]   But the only way you can do that is if you have taxes
[02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:28.960]   and the only way that that taxes gets collected is by and large from corporate taxes.
[02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:29.960]   Yeah.
[02:24:29.960 --> 02:24:30.960]   And I think that there was an article in the telegraph.
[02:24:30.960 --> 02:24:33.960]   When we get robots, they won't be paying any taxes.
[02:24:33.960 --> 02:24:34.960]   Yeah.
[02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:35.960]   They're talking about robot taxes.
[02:24:35.960 --> 02:24:38.960]   But anyway, there was an article in the telegraph this week about Uber.
[02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:43.960]   And apparently the majority of Londoners are actually full Uber getting stripped of its license.
[02:24:43.960 --> 02:24:46.960]   So Uber is losing the PR War.
[02:24:46.960 --> 02:24:47.960]   So...
[02:24:47.960 --> 02:24:48.960]   Why did London...
[02:24:48.960 --> 02:24:49.960]   Why did London boot Uber?
[02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:53.960]   Because they failed to comply with the...
[02:24:53.960 --> 02:24:56.960]   If you want to run a public taxi service in the UK,
[02:24:56.960 --> 02:25:00.960]   you've got to have your drivers checked to make sure they're not dodgy.
[02:25:00.960 --> 02:25:04.960]   If they assault a driver, they're a passenger, they've got to be reported.
[02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:08.960]   And you've got to play it reasonably fair with the police.
[02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:10.960]   Medical checks, criminal checks.
[02:25:10.960 --> 02:25:11.960]   Oh, yes.
[02:25:11.960 --> 02:25:12.960]   Medical...
[02:25:12.960 --> 02:25:13.960]   Yeah.
[02:25:13.960 --> 02:25:14.960]   Any of you who refuse to do any of that?
[02:25:14.960 --> 02:25:15.960]   Yeah.
[02:25:15.960 --> 02:25:16.960]   Refuse to do any of that.
[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:18.960]   And also deployed what's the grey thing.
[02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:20.960]   Oh, guy's grey ball.
[02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:21.960]   Yeah.
[02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:23.960]   And she's grey ball to try and dodge the red...
[02:25:23.960 --> 02:25:28.960]   And then the peace de resistance, the peace de resistance was we don't trust them.
[02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:29.960]   Yeah.
[02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:31.960]   We don't trust them.
[02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:32.960]   That was literally the...
[02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:33.960]   Who said that?
[02:25:33.960 --> 02:25:34.960]   TFL.
[02:25:34.960 --> 02:25:35.960]   TFL.
[02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:40.960]   The licensing authority for taxis said we do not believe that Uber is a trustworthy organisation.
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:43.960]   By the way, TFL might have a dog in this hunt.
[02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:46.960]   They've got a lot of black cabs and cabbies at my point.
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:49.960]   No, no, no, they've got to have a separate organisation completely.
[02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:54.960]   The TFL is a Quango, a semi-government organisation that just regulates public transport in London.
[02:25:54.960 --> 02:25:56.960]   But don't you think they act in the interest of the...
[02:25:56.960 --> 02:25:59.960]   I don't like calling them in the UK, but the medallion holders?
[02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:00.960]   Oh, no.
[02:26:00.960 --> 02:26:02.960]   I mean, honestly, they don't need TFL.
[02:26:02.960 --> 02:26:03.960]   They don't care.
[02:26:03.960 --> 02:26:05.960]   There are three other...
[02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:10.960]   I just have to say, as a customer, if I'm going to go to London, I'm going to miss Uber.
[02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:11.960]   That's right.
[02:26:11.960 --> 02:26:12.960]   You can use one of the other ones.
[02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:14.960]   Honestly, London's called the best...
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:15.960]   There's three others.
[02:26:15.960 --> 02:26:20.960]   There's three other ride-hailing companies in London that are just as good, if not better than Uber.
[02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:21.960]   When I was in Prague...
[02:26:21.960 --> 02:26:22.960]   I have a hard time.
[02:26:22.960 --> 02:26:24.960]   I wanted to lead Uber.
[02:26:24.960 --> 02:26:25.960]   I agree.
[02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:26.960]   They're pretty convenient.
[02:26:26.960 --> 02:26:32.960]   But I flew into Prague in Czechoslovakia about six weeks ago for the IETF conference.
[02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:38.960]   They had a perfectly fine app from a company called Lyftigo, and it worked exactly like Uber and it worked fine.
[02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:42.960]   It was a person in a black car with a nice clean car and blah, blah, blah.
[02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:43.960]   Uber exists.
[02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:49.960]   I'm not sure this is true in London, but in most places, certainly in the US, because cabs are such a God-awful experience.
[02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:51.960]   Certainly in San Francisco.
[02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:54.960]   In New York, there's a God-awful experience.
[02:26:54.960 --> 02:26:55.960]   Oh, no, cabs in New York could grow.
[02:26:55.960 --> 02:27:04.960]   I'll never forget going in Paris, and it started snowing, and all the cab drivers rolled up their windows, lit their gal walls, and opened the papers and said, "No!"
[02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:06.960]   They would not give us a ride.
[02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:09.960]   There's a reason Uber exists.
[02:27:09.960 --> 02:27:12.960]   They're disintermediating a broken system.
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:16.960]   Only in certain locations does it actually work.
[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:18.960]   So in New York, Uber made sense.
[02:27:18.960 --> 02:27:24.960]   But at the same time, Uber has deployed inexcusable practices to prevent competitors.
[02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:26.960]   I agree, but I...
[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:30.960]   But literally, TFL basically said, "We don't trust what Uber has submitted to us.
[02:27:30.960 --> 02:27:33.960]   They've consistently failed to comply.
[02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:34.960]   We've taken it as far as we can."
[02:27:34.960 --> 02:27:36.960]   So Dara and the CEO went over there.
[02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:37.960]   Yeah.
[02:27:37.960 --> 02:27:40.960]   And he's trying to admit that there was a problem, which is...
[02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:42.960]   We're going to see who fixes.
[02:27:42.960 --> 02:27:45.960]   But then, while he was away, Travis appointed two new bull directors.
[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:46.960]   One of us.
[02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:49.960]   We could go on and on at Uber, but we can't because we're done.
[02:27:49.960 --> 02:27:50.960]   But what I'm saying here is...
[02:27:50.960 --> 02:27:52.960]   We've done two and a half hours, gentlemen.
[02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:53.960]   Yes.
[02:27:53.960 --> 02:27:54.960]   What I'm saying here is that that is...
[02:27:54.960 --> 02:27:56.960]   They're losing the PR wall.
[02:27:56.960 --> 02:27:59.960]   So as we're seeing increasingly, people are turning against Facebook.
[02:27:59.960 --> 02:28:00.960]   They're turning...
[02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:02.960]   They distrust Google.
[02:28:02.960 --> 02:28:04.960]   Apple's starting to lose its privileged position.
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:08.960]   People aren't lining up for the iPhone 8 in part because why am I continuing?
[02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:09.960]   I think in a small...
[02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:10.960]   I agree with you.
[02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:11.960]   There's a backlash.
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:12.960]   Yeah.
[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:13.960]   And the point is, how do we solve it?
[02:28:13.960 --> 02:28:15.960]   I'm well aware of it.
[02:28:15.960 --> 02:28:19.960]   In fact, in some cases, it's been the purveyor of the backlash.
[02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:25.960]   Hey, listen, I mean, it's just when things get to this level of this stage, you've got to
[02:28:25.960 --> 02:28:28.960]   extract, excuse it, getting some triage in place.
[02:28:28.960 --> 02:28:31.960]   Otherwise, it is going to be Luddites taking everything.
[02:28:31.960 --> 02:28:35.960]   So if we're actually smart about this and the tech companies think it through, they'll
[02:28:35.960 --> 02:28:40.960]   see it's in their long-term interests to actually play a level playing field.
[02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:44.960]   If they don't well, then they're thinking short-term, they're stupid and we're all screwed.
[02:28:44.960 --> 02:28:49.960]   And it is a clarion call to these companies that maybe it's time for them to think about
[02:28:49.960 --> 02:28:54.960]   what they're doing, sit down with government and come to a compromise that benefits everybody
[02:28:54.960 --> 02:28:57.960]   instead of being repacious robber barons.
[02:28:57.960 --> 02:29:00.960]   But what worries me is you've got Zuckerberg doing his not presidential...
[02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:02.960]   He's going to run for the president.
[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:05.960]   And that's one way to fight this is to take over the government.
[02:29:05.960 --> 02:29:06.960]   Yeah, no.
[02:29:06.960 --> 02:29:08.960]   It doesn't have the science fiction stories.
[02:29:08.960 --> 02:29:10.960]   Talk about how it's a...
[02:29:10.960 --> 02:29:11.960]   You could argue...
[02:29:11.960 --> 02:29:13.960]   He's run by corporations.
[02:29:13.960 --> 02:29:16.960]   You could argue that we're getting into the Asimov Merchant Princess scenario.
[02:29:16.960 --> 02:29:17.960]   Yes, exactly.
[02:29:17.960 --> 02:29:21.960]   But I would much rather have democratic government.
[02:29:21.960 --> 02:29:24.960]   Oh, we lost that a long time ago.
[02:29:24.960 --> 02:29:28.960]   You're such a dreamer.
[02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:29.960]   Ah, well, one day.
[02:29:29.960 --> 02:29:31.960]   Ian Thompson, someday we will have a democracy.
[02:29:31.960 --> 02:29:33.960]   He is a reporter for the Register.
[02:29:33.960 --> 02:29:38.960]   If you don't go to the Register.co.uk every single day and read, you're missing out on
[02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:41.960]   some of the best writing, the best snark is in business.
[02:29:41.960 --> 02:29:42.960]   That's very nice.
[02:29:42.960 --> 02:29:45.960]   And Ian is a very important part of all that.
[02:29:45.960 --> 02:29:46.960]   It's always a pleasure to have you here.
[02:29:46.960 --> 02:29:47.960]   Oh, it's fun as well.
[02:29:47.960 --> 02:29:48.960]   Thank you.
[02:29:48.960 --> 02:29:49.960]   Yeah.
[02:29:49.960 --> 02:29:51.960]   And of course, Greg Ferro, what can I say?
[02:29:51.960 --> 02:29:53.960]   Just a fount of wisdom.
[02:29:53.960 --> 02:29:54.960]   Just make stuff up.
[02:29:54.960 --> 02:29:56.960]   He's a pack of pressure stuntinette.
[02:29:56.960 --> 02:29:57.960]   Well, don't tell me that now.
[02:29:57.960 --> 02:29:59.960]   I believe everything.
[02:29:59.960 --> 02:30:01.960]   I believe everything you say.
[02:30:01.960 --> 02:30:03.960]   It is great to have you both.
[02:30:03.960 --> 02:30:07.960]   This was a very fun conversation and I hate to cut it off.
[02:30:07.960 --> 02:30:09.960]   But I got to go.
[02:30:09.960 --> 02:30:12.960]   So, yeah, you're the bathroom.
[02:30:12.960 --> 02:30:14.960]   So, I just can't.
[02:30:14.960 --> 02:30:16.960]   Okay, TMI, TMI.
[02:30:16.960 --> 02:30:19.960]   Hey, it's been a lot of fun.
[02:30:19.960 --> 02:30:20.960]   We thank you for joining us.
[02:30:20.960 --> 02:30:22.960]   We do this week in tech every Sunday afternoon.
[02:30:22.960 --> 02:30:23.960]   It's so nice to be back.
[02:30:23.960 --> 02:30:25.960]   I have to say, I love doing this show so much.
[02:30:25.960 --> 02:30:29.960]   And I really am grateful to our hosts who filled in.
[02:30:29.960 --> 02:30:32.960]   Father Robert Ballisair, who ran the show.
[02:30:32.960 --> 02:30:34.960]   Becky Worley did a great job.
[02:30:34.960 --> 02:30:36.960]   But you don't have this seat yet.
[02:30:36.960 --> 02:30:39.960]   I love coming here every Sunday, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m.
[02:30:39.960 --> 02:30:41.960]   Eastern, 2200 UTC.
[02:30:41.960 --> 02:30:44.960]   We will do it for you live if you want to watch it.
[02:30:44.960 --> 02:30:45.960]   Twit.tv/live.
[02:30:45.960 --> 02:30:51.960]   If you do, please join the conversation behind the scenes in the chat room at irc.twit.tv.
[02:30:51.960 --> 02:30:53.960]   You can even listen live on your Echo.
[02:30:53.960 --> 02:30:55.960]   I got to mention this.
[02:30:55.960 --> 02:30:58.960]   YouTube turned off the video on the Echo Show.
[02:30:58.960 --> 02:30:59.960]   I'm a little pissed off about that.
[02:30:59.960 --> 02:31:00.960]   But you can always listen.
[02:31:00.960 --> 02:31:03.960]   If you just say, "Echo," listen to Twit Live on TuneIn.
[02:31:03.960 --> 02:31:05.960]   You can listen to what's going on right now.
[02:31:05.960 --> 02:31:06.960]   Or pick your favorite show.
[02:31:06.960 --> 02:31:09.960]   And you can say, "Echo," listen to this week in tech on TuneIn.
[02:31:09.960 --> 02:31:11.960]   It'll play the most recent episode.
[02:31:11.960 --> 02:31:13.960]   So, another great way for you to listen.
[02:31:13.960 --> 02:31:15.960]   You can also subscribe using your favorite podcast.
[02:31:15.960 --> 02:31:17.960]   I wish you would.
[02:31:17.960 --> 02:31:19.960]   I thank you all for being here.
[02:31:19.960 --> 02:31:20.960]   And I will see you next time.
[02:31:20.960 --> 02:31:22.960]   Thanks to our studio audience.
[02:31:22.960 --> 02:31:25.960]   Who's got buns of steel?
[02:31:25.960 --> 02:31:26.960]   Anytime.
[02:31:26.960 --> 02:31:28.960]   We'll put it at more comfortable.
[02:31:28.960 --> 02:31:29.960]   We'll see you next time.
