[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This is Twit, this weekend tech episode 26 for October 9th, 2005.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   [applause]
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Coming to you once again from the beautiful gallery cafe in San Francisco in Naapil.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   Where Naapil meets the Chinatown District, across the street from the cable car barn and museum.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   We're being buzzed by the Blue Angels, and let me introduce the Twit crew before the Jets fly over.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Roger Chang, who is all excited about the Jets.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Yes.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   From Gamespot.com, David Prager from System.org.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Hello, hello.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   You all have an association, I have to mention your plug each time, right?
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Robert Herron from PC Magazine at DigitalLifeTV.com.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Hello, Leo.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   At Patrick Norton also from DigitalLifeTV.com.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   And of course, John C. Devorek.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   He gets...
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   No spam!
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   From Devorek.org/blog.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Is it hard to say you're from there?
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Yeah, right, that's my spot.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   That's where I make all your big dough.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   That's where the big money is.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   So, was that cool, the Blue Angels?
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   I mean, I didn't see them.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   I was driving over the bridge and I knew somebody was going to rear end me because I was trying to pay attention to the driving and they're going boom.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   I think they've got the same choreographed show for the past ten years at least.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   It's cool.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   I mean, it's cool.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   I mean, it's exactly the same show.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   It's Fleet Week in San Francisco.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   That means you're all supposed to take home a sailor tonight.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   They do have that program.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Yeah, they do.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Yeah, take a sailor home.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   A doctor sailor.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   A doctor sailor, that's what's called you.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Who do you think does that?
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   People on the Castro for one day.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Hey, sailor.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   It's a busy time.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   It's a party.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   It's a party.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   And of course, the Blue Angels are the demonstration flying team from the Navy and they're pretty amazing.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Pat, I wouldn't flu them once, but you knew that.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   That's right.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Yeah, we did a video of you passing it.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   I mean...
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Did they make you throw up?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   They tried.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   They tried.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Oh, they didn't?
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   They did a really good job.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   He didn't eat before, right?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Well, of course.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   They tell you not to eat.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Depends testimony.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   No, actually, they want some food in your stomach.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Oh, really?
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   It's not a whole lot.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Just a little...
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Have a little bun.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   They also tell you that if you puke inside the cockpit, because the guy who's giving you the whole spiel on what to do when you feel yourself start to blackout or explaining the physiology of it, is also the guy who has to clean up the cockpit if you hurl.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   So he doesn't want you to.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   No.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   But the pilots do.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Skipper and Mikey are really awesome.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   They think they all have names, right?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   They think it's a story.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I was listening on the way over on local channel 910.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   They were actually playing the feed on the Blue Angels.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   They were telling you that.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   With the crazy...
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Yeah, they have a big announcer there.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I used to do that.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   For K&B Arm, K&B Arm used to broadcast it here in the San Francisco.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Whoever, this is the Navy guy.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Yeah, the Navy guy and me.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And we would do this.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   The guy's the worst.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I mean, he sounds like a ham actor.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   See, I would do the play by the way.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   He would do the color.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Well, there's a reason he does that.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   No, the Blue Angels.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Exactly.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   But anyway, what was interesting, I didn't know, is that they don't wear those pressurized suits
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   when they do this one.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   And you know what that means?
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   They have to work out.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   They clench hemorrhoids.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Seriously.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   There's serious clench.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I knew a good fighter pilot.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   He says it's the number one.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   All fighter pilots have this problem because they...
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Really?
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   One of these moves and boom, you just blow yourself up.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   And these guys are wearing...
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   I don't know.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I know.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I know.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I know.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   I thought that this was a good...
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Did they put you in a flight suit?
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   No.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Nobody gets the pressure suit.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   There's no room in the play.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   It's just to experience...
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   You get to experience what they experience.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   There's nothing to do with it.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   But see, they can clench their muscles in such a way to keep the blood from...
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   The problems of blood go to your head, right?
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   That's what you do is that's what it gives you the head.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   You basically clench all the way up.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Yeah, and what you do is you actually...
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   When you tighten your muscles, you're forcing the blood to not...
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   You want the blood to be in your head and when...
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   The thing that...
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Oh, you don't want to go out of your head.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Yeah, you want to keep it in your head and when like...
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   To test him to pet.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Like he lost consciousness at the very end, but they pulled seven and a half G's on him as well.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   And we got a nice video tip of it.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   And another peculiar thing I thought was interesting is a videotape in the thing and it's a PR arm for the Navy.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   All the cockpit videos on a VHS tape.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Including in metrics?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Yeah, and the only...
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   I think it's just because they haven't put forth the effort to...
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   They had to outfit the recorder so that the heads would keep touching when they're pulling seven and a half G's
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   and they haven't outfitted...
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   They haven't gone to the original.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Like that?
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   And they're not using another kind of tape.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Do you know...
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Did you get flight time for that?
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   You think it's funny, but you get flight time for being in the simulators over at the night.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   He wasn't actually doing anything.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Oh, 45 minutes of sitting in the back.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   But you know what?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Counts.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Maybe planes don't have sticks on the back.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   So Web 2.0 was...
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Yeah, it was just...
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   That's something.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   There's a way to shoot.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Only the trainers.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   They don't like...
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Only the Air Force.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Well, the normal F8...
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   No, they're probably doesn't count.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   This guy reads James when he goes to bed.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   You know, he's like...
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   It's in the morning.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Not in bed.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Alright, in the morning he reads.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   So what about tech news?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   What about that?
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Web 2.0, did you go?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   No, it's not your thing.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   It's a group thing.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Who's gonna go to that thing?
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   You know, let's come back to Web 2.0.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Darker Grand Challenge.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Five...
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   That's exciting.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Five finishers?
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Five.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   The first one is of course the Stanford Racing Team.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Actually, they weren't the first across the line.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   They were the first on time.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   I know that one.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   They're saying they won.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Yes.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   They had the shortest time to traverse the...
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   But then other...
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Well, that means they were the first, right?
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Well, no, they do staggered starts.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Oh, I see, I see, I see.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Five.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   And this is none ever finished before.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Right, well, there was a lot...
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   There was a couple, I mean...
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   I think I still, I said this before,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   it's like last year's results were very deceptive.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Because they let a lot of vehicles run
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   that shouldn't have been allowed to run
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   because they didn't pass the initial challenge.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   So $1 million prize last year,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   they doubled it to try to get some winners this year.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   $2 million.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Busway and Turic.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Now the key, it's not remote control.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   No.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   You push the button, you say, "Bye-bye car."
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   And it drives.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   It basically does the whole thing.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Yeah, but they give them a huge number of GPS points
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   to navigate, but on top of that,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   it's also dealing with,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   basically, they're using terrain.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   That's a problem, right?
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   The terrain's a little mellower.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Because that was a problem, they couldn't get over it.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   A lot of people got caught up in rocks and rocks.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   132 miles.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   So that was the course distance?
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   132 miles?
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And who did it fastest and how fast they did it?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   Stanford did it in six hours and 53 minutes,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   which is pretty good.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Not bad.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   But you have 10 minutes, 10 hours total,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   so five of them did it in 10 hours or less.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Well, now one of them did it in 12 hours and 50 minutes.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   That was Team TerraMax, the one with the 42 million ton
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   industrial vehicle.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   And I figured that's a better way to go.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   I think they just didn't want them to be run over by them afterwards.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   I like autonomous vehicles.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   I think the thing that you should point out is that this is done
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   by the Army Defense Research Project.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   These are the people who brought you the Internet.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   And the idea of DARPA's ideas, they want to have robotic vehicles
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   in the field.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Actually, they want them so they can come into the cities
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   and kill the citizenry.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   That's right.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   You just barrel in here when there's a riot or something.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Flash the guys with hot water or whatever you want to do.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   You cut the headphone levels a little bit.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Everybody's getting a good blow right here.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Lower.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Die in here.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Ah, there you go.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Now, now, now Web 2.0 because Patrick did go to that.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Yes, I got to attend a bunch of the sessions.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Wasn't that just a bunch of guys who were like leftovers
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   in the web blowout in the year 2000?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Or big shots like Terry Semmel who don't get it at all.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Right?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Yeah, one of the two was there.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Well, I mean, there was a mixture.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   I mean, a lot of what you hear is, you know, I don't know.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   There's a lot of interesting stuff there.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Name one.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Name one.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   He's put you on the spot.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Oh, man.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Watching some of the demonstrations of interactive applications
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   where the user controls the interface.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   That's the new thing, right?
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   You must have--
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   I mean, you heard HX and maybe on Rails.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   No way by that.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Actually, the best thing I heard was, was, uh,
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Sergey Brin from Google showed up kind of as a surprise.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And they did an interview.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   They did, you know, one of their discussions with him.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And he was really funny where he pointed out that if the executives
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   controlled what projects were pushed forward at Google,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   most of the projects that have made Google successful
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   never would have--
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   There you go.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   --wether would have been passed.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   There you go.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   And it was interesting to hear him say that.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   That's an executive.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   That's an executive.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   And it's, you know, what they can do with the research
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   and encouraging people to create this system.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Well, now you-- let's reiterate this.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   OK.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   What you said was, what the executive suggested,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   if they had-- if these things--
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   If the executives decided we won't, that project and that project.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   These were going to be the focus of Google moving into 2007.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Like Google--
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   So they're smoking empty space instead of a--
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   He's saying--
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   He's saying that they--
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   They had no clue.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   The executives have--
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   That's the one.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   OK.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   It was-- big story.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Interesting.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Stop the presses.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   What about this guy, the weblogs guy who sold his company--
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   He was there, I know.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   What's his name?
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Jason was very happy.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Jason McCall McCall, I guess.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   McCall--
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   I like Jason, but we had words at Nome Decks a couple years ago.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Oh, really?
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Well, he was like, everybody knows that, you know,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Zeph Davis and CNET and IDG are all in the pockets of the advertising.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   I was like, "Um, as somebody who writes for all three of them?"
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   That was--
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   It's like if that was that coordinated.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   He did OK, though.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   He sold a weblogs ink to AOL for--
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Like $25 million?
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   $25 million.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   He's a happy boy.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   There goes a cable car.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   It's Riceroni.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   That's a cable car.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   You can hear him.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   He's on the screen to the plant.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Here it comes.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   He's Riceroni, the San Francisco tree.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Don't know.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   According to their marketing campaign.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Has anybody ever had Riceroni?
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Anyone?
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   I've had Riceroni.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Patrick and--
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   The two guys from the Midwest.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   I have had Riceroni.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   There you go.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Well, every sloppy--
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   So what else was that web?
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   I mean, it's basically on one hand from what you're saying in the group.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Think it's like, yeah.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   The users are wanting to control the medium.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   The idea that end users--
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   It was--
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   You know, you're just going to give me that stare.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   He lost it already.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   It's true.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   A lot of me--
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   I got to sit on two sessions and a couple of them were stating the obvious.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   It's like, hey, blogs are--
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   You were a panelist?
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   No.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   You're in the room.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   He was watching.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   The best part is that Michael Powell, former FCC chairman, says he'll be on Twitter anytime we want him to.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   I think he would.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   He gave Patrick a hug.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   I got a hug.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   A man hug.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Really?
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Was it a tent hug?
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Or a radio?
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   It was the bear hug.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Not quite the full bear hug, but the half bear hug.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   I like Michael.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Did you get a photo?
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   He's a good guy.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   It was interesting to hear him talk.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   It was interesting to hear people talk about the fact that they're still fighting distribution.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   The major problems are still, if you know, do you want video on the web?
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Will the studio still control?
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   And even the studio control distribution mediums like movie link don't have most of the content.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   We still need faster connections.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Am I crazy?
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   I like audio on the web.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Sure.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   I think audio.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   I think that's what you're doing.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   This is what this is.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   We're doing video, but I wonder if-
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Maybe you have a conflict of interest here with that.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Should I disclaim that?
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   I mean, you like audio because that's what you do.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   I think it's fair.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   That's one of the things that happens over the web is that whatever medium you came from,
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   that's the medium you think the web is.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   So, print guys think the web's print, magazine guys think the magazine, TV guys think it's TV.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   I think it's whatever people are downloading the most on BitTorrent at this point.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Well, that may be.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   I think though, it may well be that we just don't-
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   The real innovators on the net are just now, you know, coming of age and those are the people
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   who don't have the preconceived notions of my come up with something completely different.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   One of the best panels is they have a guy that- one of the guys that runs one of the
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   investment houses brings up a group of teenagers and talks about what they do, how much they
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   spend on it and where they get it.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   And the one universal thing across this fairly diverse group of teenagers is that none of
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   them pay for music.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   None of them.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   In fact, the Canadian research says something like 75% of all music downloads are stolen
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   and they're by 18 to 24 year olds.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   That's who's doing it.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   They don't have the culture of buying music.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   No, it's what the record- So, they're probably afraid of-
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Or the money.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   It's too late now.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Do you think that they don't have the money or if they come of age?
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   No, they have the money.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   I just think that their desire for music outstrips their resources.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   People think that they're being in college just for it.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   It's like you're buying you CDs, you're buying, you know, you're not spending.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   You take a box of pop for a new desk.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   I mean, if you're making their grand year and you could get something free.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Gonna have beer money.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   That's the key.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Well, it's ironic because a couple of these kids are spending like $600 a month, they're
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   not $600 a month in ringtones and games.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Yeah, that's what they buy.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   Oh, come on.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Kids are buying ringtones.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Oh, who's buying ringtones?
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Somebody's buying ringtones.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   It's a huge business.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   They bat the financial district.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Oh, you think it is?
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   It's like people with more money than sense.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   It's like cab drivers.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   And there's some people with no money and no sense.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   I mean, does anybody-
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Has anyone ever bought a ringtone?
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   I don't want to- I don't want- I would consider buying a song.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   I'm not going to buy a ringtone.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   I bought one.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   I have ringtones.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   You bought one?
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Anyone out here?
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Anyone buy a ringtone?
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   It was one of the reasons I almost done my phone immediately.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Okay, you guys are working this financial district, right?
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Anybody ever hack a ringtone on the internet?
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   That's the better thing to do.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   It's my ringtone right here.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   [laughter]
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   [laughter]
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   I don't want to- I don't want to-
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   I would consider buying a song.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   I'm not going to buy a ringtone.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   I bought one.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   I have ringtones.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   You bought one?
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   Anyone out here?
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Anyone buy a ringtone?
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Guns are legal.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   Right, I mean-
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Good news.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Shooting people are legal.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   I got the laugh anyways.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   What's the name of the detail?
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Oh yeah, the label.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Sorry, I made it mistake.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Facts.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Eminem is suing a bunch of different companies because he doesn't want them.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Because he's selling his music as ringtones.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Good for him.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Well, that makes sense.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Is it how much money these companies make in selling ringtones?
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   It's like $18 billion last year or something.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   It's unbelievable.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   The number is unbelievable.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Worldwide, it's huge.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   So, got another invitation from Apple.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Did you get your invitation?
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   No.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Is it Tuesday, right?
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Oh, you're the Wednesday?
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Is it Wednesday?
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Going Wednesday the 12th?
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   So, you got an invitation?
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   No, I bought the tickets.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   How many got invitations in the email?
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   I actually had to ask one.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   I'm the only one who got one.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Well, that's because you're a lackey for Apple.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Oh, that's right.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   I forgot.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   So, are you going to go down and see what-
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   I'm going to make Canada a Kecko.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Do you want to go over-
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Yeah, one more thing.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   Yeah, I'll go.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   That's the name of And One More Thing.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Because that's what Steve Jobs is.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   So, this is the-
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Do we know what it is?
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   This is the video iPod?
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   That's-
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   A lot of people are saying it's not the video iPod.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   I hear two things.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   I hear either video iPod, but they don't- also they don't want to trump the whole Nana,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   which is selling like lousy time.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   And then the other thing is they haven't done any significant upgrades to the power books.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   I think-
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Maybe they're like a Pentium M thing.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   I'm going to go out of- I'm going to limb.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   I'm going to say it's an Intel power book.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   That would be scary.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   I have no evidence of that at all, by the way.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Now, a lot of people are saying it's a fifth generation iPod.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   You know, think secret says it's not anything with an iPod.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   They say it's going to be updates to power books to the power books.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   It makes more sense that it wouldn't be anything with an iPod.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Why undercut a Nana?
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Yeah, Nana was doing two bones.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   They're back ordered.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Will there ever be an iPod video?
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Absolutely.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   When?
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Everybody knows this.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   They got one.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   They made it.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   They made it.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Well, they're going to wait till the sales- they got these sales curves.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   They look at these miles on the cell phone and now's the time to do it.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   Where's the content for it coming from?
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   Us, look at this.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Right here, we can- we'd be number one.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   We would be.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   For a moment, it just wanted to see us.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   And then they'd see us.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   And that would be it.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   We'd be number one.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Didn't the previous announcements for the iPod like the Nana?
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Didn't it give a hint in terms of like, okay, we're going to have thousands of dollars.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   He'd said a thousand dollars on the iPod.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   I was like, I can see you knew.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   And this is Nana one more thing.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   It's just one more thing.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   It could be anything.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   It could be a last time they had an event down there that had you two and Bono as the introduction
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   of the iPod photo.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   And one more thing.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Maybe it's a pun or something.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   It's a related one.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Well, maybe that's always- like some Steve Jobs always does that.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   It's always in one Nana with the- at the Maria.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Why would that be in one more thing?
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   No, that's not good.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   One more thing to the Nana.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:24.700]   That's always for the
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:25.700]   Nana.
[00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:26.700]   What could it be?
[00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:27.700]   I think it's going to be the boring thing.
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:29.800]   It's going to be upgrades to the power piece.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.200]   Maybe it's that breakout box that was a big scandal.
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.800]   A lot of people were saying, when are they going to do- this is typically the most important
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:36.800]   typical speculation.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.800]   One of the things that you do- a media- meaningless.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.800]   Yeah, meaningless.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.800]   Media center edition.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:41.800]   Always 10 media center edition.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.800]   Is it selling well for Windows?
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:44.800]   Yes.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:45.800]   Is it?
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.800]   It's one of the most popular PVR software if you're going to do your own.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.800]   How is it selling the- in terms of numbers now?
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.800]   Oh.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.800]   I mean, you compare the rest- like you, but not everybody.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.800]   Or it's going to be a tablet Mac.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.800]   Another big product category.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:00.800]   That's how- I don't think so.
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.800]   The tablet thing is so dead in the water right now that I can't imagine.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.800]   I'm hoping for the one that Newton's very-
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.800]   With a funny.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.800]   I'm hoping for a Pentium M Powerbook.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.800]   That would be a very compelling product.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.800]   What's to hold them back?
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.800]   I think they're going to do a desktop before they do a Powerbook.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:18.800]   You think so?
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.800]   Well, they said they were going to do the low ends first, which would be the mini.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.800]   And then a year later they're the high end.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.800]   I think they would do all the- do all the notebooks because the Mac mini is essentially
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.800]   just a-
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.800]   Where their desperate is in the notebook.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.800]   They cannot put names in the books.
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:30.800]   They cannot put names in the books.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.800]   It's an interesting idea.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.800]   That would be interesting because I know I was talking to somebody the other day who told-
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.800]   Who has it on good authority?
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.800]   That Apple- or Microsoft actually has a reference design for a mini-killer.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.800]   It's a 60 bucks deal.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.800]   60 bucks of parts and it's a little mini.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.800]   And they're sitting on it.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.800]   Why?
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:50.800]   Maybe this is what Apple's going to roll out.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.800]   60 dollars.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.800]   No, 60 dollars in parts.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.800]   They're charging 300 bucks.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.800]   It'd be well normally the market.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.800]   Normally the market-
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.800]   The normal market's on bag of parts versus the retail price.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.800]   Traditionally it's always been 4X.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.800]   Wow, that's cheap.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:11.800]   Recently it's changed to 3X because they've cut a bunch of margins out.
[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:16.800]   So the bag of parts means you have a $200 computer, supposedly.
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:17.800]   With nothing on it.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.800]   And it would run Windows and it would run OS X.
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.800]   It would come with OS X and you put Windows on it.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.800]   I'm just saying.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.800]   That's a killer.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.800]   Would that not be a killer product?
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.800]   The panting in the audience would indicate.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.800]   So are you panting?
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:29.800]   Most of the figures are.
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:31.800]   The audience already got hot machines there.
[00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.800]   That's one of the problems.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:39.800]   Right now I think there's something that one thing overlooked in the news is that Dell has decided to bring out a high end machine.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:44.800]   And I was talking to some vendors about this recent because I'm starting to build machines with SLIs.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.800]   And these machines cost about $4,000 to put together.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.800]   And I started thinking about it because about two years ago I started doing all these little boxes,
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:18:22.800]   these little cubes and all these cheapies that you could build for $2, $3, $4, $3, $4, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3, $3
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.800]   four gigabytes of no.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.800]   There's not one person sitting at these chairs that doesn't think this would be good to have.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.800]   Four gigabytes of main memory.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.800]   A terabyte of, you know, take three, four hundred gig drives and throw them on the set array.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.800]   Now what's the price?
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.800]   The hour and three grams.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:39.800]   Three grams.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:40.800]   Who would buy that for three grams?
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:41.800]   See?
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.800]   Everybody.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.800]   I've built it myself.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:48.800]   I would want an AMD processor and that's something Dell would like.
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:52.800]   I can say that because there's no cameras coming that way.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.800]   Hey, it's the beauty of radio.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:56.800]   Almost everybody.
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.800]   Well, there was three guys back there.
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.800]   But they were very enthusiastic in their way.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:01.800]   I think it's an itch product.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.800]   I don't think that that's what the mask is.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:04.800]   Everybody wants that.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.800]   I've come to that conclusion.
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.800]   So how many people are willing to pay for that one system that has no OS load on it?
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.800]   Right.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.800]   It's designed for your own build of Linux.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:12.800]   Well, it comes with a free DOS.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.800]   But I guess they have to put something on it.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.800]   So at least you hit the power button.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:21.800]   Anyway, with the new SATA, you know, serial ATA, you can throw, they got the RAID built into
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:22.800]   the chip set.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:28.800]   So you can throw three of those 400 gigabyte drives on there and have a 1.2 terabyte
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.800]   RAID lash up.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.800]   We zoom right along.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.800]   Who here makes less money than John?
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.800]   I have a terabyte of storage, but I don't RAID the damn thing.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:38.800]   It's too dangerous.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.800]   Don't you think?
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.800]   You get one drive down and the whole thing.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.800]   What is that?
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:43.800]   No, I know.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.800]   Would you be doing with this amazing machine?
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.800]   Oh, word start.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.800]   Word start.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:48.800]   Pac-Man.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.800]   It's all in there.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:50.800]   In SLI mode.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:55.800]   I think that's the real issue, John, is that the only applications that need anywhere near
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.800]   that power are games.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.800]   Everything else is fun.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.800]   Well, Photoshop, but dual processor.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.800]   I mean, you don't need to get crap out of time waiting for Photoshop.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.800]   Now, to be honest, the SLI thing is just a whim.
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.800]   I don't think you need that kind of, you know, I don't remember.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:08.800]   It reminds me of a rumor.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:09.800]   Remember, remember, remember, remember.
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:13.800]   People would put two of Voodoo, oh, yes, cards in a machine.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.800]   It was the same idea, right?
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.800]   Same amount of money, too.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:16.800]   Which literally expense.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:17.800]   Three, four, hundred bucks a pound.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.800]   And then the Voodoo's came out with one card that had both.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.800]   And then, of course, a better chip completely made off, so leave.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.800]   And it was worthless.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.800]   Well, that don't happen with this, too, of course.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.800]   It's right now the SLI cards are $4.49 a piece, and you need two of them.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:31.800]   $900.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.800]   You can get the lower end card.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.800]   That's the one benchmark I want to see done is the lowest end card and what that compares
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:37.800]   with in terms of the high end.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.800]   SLI stands for scalable link interface.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.800]   And the idea is two video cards sharing in parallel?
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:50.800]   Or are they kind of-- no, they split the workload up and they have different algorithms for-- they can either do it line by line like the traditional scan line and leave that 3D-FX did.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.800]   Or they can trade off one frame rendered by one card, another frame rendered by another card.
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:59.800]   Or they can physically or dynamically split the screen depending on the workload that's happening.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.800]   You do the Zebra for you to the anti-aliasing.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:07.800]   They have several methods because some games and some graphics API's work better in certain circumstances with different ways of doing it, so.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.800]   But it's just a game has to be SLI aware to take it back out at all.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.800]   That's the beauty of the game.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.800]   It's DirectX 9 or DirectX 9 and OpenGL as well.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.800]   What's going to happen to OpenGL?
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.800]   Microsoft's saying they probably aren't going to put OpenGL in Vista, right?
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:22.800]   Probably not.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:28.800]   They want to push OpenGL out because they own DirectX and they can say, you know, any game, look, develop for DirectX.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.800]   Don't develop for that OpenGL.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.800]   And then they don't have to worry.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.800]   Nobody else that won't run on any other platform.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.800]   And the advanced feature sets that are available in the new cards are all DirectX 9.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:43.800]   Just before it's sooner in DirectX, then you would find it OpenGL and the standard took so darn long, especially at 2.0.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.800]   Is it open standard or it's a good standard, right?
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:46.800]   I mean, it's a shame to lose it.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.800]   Right.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.800]   Doom 3.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:53.800]   I mean, it might not be your favorite game, but the engine does a really good job with that API.
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:58.800]   And I'm, of course, you know, biased because I want stuff to run on the Mac and it's not going to run on the Mac if it's DirectX 9.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.800]   It's never going to run on the Mac.
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.800]   Is World of Warcraft?
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:05.800]   Since that's on both, it's not that demanding, I don't think.
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.800]   Okay.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.800]   Is it an OpenGL game, though?
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.800]   No, it must be, right?
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:14.800]   Or they ported or they wrote two versions of DirectX 9 version and an OpenGL version, I don't know.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.800]   But that's a problem.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:22.800]   If Vista doesn't have OpenGL, can somebody come along and support it after the fact or...
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.800]   be interesting at issue?
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.800]   I think that's a non-competitive area that might have patched it.
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:27.800]   Microsoft could get into.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:35.800]   Apple could come up with an API or something easy to do with, like, a DirectX, where you could just move poor programs over easier.
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.800]   Direct export.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.800]   Maybe that's what they'll announce.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:39.800]   One more.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.800]   Well, on the subject of graphics, did you guys talk about the movie "Serenity" last week?
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.800]   Did you go see it?
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.800]   I haven't seen it.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.800]   I haven't seen it.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:47.800]   I haven't seen it yet.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.800]   Go see it at the Metron because they were showing it on the Big IMAX.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.800]   Oh, I'm...
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:55.800]   Every time they do that, you never get to see it in the middle and then you're looking at the board.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.800]   You've got to sit in the back in the middle.
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:22:59.800]   You've got to get higher than the middle.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.800]   Yeah, you have to see an IMAX flick.
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.800]   That's just optical.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.800]   They don't shoot it.
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:04.800]   No, they just blow it up.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.800]   It's big.
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.800]   It's 70 millimeter print though, right?
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.800]   I don't think so.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:09.800]   I don't think so.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.800]   I think they stopped doing...
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.800]   That's a 70 millimeter print system.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:12.800]   They haven't done it for years.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.800]   I've been in Metron's DLP cinema with the new 2K chip.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:17.800]   That is gorgeous.
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:18.800]   Yeah, it's pretty.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.800]   Sony has a new tech coming up.
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.800]   Was "Serenity" done digital or is it a film?
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.800]   It's a film.
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.800]   Hopefully film.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.800]   You don't like the digital?
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:26.800]   I just down the road.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.800]   It's right now.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.800]   It's cheaper, I think, to shoot your stuff on film and then transfer it to digital because
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.800]   you can still make a tremendously high resolution call.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.800]   I think you might get an argument there.
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:35.800]   Hey, do you see this story?
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.800]   I didn't see this anywhere in the mainstream media.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:43.800]   It was just a small note that the European Union is trying to take away the Internet from
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.800]   ICANN.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.800]   They want to get the US on it for a while.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.800]   It's not so much they want to take away.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.800]   They just want to remove a big portion of US influence.
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.800]   Because ICANN isn't theory in international body but really dominated by the US.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:02.800]   Actually, I had curiously enough went down and visited ICANN about this particular topic.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.800]   What was there?
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.800]   It even freaked out about it for almost a year now.
[00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.800]   Well, it's moving ahead of me.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:07.800]   Actually, yeah, I know.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.800]   What it really is is the United Nations above all.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.800]   That's right.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:11.800]   The other ones are pushing it.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.800]   And it seems to be at the behest of, according to them.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.800]   And I believe their story.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.800]   It seems to be at the behest of about six or seven countries that are...
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.800]   China?
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.800]   I believe China might be one of my no Saudi Arabia, that's for sure.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.800]   Some African countries.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.800]   And for some unknown reason, Brazil.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.800]   And a few others.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:35.800]   And they're trying to do all kinds of stuff that apparently architecturally can't be done.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.800]   And the ICANN people are freaked out about it.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.800]   Well, the real fear is that you get these governmental agencies starting to rely on engineering topics.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.800]   You know, they don't have any reason to...
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.800]   Well, it's this Internet is going to fall apart.
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.800]   But you have to understand real stuff.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.800]   We may have an attack on all you can.
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.800]   This Internet is going to fall apart.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.800]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:56.800]   I felt this way for a while.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.800]   I think the problem is a lot of that.
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:24:59.800]   Is there another Internet to take over?
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:03.800]   No, I think maybe, you know, maybe the academic one they're building Internet.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.800]   Back to BBSs.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:06.800]   Who knows?
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:11.800]   I just think that there's a potential, like when I got my blog banned by these filtering guys.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:16.800]   And every major corporation in the country was like banned my blog from...
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.800]   Which is because it was all of a sudden a sex blog.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.800]   And there's no recourse for this.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:21.800]   I got no sex on this blog, folks.
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:22.800]   I'm sorry about that.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.800]   Is there any...
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:24.800]   Well, you got some sexy pictures.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:28.800]   Yeah, while the recourse was contacting public relations agency and bitching and moaning.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:29.800]   And then it was gone.
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:30.800]   Oh, they fixed it.
[00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:31.800]   Yeah, they fixed it right away.
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:34.800]   But, you know, it still be worth suing them.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.800]   You still have some power.
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.800]   I think a lot of other people would, you know.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.800]   It's the same thing with this email black whole thing.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.800]   There's no recourse.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:41.800]   There's just shady fellows.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.800]   Right, and in this split we had this last week between...
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.800]   Let's talk about level three and...
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:47.800]   There's a level seven or level seven.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:48.800]   Level three and cogent.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:53.800]   Just briefly to summarize the story cogent is a web hosting company.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:26:00.800]   They do a lot of porn sites, but they do sites like Synlib, which is the big, big podcast site.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.800]   And they had a peering arrangement with level three, but no one else.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.800]   So essentially...
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.800]   Right, which is like, well, that's not how you're supposed to...
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:08.800]   Hello.
[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.800]   Essentially, level three was freely giving them all their bandwidth.
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.800]   And level three's been complaining about this for a while, like six months ago.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.800]   They sent them a note saying, "You've got to stop doing this, guys."
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:23.800]   Because, you know, the idea of a peering relationship is it's an equal partnership you give as much as you get.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.800]   And these guys were just using all of level three's bandwidth and, you know, not giving any back,
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:29.800]   because they weren't connected to anything else.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:30.800]   Right.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.800]   So level three pulled the plug on Thursday or Wednesday.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.800]   You know, a few people affected.
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.800]   Our friend Steve Gibson was off the air.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:38.800]   Well, as you can be.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.800]   And the Log X, you know, so there were people that were affected by this.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.800]   They broke her to deal on Friday late and they got it back on.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:49.800]   But it just shows you the fragility, it's your point exactly, of the internet.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.800]   You could just pull the plug on these guys and you cut off ten thousand websites.
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:57.800]   The thing is, years ago when BoardWatch Magazine was still in existence, they did a study on peering.
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:00.800]   And they showed all the different... they mapped all the peers.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:05.800]   And back then you'd have the big companies were MCI and Sprint and these big back-fold companies.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:10.800]   And they had... Sprint had some unbelievable number of peers.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.800]   They had like twelve hundred companies that they were sharing with.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:14.800]   So that's very redundant.
[00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.800]   And the whole internet was like this really nice web that was designed.
[00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.800]   And very slowly we get... as we get more and more consolidation, there's less and less of these players.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:26.800]   And when it gets down to a few hundred and then maybe gets down to like two guys,
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.800]   "Hey, where you go from there?"
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:29.800]   It's fragile.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.800]   It's fragile in a lot of ways people don't really address.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.800]   Well, there was one point I think it was either Nebraska or Montana.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.800]   There was essentially one connection to the rest of the internet.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:40.800]   And everything else inside the state was essentially running through that connection.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.800]   A lot of third world nations, it's like that.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.800]   They have one, you know, T1 for the entire country.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.800]   And it's all gone through there.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:48.800]   No, I'm not kidding.
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.800]   You think I'm joking.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:50.800]   Yeah, it's like that.
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:51.800]   It's one...
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:56.800]   Have you ever seen that Simpsons episode where they have the internet thing and they go through the Cisco router?
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.800]   You ever seen the...
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.800]   It's one... it's a classic.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:00.800]   I got it.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.800]   I'm going to have to put it on.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.800]   Let's put it on a button.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.800]   But anyway, they show that... they show that...
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.800]   Marge Simpson says, "Can you say stuff like that on the internet?
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.800]   You know about porn."
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:15.800]   And so they hit the button and then you see the data go flying, not like a million go high miles through the city.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:20.800]   And then it goes to a box that says Cisco router with two flies buzzing around.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:26.800]   Some guy is sleeping and then the data just gets stuck in there for about a minute and it takes off again.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:27.800]   That's probably...
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.800]   What did they do?
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:33.800]   What did Cisco do to... to irk these guys at the Simpsons?
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.800]   That's what I love about them though, is that these guys at the Simpsons...
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.800]   There's a lot of in-jokes like that where they're just really pretty smart guys.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.800]   Most of them I think come from Harvard.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:43.800]   Yeah, I have it.
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.800]   I think it's a pretty... that's a funny comment.
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.800]   Oh, the writers are a family guy.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.800]   Just incredible.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.800]   I won't let my kids watch that stuff.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.800]   Family guy's pretty rude.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.800]   It's rude.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.800]   But Stewie, you've got to love Stewie.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.800]   It's rude, but you'll laugh pretty damn hard.
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:58.800]   That's funny.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:03.800]   So what did the ICANN folks say about this United Nations attempt to take over the Internet?
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.800]   They're worried they don't like it.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:05.800]   Yeah, and they think that there's something...
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.800]   The public's unaware of it and it's going to screw everything up.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.800]   It's all got to come to a head in the couple weeks.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:12.800]   The other thing is the ICANN guys have always been getting...
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:13.800]   I've always got a bad rap.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.800]   If you go down and visit them, they're down to the San Diego area or some Newport Beach area.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.800]   That's where John Postel used to be with the IANA.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.800]   Right.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:22.800]   But that's very much like the Simpsons.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.800]   It was one guy in San Diego who was responsible for all the names and numbers of the Internet.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.800]   Yeah, well, they...
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:28.800]   It was working.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.800]   It worked for it.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:33.800]   But anyway, you go down there and they have this really a self-effacing place.
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.800]   They don't have big offices.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.800]   There's not a lot of money being spent.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:37.800]   Everybody's pretty sincere.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.800]   There's a lot of engineers there.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:39.800]   It's actually pretty cool.
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.800]   I was impressed by the fact that it was like so down to Earth.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.800]   It wasn't like a fancy government operation.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.800]   If you go to ICANNWatch.org, which is one of the sites, it's kind of anti-ICANN.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:51.800]   Read about the...
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:52.800]   I was kind of on there.
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.800]   I would have been more that way until I actually did more.
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.800]   I was just in case scenario for this whole situation now.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:57.800]   The Internet falls apart.
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:58.800]   Really?
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:29:59.800]   Literally.
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:03.800]   Or am I just splitting two with one US centric, one in one...
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:04.800]   Yeah, some of my...
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.800]   If all kinds of weird things are going to be good.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:11.800]   If I'm somebody not in the United States, I think that's not such a bad thing.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.800]   Why should the US be writing?
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.800]   That's the problem.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:15.800]   I think the problem is all of it's dictated by politics.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.800]   Because we've done such a good job of it.
[00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.800]   I mean, theoretically, yeah, sure all the US know big bullies.
[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.800]   But we haven't like screwed it up.
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.800]   I mean, as far as I'm concerned, the US should be running this thing.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.800]   We're the ones who basically invented it.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:29.800]   We're the ones who maintained it.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:30.800]   We're the ones who make it work.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:31.800]   Until such time as we screw it up.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:32.800]   We're not going to screw it up.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:33.800]   Who's going to screw it up?
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.800]   Are these boneheads from Saudi Arabia?
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:36.800]   I like it all.
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:40.800]   If it's been designed properly, security would be built in and blah, blah, blah.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.800]   And basically for all these scenarios, nobody could have envisioned it in 20 years.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.800]   Of course.
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:45.800]   You know?
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:49.800]   So you guys aren't just jingoistic chauvinistic United States flag waving.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:50.800]   I am.
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:51.800]   Patriots.
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:52.800]   Well, he is, but not me.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.800]   I, I, I, I, I believe a lot of it is just politics and it's just one way to kind of.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.800]   It's all life as politics.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.800]   I mean, that, that, that, it's a bad thing.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:01.800]   I can tell you that for a fact.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.800]   All I can say is just clench.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:04.800]   Okay.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:05.800]   Just clench.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:07.800]   I'm going to go buy a G suit.
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:08.800]   Go buy a G suit.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:13.800]   So the, so the, so the, the internet is, as we, we know it may be doomed.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.800]   But now the world relies on such a great degree on the internet.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.800]   Wouldn't that cause economic chaos?
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:20.800]   It doesn't matter.
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.800]   As long as the US gets screwed in it, it's, it's good.
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.800]   There's some element of truth in what it says.
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:26.800]   I'm serious.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.800]   You think it's funny, but it's, that's, that's, that's, that's.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.800]   I said there's an element of truth in what you say.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:31.800]   No, I don't think it's funny.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:32.800]   I think you're, you're probably right.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.800]   So what do we do?
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.800]   I don't know.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:35.800]   Turn them off.
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:36.800]   The lights.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.800]   All that one guy that you flip this switch.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:39.800]   Well, there goes.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:40.800]   So Europe.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:41.800]   So meanwhile the upshot of.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:42.800]   You do that.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:44.800]   There's a reason.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:45.800]   I never want Roger.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.800]   I like about this.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:50.800]   This is why we need more arch villains.
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.800]   I am going to shut off all of France.
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:54.800]   Just don't start the model.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.800]   I've got one million dollars.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.800]   So Rick Bouchure is getting in on this, of course.
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:00.800]   Why not?
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:04.800]   He is the member of Congress always seems to have something to say about this.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:05.800]   Now he's proposing.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:06.800]   Bouchure?
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:07.800]   Boucher?
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:08.800]   I always say Bouchure.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:09.800]   Jerk, I can't remember.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:10.800]   Sorry.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:15.800]   He's suggesting a modification to the Telecommunications Act.
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:20.160]   He's a Democrat from Virginia sits on the House Committee that handles telecommunications
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:23.800]   law to prevent the kinds of outages we just saw with cogent and level.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:25.800]   That's right.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:26.800]   It was going to have to be something like that.
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:27.800]   So do we need a government owned backbone?
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.800]   Well, that's what it used to be.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:33.800]   Until ten years ago in the National Science Foundation said it's the free internet.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.800]   No, there has to be a system for these shutdowns.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.800]   So when the shutdown takes place everybody's protecting the interim.
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.800]   That's what, you know, I don't know.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:44.800]   You see this thing that's doing where all the news is.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.800]   You know, kind of shows how all the news is connected.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:48.800]   That's just terrible.
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:49.800]   I just saw this.
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:50.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:51.800]   It's just horrible.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:52.800]   It's live plasma.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.800]   It's like that, you know, the woods that the source of the...
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.800]   Oh, the virtuals around.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:58.800]   Yeah, the brain.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.800]   You think about the brain.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:00.800]   The virtuals of the source.
[00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:03.800]   The problem with the brain is you have to manually figure it out.
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:11.800]   Actually, there's a search engine called CAR2, K-A-R-T-O-O that does that.
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.800]   It's actually kind of fun to watch.
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:21.800]   We should explain, I'll put a link in the show notes, but we should explain that what we're talking about is how these sites that show how everything is interrelated and then they draw these.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:22.800]   Yeah, it's totally meaningless crap.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:23.800]   It is meaningless.
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.800]   It doesn't give you any more information.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.800]   Actually, there's some really good stuff.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.800]   There's a bunch of stuff that came out of...
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.800]   Out of...
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.800]   Out of...
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.800]   2.0?
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:32.800]   No.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:33.800]   Actually out of the...
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:34.800]   My mom was trying to switch off the source.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:35.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:36.800]   She does.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:37.800]   I like it too.
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:38.800]   It's not the paid service.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:40.800]   Patrick Finartio is drawn on math.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:48.800]   But signals intelligence processing for, you know, sayin' stuff where they actually throw some really heavy intelligence at it and it does amazing stuff to information processing.
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.800]   It makes it very...
[00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.800]   You can basically parse through huge amounts of information.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:53.800]   That's always really common.
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:54.800]   Here's Devore.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.800]   I'm not expecting that.
[00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.800]   Here's what you're describing on CNET.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:58.800]   Here's Devore.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:33:59.800]   Here's John.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:00.800]   Here's PCMag.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.800]   Here's Devore.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.800]   Keyboard.com.
[00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:03.800]   I don't know how it got over there.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:04.800]   It shouldn't even be...
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.800]   Maybe because it was mentioned in the magazine.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.800]   This is new.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:08.800]   I haven't seen a new layout.
[00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.800]   It looks like a...
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.800]   It looks like a...
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:11.800]   It looks like a...
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.800]   It looks like a cancer.
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.800]   It looks like a tumor.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:14.800]   Yeah, it doesn't...
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:15.800]   Organizing the internet.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.800]   No, that's pretty cool.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:17.800]   Anyway...
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:18.800]   This is Cartoon.com.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.800]   Check it on your spare time.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:21.800]   This is fun.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.800]   I don't know what you do with it.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.800]   You do.
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:24.800]   I don't know if that's how things are done.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:25.800]   I've never actually...
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:32.800]   You know, the problem with doing a lot of these obscure... using obscure engines is that, generally speaking, they don't really bring anything to the party that Google hasn't already brought.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.800]   Cartoon's default is UK pages.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.800]   So when you...
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:36.800]   If you do a search on Cartoon...
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:37.800]   I was trying to find it.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.800]   I was trying to find it and it was like...
[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:40.800]   It's like animated porn, mate.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:41.800]   Oh, really?
[00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:42.800]   What's that?
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:43.800]   I don't know.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:44.800]   I animated porn?
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.800]   No, no, no.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.800]   I don't know.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.800]   I was called the movie.
[00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.800]   I've never made it.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.800]   So it's called a film.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.800]   No, it's a cartoon.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.800]   The animation.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.800]   Oh, my God.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:53.800]   The movie.
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:54.800]   The pictures.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:55.800]   Move.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:56.800]   That's what you can do.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.800]   I think it should make money off that.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.800]   It's a believable...
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:00.800]   I'm going to say it's a compromise position.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.800]   It's not going to help me.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.800]   I can't use this anymore.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.800]   You guys...
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:06.800]   You guys...
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.800]   So Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Gooba Neta, signed along on Friday.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:15.800]   It said, "You may not sell adult games to teenagers in California.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.800]   If you're under 18, you can't get an MA game."
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:18.800]   There's a 1500.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.800]   What does this mean?
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.800]   It means Leland E finally got what he wanted.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.800]   More control over the game.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.800]   Grab your parents' credit card, go online and do your shopping.
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.800]   It means everybody just buy it out of the state.
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.800]   Well, it's going to be like...
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.800]   I mean, come on.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.800]   It's so hard to control kids drinking alcohol.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:34.800]   Like having somebody...
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.800]   Dude, can I give you 50 bucks so you buy me a copy of Insert Name Here?
[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.800]   Oh, look dude.
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:39.800]   How do you get that to you?
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:40.800]   Yes, usually.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.800]   They'll be standing out in 50 bucks.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:47.800]   And they're marking lots of electronics boutiques, trying to get adults to buy them copies of Grand Theft Auto.
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.800]   Hey, it's got to be a guy saying, "Hey, buddy."
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:50.800]   My parents are just going to buy it out of the way.
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:51.800]   No, what they're going to do is boot-lay it.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:52.800]   I can't think of one title.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.800]   You know what?
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.800]   Have your parents start a Gamefly account and you just put it in the queue.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:57.800]   That's true.
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:58.800]   You can do it from Gamefly, just rent it.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.800]   I mean, what game, even if it has a mature rating right now, I can't think of one title, popular title anyway, that...
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.800]   I wouldn't let a teenager play.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:06.800]   Well, who's playing them?
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.800]   It's not everybody's eyes.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.800]   No, but you have to have a great time about M for Mature.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.800]   Right.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:14.800]   You have to have an idea since you're 17 and over because that works so well in movies keeping kids out of R-rated movies.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.800]   I got carded ones going into a movie thing.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:17.800]   I thought it went on.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.800]   It wouldn't let me in.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.800]   I thought it went on her first day.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.800]   I thought it went on her first day.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:21.800]   I didn't say it was but she doesn't listen.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:22.800]   She went on her first day last night.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:29.800]   My wife calls the theater and says, "Now, you don't let children into R-rated movies without ID, right?"
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.800]   And the woman says, "Oh, no, of course not."
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:37.800]   And then she says, "And if you see them necking in the back of the theater, you stop them right?"
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.800]   And she says, "We certainly try."
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.800]   And my wife hangs up happy.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.800]   So sometimes this information is helping people with what they want to hear.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.800]   No kissing.
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.800]   No kissing.
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.800]   No kissing.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.800]   No kissing.
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:54.800]   Well, they're already in there with the night vision cameras looking for people recording the films anyway.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.800]   They're more worried about that, frankly, the people neck it in the back.
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.800]   I think they're doing both.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:00.800]   Yeah, well, actually...
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:06.800]   It's like that study that was done by a pen teller in that B.S. show that they do, called Bullshit,
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:10.800]   where they set somebody up to monitor something like this.
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:15.800]   When, meanwhile, they had somebody making out next door so they took the cameras and they very slowly gravitated over to there.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:18.800]   And meanwhile some terrorist activities taking place.
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:19.800]   Exactly.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:20.800]   And that's what the agent is.
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.800]   Somebody's watching for the guy making a booth like who cares.
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:27.800]   How long before they check you for a camera phone?
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:32.800]   I mean, as the quality of these things goes up, how long before they say, "I'm sorry, you can't bring your camera phones?"
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:33.800]   Well, it's not going to be that.
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:34.800]   I had a worse premiere at the time.
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:35.800]   I was.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:36.800]   They searched every single person.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:37.800]   I've been to it.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.800]   I've been to it.
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:39.800]   Anything.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.800]   I've been to it.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.800]   I've been to it.
[00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.800]   I've been to it.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:43.800]   Would they confiscate one of these?
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:44.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:45.800]   They confiscate everything.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:46.800]   Can't you get it back after?
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.800]   What do they have, like, special lockers?
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.800]   It was such a pan but there was like, you know, a thousand seat movie theater and, I don't know, 800 seat movie theater.
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:51.800]   Everybody was checked and any cameras or cell phones or anything.
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.800]   But that was before it was released.
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:38:00.800]   And boy, you know, you get one of those camera phone films put it on the net and you have the Star Wars.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.800]   No, it was made about that right at the time.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.800]   It was a climatic moment.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:03.800]   The phone rings.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.800]   I just hate that one that happens.
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:05.800]   When you're shooting them.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:06.800]   Yeah, right.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.800]   The camera falls.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.800]   The half a pixel, whatever, shooting that.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:14.800]   You know, if those phones didn't light up so bright, I'm sure more people could get away with it.
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:17.800]   I was at a U2 concert in Canada and, you know, people don't have lighters anymore.
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.800]   So Bono said, "Everybody open up your phone."
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.800]   And actually, it was quite beautiful.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:23.800]   It was quite beautiful.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:24.800]   Isn't that a conversion?
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.800]   Sure interesting to me is why you'd be at the concert in the first place.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   I love U2.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:29.800]   Oh, really?
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:30.800]   In the name of the phone.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.800]   Me too, thank you.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:32.800]   That's what my wife said.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.800]   She said, "I love U2."
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:34.800]   And I said, "Thank you."
[00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:35.800]   And she said, "No, I mean, the group.
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:36.800]   I don't love you."
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.800]   She doesn't listen either.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:39.800]   I take it.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:40.800]   I do.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:41.800]   I cried.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.800]   No, she wants to do her own podcast, though, you know.
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:44.800]   Everybody wants to.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.800]   I got a thing from Em Audio, a new podcast in a box set up.
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.800]   Looks pretty good.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:49.800]   I was going to bring it.
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:50.800]   It's good stuff.
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.800]   Em Audio does great stuff.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:52.800]   They have a lot of nice stuff.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:54.800]   It's like a firewire box or something.
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:39:01.800]   It's a firewire box, a mixer, a microphone, and software that apparently allows you to...
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:02.800]   Edit audio?
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:03.800]   Maybe.
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:04.800]   No.
[00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:05.800]   It shouldn't be that.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:06.800]   It's not that it's about time.
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:07.800]   You have to whip out the soccer box.
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:15.800]   So anyway, it makes the Creecy RSS linkage just right.
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:16.800]   Oh, that's what you mean.
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.800]   That's what it actually works.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:18.800]   It's great.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.800]   If it works, I haven't used it yet, but Em Audio has good stuff.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.800]   Check it out, Em Audio.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.800]   You can feed it.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.800]   We're using a Prosonus FirePod now.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.800]   We'd say that we covered the mixer and we're...
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.800]   FirePod just takes a mic input and turns it to Firewire, sends it to the laptop or recording
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.800]   it on a laptop.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:34.800]   So we now have somebody who knows what he's doing.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.800]   I take it as opposed to me.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.800]   Well, I didn't say that.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.800]   But yeah.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.800]   Okay.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:41.800]   Here, have a twit pen.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.800]   So, in honor of your...
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:46.800]   Can we do better than this?
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:47.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:48.800]   It's a pretty cheap pen.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.800]   It's the same kind of pen my dentist gives me.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.800]   We've got to get some German guys to make these pens.
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:54.800]   German engineer pens.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.800]   We want to pay 14 dollars.
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.800]   So, is Chris Horr from Text America?
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:39:59.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:00.800]   Nice aptly named.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.800]   Is this it?
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:02.800]   Senes, it's...
[00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.800]   Whoa!
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:04.800]   Time out!
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.800]   What was that?
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.800]   It's all he said.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.800]   It's definitely a pun.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.800]   What's his...
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.800]   What's his...
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.800]   I'm more blogging this.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:11.800]   Look at this.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.800]   Hey, he's got all the sizes.
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.800]   He's got medium, large, extra-large and programmer.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.800]   Let me get that big.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:18.800]   This is...
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.800]   Who would...
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:20.800]   No geek would fit that, right?
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:21.800]   Yeah, I go...
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.800]   That my daughter's getting that.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:23.800]   Oh, there you go.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:24.800]   All right.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.800]   Anyway, thank you, Chris, in Text America.
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.800]   And thank you for delivering this, Michael O'Donnell.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.800]   He's our Radio Shack contact.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:34.800]   If you ever need batteries, I can get you in the club.
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:36.800]   X, did they still do a battery club?
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:37.800]   Battery club, yeah.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.800]   That took me that long to get that joke.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:40.800]   Seriously.
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.800]   I forgot all about that battery club.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:46.800]   That's back in the days when you'd get SNH green stamps for shopping at the guest.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.800]   Right, and they compete.
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.800]   They compete about the blue stamps for the blue stamps.
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:54.800]   You get seven batteries, but they only come at six battery packs, so they take a new one and they tear it off.
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.800]   That's the good thing about the battery club.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.800]   Yeah, the first rule of battery club.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.800]   Don't talk about the battery clubs, right?
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.800]   It's all callbacks today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.800]   Charvents, all over the dark.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.800]   Microsoft shipping its patches on Tuesday.
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.800]   Only one critical patch.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:14.800]   Windows.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.800]   Windows.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.800]   Yeah, the whole thing is a critical patch.
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:18.800]   Windows.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:23.800]   But there's a new version of the Microsoft malicious software removal tool.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:25.800]   Yeah, it keeps coming out over and over.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:26.800]   What is it?
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.800]   Is it anti-virus or what?
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.800]   It's anti-spyware supposedly.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.800]   It's actually, I think, it's just a little bit.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:32.800]   That's just the removal tool.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:35.800]   They have the separate beta for this spyware prevention tool.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:36.800]   Right, actually.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.800]   Don't go on, they bought from giant.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:38.800]   Is that it?
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.800]   No, I thought that was this.
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:41.800]   It's the same thing.
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.800]   Well, if you go to microsoft.com/spyware, you could know.
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:44.800]   No, anybody know?
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.800]   The anti-spyware is the giant one.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.800]   I don't know what this is.
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:48.800]   I thought that was the giant one.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:49.800]   It's probably a placebo.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.800]   It makes you feel bad.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:54.800]   It's been removed.
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.800]   It's been removed.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.800]   There haven't been that many patches.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.800]   There's one last, more critical patches.
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:09.800]   Well, ever since the scam, the great idea, the guy who reversed engineered the patch, in other words, Microsoft brings out the patch and you say, somebody looks at the patch and says, you know, I bet you only have to pick up the patch.
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.800]   I bet you only have to use these things.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.800]   I'll just use reverse engineered patch to create the bad thing.
[00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.800]   Right, right.
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:16.800]   That's a great idea.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:17.800]   It's genius.
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:18.800]   They've been doing that for a while.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:19.800]   Now they're freaked about making it.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:20.800]   We can't really catch.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:27.800]   The guy says, "The guy says there's like three major critical flaws in Internet Explorer and Microsoft just ignores it, basically."
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.800]   No, that's pretty common.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.800]   They'll start back to normal.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:32.800]   It'll break from those.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:38.800]   They also are going to start their subscription protection software thing.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.800]   You subscribe, you pay them and they protect you.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:41.800]   The mob.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.800]   That's exactly what it sounds like.
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:44.800]   It sounds like a racket.
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.800]   Yeah, but if you pay the mob, you're using the stator.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.800]   You're the one who makes the software.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:52.800]   Why are we paying for them to protect us from their software errors?
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.800]   Going to Linux.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.800]   Gosh, I don't know.
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:57.800]   Seems like a good idea.
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:59.800]   It's like a protection.
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:02.800]   Definitely a disincentive for them to fix this code.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.800]   That's a good point.
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.800]   It is kind of a conflict of interest.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:07.800]   I'm writing about it.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.800]   Yeah, would you please?
[00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:10.800]   Modchips are legal.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:11.800]   In Australia.
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:12.800]   Let's all go.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:13.800]   Awesome.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.800]   But everything else is illegal in Australia.
[00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.800]   You know, this is the--
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:18.800]   You talked about it.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.800]   It's hard to understand their laws there because you're right.
[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:24.800]   They just don't seem to have a consistent attitude towards copyright.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:28.800]   So in this case, the Supreme Court in-- or the highest court in Australia said,
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:33.800]   "players can legally hack PlayStation consoles and PSP, I presume as well,
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:38.800]   so that you can play games and international copies and other games and so forth."
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:39.800]   It's legal.
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:42.800]   Was there a specific case that took a four-year battle?
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:43.800]   This guy fought so many--
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.800]   It's only four years.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:48.800]   In the Australian High Court, there's no appeal.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:49.800]   That's it.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:50.800]   Says it's okay.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.800]   I never needed a modchip for my PS2, though.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:56.800]   I just used the software stuff that you can just add a hard drive to and
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.800]   done your titles right to it.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:43:59.800]   I love my mod of that.
[00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.800]   I'm not sure what additional benefits you get by.
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:05.800]   I can see the Xbox one, of course, with the hard drive and everything built in.
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.800]   First PlayStation Portable Trojan.
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:08.800]   Do you see that?
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:09.800]   Uh-oh.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:11.800]   It turns your PlayStation Portable into a brick.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:12.800]   Yeah, it supposedly deletes some--
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:13.800]   It's not viral, though.
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:17.800]   I mean, just try to trick people to, "Hey, if you do get this and install it,
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:18.800]   you can play custom titles."
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:19.800]   What kind of--
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.800]   Let's back up on that story.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:25.800]   What kind of product is this that you can do that to?
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.800]   We just run some code and the next thing you know is that--
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:28.800]   That's a good point.
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.800]   It smokes up and blows up and drops the--
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:33.800]   Yeah, but you should blow the rebooted or something.
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:34.800]   I mean, there's got to be something.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:38.800]   If I could trick you into downloading a BIOS upgrade for your PC.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.800]   Well, that's pretty extreme.
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:41.800]   Sure, it's a lot of just--
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:42.800]   BIOS upgrade.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:43.800]   Come on, let's tell you--
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:44.800]   That's not like a--
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:45.800]   This is like a--
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:46.800]   This is like a--
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.800]   Some guy thinks he's downloading a game.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.800]   The next thing you know is machine stops working forever.
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:54.800]   Well, what's interesting is that somebody pointed out online that was basically
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.800]   semantic made a big deal out of this just like they made a big deal out of the first
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:58.800]   Palm OS virus.
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:44:59.800]   Right.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:00.800]   But nobody really has to.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:04.800]   Well, but they released a Palm OS tool like virus removal protection software kit.
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:05.800]   So they're going to do that for--
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:06.800]   Which they sell.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:10.800]   There's been three viruses on the Palm since then, you know, but they're making money off
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:11.800]   of it.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:12.800]   You think it's a scam?
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:13.800]   So what you're saying?
[00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:14.800]   I'm saying they're taking advantage.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:15.800]   It's an untapped march.
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:19.800]   To this day, people come to me and say, well, everyone knows that the virus companies make the
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:20.800]   viruses.
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:21.800]   Yeah, that's B-S-S.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:22.800]   You don't have to.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:23.800]   Right.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:24.800]   There's plenty of--
[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:25.800]   Why buy a cow in the milk is free?
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:26.800]   [laughter]
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:28.800]   A lot of bored teenagers out there.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:33.800]   They busted three teenagers, the kids who did-- what was the name of that worm?
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:36.800]   Some of us TK worm or something.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:40.800]   And was this for trying to make this huge chat room and then like, no, no.
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:41.800]   Well, yeah.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:45.800]   It was a worm that would take over log-- you know, machine to be zombied, log into a chat
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.800]   room and then they could issue a command.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.800]   Two of them in Britain, one of them in Indiana.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.800]   And they're going to jail.
[00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:52.800]   Good.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.800]   Well, it wasn't that big a virus.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:01.800]   Usually, you know, they really blow these estimates of how much these viruses cost at a proportion.
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:06.800]   They say this one costs 5.5 million pounds, which means it was like nobody got it.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:09.800]   It's like nothing.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:10.800]   Okay.
[00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:11.800]   Mm-hmm.
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:12.800]   Next.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:13.800]   I'm pretty much--
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:17.800]   Have you heard of this very obscure story, but I don't know.
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:20.800]   I was thinking about it when you talk about how many terabytes of you are going to need
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:22.800]   a computer to do photo shopping.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:26.800]   This company called Matrix Visas, they're coming out with a lossless compression codec.
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:29.800]   It's supposedly 15 times better than JPEG or up to 15 times better.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:30.800]   I hear these stories every year.
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:32.800]   Yeah, boy, I agree with them.
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:34.800]   I have heard these stories for one-fractal--
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:35.800]   Remember fractal--
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:36.800]   Remember fractal--
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:37.800]   fractals and all that.
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:39.800]   The thing down on the size of a billion.
[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.800]   Yeah, you have to ask these code for three.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.800]   It's an entire picture of a squash and D-sing.
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:46.800]   Everything's there.
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:47.800]   Unbelievable.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:51.800]   This is from some website business, two point on-- so you're probably vaporware of some sort.
[00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:54.800]   It's website business what, two point O?
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:55.800]   Business 2.0.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.800]   Yeah, I think that's the giveaway right there.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.800]   What was wrong with Business 1.0?
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:00.800]   That's my question.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:03.800]   Until they get to Business 3.0, we know it's time to do it.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:08.800]   Business 2.15B.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:11.800]   Google releases a news reader.
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:12.800]   Do we care?
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.800]   Well, a lot of people are--
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:15.800]   I think it's all late to the game.
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:16.800]   And who cares?
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:19.800]   Well, because it's Google, you wouldn't have brought it up if it wasn't Google.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:20.800]   Absolutely would not have.
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:24.800]   That was actually one of the things people talked about at Web 2.0 is if there was any interesting
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:27.800]   Google moving into your area, if there was no point in starting a company.
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:28.800]   Right.
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.800]   And a couple of the people at Google were like, "Hey, you know what?
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:36.800]   A lot of people made a lot of money off of being purchased by our competitors whenever we move into a new area."
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:37.800]   But--
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.800]   Sergey said that they're not going to do an office suite.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.800]   Like, why would they do an office?
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.800]   I know, I never got that story either.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   The whole thing-- and this deal with McNeely, which is just a bunch of--
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.800]   What is that sun Google deal?
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:52.800]   You should read my column in Market Watch last week.
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:53.800]   It talks all about it.
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:54.800]   It's a scam.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:55.800]   It's nothing.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:56.800]   It's a toolbar.
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:57.800]   It's a toolbar.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:58.800]   They already have the toolbar.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:10.800]   Now, they-- basically what it is is Eric Schmidt used to work for Sun as the CTO, and him and McNeely are old drinking buddies, and they needed an excuse to write off a binge.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.800]   So they got together and sat there.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:13.800]   You say that to Market Watch?
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:17.800]   Well, I didn't quite say that, but it said something like that.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:24.800]   And so the two of them got together and they thought they'd jack up Microsoft a little bit with a non-announcement and then go out and have a beer.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:27.800]   [laughter]
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.800]   Wow, I was looking for that story.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:30.800]   I think that's amazing.
[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.800]   Yeah, that's a little-known fact.
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:33.800]   A little-known fact.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:34.800]   A little-known secret.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:35.800]   Beware of the binge.
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.800]   I'll get a call from Sun PR now.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:38.800]   I should just talk to you.
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:39.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:40.800]   I don't know why you say stuff like this.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:41.800]   It's very nice.
[00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:42.800]   It's not very nice.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:43.800]   You're not very nice.
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:50.800]   It's because Sun Microsystems kind of was involved with the Open Office thing, so they're thinking, oh, they're going to get involved.
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:51.800]   I think that's what we're-
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:52.800]   I think we're the rumor.
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:57.800]   And release something that you can use online because everyone, you know, Web 2.0, everything's going to be online, so you don't need your office stuff.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:01.800]   Yeah, you really definitely want to use this online spreadsheet.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:06.800]   I think I'll just recalculate these 5,000 cells and go maybe to dinner.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.800]   [laughter]
[00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:14.800]   All right, let's get some questions from our vast audience here at the beautiful gallery cafe in Nob Hill.
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:15.800]   There's a little microphone there.
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.800]   If you step right up, I like the guy with a nerd t-shirt.
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:19.800]   That's a nice t-shirt.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:20.800]   Says nerd.
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:21.800]   He is a nerd.
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:22.800]   Well, you don't know that.
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:24.800]   He's making the claim.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.800]   We can't be absolutely sure.
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:27.800]   Maybe a bluff.
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:28.800]   Ski San Francisco, come on up.
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:31.800]   You asked me if I've gotten those at the- when the extreme games were-
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:32.800]   Absolutely.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:33.800]   Were here.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:34.800]   Did you ski?
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:35.800]   No, I helped work it though.
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:36.800]   Did you?
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.800]   I was one of the neighbors that tried to make the thing happen.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:42.800]   Big local controversy because they built a ski slope in San Francisco.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:43.800]   It was beautiful.
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:44.800]   Oh, is it?
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:45.800]   Was it?
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:46.800]   Did you see it?
[00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:47.800]   It was awesome.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:48.800]   Incredible.
[00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:49.800]   Some great pictures of dangerous as all heck.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:50.800]   I got lucky.
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:52.800]   I watched the Blue Angels, jumped in my car, came down here.
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:53.800]   I've been up.
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:54.800]   I got one hour of sleep last night.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:55.800]   Wow.
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:58.800]   I've got a TI-FI power book first generation.
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:04.800]   The screen went dead maybe a year and a half ago, but I pretty much use it as a desktop, so I've got an external monitor.
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:05.800]   Right.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:09.800]   Now I've got the blue screen of death and I've done everything to try to fix it.
[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:10.800]   Any clue?
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.800]   I feel so sorry for Windows users.
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.800]   I never get blue screen.
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:17.800]   I never saw blue screen on the Mac either, so I don't know what's going on.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:20.800]   I haven't seen a blue screen of death for- Really?
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:21.800]   Two or three years.
[00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:22.800]   And I know the money- I see them all the time.
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:23.800]   No.
[00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:28.800]   I know the monitor is good because I plugged it into my- I don't see the blue screen of death.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:29.800]   I don't see the blue screen of death.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:30.800]   What is that thing I see on my- I see them- I see them-
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.800]   It's probably flashbacks and LSD trips to the 60s.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:34.800]   Well, that I have.
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:36.800]   There's no blue screen of death anymore.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:38.800]   This is an edict.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:39.800]   Bill Gates is announced.
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:40.800]   There isn't.
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:41.800]   Governor Shire's announced.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:44.800]   This is the same man who gets no spam, so I'm not kidding.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.800]   I have a- You got the blue screen of- I mean really.
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:49.800]   The old-fashioned- Yes!
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:50.800]   I'll take pictures.
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:51.800]   I'm talking to him.
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.800]   [laughter]
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:54.800]   What are you running?
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.800]   You're running Windows 95?
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:59.800]   No, it's a nice XP machine.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:02.800]   And periodically for no reason at all, it just be sitting there running.
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:05.800]   I have a set up, so I have a KVM switch.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:06.800]   I have a couple PCs.
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:10.800]   I have dual monitors so I can- when the Mac is switched up, I have two monitors.
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.800]   But I work and have a Mac and a PC monitor.
[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:13.800]   All right, all right.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:14.800]   Get to the point.
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:17.800]   Just every once in a while, at least every couple of days.
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:20.800]   Did you build the machine?
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:22.800]   Yes, it's when I'm built on the screen saver sometimes.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:23.800]   Oh, there you go.
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:26.800]   Somebody slipped in the blue screen of death code.
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:27.800]   No, it's happening all the time.
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:29.800]   It's probably some software I'm running.
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:31.800]   But you know, that's the point is, yes, they still happen.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:32.800]   He's got it.
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.800]   So what do you- what do you think I should do?
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:35.800]   Get a Mac.
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:36.800]   Read it out.
[00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:38.800]   Can you reinstall the OS?
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:39.800]   Reinstall the OS.
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.800]   Think so?
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:44.800]   The only time you have blue screens of death is if- if- if- if a blue screen of death means
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:46.800]   if something got- if something rings zero.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:48.800]   I've got disk warrior in it.
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.800]   I've done a PRM.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:53.800]   Just not- where you have a new version of it.
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:57.800]   The last version, the new SP-6 or whatever the hell it is.
[00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:58.800]   Load that baby out of it.
[00:51:58.800 --> 00:51:59.800]   Ask mine.
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:00.800]   Kill me.
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:01.800]   Kill me.
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:02.800]   Kill me.
