[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.800]   It's time for Twit this weekend Tech, the show we cover the week's news
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   with a panel of tech spurts.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.800]   That's the worst neologism ever.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.800]   Tech spurts.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.800]   Here's a tech spurt from Tech Burger.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.800]   Mr. Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.800]   Hello Tech spurts.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.800]   I don't know if I want to be a tech spurts.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.800]   That's the worst.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   I've never called you that before and now I'm sorry.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.800]   No, please don't again.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.800]   I apologize.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.800]   That was not intentional.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.800]   Good to see you though Dwight and we were just talking about old times.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.800]   Thank you.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   Because we got an old timer here with us.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   Peter Rojas was a guest of many Twits back when he was at Engadget
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.800]   and Gizmodo.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.800]   Of late he's been a big time investor at Beta Works.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.800]   Small time investor at Beta Works.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.800]   It's so good to see you again Peter.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.800]   It's good to be back.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.800]   I was thinking the first time I was on was, has it been 14 years?
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.800]   Probably.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.800]   The show's only 15 years old.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.800]   You were on early.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.800]   You were on the cottage.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.800]   And by the way, we always loved having you on and your expertise.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.800]   And it's just great to see you.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.800]   I guess the last, since we've seen you last, you've had a few kids.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.800]   Keep having children.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.800]   Keep them busy.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.800]   It's so great.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.800]   Anyway, welcome to the show.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.800]   Welcome back.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.800]   Thank you.
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.800]   Thrilled that we were able to get you.
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.800]   And also thrilled to see Brian McCullough, host of Tech Memes Ride Home Podcast, our resident
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.800]   internet historian.
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.800]   How are things with you Brian?
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.800]   Everything's still kicking over.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   Apparently not as smoky over here as it is where you are.
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.800]   Oh man.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.800]   We're just a mess.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.800]   We're just a mess.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.800]   There's another, yet another fire.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.800]   Croped up over the hill and nap and it's apparently all the smoke is coming this way.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.800]   So even in the studio, it's starting a little smoky.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.800]   We got the molecules on full.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.800]   They're turned all the way up because it's just a messy, messy, messy.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.800]   Last time I did the show, I had that Microsoft Duo to play with.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.800]   I just want to give you an update on that.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.800]   It's going back.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.800]   I loved the feeling of it.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.800]   The hardware was very premium.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.800]   It was really nice.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.800]   It just, it wasn't, I think there were a couple of problems.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.800]   The software didn't really understand the dual screen.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.800]   But I also think because they put a slightly older processor in there, it just didn't feel very
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.800]   responsive or snappy.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.800]   So, and I figured $1,500 for a phone.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.800]   That's just not enough.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.800]   So I thought, why don't I spend $2,000 and get a really nice phone?
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.800]   I feel like what I'm doing is a research project on alternate form factors.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.800]   But I'm drawing a line of the LG wing because that's just cookie.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.800]   That's the one there with the screen flip sideways and there's a little hidden screen underneath.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.800]   But this is the Galaxy Z Fold 2.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.800]   And have any of you played with this yet?
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.800]   Because I have to say, the reviews I've read were very positive compared to the Duo.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.800]   And I kind of agree.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.800]   Leo, I had one for a couple of weeks, did a review of it.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.800]   And my wife loved it more than I did.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.800]   I mean, she was sad to hear that it was going back.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.800]   But it's just, you know, the value for the dollar part of it.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.800]   You can't justify it.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.800]   It's just not there.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.800]   You can't justify it.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.800]   I went around Petaluma.
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.800]   And it's so heavy.
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.800]   It looks elegant.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.800]   It doesn't feel elegant.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.800]   And I just, I don't think you can, at this point, you can justify the cost.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.800]   It feels like a lopsided poorly made sandwich because it's so thick.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.800]   There's a sandwich where they left the meat out.
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.800]   And I was very concerned about the folding screen.
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.800]   Although I have to say, having used it now, my concerns there are kind of alleviated.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.800]   It actually works pretty well.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:35.800]   It feels good.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.800]   It doesn't feel like plastic.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.800]   And while you can see a crease, if I angle it right, when you're looking at it straight
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.800]   on, you really don't see it, it's really fun to take pictures with because it's not as
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.800]   big as an iPad, but it's a big viewfinder.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.800]   So it's kind of fun to do that with.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.800]   But boy, was I nervous taking pictures because I thought, this is $2,000 if I drop it.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.800]   And you know, if you drop it, million pieces.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.200]   But the main point, this is the thing, I've not had one long enough to see if this would
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.200]   be valuable enough.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:11.680]   But for that money, right, the main point of one of these things is when I want a bigger,
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.800]   when I went to a screen real estate, I have it.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.320]   Well, how often does that come up for you?
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.800]   Does it come up enough that it's worse?
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.800]   No.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.480]   So I guess my thought would be this, you know, they talked a little bit about the second generation
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.480]   now.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.960]   They've made the front screen a little bit bigger.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:34.200]   It's still oddly narrow, you know, the aspect ratio is very tall and weird.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.960]   So type on the front screen at all?
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.960]   Yeah, but it's really small.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.040]   It's like kind of cramped, right?
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.200]   Yeah, it's cramped.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:45.680]   So even if you don't need to open it up, you do want to open it up almost always.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.400]   Then it's very feels very spacious, especially contrast to the front screen.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.400]   But then typing on this is weird.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.400]   Now maybe this is just, I haven't, I maybe not figured this out yet.
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:03.760]   But it does a split screen, which I guess kind of makes sense as a split screen keyboard.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.840]   But I wish it would just take the whole bottom up because this isn't any bigger.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.120]   These are still small little keys because it's not using the whole thing.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.040]   It's designing those two hands, you know?
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.400]   Yeah, but you know what else doesn't work?
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.760]   You're not either side.
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.440]   Even though this is the Samsung keyboard, swipe doesn't work.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.880]   It doesn't understand that there's a gap there.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:28.160]   So you can't, it's just, I feel like this is like the same problem I had with the duo
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.840]   essentially was this is such a new form factor.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.240]   Not everything works yet.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:39.680]   Samsung is a lot closer, but you know one should spend $2,000 on a phone that is slippery
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.760]   and made of glass.
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.520]   This is why I thought the LG Wing design actually kind of made sense because you could
[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.600]   you know, rotate the screen up and then have on the bottom part, you could have the keyboard
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.160]   and then you could type and you could still have that wider.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.800]   I'm not saying it completely works, but at least like conceptually you could see the
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.440]   argument for it because you could sort of, you know, have the same typing experience
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.600]   you have on your phone right now but have a bigger real estate.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.200]   Well, I, you know, I traded in the duo to get this.
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.200]   Maybe I'll trade this in.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.680]   You know, a wing.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.680]   Keep going.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.680]   Yeah, it's the quest.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:16.960]   Also, the LG Wing looks a lot like when you have it swapped over like the hand terminals
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.960]   in the expanse.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.240]   Well, there is something to be said for that, isn't there?
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.240]   That's right.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.360]   That's what everybody, that's the end game, right?
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.560]   Everyone wants those expanse things.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.560]   The hand terminals, yes.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.360]   I guess, you know, in a way it would solve the keyboard problems I've had on these because
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.880]   that bottom screen I presume becomes a keyboard.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.880]   Maybe.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.880]   I don't know.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.880]   It's so goofy looking.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:46.640]   I just, it's just, I can't, it's not a dual screen.
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.480]   It's a T screen.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.360]   It's just a weird, it's just weird to me.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.400]   Well, it's the best of both worlds, Leo.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.200]   Oh, the worst.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.700]   Yeah.
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:02.000]   We are, I mean, clearly, and we've said this before, we got an iPhone coming out next
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   month.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   We are a peak phone.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.160]   There's no way phones are going to, you have to go to these weird form factors to do
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.440]   anything different these days.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.600]   What do you think, Dwight?
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.200]   Is it a fool's errands to try to reinvent the smartphone?
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.480]   Are we just perfect now and you should just stop?
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.880]   Oh, no, no, I don't think it's perfect.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.560]   And I think all these experiments are good because what will happen is there will be
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:35.320]   some technology say that comes out of the fold or out of the wing or that will then
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.520]   be perfected by someone else.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:43.160]   You know, Apple, for example, is working supposedly on a folding phone.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:49.200]   And, you know, theirs will be thinner and, you know, there'll be things about it that
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.200]   they do with it.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.880]   But whether that works, I don't know.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:52.880]   What can they do?
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.520]   Do Samsung own this folding screen technology?
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.480]   I mean, they make these screens.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.920]   Are there others that can make, can do this?
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.160]   I think Samsung has talked about selling it to other people.
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.240]   And I see, I vaguely remember, and I'm not going to Google it right now, but I vaguely
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:12.280]   remember there was some discussion of Apple acquiring some folding screens from Samsung.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.040]   But then it's going to be the same screen.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.000]   So it's really going to come down to whether the software can be.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.640]   And here's the good thing.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:23.360]   Unlike Samsung, Apple controls both hardware and the software completely.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.640]   So they don't, they're not, you know, they don't have to make it work on Android.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.320]   So it presumably would work better.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.320]   I don't know.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.320]   But I don't know.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:35.840]   I think that the way technology develops is that people try some outrageous things and
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.080]   other people look at it and go, well, let's use that with this.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.080]   Right.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.080]   And then it works.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.080]   Right.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.960]   And I think this is very much the same.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:48.800]   Well, that's, you know, the case with the, my guess is that Apple might say, be experimenting
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:54.360]   with it, but is waiting for glasses and that they think that I would guess their thought
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:59.320]   is, and I'd be curious what you think about this Peter, that the new form factor is not
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:05.680]   doing more with a single phone, but having glasses, air pods, watch that extend the phone,
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.720]   but the phone stays fundamentally the same.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.280]   It's the computer in your pocket.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:14.040]   And that's, I mean, you can see that that's Apple strategy, which is in a way it kind of
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.680]   mirrors the original strategy that Steve Jobs laid out for the PC as the hub.
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.200]   I was just going to say that.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.200]   All these devices.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.960]   And so it goes back to, I think, 18 years ago or so.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.440]   So now the phone becomes the hub.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.720]   And for a lot of reasons.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.200]   One is you can put a more powerful processor in there.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.640]   You can put a bigger battery.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.320]   You can put the, you know, 5G radio in there.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.400]   It's going to be hard to pack that stuff into the glasses.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.080]   It's going to be hard to pack that stuff into air pods.
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.760]   You know, you can sort of do it in the watch, whether you can get 5G in a watch anytime
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.160]   soon remains to be seen, right?
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.880]   But the idea that like you're having this network of devices that all work together
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:49.560]   and the phone is at the center of them, that appears to be Apple strategy.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.440]   And I think that one advantage that it gives for Apple is it actually makes it harder for
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.240]   people to leave the iPhone.
[00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.240]   Absolutely.
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.040]   Because all of a sudden you have, you know, you got to replace your watch.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.040]   You got to replace your glasses.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.680]   You got to replace, you know, your wireless headphones.
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.560]   And so, you know, the more that they can create this ecosystem of devices that all work
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.760]   really, really well together.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.000]   The harder it is to leave because you got to swap out not just one thing now, but like
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.200]   four, maybe even five.
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.560]   It works in both ways.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.320]   And I want to lock you in for sure.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.960]   So yeah, I think that makes more sense than trying to make a phone that can do everything,
[00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:23.520]   especially since it's pretty clear.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.880]   We've hit the limits on what people are willing to pay for a pocket device.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.040]   I mean, 2000 is way too much.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.880]   1500 people were bitching about the duo being 1500.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.600]   I think 1000 is the sweet spot.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.040]   You know, it's hard to charge a lot more than that.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:42.280]   Yeah, Samsung was charging 1500 for the Flip Z, you know, their, their vertical folding
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:43.280]   phone.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.640]   That, you know, that was too much for that particular form.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.520]   I'm just nervous as hell carrying this around.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.800]   I ought to have it chained to my wrist like they make a case for that.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.800]   I ordered the case.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.880]   It's not out for two weeks.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:59.880]   So I got, I'm in two weeks of fear.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:07.800]   Flying through the dangerous zone with my Samsung folding phone.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.280]   I feel the need to fold.
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.720]   All right, let's take a little break.
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.480]   I want to come back.
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.800]   The reason I want to take a break so early in the show is because we need to check if
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.960]   TikTok still works.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.360]   And I understand the president is having a press conference.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.920]   So maybe I don't know what's going on.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.720]   But welcome to 2020.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.280]   This was supposedly right, a deadline day.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:34.280]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.680]   There's court cases, just a mess.
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.280]   We'll get an update on that.
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.440]   We could, I guess talk about the Apple Watch.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.240]   I have the series six here.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.680]   I just washed my hands.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:45.680]   It scolded me.
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.240]   That's no fun.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:50.040]   We could talk about a big birthday.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.160]   How old do you think Google is?
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.160]   No peaking.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.600]   Oh, I already know.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.600]   You 22.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.760]   Can you believe it's that old?
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:04.120]   Of course, my son's 26, so I guess I can.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.120]   Yeah.
[00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.040]   It just feels like I miss I miss all to this.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.800]   No, when he misses all to visit.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.800]   I'll to this was pretty good at the time, though.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.720]   Or it's time or it's time.
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.240]   I got you know, if you like all the vista, try Duck Duck.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.240]   Go.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:25.240]   It's, you know, it's equally bizarre.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.440]   Or show today, I keep trying Duck Duck.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.480]   Go because I really want to like it.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.480]   But it's basically just being.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.480]   And I'm sorry.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.480]   I can't.
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.640]   I just can't.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.160]   Our show today brought to you by LastPass.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.400]   We got a big event coming up with LastPass.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:42.360]   We're going to have a lot of fun talking about security.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.840]   What we're going to do is we're going to do teams.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.200]   It's going to be a team event.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.400]   We've done a number of events with LastPass October is Security Month.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.160]   October 8th, 1 p.m. Pacific.
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.280]   We're going to do Red Team versus Blue Team.
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.320]   We're going to have hackers versus defenders.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:04.240]   And we've got a really good lineup for this, including Longmeans Sisso, Gerald Bucelt,
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.320]   who's been on all of our events.
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:12.280]   He'll be joined by, I think we're going to make Robert Ballisare an attacker.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.920]   Brian Chi from this week in Enterprise Tech, an attacker.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:21.720]   And then we'll have Jerry, who's a CISO, and the great security guru, Bruce Schneier,
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.720]   as defenders.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.640]   I haven't decided yet who's going to be on what team.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:29.800]   But we'll talk about common attack scenarios and the best way to defend against them.
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.440]   This is going to be not just fun, but I think very educational.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.080]   It'll be almost like a debate format.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.560]   It's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.840]   We're doing that with LastPass October 8th at 1 p.m.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:44.040]   We're big fans of LastPass, not just because they bought the studio naming rights.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.800]   In fact, I've been a fan for almost as long as I've been doing these shows.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.360]   LastPass came out about 12 years ago, something like that.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.360]   And I started using it immediately to keep track of all my passwords.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.600]   Actually, it went well beyond that almost immediately because it's so secure, because
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:03.120]   the encryption is done perfectly so that you only are decrypted on device.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.040]   You never decrypted anywhere else.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.640]   Your password has never transmitted the LastPass.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.840]   So I really trust it.
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:12.840]   It's become kind of a software secure enclave on all my devices.
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.520]   So I don't just put passwords and logins there.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:16.520]   I put everything there.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:21.000]   My driver's license, my passport, when I traveled-- haven't done that on a while, but when I
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.720]   traveled, you always want to bring a copy of your passport, perfect place to store it,
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.720]   in LastPass.
[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.880]   I always have it on me.
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.840]   It's always safe, but it's also secure from prying eyes.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:35.520]   When it comes to business, there is nothing more important than that identity and access
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.840]   management that LastPass provides.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:43.240]   They actually surveyed 700 IT and security professionals in financial services and IT
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.800]   and retail in a bunch of different industries.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:50.920]   Most all of them said their business has been exposed to risk due to poor identity and access
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.920]   management.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.920]   82% said that.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.840]   That's why you need LastPass.
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.040]   The risks are out there.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:02.560]   As we work from home, our employees are outside of the shelter of the workplace.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.800]   They are vulnerable.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:10.680]   You don't want them sharing passwords with one another via text messages or email.
[00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:12.200]   That's why you have LastPass.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.920]   They have a secure and safe way to share passwords.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:22.120]   Of course, employees get that same strong, secure password storage for storing every
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.280]   app and web login they use.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:29.720]   Of course, with single sign on in all of LastPass, your IT always has absolute insight into who
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.520]   is accessing what and where.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:39.640]   Oversight of shadow IT and forcible policies across all password protected accounts, that's
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.840]   LastPass.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.880]   That's what LastPass is all about.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:47.320]   They also have added, by the way, of course, we love to factor in LastPass supports that.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:52.680]   In the enterprise, they now have added multi-factor contextual factors like geolocation and IP
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:58.040]   address so that you really know that the right people are accessing your most valuable
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:03.240]   resources, your web logins, your QuickBooks, your data, your customer records.
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.880]   You've got to keep that stuff safe.
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:14.000]   AES-256 bit encryption, PBKDF2 to make it hard to brute force complete security in the cloud.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   That's why I trust LastPass.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.640]   That's why you should trust LastPass.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.520]   That's why we've been using LastPass in the enterprise for many years now.
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.520]   Thank goodness we've got it.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.440]   It's the number one password manager.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:28.760]   Let LastPass securely manage your users' identity by letting your employees work efficiently
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:32.320]   without making your business vulnerable to cyber threats.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:36.880]   LastPass.com/twit.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:44.520]   LastPass.com/twit because stronger security cannot wait.
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:48.000]   I don't even know where to start with this.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:56.320]   Every episode, it seems like there's something new with TikTok.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.040]   TikTok, of course, went to court.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:02.960]   They said, "You can't ban us.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:10.440]   The DOJ went back to court saying they ruled against three users defending the ban in TikTok
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:17.080]   against the Pennsylvania judges ruling Saturday or citing the Pennsylvania judges ruling Saturday
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:23.160]   against three TikTok users.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:30.200]   TikTok users have requested that the plan be denied, the judge denied that.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.720]   The DOJ pounced on it.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.200]   I thought that today there was a...
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.400]   Brian, how do you cover the news daily?
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:39.360]   How do you even cover this story?
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.360]   Do you know what?
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:45.800]   I said this week, I was like, "Listen, I'm going to throw my hands up in the air after
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.640]   every segment."
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.880]   Here's what I can tell you.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.600]   First of all, at this moment, whenever that press conference is, they're asking him questions
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.560]   about who's playing Biden in the debate.
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:01.120]   Whether we're going to find out or we're having this conversation, what his decision is, I
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.120]   don't know.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.960]   By the way, who is playing Biden in the debate?
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:09.240]   I didn't see if anyone knew the answer.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.520]   I just assumed he wasn't practicing at all.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.520]   That's what he said.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.720]   He said, "I practice every day."
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:20.120]   No, no, I agree with...I thought he wasn't practicing at all because he didn't think
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.120]   you're right.
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.840]   Okay, so here's what we know.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:36.440]   Number one, the deal should in theory be oracle and Walmart to take a percentage.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:41.520]   The problem is the president is saying the percentage is 100%.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.120]   The TikTok should say no.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.080]   The percentage is 20%.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:50.920]   Not only that, apparently the reporting has been that there's not even a term sheet.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:51.920]   Oh, Lord.
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:58.440]   Typically, so everyone, the agreement as it exists has always been an agreement and principle.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:03.480]   When things get floated like this $5 billion fund that the president believes is going
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:08.800]   to go to education and things like this, apparently that's nowhere near the term sheet, because
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.520]   again, the term sheet doesn't exist.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:15.200]   On top of that, if it does exist, it would come after the IPO that would happen if the
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.200]   deal goes through.
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:23.040]   Which would pay for the $5 billion reeducation fund the president's demanding.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.040]   Right.
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:28.480]   Or would come out of payroll taxes and things like that.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:32.760]   It's one of those things where I keep saying something's probably going to happen because
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:39.440]   I feel like there would be a situation where everyone can declare victory and nothing actually
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:44.600]   functionally changed except Oracle maybe got a kind of sweetheart deal out of it.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:49.480]   But I would have thought that that would have happened by now and the fact that it hasn't
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.080]   makes me think that it's never going to happen.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.760]   And then here's the bottom line.
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:58.480]   No matter what happens if Trump right now as we're speaking says, yeah, I accept the
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.040]   20% deal or whatever or no, I insist on whatever if they aren't that out in the end, the Chinese
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.680]   can still say, no.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:05.680]   Right.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.680]   They're the ones.
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.840]   They're the one's as the ultimate veto.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.840]   Okay.
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.600]   And they have said they will say no, right?
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.600]   The current.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.600]   Well, they, yeah, they looked at that and said, you know, we're not going to sign off
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.600]   on this.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.880]   So then there's the federal court, right?
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.560]   Hearing which is happening today.
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.560]   It happened.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.560]   I eat.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.840]   That, you know, where he will say whether he blocks the ban or let's it go.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:28.840]   Okay.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:33.440]   The comments department ban on the app store was supposed to happen at noon Eastern today.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.280]   I don't think that did.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.720]   So I think we're waiting for this judge.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:42.000]   There's one more wrinkle to this in terms of things at all being Kabuki theater.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.760]   So let's say that he announces right now that the app has to come out of the app store
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:54.480]   and Google Play that they can't functionally remove the app from anyone's phones.
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:59.720]   So then the real teeth would be is if no one can do any hosting like that.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.720]   Seafius, or I never know how to pronounce that or whatever, you know, the committee
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:08.360]   of foreign investment in the United States, but that's foreign investment in US companies,
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.520]   not US investment in foreign companies.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.320]   But it's like, it's like a sanction.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:16.480]   So they can say you can't, you can't access your bank account.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.640]   They can't say no financial transactions.
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:22.560]   Well, if you can't do business with them, then AWS would have to say we can no longer
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.960]   host you or something, right?
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.880]   That would kill it.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.960]   There is, don't tell the president, just keep this under your hat.
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:35.160]   Both Apple and Google have a kill switch, right?
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.840]   They can pull apps from your phone.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:37.840]   I think they've done it.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.040]   It seems to me they can kill malicious apps.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:45.560]   So just don't tell the president, but apparently they could if they wanted to.
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.920]   You TikTok could disappear from your phone.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.880]   Here's the only thing I would say we've covered this and I've done the same thing Brian.
[00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:57.480]   Throw your hands up, which is also coincidentally the same thing you do on a roller coaster.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.320]   Throw your hands up and say, I don't know what the hell is going to go on.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:02.320]   Here's what I would say.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.800]   Our relationship with China is complex.
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:09.960]   It is geopolitically and strategically extremely complex.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:15.940]   They own a lot of assets in the United States, including treasury bonds.
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:23.600]   Most US tech companies manufacture their gear in China made in many cases with parts made
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.080]   in China.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.920]   China is an interesting country.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:35.560]   They're treating their Uyghur Muslims very badly in tournament camps and slave labor.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:41.560]   They have definite economic aspirations around the world with their Belt and Road initiative.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:46.640]   They're reaching out much as the United States has done with foreign aid for years to countries
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.880]   and saying, let us help you to co-op them a little bit.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:54.520]   There's intellectual property rights issues with China.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:26:04.200]   But this is a very big, complicated issue that requires strategic planning, diplomacy,
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:14.400]   thoughtfulness, subtlety, negotiation, banning forethought, banning an app is not in any way
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:17.520]   useful to this process.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:20.920]   Do we agree or who wants to say TikTok should be banned?
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.560]   Because we've had a lot of people on this panel.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.600]   I don't have it on my phone anymore.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.520]   Any more than I have Facebook on my phone, but that's a personal choice.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:34.600]   And certainly the Department of Defense has the absolute right and probably burden to say,
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:37.800]   no military person else should have TikTok on their phone.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.360]   I would hope they do the same with Facebook.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:47.000]   One more angle for this being Kabuki theater is that Microsoft, like Chumps, made the
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.480]   mistake of negotiating a good faith and saying, is security your issue?
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:56.360]   While our deal, let us have it, we will solve all of your security issues.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:01.080]   So one of the most frustrating things to me has been, if that was really what the concern
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.960]   was, then it should have been Microsoft.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:09.360]   But apparently, Larry Ellison has held fundraisers for Trump.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.960]   It looks like cronyism, doesn't it?
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:12.960]   It looks like NBC--
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.960]   It looks like revenge.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:14.960]   It looks like revenge.
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:15.960]   Go ahead.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:16.960]   Please, Peter.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:21.960]   Yeah, I was on CNBC a couple of weeks ago to talk about TikTok.
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:27.240]   And when I pointed out the potential corruption in all of this, I started getting death threats
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.240]   immediately.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.240]   Well, that's everybody.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:31.960]   It's a very emotional topic.
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:40.240]   People don't talk about everybody's walking on eggshells here because they're armed people
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:46.080]   out there who will, on either side, maybe, I don't know if there's-- are TikTokers armed?
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.080]   Probably not.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.080]   Probably not.
[00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.400]   They're armed with tide pods, but they're not armed with guns.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:55.880]   But there are people out there who will enforce this stuff by force.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.280]   And so everybody's a little bit nervous.
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:04.400]   I'm more scared, frankly, of the president's supporters than I am of China at this point.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:09.720]   So I really don't know if there's anything more to say about this.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:14.360]   We're just going to watch and throw up their hands.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.400]   I'll make one last point.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.400]   Please do.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:23.960]   But it's that if there are legitimate concerns about data and TikTok's relationship to the
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:29.200]   Chinese Communist Party and what happens to user data, I think that those concerns need
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:33.000]   to be addressed at an industry level via regulation, right?
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.880]   A set of rules that everybody, Chinese American companies all have to adhere to.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:38.160]   Because it's not just TikTok.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.160]   It's also Facebook.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.160]   It's also everybody.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.160]   Absolutely.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:47.960]   But if somebody wants to get data from TikTok users or Facebook users or whatever platform,
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.160]   you can usually get that through some sort of third-party data broker.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:56.000]   And that is an extremely, very lightly regulated market right now.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.960]   I think the average person might be very surprised to find out how much data about themselves
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.160]   is floating out there.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:07.360]   And I think with the CCPA, there has been an attempt to sort of address and mitigate
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.360]   that.
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:13.120]   There's very few people are taking advantage of their rights to be able to have their private
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.120]   data deleted.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.280]   I think partly an awareness issue.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:22.120]   And I think partly people don't feel especially threatened about that sort of data versus
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.640]   their DMs being exposed.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:33.560]   And then there's Palantir, which has its IPO on Tuesday.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.480]   They're seen opening about $10 a share.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:48.640]   This is a US company, big investors Peter Thiel, run by Alex Frig, a carp that seems to be
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:56.400]   doing all sorts of data mining on data gathered by US intelligence and police officials and
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:59.040]   then resold back to police officials.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:03.720]   Things like pre-crime reports.
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:10.440]   I mean, China is not the sole owner of these kinds of technologies.
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:13.560]   We're very actively participating this.
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.760]   You got your bid in for your Palantir stock there, Peter.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.680]   You're going to stock up?
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.680]   No.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.040]   In fact, I actually don't.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.040]   I don't try to play the stock market game at all.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.720]   I mean, I own some public stocks, but it's managed.
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:33.000]   Given how old Palantir is as a company.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.600]   They've never made penny one, by the way.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:42.120]   Their revenue growth is not as it's kind of now what could happen given the recent stock
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:47.520]   market stuff is all the kids on Robinhood could shoot this thing to the moon.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.000]   That's a story too.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   I love that.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.120]   We should probably go into the Robinhood story at some point.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.120]   Go ahead.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:58.120]   I mean, I never interrupt you.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.120]   But that's a good point.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:00.600]   That's why the stock market's so unpredictable.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:05.520]   Under normal circumstances, this would be a sort of, eh, I wouldn't put my money in that.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:10.840]   But then at the same time, there were different snowflake was a different case because if
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:15.720]   he got Warren Buffett making his first tech IPO estimate ever, that would do something.
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:20.440]   But it is so much of the stuff has been this momentum trading with, they always say that
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:25.640]   the young people on Robinhood, but whatever, if anyone on Robinhood, it's like it's back
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.440]   to the day traders of the late '90s.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.440]   All right.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.880]   Well, I know.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:41.720]   So there's two areas that we probably don't have the expertise, the tech spurts to delve
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.440]   into one is politics, the other is the stock market.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:52.760]   So I will move on, both seeming complete at this time anyway, completely incomprehensible.
[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:59.800]   I'm just watching to see what happens both to WeChat and TikTok.
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:03.040]   We'll see if the judge's ruling comes in, which it should, I think, before the end of
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.040]   the show.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:07.640]   It was supposed to come in sometime before midnight as well.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.640]   Oh.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:09.640]   Okay.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.640]   So it could not be, it could be.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.640]   Yeah, it was the deadline.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.640]   In the middle of the night.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:13.640]   Okay.
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.340]   We just got to keep going on the aisle until we get an answer.
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:20.880]   We're not going to end this show until the judge tells us what's happening to TikTok.
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.120]   That's all there is.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.920]   Okay.
[00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.920]   Let's see.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:32.360]   I'm just looking at, this has been a complex week.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.960]   What do you, Brian?
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:38.400]   You know, it used to be there were rhythms in tech news.
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:43.760]   And you know that we like next week, the new Pixel phone is going to come out and in a
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:47.000]   couple of weeks ago, Apple had their event and it was these kind of rhythms.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.400]   You know what you'd be covering.
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.920]   Now it feels like Whiplash.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.680]   It feels like bumper cars.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:57.160]   And this, I've only been doing it daily for three years, but the summer was usually reliably
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.160]   slow.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.600]   You would think the summer of COVID, it would be slow and it hasn't been.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.840]   And I don't know.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:07.040]   I was, when COVID hit and we all went into quarantine, I always thought, Oh, well, that's
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.040]   it on that.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:13.400]   We're going to be, we're going to be talking about baseball for half the shows or something.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.040]   As it turns out, we're not talking about baseball.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.040]   There's a lot of times.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.520]   And also, I mean, it's not helpful.
[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.800]   This is totally inside baseball.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:26.600]   But when, when Amazon has a hardware event announcing, I don't know, 42 different products
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:30.560]   and they don't stream it and they don't give you embargoed heads up on what they're
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:31.560]   in.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:32.560]   I know.
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:36.440]   It's just, I know I woke up on Thursday, went what?
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.440]   Let's do that.
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.560]   Actually, let's do the Amazon.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:43.600]   That's to the Amazon event because this will, this is the gift that we'll be giving, keep
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.920]   on giving for some time to come.
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.400]   I ordered that weird wristband.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:55.080]   They announced this a few, like a month or two ago that will do emotional temperature
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:58.520]   assessments on you based on your voice.
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:02.760]   Because I really want to know if I'm yelling at my subordinates too often, right?
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.960]   I think not enough or not, or not enough.
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.600]   Leo, you're too nice.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:08.600]   You're too nice.
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.440]   You should be more mean.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:14.120]   That would be funny if it said that somehow I don't think it's going to do.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:19.200]   They announced some very dystopian sci-fi weirdo stuff.
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:27.600]   Let's start by talking about Amazon's sidewalk, a mesh network designed to extend Amazon's
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.120]   reach into your whole neighborhood.
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:33.240]   They already, you know, they acquired ring and they're already getting heat for the
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:37.160]   fact that ring cameras are everywhere, recording everything that happens in your neighborhood
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:39.080]   and sending it off to the police.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.960]   Now they want to do sidewalk.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:46.400]   Do I have you been, can you explain sidewalk to me?
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.400]   No, sidewalk.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:52.600]   In fact, this is the first time that I've heard Amazon's sidewalk when you said sidewalk,
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:53.760]   I thought, "What?"
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:54.760]   Google sidewalk.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:56.760]   Google sidewalk.
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:00.240]   Actually, every major tech company has a sidewalk except for Apple.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.920]   I'm waiting for Apple's sidewalk.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:05.680]   Google has sidewalk, which is their smart city initiative.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:12.480]   Microsoft had sidewalk, which was their local news, right now Amazon sidewalk, which is
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:17.360]   a shared network, a mesh style network that helps.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:22.800]   This is, I'm reading Amazon's copy, helps devices like Amazon Echo, ring security cameras,
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:28.600]   outdoor lights and motion sensors work better beyond your Wi-Fi.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:32.600]   And one of the first things they announced is a sensor you put on your mailbox.
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:38.000]   Many of us who live in more rural areas have mailboxes that are somewhat distance from
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   our door.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:48.040]   It will let you know if the mail has arrived, but it will also expand the reach of the Amazon
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:51.560]   network out to the street.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:56.520]   And they're hoping that everybody who has a ring doorbell and this will make this kind
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:01.560]   of this mesh coverage over the whole neighborhood.
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.400]   They should have called this Amazon note.
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:09.200]   Because no, that's just that's.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.040]   All right, you're going to say how great this is.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:13.040]   No, I'm not.
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:16.480]   I'm going to be devil's advocate in the sense that it's low bandwidth.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:21.680]   I I described it as this is they're trying to build the Internet for the Internet of
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:22.680]   Things.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:28.800]   You know, the use case that they love to tout is that if you have a tracker on your dog
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:32.960]   or your pet or whatever, it would be a lot to stay on the street.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.200]   Each mailbox because I see him.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.200]   I see him.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.200]   I see him.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.320]   But the point is, is that it is super low bandwidth.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:42.640]   Like you wouldn't even notice it if you joined the mesh because it's it's connecting to the
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:45.720]   lights and the ring camera and the whatever whatever.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.680]   It's not you're going to walk down the street and have Wi-Fi ever.
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:49.920]   Oh, God, no, no, no.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.480]   In fact, this isn't going to be accessible to you.
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:53.480]   This isn't for you.
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.880]   This is for the machines.
[00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:58.160]   80 kilobits, not very fast.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.960]   Although I remember having a 56 kilobit modem.
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.600]   It's faster than that.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:08.560]   80 kilobits and it's capped at 500 megabytes a month.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:15.000]   Again, you know, that's 10 minutes of streaming video a month.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:21.080]   I think the trick is going to be to persuade people to participate in this.
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:24.640]   Well, the thing is that it isn't useful unless everybody does it.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:25.640]   Right.
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.440]   What happens to the network then?
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.440]   It's a snaggle tooth network.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:33.120]   That's a good name for it better than sidewalk.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.120]   What happens in the FAQ?
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:38.360]   What happens if there are not a lot of bridges in my neighborhood?
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:43.440]   Amazon sidewalk coverage may vary by location based on the number of participating bridges
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.440]   in the location.
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:49.120]   The more of your neighbors who participate, the better.
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.840]   To be, you know, yeah, I start.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.640]   I was going to be like, are they going to be like parties?
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:55.640]   Like Amazon.
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:01.360]   It's on parties where you invite your friends over and try to sell them on installing the
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:02.360]   stuff.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.600]   This just sounds awesome.
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.720]   This really brings to a head this whole.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.520]   It doesn't sound that crazy to me.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.520]   So that's what I mean.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:11.520]   This brings together a little bit.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.120]   No, but think about how it is practically.
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:18.920]   You know, so for example, if you're in Houston and you've got these houses that are each
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:25.520]   on a quarter acre lot and there's 700 of them in a neighborhood and maybe a third of
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:29.640]   them have it and they're distant from each other, it's worthless.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.000]   You got to have the only way it works.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.080]   Yeah, you know, I mean, has wider coverage in the suburbs.
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:37.680]   And if it has, and if it's got strong, it's got better.
[00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:42.240]   But if you have an active an accurate, an accurate echo device or a ring camera or a
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:47.520]   ring spotlight, they are all bridges.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:50.080]   Now I imagine there'll be a switch turning on and off.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:53.280]   The question is it will default beyond.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:58.480]   I traded in my ring doorbell because of this whole, given the video to the cops thing,
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:59.480]   maybe very nervous.
[00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:04.360]   I got a Google, a Google hello doorbell, which has its own problems.
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.800]   It recognizes people.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.680]   It says, John's at the door.
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:08.680]   You want to say hi?
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.920]   It's like what?
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:13.560]   So in fact, it even says it even has a warning when you set it up.
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:16.080]   This may not be legal in all states.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:22.440]   So it can solve your local laws because it has face recognition in them.
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:27.480]   Really, listen, not to push things along too quickly, but then we've got to get to the
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:28.840]   drone sentinel inside your house.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:29.840]   We're going to get to it.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:30.840]   Don't worry.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:31.840]   There's plenty more.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:40.200]   We're just beginning with the wildest Amazon event ever and they have had wild events.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:46.200]   What I was going to say is this epitomizes the tension between privacy and convenience.
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:50.480]   And I think that that's going to be the story of the next five years of technology is,
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.160]   hey, this is really great.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.200]   You know, your dog will know where your dog is.
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:56.520]   Will know when you got some mail.
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.720]   I'm sure there'll be other applications beyond that.
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.320]   That's some fairly trivial.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.320]   And yeah, you give up a little privacy.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:06.240]   So it's not that bad.
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:09.080]   Peter, you seem like you were all in on this.
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.080]   I'm not.
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:13.520]   I wouldn't say I'm all in, but I think that we have to separate out the parts that make
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.000]   us uncomfortable and the parts that make us uncomfortable.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.960]   And the fact that there's a mesh network where data is repeating across multiple users
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:19.960]   like this.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.080]   I don't think that is inherently problematic.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:25.120]   The data is almost certainly going to be encrypted anyway.
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:29.200]   And so it's not like you're going to have access to your neighbor's data as it passes
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.200]   down.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.200]   No.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:34.520]   And even if you did, you'd know when their mail arrived or something, it wouldn't be
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.520]   there.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.520]   Yeah.
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:40.640]   It's more like, do we want to give Amazon, for example, or any big company, this level
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:41.960]   of granular data over it.
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:45.120]   But like, I think the reality is we have given up a lot of this stuff.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:49.680]   And again, to go back to the point around TikTok, I think that the only real solve for
[00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.280]   this is at a regulatory level.
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:55.600]   I mean, it's not necessarily the most popular solution or the easy solution.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:58.440]   But I think that is the one that would be the most effective is you have to set rules
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:04.280]   of the road for all these big companies about how they have to treat customer data and protect
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.280]   it.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.360]   And I think without that, one, you have this sort of race to the bottom, right?
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:13.240]   Where one company might sort of might decide, hey, we're going to take these protections
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:18.480]   and if their competitor doesn't, then they're a disadvantage in some respects.
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:21.800]   The premise, though, requires a functional government.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:24.800]   Well, a lot of things require functional government.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:25.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:29.200]   I'm just saying, I mean, that seems like a high bar at this point.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.160]   Not just, I'm not talking about, I'm not talking about Trump.
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:37.600]   I'm just saying, in general, expecting sensible privacy regulation, I guess California did
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:39.760]   a decent job.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.000]   So maybe that's not the case.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.280]   I just feel like it's not impossible, but it is hard.
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:47.080]   But I mean, you could say this about everything that we have regulations.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.080]   It's all right.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:52.880]   It's food or transportation or look, I mean, it wasn't popular to put seat belts in cars,
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:53.880]   right?
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:54.880]   But it was a good thing.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:55.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:58.760]   People talked about it violating their freedom and the simple laws and stuff like that.
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:04.080]   But at the end of the day, there are certain things that happen in the public interest.
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:06.480]   And those things have to be solved at that level.
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:10.160]   I mean, they can't be, they're not things that individuals can solve on their own and
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.160]   they're not business.
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:14.080]   There are things that businesses have the right incentive to solve or address.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:24.600]   So I guess the question one should ask, absent government regulation someday, is why is Amazon
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.840]   doing this?
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:33.120]   I don't think people have been pounding on Jeff Bezos' door saying, I need a mailbox
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:35.640]   sensor.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:36.960]   Why is Amazon doing this?
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.840]   Now I'm going to take a hazard, a guess.
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.880]   You could tell me if I'm wrong.
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.640]   Amazon is driving a lot of trucks around all the time.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:50.040]   I think Amazon would love this mesh network to locate their deliveries.
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:57.160]   I think you're offering your bandwidth to help Amazon be better in logistics.
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:00.120]   You're also building their logistics stack.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.120]   Sorry.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.120]   Go ahead, Brian.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:06.400]   I mean, you've got the camera at your front door.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:07.360]   You've got the sensors.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:12.200]   So like, you know, the Amazon people delivering to our house now, you know, you see them take
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:13.200]   the picture.
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.200]   They love that.
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.200]   I even get a notice.
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.200]   They said they're nine stops away.
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.200]   They're eight stops away.
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:19.840]   They're six stops away.
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:25.160]   Also, maybe this is, and honestly, what's scary about this is this is the best case scenario.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:30.880]   Maybe the best case scenario is that Amazon is convincing all of us to buy and build out
[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:36.000]   the logistics, the stack that they need to make their logistics simpler.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:43.040]   They say things in the Amazon blog post like, just imagine, we're going to do a proof of
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:46.240]   concept with the American Red Cross.
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:50.280]   Just imagine if Sidewood could support the tracking of blood collection supplies between
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:56.280]   distribution centers and donation sites to add new efficiencies within the blood donation
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.760]   supply chain.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:05.040]   That sounds like they really had to dig deep to find a public surface use case for this.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:11.240]   Yeah, that's like they could already do that without Amazon.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:12.240]   Yeah.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:16.280]   No, this has more to do with Amazon's logistics, I suspect.
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:24.040]   But I also think that there is a larger question of, do we want this private company to set
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:30.040]   up a mesh network, kind of ad hoc mesh network over our communities?
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:33.240]   Is that something a company should really be doing?
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:34.240]   No.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:37.880]   Well, it's an ISP question at some level, right?
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:42.960]   I mean, should we have publicly funded or publicly created ISPs?
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:49.160]   The fact that a lot of states are now passing regulation laws banning municipal ISPs.
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:50.160]   That's shocking.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.160]   That's so sad.
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:55.360]   But you can imagine a city saying, hey, we're going to set up one of these low bandwidth
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:57.360]   mesh networks on public infrastructure.
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:01.880]   We're going to cover the entire city and we're going to open it up to any provider and we'll
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:04.240]   charge for access.
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:08.040]   It could be one or I mean, it would require a lot of upfront investment, but for the long
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:12.600]   one, it could be a public benefit for the population, but also our potential source
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.360]   of revenue for the city.
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:20.640]   These are things that, again, requires people thinking ahead and willing to make the investment.
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.640]   And that's really tough.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:24.120]   And that's why a lot of this stuff ends up being done by private companies that have the
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.240]   real resources to do it.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:31.240]   I feel like also not to put you down, Peter, because I'm so glad you're here and you really
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:36.660]   had a good, but I feel like it's a little bit of a cop out to say, Oh, well, the government
[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.200]   should regulate this.
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:44.240]   Like the government, whoever would or do it right and be like, there should also couldn't
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:53.360]   we just stand up and say, no, just don't know what, no, but my neighbors might.
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:54.360]   That's the problem.
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:57.080]   I don't have any, you know, I guess that's where government.
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:58.960]   Well, but we get right.
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:00.120]   Here's the thing.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:05.360]   I look at this and I go, this is, this is the camel's nose under the tent.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:08.080]   And nobody's even like, it's not on it.
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.600]   Nobody's even mentioning it.
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:14.720]   Amazon is proposing putting a mission network over all of our communities that they will
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:15.720]   control.
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:19.920]   They will reap the data from and decide what the data is.
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:24.880]   And they end the, and the, the, the offer that they're making is, well, you'll now, and
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:27.640]   you'll know if your mailbox has been opened.
[00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.600]   It's so bizarre, your dog will be tracked.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.440]   It's so, it's so inconsequential.
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:40.520]   And nobody's saying, golly, this, this is an interesting invasion that Amazon, you know,
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:44.480]   a soft invasion that Amazon is perpetrating and nobody's paying any attention to it.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:49.160]   Or am I, I, my friend, Jeff Jarvis on this week and Google constantly spanks me for moral
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:50.160]   panic.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.360]   So maybe this is moral panic.
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:55.000]   I just feel like this is an odd play from Amazon's point of view.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.560]   There's not enough questions being asked about this.
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:03.400]   And I also think Amazon is taking advantage of a loose regulatory environment right now.
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:05.200]   They've been working on this for a year, but it's time.
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:09.160]   I think they wanted to announce this before the election because their environment is
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:10.160]   pretty loose right now.
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:14.440]   And you can kind of start this thing ball rolling and especially in the fact, in light
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:18.160]   of the fact that they are getting, they're got so much heat for ring.
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:22.760]   And then they got heat because they were listening in on echo recordings.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:26.160]   So they were already kind of, and the government's already, you know, Jeff Bezos got more questions
[00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:30.840]   from Congress than anybody at the antitrust hearings.
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:35.200]   I feel like they're saying, you know, you better get this sidewalk thing going now.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:39.440]   I've asked several people over the last year when I've interviewed them.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:41.960]   Doesn't it feel like Amazon has gotten weirdly aggressive lately?
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:42.960]   Yes.
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:47.520]   Like that like is I've asked people's like point blank is there been like an executive
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:48.520]   turnover?
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:49.520]   Are there new people in there?
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:50.760]   Are there cowboys that came in or something?
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:56.000]   But like even ring was, you know, a reasonable successful startup, but it wasn't blowing the
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.360]   doors off anybody.
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:02.920]   And ever since Amazon acquired them, like they've become almost the ring company.
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:07.720]   Like you never saw Google double down this hard on nest and things like that.
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:10.440]   Like like Amazon has done with ring.
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:14.320]   I feel like half the products they announced were ring related products.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:17.040]   So it's all about to your point.
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:22.160]   They seem to see that there it's the field is wide open to grab the home and grab the
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:26.960]   public space in terms of if we're talking about data and the value of data.
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:28.040]   And so maybe you're right.
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:32.680]   Maybe they're trying to in the Anna Jones style get get out before the door slam shut.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:38.000]   Google's own sidewalk project was kicked out of Toronto because the community said, we
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.760]   know, we don't like the idea of Google having a smart neighborhood.
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:48.280]   This is like so I would I would love to hear from the guys and wise.
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:52.920]   You know, wise is that low cost Internet of things.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:49:00.000]   This company that's a bunch of guys from Amazon left and they're selling, you know, security
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.560]   cameras for inside outside the home for 25 bucks.
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:05.040]   They work good enough.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:09.240]   They just introduced a doorbell and they're adding more and more stuff.
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:15.360]   I would really love to hear from them about what they think about what Amazon is doing
[00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:20.080]   and what they think about both the security issues as well as the privacy issues.
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:21.680]   We haven't talked about security.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:27.080]   What happens if this network if hackers get into this network, if it's breached, well,
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.880]   reach the whole neighborhood is in a why.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:29.880]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:31.760]   I mean, it's not a Wi-Fi network.
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.440]   It's a it's it's kind of like Zigbee or Z wave.
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:40.960]   It's a low bandwidth IOT network, probably not carrying a huge amount of information.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:42.720]   What did you give you on trade to?
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:44.400]   Yeah, but does it get you into that?
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:48.840]   Because it you know, it is the bridge isn't as most of these ring devices as well as your
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:50.280]   Echo devices.
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:55.360]   But I mean, I mean, we could say, you know, what if someone hacks into right Comcast in
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.360]   your neighbor?
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:57.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.360]   There's plenty of ways to get in that.
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.360]   There's no that's not an issue.
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:05.400]   I just think this I think let's let's let's put this in this proper context.
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:07.400]   That just seems like a strange grab.
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:08.400]   All right.
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.760]   I don't think it's like I don't think it's a strange grab.
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:14.400]   I mean, I think like again, Amazon is trying to quantify the physical world.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.400]   Right.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:16.920]   Because at the end of the day, they are logistics company.
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:19.240]   And so this is, you know, there is an opportunity.
[00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:22.960]   And if frankly, you know, if this is going to be something that happens, it's better from
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:27.280]   Amazon's perspective for people to standardize around, you know, sidewalk than if for to be
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:31.680]   Google or Apple or not many other companies that could pull it off.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:37.160]   But but it's better better for it to be Amazon's mesh network than somebody else's.
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:41.560]   Only in the chat or shadow, Shaddexo says, well, Google and Facebook, you don't complain
[00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:42.560]   about them.
[00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:43.560]   I do.
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:47.960]   But the difference to me is this is kind of a watershed moment because all these other
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:51.560]   companies are invading your privacy in the in the internet space.
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:53.040]   This is in meat space.
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.040]   This is them.
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:51:00.480]   Bridging over into the physical world beyond your net.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.920]   But Facebook's going to do that with the AR glasses.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:03.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:04.920]   Everybody.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:07.920]   That's concerning.
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:11.000]   I'd say, you know, somebody with Facebook AR glasses walking around your house.
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.560]   Now Facebook has a model of your ear to your space.
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:19.960]   And you know, that's certainly something that is going to compete because of their
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:23.560]   century drone because right Leo, please do.
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:24.560]   All right.
[00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:25.560]   You really want to talk about the drone.
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:27.360]   I know you want to talk about the drone.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:32.840]   So just real quickly, I do want to address the AR glasses because that's an interesting
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.680]   point.
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:38.600]   Facebook's probably doing the same thing by saying, hey, what if everybody wore a camera
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:40.400]   around for us?
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:41.720]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:43.200]   So you're right, Peter.
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:46.000]   That's, you know, that's not that much different.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:50.800]   That is, that's going to be the, let's say it, that's going to be the next kind of battleground
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.280]   is, is meat space.
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:55.520]   Like, okay, we got all the digital data we could possibly get.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:57.080]   How do we get more meat space data?
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:00.200]   And that brings us to the drone.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.200]   Hold on.
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.200]   Hold on.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.800]   No, no, no, no, you can say something.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:05.800]   Go ahead.
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:06.800]   No, it's a joke.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:09.560]   You just want to derail that conversation one more time.
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:10.560]   All right.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:15.480]   I want to take a break before we get to the drone because I really want to torture Brian.
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:16.480]   But I do, I agree.
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:21.600]   The drone is the silliest, but at the same time, the funny thing is my wife says, let's
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:22.600]   get one.
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:27.880]   So I really, we got to talk about this because it's interesting.
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:28.880]   I showed it.
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:31.240]   They brought to you quite literally by cash fly.
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:34.360]   That's our CDN, our content delivery network.
[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:37.840]   Cash fly is really is one of the pioneers in this space.
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:42.400]   They've been innovating content delivery since the last century, the turn of the last
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.240]   century is 1999.
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:45.640]   We've been using them for more than 10 years.
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:51.040]   Remember when we first started Twit, we were begging people to see the bit torrent stream
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:52.920]   and, you know, we had the web down.
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.000]   We just then that Levine call me from cash fly.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.560]   I said, look, Leo, you need a CDN.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:59.040]   You need cash fly.
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:02.600]   And we have been happy cash fly customers ever since.
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:06.840]   If you never complain that it's hard to, you know, the podcast has slowed it down.
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:07.840]   Thank cash fly.
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:12.120]   I never get a 3am call saying, oh my God, the servers are down.
[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:13.760]   Thank you cash fly.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:16.200]   Cash fly also saves us a ton of money.
[00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:21.640]   We'll save you a ton of money with their new storage optimization system.
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:26.640]   So the one expense sometimes with the CDN is when you get a cash miss and you have to
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:31.720]   load the data from the source Amazon S3 or wherever you keep your content.
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:35.800]   This could be a podcast, could be an application, could be a game, whatever the data could be
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:38.000]   video streaming video.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.760]   Those cash misses can end up costing you because of course, it's much more costly to
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:45.120]   transmit the data across the internet.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:48.320]   This is what storage optimization system does for you.
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:51.440]   Cash fly is a dedicated storage space.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:55.840]   That's for you where you put your data on the cash fly network.
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:54:00.560]   You will save you potentially thousands a month by shielding your origin and with zero
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:06.440]   cash misses, your download speeds will be drastically improved, no more buffering video
[00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:11.040]   and you'll save money on your data transfer out fees because you're going to have a 100%
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:15.280]   cash hit ratio with cash flies S-O-S.
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:19.120]   Once you're a cash fly customer, just decide how much storage you need, they'll take care
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:20.120]   of the rest.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:25.400]   Cash fly is also really improving by adding new, there are points of presence all over
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:26.960]   the globe.
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:29.640]   That's why we like it because we have listeners all over the globe.
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:34.040]   No matter where you're getting the show, you're getting it from a cash fly server, geographically
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:35.040]   proximate to you.
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:38.800]   That speeds up the downloads, it lowers the network traffic.
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:40.640]   It's really good at all around.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:44.080]   They've just added six new pops in South America.
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:48.000]   They're actually serving 10 times the amount of traffic in Latin America over the last year.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   We love that.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.080]   We love our Latin American listeners.
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:55.720]   Cash fly is not only maintained but drastically improved the performance in Latin America
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:58.600]   and taken on a much higher traffic load.
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:54:59.920]   That's the beauty of cash fly.
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:01.560]   It doesn't matter where your end users are.
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:07.200]   North America, Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific, cash
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:11.400]   fly delivers content quickly and reliably.
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:16.280]   What you would normally think of is hard to reach regions, they're all local to you.
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:18.240]   That's what's great about cash fly.
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:21.360]   Existency and performance all over the world.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:26.000]   Reliable throughput and scalability, five times faster than other CDNs.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:32.640]   And because they have so many servers, they offer 100% uptime SLA guarantee.
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:36.720]   So you get industry leading global performance, you get a lower price than the other guys.
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:43.600]   You get 100% uptime and you don't have these expensive cash misses.
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:48.000]   That's going to make a huge difference with video streaming, podcasting, digital downloads.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:52.040]   They ensure cash misses are delivered five times faster than they would be from your
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:56.840]   origins, whether it's software delivery or games, video.
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:58.040]   Cash fly is also a great company.
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:55:59.880]   They just partnered with World Central Kitchen.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:06.640]   They've donated over $50,000 to help serve 300,000 warm meals to people who are struggling.
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:08.240]   These are tough times.
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:12.280]   Cash fly is a great partner in the world.
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:15.880]   We're really happy to be partnered with Matt and the cash fly team.
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:18.640]   But cash flies SOS save your ship.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:23.000]   Just for Twitter listeners, cash fly is giving away a complimentary detailed analysis of your
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.680]   current CDN bill and usage trends.
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:32.440]   See if you're over being by 20% or more by going to twit.cash fly.com.

[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:41.280]   So my wife said no security cameras in the house.
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:42.520]   I understand that.
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:47.600]   She doesn't want stray video of her walking around on the internet somewhere.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:48.600]   She doesn't control it.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:50.800]   I understand that.
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:56.680]   So when Amazon announced this new ring camera, I thought she'd say absolutely not.
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:57:00.800]   She says, "When are we getting one?"
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:01.800]   This is nuts.
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:03.560]   Brian, this is your story.
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:08.440]   Tell us about the ring always home cam.
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:13.960]   Well, I actually want one too because I'm a nerd and it seems really cool.
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:14.960]   It is cool.
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:21.840]   But yeah, so imagine a little box and a tiny drone can pop out of it and the camera's
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:26.440]   on the bottom part of it, like the little tail hanging down so that when it's in its
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:28.600]   box, the camera's not looking.
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:33.520]   But the idea is it syncs to all the other ring stuff and let's say there's a detection
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:39.320]   of a noise, maybe a somebody at the door or a window or no one should be in that room.
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:41.640]   Why is that light on?
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:47.640]   The drone pops up and flies over and with its camera investigates.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:51.920]   I imagine that the use cases is you would get a notification on your phone and you open
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:56.880]   up the app and you can watch in real time the video, etc.
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:58:01.360]   So let me give you the first thing that is blowing my mind about this and then please
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:03.280]   come back for the second one.
[00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:09.360]   The first thing is that it's going to map your home.
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:12.640]   It's going to map the interior space of your home.
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:17.960]   And so by the way, my Roomba does that as well in order to clean your floors.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:18.960]   Sure.
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:22.800]   However, Roomba doesn't also have a side business of selling me things.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:26.480]   And so the first thing is we don't know yet because this isn't available.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.600]   They just announced it.
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:28.600]   It's not.
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:29.600]   250 bucks.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:31.520]   We don't know what sometime next year.
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:35.040]   But crucially, we don't know the terms of service yet.
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:37.720]   So are they allowed to do anything with that?
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:40.920]   If they go by your pantry and they see what plans.
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:44.040]   You should or some more some more Sherman, you need more Sherman.
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:48.080]   I was just in the master bath and your toilet paper.
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:51.840]   So as opposed to whatever family, right, right, right.
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:55.760]   So that's number one and that gets back to and I'll leave it here so we can come back
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:59:00.080]   to number two later, but that gets back to your conversation about what sort of privacy
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:05.040]   are you giving up, what sort of data are you giving up because now they are going inside.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:06.720]   Your home is a castle.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:07.720]   Your hearth.
[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:09.840]   You know, going back to the Magna Carta, this is the.
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:15.520]   But you already have a Google Nest Cam and a Facebook portal.
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:20.640]   But the point is is that you have set up those cameras at specific places that you
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:21.640]   have designated.
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:22.640]   Right.
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:23.640]   I understand that.
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:25.200]   But the drone doesn't go on its own.
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:28.280]   So it does say when you get the drone will map your home.
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:32.040]   It has to map your home in order to not run into things.
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.040]   Right.
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:36.640]   So at the very least and then part two will be the law enforcement part of this.
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:43.440]   But at the very least, somewhere, you know, on a server somewhere, they will have an interior
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:45.480]   map of your home.
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:47.600]   And we don't know what they can do with the video of it.
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:49.160]   Like, well, they put the couch over here.
[00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:50.880]   They put the what would they do with?
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:54.720]   Well, the TV is on in these hours with, you know, Amazon prime TV.
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:55.720]   Well, it doesn't go.
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:58.720]   The fact that doesn't come out when it doesn't come out.
[00:59:58.720 --> 00:59:59.720]   Right.
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.840]   When you're home, I hope.
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:02.840]   But it would.
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:03.840]   My wife would want this.
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:05.160]   The whole idea is right.
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:08.080]   And you know, they mentioned things like you ever leave the stove on?
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:09.080]   You want to know?
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:10.520]   Ask the drone.
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.160]   Did I leave the garage door open?
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:14.440]   Ask the drone.
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.760]   Where's the dog right now?
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:16.760]   Ask the drone.
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:19.880]   Apparently the drone is very loud.
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:20.880]   On purpose.
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:21.880]   Yeah.
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:24.320]   Well, also because they probably couldn't help it.
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:25.320]   But right.
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.320]   They couldn't help it.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.320]   The drones are noisy.
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.320]   They made a point of saying, oh, we're so you don't we won't be surprised.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.320]   It won't sneak up.
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:32.320]   It won't sneak up.
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:33.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:39.200]   The IEEE spectrum was the most critical of this of all of the stories.
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:44.480]   They say why you should be very skeptical of rings indoor security drone.
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.720]   They interviewed among other people.
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:53.600]   They interviewed a number of privacy experts, a professor who said, let me see if I could
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.600]   find it here.
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:59.520]   I just I just went by the quote that I was going to read to you.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:04.560]   Ryan Kalos, professor of the University of Washington School of Law said fixed cameras
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.400]   can be avoided, right?
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:07.960]   There's a little light on them.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:10.200]   I see my nest cam right there.
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:14.120]   It's glowing fixed cameras can be avoided.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:19.720]   Mobile ones can't, which makes it impossible for a child spouse or roommate to get away
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:20.720]   from the camera.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:24.120]   I hadn't thought about that.
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:27.120]   Imagine the domestic violence issues.
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.120]   Yeah.
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.120]   All there.
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:34.280]   So could a husband who's suspicious of his wife leave the house then turn on the drone
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.760]   and see what's going on?
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:39.440]   Well, or say, I told you never to leave this room.
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:42.920]   Oh, God.
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:48.760]   He says the professor says, if mobile surveillance is normalized, my concern is it will permit
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:55.720]   an abuser to check in on their partner wherever they are, erase surveillance blind spots and
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:02:01.920]   remove excuses that the surveilled individuals merely off camera.
[01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:05.160]   Surveillance is a well known component of domestic abuse.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:07.960]   Well, that's a very good point.
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:08.960]   Okay.
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:11.040]   Let me get to point to you real quick.
[01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:12.680]   And then I promise I will I will shut out.
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:13.680]   Oh, this is your story.
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.680]   You love this story.
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:15.680]   I love it.
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:16.680]   That's good.
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:22.200]   So, is that remember ring has gotten in trouble or has had controversy or people haven't liked
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.800]   the fact that they have all these deals with local law enforcement to share things.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:31.320]   So one would think that when Amazon announces something like this that seems a little wacky
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:35.920]   to people that they would have already thought through, oh, will this be included in the video
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.200]   that we will share with our law enforcement partners?
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.920]   And this is quoting from the Wired piece on this.
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:44.880]   Amazon originally said the device would be included in the hundreds of video sharing
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:47.920]   partnerships Amazon has with law enforcement agencies across the US.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:52.800]   The company later sent a correction and said the drone would be ineligible for this video
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:53.800]   request feature.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:59.400]   So, okay, aside from the fact that I don't want law enforcement to be able to act, I
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:03.880]   mean, hopefully with a warrant or whatever, I never want them to be able to give me launch
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:07.720]   the drone, tell me where Brian is right now inside his house.
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:11.400]   You would think that if they were going to announce something like this, they would already
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:16.680]   have their ducks in a row with this very basic question and apparently not.
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:21.200]   I'm sure law enforcement, I mean, I would like this if I could catch a crook and have
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:26.400]   a good clear video of the crook in the act that I mean, the ring doorbell has been used
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.400]   that way many, many times, right?
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:32.560]   It's just like having having that everywhere in your house.
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.800]   The prosecutions would go up.
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.680]   That's a good thing.
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:45.200]   So Peter, could Amazon make this all better with the proper privacy policy and commitment
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.520]   to enforce it?
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:50.600]   But then everything, all of this that we just talked about, would it all be okay?
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:54.840]   I mean, I think part of it is whether people trust Amazon or not, right?
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:59.400]   And people have, you know, if you have cameras or you have an echo in your home and you have
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:03.840]   recordings of your voice, you want to have a feeling that, you know, random people at
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:09.280]   Amazon can't look you up and access your private information, your private videos.
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:13.080]   It's the same thing with, I think this partnership with the police, with the ring videos, you
[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:15.880]   know, your videos aren't being sent automatically to the police.
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:19.280]   Yeah, I kind of was okay with it because you have to give permission to do that.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:22.680]   And so, you know, it's not in some respects that much different that, I mean, we had an
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:27.960]   incident where somebody stole a car and parked in front of our house and, you know, we had
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:32.520]   reported it and, you know, the detectives, like, hey, do you have any cameras around
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.520]   the house?
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:36.480]   And I was like, yeah, and he's like, if you have any videos of it, I have a video of
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.480]   someone rolling in.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:39.400]   And he's like, send that to me.
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:43.240]   And I was like, okay, you know, I didn't think that was that big of a deal.
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.240]   You're a good citizen.
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:45.240]   Yeah.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:48.800]   And so, I didn't help catch the person because it was, you know, pretty blurry, but that
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:49.800]   notwithstanding, right?
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:55.640]   You know, and so I think that, again, not to go back to this issue on regulation, but,
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:05:00.640]   you know, big companies that are in the business of making money and, you know, they do have
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:03.640]   to have a certain level of trust that they want to continue to, you know, sell these
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:04.640]   devices to people.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:09.720]   But at the same time, I think they're not being, when there isn't strong regulation
[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:13.520]   or penalties for them behaving badly, sooner or later, there are going to be things that
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:17.880]   happen and they need to be able to, there needs to be a consequence attached to, you
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.840]   know, those sorts of privacy violations.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:24.160]   And, you know, if you look in, you know, it's not an impossible thing to do, you know,
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:29.240]   certainly the EU, not that their regulation has been perfect, but, you know, they are
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:34.400]   holding companies more accountable than we are in the US for gross violations of privacy.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:37.800]   And I think about the stuff that's happened not just with, you know, your video or audio,
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.200]   but with private data.
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:42.920]   I mean, the fact that, you know, what was it?
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:43.920]   Was it Experian?
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.080]   Which one had the, the, the, Equifax?
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:47.080]   Equifax.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:50.280]   You know, the fact that Equifax is still in business at all is crazy.
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:54.800]   And certainly that, you know, and by the way, much more damaging people still trust
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:56.280]   their information with Equifax.
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.640]   Well, you don't have a choice.
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:58.640]   Yeah, I guess not.
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:04.400]   You know, and, and, but the fact is that, like, you know, we have a really inconsistent view
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:07.840]   ourselves of what is a violation and what isn't.
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:11.480]   And, you know, and so, you know, if you think about like the potential damages that happen
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:16.000]   to a lot of, you know, the Equifax breach actually, you know, has resulted in people's
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:19.600]   identities being stolen, you know, things being compromised.
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:23.280]   I'm not to minimize, you know, what's going on with, with Amazon or, you know, with Google
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.880]   or Facebook or any of these things.
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:29.480]   But the fact is, you know, the data is being collected and if we don't like the risks associated
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.560]   with that, we have to have different policies.
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:34.280]   And I know it goes back to what you said earlier, Leo, about the fact that we don't have a function
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.280]   in government.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:36.280]   But that's on us, right?
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:40.240]   I mean, it's our job as citizens to have a government that works then, that works and
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:41.240]   solves these problems.
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:42.240]   And that's the point.
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:47.520]   The Senate in me would say that's why big business buys Congress.
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:51.040]   That's, you know, we have the best government money can buy.
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:07:00.400]   And because Jeff Bezos has a lot more money to donate than I do, his will be done.
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.960]   But that's not, I mean, but they've lost, they didn't get the Jedi contract from the
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:03.960]   Defense Department, right?
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:07.320]   I mean, it's, you know, this stuff is not as simple as they just have the most money
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:08.320]   and they get what they want.
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.320]   Right.
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:12.000]   I think the fact is, and then, you know, it's, and I think that, you know, it means that
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.680]   us as citizens, if we, if our only form of expressing our discontent with something is
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:19.680]   to not buy something, that's a problem.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:20.680]   Right.
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:23.680]   And we have to have more avenues and more channels for expressing our discontent, our
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:28.240]   displeasure with things, and that we are, aren't just consumers, we are citizens.
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:30.920]   And, you know, and I'm, I agree.
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.280]   I just don't want to like throw up our hands and say, well, there's nothing can be done
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:35.000]   in their big company and it's over.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.280]   No, no, we need to do something.
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:38.120]   I agree.
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:44.320]   And honestly, it may be required going to first principles and getting money out of politics
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.760]   first to make any effective.
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:50.640]   So we should start thinking about, well, you know, what is, what would government do
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:55.040]   if we had a functioning government, how would we get that to happen?
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:56.160]   And how could we make that happen?
[01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:00.480]   I think the first step would probably be to get the money out of politics because,
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:04.600]   Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, I mean, we have to look at those things and we have to start
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:07.920]   to realize that, you know, these things aren't going to change on their own.
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:08.920]   Yeah.
[01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:11.040]   And again, and people are saying in the chat, you know, like, don't buy Amazon.
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.040]   Yeah.
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.640]   I mean, if you are uncomfortable, don't buy Amazon.
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:15.280]   Like, I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:16.880]   And I think like, I don't have a Facebook account.
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:18.920]   I haven't had a Facebook account over 10 years.
[01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:22.360]   And because I avidly disagree with the way that they run that business.
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:28.200]   And I will say, if anything is history has proven me 100% right on the, you know, negative
[01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:31.160]   impact of its far worse than we knew 10 years ago.
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:32.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:35.960]   It was it's what our worst nightmares were.
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.160]   Maybe even worse than that.
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:38.160]   Yeah.
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:41.480]   But on the other hand, I'm thinking if I, you know, my mom's 87, I just bought her an
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:44.120]   Apple watch because I want the fall detection.
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:48.520]   I mean, in effect, she's got a surveillance device on her wrist so that I can keep an
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:49.520]   eye on her.
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:50.520]   And you know what?
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:53.160]   I might even put a drone in her house.
[01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.920]   There's certainly, this is the problem.
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:56.640]   They're clear benefits.
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:02.520]   You know, every time I watch a crime procedural from more than 10 years ago on TV, I go,
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:06.200]   well, that couldn't happen today because there's cameras everywhere.
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:09.000]   There's you can't get away with somebody in the chat room said, what would, what would
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.760]   happen with OJ these days?
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:12.960]   There'd be video footage, everything.
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:15.880]   You know, you'd be able to piece the whole thing together.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:21.400]   So that's probably good, but there are societal costs to that.
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:27.920]   I think strong privacy policies that are auditable and enforceable might go a long way towards
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.200]   this.
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:36.280]   There are definitely moves a foot to get people's data somehow be, you know, in a vault that
[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:41.640]   you have control of so that you share it only when you want to to people who give you
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:44.040]   the value for the data that it's worth, that kind of thing.
[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:49.240]   I think there are solutions to this, but we, but unfortunately, the way technology usually
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:52.920]   works is just a random walk to the future.
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:54.440]   And we're, I think we're right in the middle of that.
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:55.920]   That's why I'm bringing these things up.
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.680]   We're right in the middle of that random walk.
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:01.720]   Yeah, we look, we're in a transition period and there's a lot of dislocation and we've
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:06.240]   a lot of change that's happened very, very quickly and we're digesting a lot of it.
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:10.840]   And you know, unfortunately, you know, we're living through some extremely complicated
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:16.840]   times, maybe that's a play way to say it, you know, and it may be, you know, five to
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:20.960]   10 years before we get to the other side of this turbulence and we have figured out
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:22.760]   all the solutions to a lot of this stuff.
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:28.280]   But ultimately people have to have the political will, you know, to have things be different
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:31.160]   and if they don't, they won't.
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:36.760]   The, the problem is, of course, that COVID has been really good for Amazon.
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:40.400]   I was just reading that Italy, where Amazon had been struggling, really never able to
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:47.200]   get a foothold in Italy after COVID their sales are up 75% because nobody's buying anything.
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:51.120]   They're, you know, going to go into a store, they're buying everything online.
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:53.840]   It'd be pretty hard these days for me if I didn't have them.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:59.720]   If I took a principal position and didn't order from Amazon, who you know, order from
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:00.720]   Walmart?
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:01.720]   Oh, that's better.
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:08.960]   I don't know what, I mean, I think this is a good time for Amazon.
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:09.960]   Don't you?
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:13.080]   All right.
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:14.880]   Let's move on to Apple.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:16.800]   Who else can we skewer?
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:21.080]   It's funny, Peter, since you've been here, the tenor of our conversations has gone from
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:25.880]   isn't technology grand to what fresh hell is this?
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:30.560]   Hey, I mean, I remember when I started Gizmodo, everything was, right?
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:32.360]   We're going to, we're going to save the planet.
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:35.200]   We're going to change, save, we're going to, you know, everything's going to be a utopia
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:38.520]   with everyone has a, everyone's going to have a supercomputer in their pocket and that's
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:39.760]   going to solve all of our problems.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:44.440]   Well, that's the funny thing is we did get that future and we, and, and, and it does
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:46.320]   solve problems, but it also creates problems.
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:50.120]   And maybe we weren't as good as anticipating the problems as we were the solutions.
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.840]   But we never are.
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:52.840]   Never.
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:53.840]   That's right.
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:54.840]   We never are.
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:55.840]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:56.840]   You know, you've been doing this long enough to do it.
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:03.640]   I mean, you've, you've watched the, the, the utopia turn into dystopia.
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:09.120]   Oh, oh, your microphone is pointing straight up.
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:10.120]   You're muted.
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:11.120]   There we go.
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:12.120]   All right.
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:21.360]   So I have, I have toyed with writing a column about essentially apologizing for my optimism
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:22.360]   of the technology.
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:24.360]   You don't have to do that.
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.360]   Early 2000.
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.600]   We don't have to do that.
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:27.600]   Right.
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:32.640]   Kind of like, kind of like the LA Times, you know, we apologize for our racism section
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.040]   that came out today.
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:40.440]   It, because it just feels like a lot of it's kind of win at it blindly.
[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:44.600]   And there were people who were kind of going, Hey, wait a minute, stop out there.
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:46.840]   And we were just going, yeah, yeah, whatever.
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.760]   And but a lot of them were right.
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:49.760]   Yeah.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.560]   Although there still is that tension now.
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.520]   I mean, there are a lot of people say, Oh, no, this is all great.
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:54.520]   It's fine.
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:55.520]   Yes.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:56.520]   And we want it, you know, we want it.
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:12:57.520]   I do understand you.
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:02.400]   And, you know, what's really interesting is you started going into Apple.
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:10.860]   Apple is creating a brand around being a company that will let you keep your privacy.
[01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:16.080]   And that I think is more significant than a lot of people realize, not so much for what
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:22.040]   it says about Apple, but what it accurately says about Amazon and Facebook and Google.
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:25.400]   I'm actually surprised that Apple's the only one that seems to be doing this.
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:30.200]   I thought at least Microsoft and a few others might say, Hey, yeah, that's a good marketing
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:31.200]   principle.
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:35.880]   Well, but except all the others are a lot of their revenue.
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:36.880]   They can't.
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:37.880]   Is advertised.
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:38.880]   Right.
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:39.880]   Right.
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:43.000]   Things you're going to do advertising, you know, you can't do that.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.240]   There was a one of the really interesting websites that launched, I think it was last week,
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:50.280]   the week before, is the Markups Blacklight.
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:51.520]   I love that site.
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:52.520]   Yeah.
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:53.520]   Yes.
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:57.560]   Where you could go and put in any website, you can see all of the advertising and all
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:01.120]   the trackers that come off of it.
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:04.200]   And that is incredibly eye opening.
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:05.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:06.200]   Yeah.
[01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.120]   You can see, yeah.
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:11.960]   Although a lot of our listeners run Ghostry and other tools.
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:16.240]   In fact, the new Firefox, the new Safari, I should say, does this.
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:18.480]   Yeah, the new Safari is very, very, very great.
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:22.200]   But again, there's Apple again going, you know, we're going to give you your privacy.
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:23.680]   We're going to charge you more.
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:24.680]   Right.
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:29.360]   You know, we're not, don't have the revenue stream that invades your privacy.
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:31.640]   But that's a brand that is like becoming their brand.
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:36.080]   They get, they hit that harder and harder in each one of their events.
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.000]   Well, I want to get to Apple.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.560]   Always not goodness and light in the Apple universe.
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:47.040]   There are a few people a little upset with Apple's policies in the app store.
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:49.160]   There's investigations going on in Europe and so forth.
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:51.400]   We'll get to that in just a second.
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.400]   Great panel date.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.600]   Dwight Silverman, the tech burger.
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:54.960]   You're not the tech burger.
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:56.280]   You write for the tech burger.
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:59.240]   No, I'm merely a tech burger.
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:05.320]   And it was a joke name when we were putting the site up and my editor liked it enough
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:06.840]   to actually inflict it on me.
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:09.240]   Yeah, be careful about the jokes you make.
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.240]   You make.
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:11.240]   Yes.
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:14.400]   And now we've got, I'm doing a weekly column again and it's called tech burger.
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:16.240]   And so I can get away.
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:17.240]   Good.
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:18.240]   He is the tech burger.
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:19.560]   I'm telling you.
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:22.160]   Also the return triumphant return of Peter Rojas.
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:25.960]   I haven't seen him in a wild founder of an gadget and gizmodo.
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:29.040]   He is now a, would you say angel?
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.640]   Would you say early stage?
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:32.720]   What's your, what's paid a work doing?
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:36.120]   We're doing pre-seed and seed stage VC.
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.120]   Pre-seed.
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:38.120]   Yeah.
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:39.120]   Okay.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.960]   So you're at the very earliest stages.
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:41.960]   Very earliest stages.
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:42.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:44.920]   We're usually often first investor in a lot of companies.
[01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:46.120]   That's a good place to be.
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:47.120]   Yeah.
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.120]   I have a few friends.
[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:49.120]   Yeah.
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:50.120]   I have a few friends.
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:53.480]   Most investors in companies like Twitter and Uber.
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:56.720]   I've seen them sailing off into the sunset on their mega yachts.
[01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:57.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:01.040]   I still have a few years to go.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.040]   This is cool.
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:05.080]   Did you found this or do this with friends or what's?
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:06.800]   So I have two partners.
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:11.000]   There's original beta works which started in 2007 and that's where a bunch of companies
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.400]   were built like Giffy.
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.080]   The game dots came out of their.
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.080]   Wait a minute.
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:16.080]   Wait a minute.
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:17.080]   Giffy or Jiffy?
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:18.080]   Giffy.
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:19.080]   Okay.
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:20.080]   Yeah.
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:24.800]   And the guy from the horse's mouth, not the founder but you put the money in.
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:25.800]   Giffy.
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.000]   That's how that's Alex the founder of Giffy.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.000]   That's how he called it.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.520]   Did he have a big exit when they got acquired?
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:32.960]   I hope he did really well.
[01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:33.960]   Nice.
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:35.200]   Very nice.
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:36.200]   That's a perfect example.
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:43.600]   Soul founder, simple idea, developed well, hit the nail on the head and had a nice exit.
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.600]   That's what you're hoping for, isn't it?
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:48.240]   Well, and it was something that was it was actually built out beta works.
[01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:49.240]   It started as a beta works.
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:50.240]   Oh, nice.
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:51.240]   Yeah.
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:54.720]   It was like we had a hackers and residents program that he was part of.
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:55.720]   Oh, no.
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:17:00.000]   400 million is the rumor Facebook paid for Giffy.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000]   I can't confirm.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000]   Okay.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.000]   I tried.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   You saw me.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.000]   I tried.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000]   I did my best.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000]   I didn't say anything.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.920]   I just said it.
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:12.040]   So even if it was half that it was a good exit.
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:13.040]   That's great.
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:14.040]   It was good.
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.040]   Yeah.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:18.000]   And you know, and so beta works ventures was spun out of the original beta works.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000]   And so we do all the investing.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000]   Nice.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   We have our own fund.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.000]   I have two partners.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.040]   Oh, you did dots.
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.480]   I love dots.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:26.480]   We did dots.
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:27.480]   Yeah.
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:28.480]   I wasn't there when they did dots.
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:29.480]   Dots is good.
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:31.200]   Bitly chart beat.
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:32.200]   Yep.
[01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:33.200]   Tweet deck.
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:34.840]   I still use tweet deck.
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:37.600]   Pray that Twitter does not kill it.
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:40.640]   I think that they will keep it around.
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:41.640]   It's for people.
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:42.640]   It's for the power users.
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:43.640]   Yeah.
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:45.040]   No, but they don't even tell anybody exists.
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:47.080]   No, but it's still.
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.160]   It's really, really the only way I use Twitter.
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:51.760]   It's awesome because it's got live scrolling.
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:56.840]   You know what the killer feature of tweet deck and I don't think any other Twitter made
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:17:58.040]   platform does this.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:02.920]   You can say, I don't want to see retweets in any one of the columns, which really dampens
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:06.280]   down the kind of insane volatility.
[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:08.560]   You know, you only see the first initial tweet.
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:09.560]   That's it.
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:14.640]   I somebody suggested I do that and I've loved it ever since.
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:15.960]   And there's no ads.
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:17.200]   That's right.
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:21.760]   Which I, you know, I, we have lots of ads, so I don't.
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:22.760]   It would be hypocritical.
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:25.240]   Let me just say.
[01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:27.280]   Cool.
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:31.280]   Currently focused on conversational interfaces.
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:34.720]   Bots, verbal computing and augmented reality.
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:37.120]   Seems like a good place to be.
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:38.120]   Yeah.
[01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:39.840]   Well, that's actually slightly out of date.
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:43.680]   But yeah, we're investing a lot around social gaming right now.
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:44.680]   Nice.
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:48.440]   And just sitting in the metaverse, what's coming out of the people trying to build stuff like
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:49.440]   that.
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:55.080]   Doing a lot on spatial computing and AR just made another investment in that category.
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:58.480]   And then people sort of the way we divide it is a future for how people live work and
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:18:59.480]   play online.
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:00.480]   Yeah.
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:03.160]   Which obviously was a big year for that.
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:04.160]   Yeah.
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:05.160]   Yeah.
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:09.600]   I finally realized I should just invest in technology.
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:14.280]   That seems like that's got an upside a little bit, right?
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:15.280]   Um,
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:16.280]   Twit.vc.
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:18.040]   Oh, you think?
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:20.040]   Yet Kevin Rose always said, you've got deal flow.
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:21.040]   No, it's Call of Candace.
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:22.040]   You've got deal flow.
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:23.880]   You should, you, you could do this.
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:25.480]   I don't want to do that.
[01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:27.040]   I have no interest in it.
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:28.040]   Not at all.
[01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:29.040]   Not at all.
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:30.240]   I like doing what we're doing.
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:31.240]   We're having fun.
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:32.240]   So we'll, we'll talk.
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:33.240]   But anyway, congratulations.
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:34.240]   It's great to see you again.
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:35.240]   Thanks.
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:36.240]   Yeah.
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:37.240]   And it's great to be back.
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:38.240]   Yeah.
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:39.240]   Yeah, we missed you.
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:40.240]   Well, good.
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:41.320]   I hope you'll make this a regular visit.
[01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:45.960]   And of course we love Brian McCullough, who's seven days a week now you're doing the Tech
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:46.960]   Mead.
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:47.960]   Brian,
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:48.960]   Tech Mead.
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:53.560]   Not, not technically every, every weekday, but then I do usually two or three weekend
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:54.560]   bonus episodes.
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:55.560]   Yeah.
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:56.560]   That counts.
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:58.400]   Could be eight days a week, really.
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:02.800]   Let's call it, let's call it 24ish episodes a month.
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:05.000]   Wow.
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000]   That's exhausting.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:10.080]   The key thing is, the key thing is every day by five p.m. Eastern.
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:11.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:15.920]   The key thing is, the weird thing is, is I've been putting them out at two recently because,
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:20.640]   you know, it's amazing if you don't have a 45 minute commute each way, how you're, you're
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:21.640]   day flip.
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:25.120]   But, but I told people this week, you know, the kids are starting to go back to school.
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:28.880]   So you might see it, uh, inching towards four p.m.
[01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:29.880]   five p.m.
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:32.360]   now because I got to get kids out the door.
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:35.720]   Your kids are going where, where are you located?
[01:20:35.720 --> 01:20:36.880]   Brooklyn.
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:38.920]   And the kids are going back to school in Brooklyn?
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:39.920]   Yeah.
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:42.520]   That's the whole experiment here in New York City.
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:46.800]   Um, that I've got a, a funnel experiment with a deadly disease, isn't it?
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:47.800]   On your, on your kids.
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:49.000]   Isn't that a good experiment?
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.280]   I got on your kids with a deadly disease.
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:53.520]   What fun is that?
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:55.440]   So it's, it's staggered.
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:58.160]   Like, it's not a hundred percent in person.
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:04.200]   For example, my four year old went two days this week to pre-K.
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:07.360]   My six year old is going to first grade two days next week.
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:09.800]   And so it's, it's never full time.
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:14.640]   And the way the reason for that is then they can cut the class sizes down.
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:18.520]   So you're only in a classroom with seven other kids or whatever.
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:23.520]   We bought, um, medical grade air purifiers for all the classrooms.
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:24.520]   Yes.
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:26.800]   Uh, we, you know, we were trying to do everything.
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:31.760]   We're trying, like, listen, we're optimistic because it's either we're going to do nothing
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:34.320]   or we're going to try to do something.
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:35.320]   Right.
[01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:40.320]   And we get two days a week for either of these kids just to socialize and have a, have a
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:41.320]   first grade class.
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:43.320]   Oh, it's so good for the kids.
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:44.320]   Yeah.
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:48.160]   Or it's worth, you know, cross your fingers.
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:50.600]   It's worth the stretch to see if it can work.
[01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:56.440]   We have a high school senior at home and I just keep thinking, I always keep one eye
[01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:57.440]   open at night.
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:58.520]   I'm worried about knife attacks.
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:21:59.520]   I don't know.
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:04.720]   I just feel like the poor kid, it's so stressful and he's so sick of us.
[01:22:04.720 --> 01:22:08.120]   He just can't, can you go somewhere, please?
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:09.120]   Nope.
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:10.120]   Gonna stay here.
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:11.120]   Going somewhere.
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:13.320]   I mean, going down to Trader Joe's for five minutes.
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:14.320]   That's it.
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:19.560]   We were lucky because until now where, you know, in New York City and New York state, it's
[01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:20.720]   been under one.
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:24.520]   You're saying that positivity rate all the time, although it has been spiking recently.
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:27.680]   So it could shut down next week.
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:32.800]   But also I feel like we're in a locality where if the numbers do get bad, they will
[01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:33.800]   shut it down.
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:35.120]   And they're not going to mess around.
[01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.480]   So again, that's what's making me willing to take this week.
[01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:39.680]   We have a good governor who's paying attention.
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:42.560]   Peter, are your kids back in school too?
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:45.160]   Not really.
[01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:49.080]   They're doing this thing where they have three days a week hikes that they can go on with
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:50.080]   the clock.
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:51.080]   That's perfect.
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:52.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.080]   So it's outdoors.
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:54.080]   It's optional.
[01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:55.080]   Yeah.
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:58.960]   They get some time, you know, some socially distance time with their friends.
[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:01.040]   You know, we don't have to see them for a couple of hours.
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:02.040]   Yeah, that's good for all around.
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:03.040]   Yeah.
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:06.560]   And you know, but the problem was the first week they started it was the first week that
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:07.960]   the fires were really bad.
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:08.960]   Yes, the air was true.
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:12.960]   And so they had to cancel it the first week and then it finally got good enough and you
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:15.200]   know, so it's like Silicon Valley.
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:16.200]   We're abouts.
[01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.760]   I'm right in the center of San Francisco.
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:18.760]   Oh, San Francisco.
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:19.760]   Okay.
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:20.760]   Yeah.
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:21.760]   I like, yeah, outdoors.
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:23.520]   I'm not, I'm no longer afraid about doors.
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:25.880]   I feel like that's pretty safe.
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:26.880]   It's the indoors.
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:27.880]   You got to be afraid about.
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:28.880]   Agreed.
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:29.880]   Yeah.
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:30.880]   Yeah.
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:35.360]   All I could say is I haven't got it yet.
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:41.360]   Our show today, you know, if you're stuck at home, might as well take advantage of that
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:44.000]   time you're sitting in front of the TV.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:50.460]   Sure you could watch a desperate house wise rerun or you could learn a skill for master
[01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:51.460]   class or sponsor.
[01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:53.280]   I love master class.
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:55.680]   I have been a subscriber for years now.
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:58.840]   In fact, the funny thing I told my son who's 26.
[01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:01.160]   I just had just got out of college a few years ago.
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:04.160]   I said, good, I'm going to give you a master class for graduation.
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:08.120]   I'm already, he does all the cooking stuff.
[01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:12.600]   In fact, I just got a really nice barbecue and I was so thrilled to see Aaron Franklin
[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:16.600]   with a master class on barbecue.
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:18.520]   Man, I followed his brisket.
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:21.000]   You know, it's like there's a ton of videos.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.400]   I followed his brisket recipe.
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:26.400]   It was the best thing I ever had from from from point of view of cooking their master
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:28.080]   class is amazing.
[01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:32.160]   Thomas Keller, Gordon Ramsey, and he won't even yell at you.
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:36.920]   Gabriela Kamara teaches you how to make homemade tortillas.
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:45.080]   Aaron's barbecue, Massimo teaches Italian cooking, Wolfgang Puck, Alice Waters.
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:49.680]   That's just the cooking section, but there's much more master classes and just cooking.
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:50.680]   How about you like theater?
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:51.680]   You like film?
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:52.880]   You like acting?
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:56.520]   The arts and entertainment section is mind-boggling.
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:24:59.880]   How do they get these?
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:07.920]   A list of people, Samuel L. Jackson, Spike Lee, learn how to act from Natalie Portman, David
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:10.880]   Lynch, Martin Scorsese.
[01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:15.920]   And I should point out these classes, it's not just, oh, here's a quick video.
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:22.200]   There are many videos Scorsese has introduction, beginnings, Martin's education, discovering
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:28.640]   your process, channeling your influences, developing your style, directing and technology, finding
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:32.000]   the story on and on, editing one and two.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.520]   There are 30 episodes.
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:36.960]   They're all digestible, which is great.
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:40.080]   You can watch them at any time on any device.
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:43.000]   Masterclass is the way to learn all sorts of things.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.920]   Oh, this is new Neil Gaiman?
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:47.440]   Art of storytelling now, man.
[01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:48.960]   I know what I'm watching tonight.
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:52.520]   So if you're tired of the same old, same old, you got to get Masterclass.
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:59.720]   How about learning from the all six-time winner of the World Series of Poker champion?
[01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:02.880]   The guy who was one more than anybody else, Daniel Negrano.
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:10.520]   Okay, if you wanted to learn about political strategy, who better to learn from than David
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:15.640]   Axelrod and Carl Rove, Obama's advisor and Bush's advisor.
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:18.600]   And what's great is they're sitting next to each other.
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:28.400]   24 lessons on campaign strategy, assessing your candidate, researching your opponent,
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:30.840]   fundraising, public appearances.
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:33.520]   This you want to know how politics works.
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:38.480]   Nobody knows more about politics than Rove and Axelrod together.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:39.480]   Is that hysterical?
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:40.480]   What a brilliant idea.
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:42.320]   Look, all right, I'm sorry.
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:45.320]   I just wanted to mention that one because I think it's so cool.
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:47.440]   I have an all access pass.
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:52.680]   But I would recommend because then you get access to every single one of these incredible
[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:53.680]   videos.
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:54.680]   It's immersive.
[01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:57.200]   You can watch it on your phone, your Apple TV, your web.
[01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:01.800]   Carlos Santana on the art and soul of guitar, right?
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:05.600]   Learn how to hit aces from Serena Williams.
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:08.800]   I wonder if she talks about O'Hanean on that.
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:11.200]   That'd be kind of fun.
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:12.680]   I can go on and on.
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:15.560]   Get unlimited access to every Masterclass.
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:19.600]   And because you're listening, we're going to get you 15% off an annual membership.
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:21.080]   It is worth it.
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:26.120]   Family and friends, if you're sitting down in front of the TV, you will find no time better
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:28.000]   spent than in a Masterclass.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:31.680]   Masterclass.com/twit2.
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:35.440]   That's the special URL to get the 15% off.
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:41.520]   Masterclass.com/twit2.
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:47.760]   I am ready for a Masterclass in promotional advertisements.
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:50.960]   This is what you missed if you missed anything this week on Twit.
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:53.120]   The cat came back.
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:56.720]   I pressed some button now and I can't...
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:59.320]   Every switch I push.
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:06.200]   You can't imagine why you wanted someone else to do the Ethernet house.
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:08.680]   Previously on Twit.
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:10.680]   All about Android.
[01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:12.840]   Where is Earthquake Alert feature?
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:14.520]   Was put to the test last week.
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:20.360]   A 4.5 magnitude earthquake hit the Los Angeles area.
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:22.240]   This week in Google.
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:24.400]   Why is Google still making phones?
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:26.760]   And the second question is, will they continue doing this?
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:29.240]   Is this the last Pixel phone?
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:32.400]   Their main business model seems to be to disappoint users.
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:33.400]   Yeah.
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:34.920]   It's a tragic.
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:39.640]   But still we have to ask, why are they doing it and will they stop?
[01:28:39.640 --> 01:28:45.520]   There's a 1 and a 2 switch and really you'll never need to use more than the 1 switch but
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:47.360]   it does have that 2 switch if you want it.
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:48.360]   Here's the 2.
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:50.360]   Oh my god.
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:53.360]   Perfect for those weird twit-time.
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:57.320]   It sounds like they were blown away.
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:58.320]   Twit.
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:00.040]   I was blown away Kevin.
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.800]   That's exactly right.
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:05.160]   It's where your brain and tech meet.
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:08.520]   Oh, we have fun every week on Twit.
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:12.880]   There's lots of shows to watch and our live stream is at twit.tv/live.
[01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:18.840]   If you like Twit and you have Amazon's Echo, we have a flash briefing as well.
[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:23.000]   The flash briefing in the morning news segment you can listen to.
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.440]   I listen to a lot of things but you can get Twit on there too.
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:29.640]   So check your flash briefing settings and add Twit to that.
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:33.720]   Brian, do you have a tech meet, ride home flash briefing?
[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:34.720]   We do.
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:35.720]   Yeah.
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:36.720]   You want to mention that right now?
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:37.720]   Yeah, I do.
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:38.720]   Because I...
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:39.720]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:40.720]   No, it's there.
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:41.720]   You know what I'm doing?
[01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:42.720]   They're doing it.
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:43.720]   Mike, they do...
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:49.360]   Adam pisses me off a lot of automatic voice synthesis of text stories.
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:54.840]   I want to hear you tell me the news, not some machine.
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:56.480]   No, no, no.
[01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:57.480]   No.
[01:29:57.480 --> 01:30:00.680]   I mean, it's mainly you set it up so that because it's a daily show.
[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:06.680]   So if you set it up to be your flash briefing, it is whatever the most recent show is.
[01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:07.680]   So it's sort of...
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:11.920]   It's a glorified putting my podcast at the top of a queue or something like that.
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:15.520]   That's what I'll do because that's worth listening to.
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:19.480]   But then I would get yesterday's news today because you finish it at five and then I
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:20.480]   listen in the morning.
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:21.480]   It's okay.
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:22.480]   I can catch up with you.
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:25.320]   Well, actually, I think most people do at this point listen in the mornings anyway.
[01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:27.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:31.320]   Somebody in the chatroom just sent me this tweet from the LA Times.
[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:34.600]   It's kind of a flashback to the good old days of the space shuttle.
[01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:40.320]   And they drove the space shuttle to the science center through the city.
[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:44.240]   Look at the size of that thing going down the highways.
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:48.040]   People on balcony swatching as the space shuttle goes by.
[01:30:48.040 --> 01:30:49.040]   Look at that.
[01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:50.040]   Wow.
[01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:55.040]   I don't think that was very recent, but I just thought that was pretty cool.
[01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:56.400]   All right.
[01:30:56.400 --> 01:31:00.280]   We should mention Jason Howell was talking about it on all about Android.
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:01.640]   Or maybe we were talking about it on this week in Google.
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:03.920]   I guess we were on Wednesday.
[01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:06.560]   We're going to do a little bit of a jiggery jigging of our shows.
[01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:11.880]   We'll begin early with Windows weekly at nine AM so that we can buy 11 AM.
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:12.880]   Is it 11?
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:14.360]   John, do you remember?
[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:17.760]   11 AM, we're going to do the Google announcement.
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:18.760]   They're going to stream it.
[01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:20.960]   We'll do our usual coverage as we watch the streamed.
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:25.760]   Remember those days, Peter, when you had a sit and live blog and announcement?
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:28.000]   You don't do that anymore, I bet.
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000]   I don't.
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.880]   But we were the first site to do that.
[01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:34.200]   Were you in the gadget?
[01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:35.200]   Yeah.
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:37.720]   Nice.
[01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:42.080]   We had somebody, the way you used to do it is the phones, the connections were so slow
[01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:46.000]   that one person would be there in the room and then they would be sending the messages
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000]   over AME.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000]   Oh my God.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000]   Not AME.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000]   Who would then put it into the CMS?
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000]   Oh my God.
[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:55.120]   See, this is what we need on the Internet history.
[01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:56.120]   See?
[01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:59.520]   Long ago, they were using AOL's Instant Messenger.
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:00.520]   The late great.
[01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:02.920]   It was a real process.
[01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:03.920]   Right.
[01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:06.640]   And this was a whole software platform for that now, right?
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:07.640]   Oh yeah, they totally.
[01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:08.640]   Well, they did.
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:09.640]   You know what?
[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:11.200]   They may be gone now.
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:15.120]   For a while, there was this boom in live blogging and they had a bunch of plavvers.
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:16.960]   I bet they're all gone by now.
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:17.960]   I think they are.
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:19.960]   I think a lot of sites have their own.
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:20.960]   They do their own thing.
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:27.160]   At one point, there was a plug-in for AME that where you could essentially use it to
[01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:30.480]   live blog and it would send it to certain CMSs.
[01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:32.920]   So you could actually do it directly.
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:34.960]   You would need the other guy typing it in.
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:39.600]   I think some of this went away when companies like Apple, thank God, finally started live
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:43.760]   streaming instead of, you know, they put it up on YouTube so the public could watch.
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:44.760]   Yeah.
[01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:48.080]   And so we wouldn't have to go and gadget to see what's going on.
[01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:50.320]   Yeah, there's still some live blog.
[01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:57.640]   24liveblog.com, real time infrastructure for today's newsroom.
[01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:00.240]   So there are still some businesses doing that.
[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:01.400]   But I think that that's not.
[01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:02.400]   Although, you know what?
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:04.360]   Amazon, they didn't stream it.
[01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:07.000]   Had to watch a live blog.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.360]   Google will stream on Wednesday.
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:10.200]   We'll cover that 11 a.m.
[01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:13.600]   We expect, well, there's never any mystery with Google.
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:16.280]   I don't know what the story is.
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:21.800]   If they just have no opposite at all or they don't care, they got it.
[01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:24.240]   Don't you think they just, they, they, they threw in the towel.
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:25.480]   They're like, yeah, heck with it.
[01:33:25.480 --> 01:33:26.480]   This is too much trouble.
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:28.320]   Well, yeah, we'll just let you know ahead of time.
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:29.320]   Yeah.
[01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:32.960]   It started like last year, the year before, when they just, right, after so many leaks,
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:35.600]   it just said, all right, here's the pixel for you.
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:36.600]   Fine.
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:40.560]   Yeah, the thing is it doesn't really matter that much anymore.
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:41.560]   Doesn't it?
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:42.560]   No, it just doesn't.
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:44.280]   So that's one way times have changed.
[01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:49.280]   It used to be, we were all excited and, you know, Apple event morning was like Christmas
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:51.080]   day.
[01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:56.360]   You'd be getting, but not the peak of that was that was the iPhone four, right?
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:34:04.640]   Like that was that was the one where the, the, the demo device leaked and yeah.
[01:34:04.640 --> 01:34:05.640]   It was stolen.
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:06.640]   Like that was the, right, stolen.
[01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:07.640]   Exactly.
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:10.000]   Oh, yeah, it was left in a bar.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:11.000]   Right.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.120]   In fact, it was gizmodo, I believe.
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:15.120]   Were you still like gizmodo when that happened?
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:16.680]   No, I'm gone.
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:20.080]   Was it Brian Lamb who ended up taking a night for him?
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:21.520]   Yeah, I'm dealing with that.
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:22.520]   Yeah.
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:23.520]   Brian adjacent.
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:24.520]   He's done.
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:25.520]   Okay.
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:27.040]   Since because Brian went off and started wire cutter, right?
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:28.040]   Yeah.
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:30.560]   Which is now a New York Times property.
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:35.640]   And Brian again, riding off to the sunset on his mega yacht.
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:37.440]   So pixel five, we'll see.
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:40.200]   Does any, that was, Mike Elgin was asking a good question.
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:43.600]   Well, why bother?
[01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:45.520]   Why does Google even make a phone?
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:50.240]   The one rumor I thought was really interesting is that it might not be expensive, that it
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:54.040]   might be a $600 phone, not a $1,000 phone.
[01:34:54.040 --> 01:34:55.680]   That's what they should be doing, right?
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:57.640]   That's what the nexus line was.
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:02.060]   The whole idea originally of Google making phones was an inexpensive phone developers could
[01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:05.200]   use to test their Android apps on.
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:08.600]   And then the public got wind of it and it turned out they were the best Android phones
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:10.880]   out there because they were pure.
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:14.240]   So Google, I think probably said, oh, we could make some money on this.
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:19.680]   But in typical Google fashion, they lost the thread.
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:20.680]   Was it Google?
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:22.760]   Didn't they want a pure phone out there?
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:27.320]   Wasn't it similar to Microsoft deciding to finally get into tablets?
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:28.600]   But yeah, but do you need it?
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:30.840]   But they wanted to say, here's how it's done.
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:31.840]   Here's how it's done.
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:32.840]   Yes.
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:36.800]   Yes, but they don't need that anymore because there's so many companies that make basically
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:38.880]   Android phones, even Samsung.
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:41.360]   I mean, I'm looking at this.
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:47.160]   The fold, it's really pretty much-- it's got some Samsung in it, not got a lot of Samsung
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:48.160]   in it.
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:52.320]   It's pretty much a stock Android device.
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:56.560]   Even Samsung used to customize the settings like crazy.
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:59.280]   It basically got much more stock.
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:04.920]   And certainly OnePlus and Motorola and many of the other companies are just making-- they
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:07.640]   don't, they're not customizing it that much, which is a good thing.
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:10.120]   You're more likely to get your updates more quickly.
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:13.800]   So then that begs the question, why do we need a new Pixel phone?
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:18.880]   I always thought that Google's rationale for doing this has changed over the years.
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:22.600]   But it seems to me like one reason why they continue to do it is at least to give them
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:27.000]   the ability to exert some leverage over the OEMs if they need to.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:33.720]   And whether they need to do that, it ebbs and flows over the years, depending on-- at
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:38.640]   one point, Samsung was becoming so dominant with Android that they were worried about
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:40.240]   having a counterweight to it.
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:43.480]   And Samsung was even talking about forking Android.
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:47.640]   And they had such a large share of the market that I don't think they would have executed
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:50.720]   it well, but they could have tried to do that.
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:57.160]   And so it seems to me it's a little bit like don't make us have to make Pixel a big deal.
[01:36:57.160 --> 01:36:58.480]   OK.
[01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:00.400]   Is that still the rationale?
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:01.400]   I don't know.
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:06.560]   It's still be useful to them to have it something that they continue to do for that sort of
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:08.200]   strategic purpose.
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:09.200]   Certainly.
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:13.200]   If they wanted it to be something that more people bought, they would be going about
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:14.200]   it very differently.
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:15.200]   Yes.
[01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:19.720]   Well, yeah, they'd have more carrier deals for one thing.
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:24.760]   I have to say, this Samsung Fold doesn't have Android 11 on it.
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:25.960]   Very few phones do.
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:31.360]   So that's one thing Apple, a new version of iOS comes out like iOS 14 did last week.
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:36.160]   And they get 50% adoption within a week.
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:37.160]   Everybody jumps on it.
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:38.240]   And that's good all around.
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:39.240]   It's good for security.
[01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:43.680]   It's good for developers because they know what people are going to be using.
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:44.680]   So maybe that's it.
[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:48.880]   Maybe they're just trying to say, look, we've got to get Android 11 going.
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:53.800]   Also Google arguably does the best cameras out there.
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:54.960]   Right?
[01:37:54.960 --> 01:38:02.640]   I mean, I think all of the flagship phones now, iPhone, Samsung have excellent cameras.
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:07.960]   I always have felt like the pixels are the best Android phones overall.
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:08.960]   Yeah.
[01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:11.720]   Samsung has always made the sexiest phones.
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:12.720]   Yes.
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:13.720]   Yes.
[01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:18.520]   But so maybe, you know, another question aside from how long will they continue to do this
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:20.800]   because no one ever goes broke.
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:25.040]   I think it gets Google getting bored of something.
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:28.360]   But why haven't the pixels taken off more?
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:29.800]   Is it just the carrier stuff?
[01:38:29.800 --> 01:38:33.600]   Like they haven't been able to get the deals like Samsung does or...
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:34.960]   They certainly do.
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:37.080]   They do well with the A versions, right?
[01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:39.400]   The four A's done very well.
[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:41.040]   The three A did very well.
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:42.040]   Those are the phones to get.
[01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:45.360]   They're the less expensive lower end versions of the pixel phones.
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:47.320]   They're more like the old Nexus line.
[01:38:47.320 --> 01:38:50.800]   And they've sold well, but pixels in general do not sell well.
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:52.560]   So I'm sorry.
[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:54.760]   What were you saying, Dwight?
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:55.920]   I think it's distribution.
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:56.920]   I don't think...
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:57.920]   They just don't get it out there.
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:00.360]   I don't think they're very good at getting the products out there.
[01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:01.880]   They introduce them.
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:02.880]   They're good products.
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:08.560]   But in terms of being promoting them and making sure that every carrier has them, that all
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:11.600]   the best sources for getting them have them.
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:15.160]   I have heard from a lot of people who say I'd like to buy a pixel phone.
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:17.160]   How do I do that?
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:19.400]   And it's also kind of...
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:22.360]   It's not intuitive for a lot of people.
[01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:29.280]   So that underscores that there are really two markets for Android devices.
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:30.680]   There's the enthusiast market.
[01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:32.840]   Those people know how to get a pixel phone.
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:37.800]   But those people also know all the problems the pixel phones have.
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:41.320]   Last two times, there have been issues.
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:44.600]   And the word goes out very quickly in the enthusiast community.
[01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:50.160]   Then there is the vast majority of Android buyers who are not sophisticated users.
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:51.160]   They're buying...
[01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:54.520]   Most of the time they're buying Android devices because they have less expensive phone or
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:58.720]   the phone they get for free from their carrier, that kind of thing.
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:00.320]   Pixel phone's not even on their radar.
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:03.160]   They wouldn't...
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:04.160]   That's not even...
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:05.720]   They don't even know it exists probably.
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:07.440]   And if they did, you're right.
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:09.400]   They don't know how to get it.
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:11.640]   So it doesn't work on either...
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:14.480]   For either of the two Android markets.
[01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:15.480]   So it's probably...
[01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:22.560]   I think if they were better at distribution, if they were better at marketing it, if they
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:27.000]   put it where it needed to be, and had just like a killer phone.
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:32.280]   I heard you say, I think that the pixels have the best cameras.
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:33.400]   I don't think that's true.
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:41.600]   I think the last pixel was outdone by the iPhone, particularly with night mode.
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:49.280]   But I just think that they have a really a missed opportunity because Google has its
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:50.280]   name.
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:57.400]   It has one of the biggest websites there is, but they don't do much there in order to promote
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:58.400]   it.
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:01.200]   They don't have ads for the Pixel for sure, right?
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:02.200]   Okay.
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:03.200]   All right.
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:04.200]   I'm just wondering...
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:07.160]   So maybe we'll see Google what we would look for Wednesday as maybe Google announcing
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:12.440]   carrier partnerships because that would be a big deal for Google.
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:14.440]   And this is a 5G phone too.
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:18.200]   So that kind of changes the game a little.
[01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:21.680]   Yeah, maybe a little.
[01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:27.760]   Leah, what was the consensus back to the original question which was, is this the last Pixel
[01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:28.760]   phone?
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:29.960]   What was the consensus on the shows this week?
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:33.960]   Nobody knows, but everybody kind of agreed it should be.
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:36.960]   In fact, why...
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:40.560]   I think, do you have a Pixel?
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:42.360]   Do you use the Pixel?
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:44.600]   Yeah, I have had them.
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:47.600]   I'm back on an iPhone now, but go ahead, Peter.
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:52.640]   Oh, I was going to say, I think part of it is that Google is a big company and they
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:54.840]   obviously need Android to be successful.
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:56.840]   They don't need the Pixel to be successful.
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:57.840]   And it's not.
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:41:58.840]   Good news.
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:41:59.840]   And it's not.
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:04.480]   There are things that are existential or mission critical for big companies and there
[01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:05.480]   are things that are not.
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:10.160]   And it's not a surprise that things that are not are not going to get as much support
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:13.520]   or attention or maybe the best people internally and not to denigrate anybody who works on
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:16.000]   the Pixel phone by implying that.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.960]   But you can sometimes tell internally, you can sometimes tell the CEO's priorities around
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:23.800]   what they think is the most important thing for them to be working on.
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:27.280]   And I would say that for Sundar, it's probably not the Pixel phone.
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:32.600]   It's probably more around AI more generally and probably like Google Assistant in terms
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:35.200]   of consumer facing products.
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:43.760]   The information had a story not so long ago about Rick Osterlo's in charge of hardware
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:49.680]   at Google weeks before the launch of the last pixel, the Pixel 4 saying this battery life
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:50.680]   is terrible.
[01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:52.280]   Like Rick, didn't you know?
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:56.520]   You found out just two weeks before the ship date.
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:43:02.840]   And then Mark Levois, who was the camera guru who if Google's cameras were good is widely
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:03.840]   credited with that.
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:11.200]   He left, went to Adobe where he's working on software.
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:15.160]   Those are the reading the tea leaves that tell you because that story came out too.
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:18.400]   Something's up at the Pixel.
[01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:25.000]   There's sunk cost in this one coming out and then also like you said, it's a 5G launch.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:30.080]   And once there are 5G phones out there, so I don't know.
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:32.760]   That's a good question for you guys.
[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:39.400]   Are you hearing normal people saying, "Oh, I got to get a 5G phone."
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:40.400]   What about you Dwight?
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:43.040]   Do people write to you and say, "Oh, I need a 5G phone.
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:45.280]   What should I get?"
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:52.120]   There was initially, and I think a lot of the reviews of the networks that have gone
[01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:58.560]   live, particularly AT&T's and T-Mobile, where there's only like a 20% increase in speeds.
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:06.240]   And the really fast speeds are hard to find with both AT&T and Verizon.
[01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:09.360]   I did a review of AT&T's network when it launched here.
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:14.280]   The only place they have millimeter waves and locations downtown, one of them is in front
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:19.440]   of the building where the rockets play.
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:23.880]   I went out there with the phone and when I was sitting in my car on the street next to
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:27.240]   the building, I was getting the sub-six speeds.
[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:31.560]   And I walked out and stood in the middle of the plaza.
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:37.040]   And I was getting like almost a gigabit down.
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:43.600]   But then if I moved like 100 feet away, I got sub-six speeds again.
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:50.680]   The experience right now 5G has been sold on millimeter wave to the public.
[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:52.320]   That's where the hype is.
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:53.880]   And nobody's getting that.
[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:55.440]   And nobody's getting that.
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:57.440]   And I think people are understanding now.
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:44:59.880]   I do think people want it for the future.
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:04.880]   I think if you're thinking ahead and if you're an enthusiast or maybe one step beyond an
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:10.120]   enthusiast where you know what you want, you want a 5G phone now.
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:14.000]   But I think most people are not going, oh my god, this is a 5G phone.
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.000]   I got to have it.
[01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.760]   But in about a year, it's not going to come.
[01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:20.800]   Well, yeah, this fold is 5G.
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:25.520]   And I put a Verizon SIM in it and I got a confusing message which I never really understood.
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:31.200]   But something about your SIM needs, if you're going to get 5G, you're going to need to,
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:32.680]   I don't know, do something.
[01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:37.840]   But I knew it was nonsense because there's no Verizon 5G anywhere near me.
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:38.920]   Because it's millimeter wave.
[01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:41.640]   So I just said, yeah, fine, whatever.
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:48.520]   So PC Magazine does that annual, you know, mobile networks testing.
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:50.240]   They go to 26 cities.
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:52.360]   Sasha Segan does this every year.
[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:54.560]   Came out a couple of weeks ago.
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:58.640]   AT&T's 5G is actually slower than LTE.
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:45:59.640]   Yeah.
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:04.480]   And then no, you know, 5G isn't is when you can get it, if you can actually get it is
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:07.480]   great, but no one's getting it anywhere.
[01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:10.200]   So it's kind of a disappointment.
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:15.040]   I did that story and I said, because I've had to do several of those recently.
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:21.240]   And the point I've been making is everyone remembers going to 3G versus Edge, you know?
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:22.640]   Oh, that was huge.
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:23.640]   Yeah.
[01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:24.640]   Right.
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:28.840]   And so everyone has been hearing for however many years that 5G is coming.
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:31.360]   So everyone's expecting the same thing.
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:36.680]   Except for the fact that, remember also, a lot of people never had smartphones before
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:42.560]   on like we had enthusiasts had smartphones on edge networks and whatever.
[01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:47.920]   So if you remember back, like most people's experience of having their first smartphone
[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:52.440]   and how it changed their lives was having a fast internet and having a phone that could
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:53.440]   handle it.
[01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:57.240]   So I kind of feel like you asked the question originally are people.
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:46:58.240]   Ask for this.
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:46:59.240]   Waiting for 5G.
[01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:00.240]   Yeah.
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:01.240]   Yeah.
[01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:03.800]   I think that they are because they remember that they either remember the jump to 3G or
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:06.800]   they remember that it was around that time that they got their first smartphone and it
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:09.760]   changed their lives and it's just not going to do that.
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:10.760]   That's not going to do that.
[01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:13.920]   Here's the bottom line in the PC magazine.
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:19.320]   Here's the quote, "To make a long story short, AT&T 5G right now appears to be essentially
[01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:20.840]   worthless.
[01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:25.560]   T-Mobile 5G can be a big boost over 4G, but its speeds are only what we'd expect from
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:26.960]   a good 4G network.
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:28.720]   It isn't a new experience.
[01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:33.760]   Verizon's 5G is often mind-blowing, but very difficult to find.
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:34.760]   In Houston.
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:38.520]   In three blocks in New York City, that's it.
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:49.080]   In Houston, I've noticed that on the 4G phones I have, the 11 Pro Max that I care every day,
[01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:54.960]   that the 4G network has gotten better because the back-call for the entire area has gotten.
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:55.960]   That makes it bigger.
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:56.960]   Yes.
[01:47:56.960 --> 01:47:57.960]   Yes.
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:05.040]   I've been putting 20 megabits down on a 4G smartphone the other day and it was just, you
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:06.960]   know, that was really impressive.
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:15.680]   What was funny, I had a 5G phone with me on the same network and like the AT&T example,
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:19.120]   it did not do as well as the 4G at that particular moment.
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:23.120]   I guess it's kind of moot because if you get a new phone, it'll be 5G, but the Pixel
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:24.120]   5 will be 5G.
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:26.520]   The new iPhone 12 will be 5G.
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:32.240]   The Samsung is 5G and it's unlike last year when it was a premium price product that
[01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:36.440]   cost you more because you had to buy a 5G subscription.
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:40.920]   It's just more like the evolution from 3G to LTE.
[01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:47.360]   It's just a natural upgrade everybody will get, but don't hold your breath, kids.
[01:48:47.360 --> 01:48:50.720]   If you're looking for a life-changing experience, I don't think it's going to be that.
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:53.080]   At the same time, LTE is pretty fast.
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:56.720]   It's probably as fast as anybody needs or am I wrong?
[01:48:56.720 --> 01:48:59.680]   Does anybody say, "Oh gosh, I need more speed"?
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:07.040]   Supposedly, one of the big deals with which is coming with both Sub-6 and Villoween Wave
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:08.040]   is reduced latency.
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:10.560]   Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:14.760]   The latency, I think, is the bigger issue for a lot of the applications then.
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:18.480]   Particularly for cars, right?
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:22.360]   Yeah, but even social applications are gaming.
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:26.720]   Gaming to the server time is meaningful.
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:28.800]   The latency is going to make a big difference.
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:33.480]   That's a very good point because we are moving, there's another big trend, I think, to cloud
[01:49:33.480 --> 01:49:36.360]   gaming.
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:43.640]   The idea that you could do AAA games on a mobile device over a mobile network is pretty
[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:48.160]   compelling, but it's going to require some low latency and some decent speed.
[01:49:48.160 --> 01:49:50.640]   Mostly low latency for it to work.
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:56.680]   That was what all the hype was with 5G all these past few years.
[01:49:56.680 --> 01:50:00.760]   We'll do cloud gaming, virtual surgeries, we'll do your car.
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:04.280]   It'll allow self-driving cars to happen.
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:07.280]   Most of the time, though, people aren't going to notice that on their phone unless they're
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:10.160]   doing those specific things.
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:14.640]   What we're learning is that for the next 18 months or so, at least in the US, all you're
[01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:20.040]   really going to get is faster LTE because they're building out the infrastructure.
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:21.240]   That's what you get.
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:23.720]   Google is also expected to announce a new Chromecast.
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:29.920]   We know they will because Walmart accidentally listed it last week.
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:33.000]   Here's the picture from Walmart listing.
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:37.520]   This is saying with Android TV, and it even comes through the remote with a button for
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:39.600]   YouTube and Netflix.
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:40.600]   That's interesting.
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:42.200]   Android TV has been a laggard for a long time.
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:43.760]   I'm a big Android TV fan.
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:45.280]   I think I'm the only one.
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:50.520]   That's because I have an Nvidia Shield device, which is a very powerful speaking of mobile
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:51.520]   gaming.
[01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:53.800]   It plays the GeForce Now streaming games.
[01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:56.840]   It's a really nice TV device, but it's over.
[01:50:56.840 --> 01:50:57.840]   It's expensive.
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:00.160]   It's as much or more than an Apple TV.
[01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:06.040]   It doesn't have all the channels because they haven't made deals with HBO and other Chromecast
[01:51:06.040 --> 01:51:07.040]   and stuff.
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:11.320]   I limited what I could watch on it.
[01:51:11.320 --> 01:51:15.640]   If it had all the features of an Apple TV or a Roku, it'd be awesome.
[01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:19.680]   I'd love to see some support for Android TV going forward.
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:24.520]   This might be an important update.
[01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:27.840]   We'll watch on Wednesday with interest.
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:33.600]   Speaking of streaming gaming, I mentioned there's a battle going on in Cupertino with
[01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:43.400]   Epic Games and Spotify and Tile.
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:47.160]   They have formed the Coalition for App Fairness to "fight back" against Apple, an independent
[01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:52.480]   nonprofit organization founded by industry leading companies to advocate for freedom of
[01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:56.480]   choice and fair competition across the app ecosystem.
[01:51:56.480 --> 01:52:02.120]   You know, missing from this list is Microsoft, who actually you could argue is perhaps the
[01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:08.640]   one that will be most disadvantaged by Apple's refusal to put XCloud on there without major
[01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:09.640]   modifications.
[01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:14.400]   Microsoft has been benefiting a lot by keeping their heads down and not having to go for
[01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:15.400]   a couple of years.
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:16.400]   It's a good time to shut up.
[01:52:16.400 --> 01:52:18.600]   Also, I kept all this week.
[01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:20.680]   The real name they should have done was Rebel Alliance.
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:21.680]   I kept yelling at them.
[01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:22.680]   It is!
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:24.440]   Just calling out on the Rebel Alliance.
[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:27.920]   Well, listen, it's Epic Games, Spotify, Tile.
[01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:32.440]   Those all three have been very vocal for months in complaining Tile actually testified in Congress
[01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:36.680]   saying we can't compete against Apple's imaginary air tags.
[01:52:36.680 --> 01:52:38.720]   Basecamp, they're the ones who did, "Hey!"
[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:45.680]   The email program that swiftly sank after a very, very vocal fight against Apple.
[01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:46.840]   Blix, blockchain.
[01:52:46.840 --> 01:52:51.040]   I don't even know there was a thing called blockchain.
[01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:57.000]   Desar, the music company, which, you know, likes Spotify is probably a little scared.
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:00.320]   Formed by Apple One and the Apple Bundle, anything else.
[01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:04.800]   European Publishers Council, they don't like anything on the internet.
[01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:12.360]   News Media Europe Ditto, Proton Mail, which is an encrypted mail program in Skydemon.
[01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:14.960]   They're lobbying other developers to join them.
[01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:19.240]   The problem is, these are all people in certain specific categories.
[01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:20.320]   They're big people.
[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:23.440]   Most, like onesie-toozy, developers are thrilled with Apple.
[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:25.240]   They don't mind the 30% tax.
[01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:26.240]   They love it.
[01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:30.160]   They can make money on the Apple platform if they can get their apps through.
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:31.920]   Is there a problem in the App Store?
[01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:34.400]   What do you think, Peter?
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:39.960]   I think that the rules that they laid down 10 years ago with the introduction of the App Store
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:42.600]   were for a different internet than we have now.
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:48.200]   Certainly, you know, the introduction of cloud services, you know, the explosion of, frankly,
[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:58.640]   of enterprise SAS, the new kinds of subscription and services which are being introduced now.
[01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:04.000]   I think that setting aside whether 30% is the fair number or not, I think that's debatable.
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:09.560]   Certainly, whether or not Apple has a monopoly or not is factors into that.
[01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:12.240]   That might be a matter of perspective.
[01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:15.840]   But I think that Apple ripping up the rule book and saying, "We're going to start over
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:21.880]   and try to figure out something that feels coherent now versus having this sort of exception."
[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:26.240]   They have exceptions to the exceptions to the exceptions now that govern things.
[01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:31.120]   I think for developers, and we invest in a lot of people building apps that do have
[01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:37.720]   some product or service of one kind that Apple takes a 30% cut off.
[01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:44.160]   I think it's that sometimes it doesn't feel fair who, you know, what things are subject
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:46.360]   to that fee and what things aren't.
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:50.520]   And that, you know, Apple increasingly is sort of twisting itself in knots trying to
[01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:55.400]   have some coherent articulation of what the policies are.
[01:54:55.400 --> 01:54:56.800]   And so I think they should start over.
[01:54:56.800 --> 01:55:01.800]   And I think, frankly, given how big they are, given how long-term and valuable it is and
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:05.560]   important for them to have developers on their side, I think it would be in their while
[01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:10.160]   to, you know, cut the fee or introduce different structures.
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:14.240]   I mean, I think that they probably didn't anticipate that there would be companies like Facebook
[01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:20.080]   and, you know, TikTok that would have hundreds of millions of users on their platform.
[01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:24.840]   And essentially, you know, run those businesses for free and not give Apple any, you know,
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:29.040]   they don't, Facebook doesn't get enough Apple 30% of ads that are sold through, you know,
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:31.360]   their iOS app, Facebook's iOS app.
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:34.240]   And so, you know, you can imagine Facebook saying, "This is great, but if you're going
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:38.640]   to have an app with more than a million monthly active users on our platform or whatever
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:43.120]   volume, maybe you have to pay some, you know, fee or something like that."
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:46.600]   I'm just sort of, you know, throwing in ideas, but I think that like they could start over
[01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:50.280]   now and sort of say, "Given what we have now, the landscape we have now for apps, what
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:51.280]   would we do?"
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:53.280]   Because they're constrained by what they decided 10 years ago.
[01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:54.840]   I agree.
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:56:00.800]   And yet, and everybody, I think everybody who thinks about this logically agrees, for some
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:01.960]   reason, Apple does not.
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:03.920]   They're digging in their heels.
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:04.920]   Why?
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:05.920]   Why does an Apple...
[01:56:05.920 --> 01:56:07.640]   Oh, I think they'll come around.
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:08.640]   They're going to have to.
[01:56:08.640 --> 01:56:09.640]   They will.
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:10.920]   They just don't do it publicly.
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:12.080]   They don't do it publicly.
[01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:13.080]   Right.
[01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:17.320]   So one of the things that Spotify complained about, everybody, this coalition complained
[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:23.720]   about, is the side deal that EQ made with Jeff Bezos for Amazon that allows Amazon to
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:26.240]   kind of bypass the 30% in the store.
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:30.960]   And that's a problem because they can...every point to that, say, "See, Apple will make a
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:34.120]   deal with you, but not with us."
[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:38.000]   And that is something I would imagine any trust regulators would be interested.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.840]   Sorry, Brian, go ahead.
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:45.640]   Well, I think the thing...it'll be...it'll not be epic that puts it over the edge, but
[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:55.400]   it will be gaming because we know that gaming is bigger than Hollywood in terms of an industry
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:57.440]   by multiples at this point.
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:04.960]   And no one would ever expect that Netflix would have to pay per movie or whatever.
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:09.440]   I know that there's all these machinations in terms of the subscription and how you go
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:10.440]   off of it.
[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:16.040]   But the idea that everybody in tech and the entire gaming industry, which is bigger than
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:21.160]   Hollywood, is moving towards delivering their product digitally.
[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:24.440]   And Apple wants to step in front of that to 30%.
[01:57:24.440 --> 01:57:31.280]   There are ways that that is unsustainable for all the other people in this huge market
[01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:32.280]   and this ecosystem.
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:36.520]   Like, Apple's going to have to cut deals because otherwise it's literally going to be this
[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:41.080]   entire thing that will be the reason that people won't go to.
[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:47.040]   I can't go to...when I was a kid, I wasn't a Mac user because I couldn't play PC games
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:48.800]   on Macs, right?
[01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:51.680]   And history could repeat itself.
[01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:57.640]   It's going to be this whole move to streaming gaming that is going to, as Peter says, make
[01:57:57.640 --> 01:57:58.640]   them reevaluate.
[01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:03.000]   All right, we have rules in place for a certain period of time and they don't fit this period.
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000]   Times have changed.
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.000]   Times have changed.
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:08.160]   Yeah, that's why I'm surprised Microsoft is not.
[01:58:08.160 --> 01:58:09.160]   But you're right.
[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:12.120]   They're smart to keep their heads down because that's going to be the big one is XCloud.
[01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:15.320]   And Apple said, "Yeah, you could put XCloud on there, but each game has to be a standalone
[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:18.160]   app so that we can review each game."
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:23.040]   And these were kooky ideas that Microsoft said, "We're not going to do that."
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:26.920]   And I think, frankly, Epic could have just said, "They need the lawsuit.
[01:58:26.920 --> 01:58:28.520]   Yeah, go ahead and ban Fortnite.
[01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:30.080]   See how that works out for you."
[01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:31.280]   Microsoft says that.
[01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:32.280]   G4 says that.
[01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:34.680]   Sony said, "All the streaming gaming systems."
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:39.840]   Because do you guys agree streaming gaming is the future of gaming?
[01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:42.320]   I love...I mean, I think...
[01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:43.880]   I don't know if I necessarily...
[01:58:43.880 --> 01:58:44.880]   I think it's a...
[01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:45.880]   It's a future.
[01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:47.960]   I think it's part of the future of gaming.
[01:58:47.960 --> 01:58:50.680]   I don't think it's a dust future of gaming.
[01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:51.680]   I feel...
[01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:52.680]   Here's...
[01:58:52.680 --> 01:58:56.920]   Okay, I'm a little out on a limb on this, but I think that streaming everything is the
[01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:59.680]   future of computing.
[01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:03.680]   That it just makes more sense to put the computing power.
[01:59:03.680 --> 01:59:08.800]   For the first 50 years of the evolution of personal computing, it's been about pushing
[01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:11.920]   the computing to the edge.
[01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:13.000]   But I think we're...
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:16.160]   It's maybe it's like the expanding, contracting universe.
[01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:20.520]   We're now in the contraction phase where it really makes more sense to put all the computing
[01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:23.840]   power in the server so that you can...
[01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:27.920]   Just as you can do word processing on any device and your documents are available on
[01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:32.040]   every device, that's the power of the cloud for productivity, you could do the same thing
[01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:37.840]   with your game, then you don't have to buy an expensive PC to game or even an expensive
[01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:39.120]   console.
[01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:40.400]   You could do it on your iPad.
[01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:42.560]   That's why I think Apple's missing the boat on this.
[01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:44.280]   This is good for the iPad.
[01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:49.000]   Some say it's because it's anti-competitive because they have arcade and Apple wants to
[01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:50.160]   own the gaming market.
[01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:53.720]   I don't know if Apple's that focused.
[01:59:53.720 --> 01:59:55.360]   How well is arcade doing?
[01:59:55.360 --> 01:59:57.160]   I can't imagine it's doing that well.
[01:59:57.160 --> 01:59:58.160]   It's not doing that well.
[01:59:58.160 --> 02:00:01.200]   Yeah, it's part of the bundle, the Apple One bundle.
[02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:06.360]   And I think that that's going to save Apple TV plus and save arcade, save news plus, all
[02:00:06.360 --> 02:00:11.040]   three of which I think are not doing that well, by bundling it in with stuff that is
[02:00:11.040 --> 02:00:16.120]   doing well like Apple Music and iCloud, which you kind of have to use if you're an Apple
[02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:18.560]   user.
[02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:24.080]   I'll end up keeping my Apple TV plus subscription just because it'll come with the Apple One.
[02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:29.360]   But really, if you give me three things that I really don't care about, that's really going
[02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:30.360]   to make me pay up.
[02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:32.280]   I'm really kind of skeptical about that.
[02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:33.280]   Interesting.
[02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:34.280]   Yeah, good point.
[02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:40.560]   So what about, so we saw this transition to streaming from content, right?
[02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:44.720]   Nobody owns, well, okay, I shouldn't say that.
[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:46.480]   That sounds way too blanket.
[02:00:46.480 --> 02:00:48.480]   Most people don't buy CDs anymore.
[02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:52.400]   In fact, it's kind of the point now where actually more vinyl records will be sold in
[02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:54.480]   CDs this year.
[02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:57.320]   That's in the story for another time.
[02:00:57.320 --> 02:00:58.480]   Everything's streaming.
[02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:01.800]   Why even have content on any device?
[02:01:01.800 --> 02:01:06.480]   If you could do an operating system in apps and gaming that way, wouldn't people want
[02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:07.480]   to do this?
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:08.680]   Isn't that five years down the road?
[02:01:08.680 --> 02:01:10.160]   That's going to be what computing is like.
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:15.360]   And the point is, is that it's not just whatever the content.
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:18.160]   It is the hardware doesn't matter.
[02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:19.960]   It's one of the screen is at hand.
[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:20.960]   That's right.
[02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:25.960]   So my kids don't know the difference between playing on the television versus playing on
[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:28.720]   a handheld versus playing on an iPad versus playing on a phone.
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:29.720]   It doesn't matter.
[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:34.440]   The whole point is that computing is, the screen is just the portal and the computing
[02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:35.760]   happens elsewhere.
[02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:37.240]   Enthusiast hated.
[02:01:37.240 --> 02:01:40.160]   But this is the problem with this show and everything we do.
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:42.320]   We're all enthusiasts.
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:44.840]   But real people, this is where it's going to go.
[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:48.160]   Enthusiasts are going to, they'll still be people building their own gaming PC in the
[02:01:48.160 --> 02:01:50.160]   year 2535.
[02:01:50.160 --> 02:01:57.840]   They'll still be people with man is still alive, woman can survive.
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:00.680]   They'll still be, they'll always be people who are doing that.
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:06.320]   There's still people today who have turntables and giant sandboxes with, so there's always
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:07.560]   going to be that enthusiast market.
[02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:11.880]   But I think the mass market is going to move to streaming, certainly in gaming.
[02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:14.280]   It's happened in productivity.
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:21.400]   I read a really interesting piece on, it was on Hacker News on the end of desktop computing
[02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:26.120]   in which his premise was Microsoft has lost interest in Windows.
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:28.400]   This is actually my opinion as well.
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:33.160]   It feels like this happening already because at some point the cost of maintaining it's
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:39.240]   going to exceed the cost, the value, the benefit, the revenue you make from it.
[02:02:39.240 --> 02:02:43.320]   So they're slowly inserting Linux into Windows.
[02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:46.320]   At some point they're just going to stream it.
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:47.320]   You know what?
[02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:50.320]   At some point users are going to demand this because every time you install a Microsoft
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:56.400]   update now it breaks a finite percentage of users experience breaks.
[02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:59.720]   People are just bitching and moaning about 2004 and Windows.
[02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:03.200]   And I think Microsoft just at some point going to say, "Fine, we'll run it."
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:04.200]   You stream it.
[02:03:04.200 --> 02:03:06.640]   You'll stream Windows just like you do anything else.
[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:09.200]   And at some point it's not even going to matter if you're running Windows.
[02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:13.000]   Microsoft's entire business is moving to cloud, to streaming.
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:14.480]   That's why they're doing XCloud.
[02:03:14.480 --> 02:03:16.480]   Their money is in Azure.
[02:03:16.480 --> 02:03:23.080]   Azure, actually, Azure revenues have now actually exceeded that of both Office and Windows division.
[02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:24.080]   And so...
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:25.720]   There are already a streaming version of Windows?
[02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:26.720]   Yeah.
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:27.720]   Yeah.
[02:03:27.720 --> 02:03:35.360]   So you got to point out, by far Linux is the most popular operating system on Azure, not
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:38.040]   Windows.
[02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:45.040]   So Microsoft's big update with 2004 is to put the WSL, a Windows subsystem for Linux,
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:50.400]   so that you have a Microsoft-written Linux kernel running in your Windows machine.
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:53.480]   What does that tell you?
[02:03:53.480 --> 02:03:54.480]   I don't know.
[02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:55.480]   I just...
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:59.760]   I know, I'm looking at a Bizarro streaming future.
[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:02.280]   I just feel like that's where everything's going to go.
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:05.240]   So nobody wants to fuss with Windows anymore.
[02:04:05.240 --> 02:04:09.080]   Nobody wants to fuss with an operating system.
[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:16.240]   So does the coming of Apple Silicon and what that may enable?
[02:04:16.240 --> 02:04:20.880]   I think it's hard to push Apple towards a streaming.
[02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:22.200]   Yeah, I think it's backwards.
[02:04:22.200 --> 02:04:28.440]   I think Apple is...I'm thrilled about it as an old-time computer user, but I think it's
[02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:34.080]   actually a little bit of a retro thing to do because I think the desktop processors matter
[02:04:34.080 --> 02:04:35.080]   in less and less.
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:36.080]   So...
[02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:38.840]   But it's not a desktop processor.
[02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:39.840]   It's not?
[02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:40.840]   It's an iPhone processor.
[02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:41.840]   Well...
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:46.920]   And it's all of the things that that system on a chip and what that enables in terms of
[02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:47.920]   efficiency.
[02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:48.920]   Right.
[02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:53.680]   So your back is going to become an iPhone.
[02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:58.600]   And if you extrapolate out that, what does that mean for it?
[02:04:58.600 --> 02:05:03.880]   I guess you'll need local computing for machine learning, especially with Apple because they're
[02:05:03.880 --> 02:05:05.840]   doing everything on device.
[02:05:05.840 --> 02:05:06.840]   On the device, right.
[02:05:06.840 --> 02:05:09.200]   You'll need it for photography.
[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:10.360]   So you're right.
[02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:12.200]   But actually you're right.
[02:05:12.200 --> 02:05:13.200]   That makes sense.
[02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:17.520]   Apple Silicon, because it's so customizable, can be...
[02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:18.520]   It's not an Intel chip.
[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:21.240]   It's not a desktop-class computing chip.
[02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:24.360]   It's whatever it is needed at the moment.
[02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:28.320]   And so it can support the services that you do want to do locally.
[02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:33.720]   And then it'll just be an internet connectivity that matters.
[02:05:33.720 --> 02:05:34.720]   Does it...
[02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:37.880]   Somebody in the chatroom says, "Apple Silicon turns computers into appliances."
[02:05:37.880 --> 02:05:41.480]   Does that sound right?
[02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:42.480]   Maybe.
[02:05:42.480 --> 02:05:43.480]   Maybe.
[02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:48.480]   Peter, you must, because of your business, you must spend a lot of time thinking.
[02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:49.480]   Thinking about things like this.
[02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:53.160]   Like, what's the future of computing going to look like?
[02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:55.520]   Well, that's a big question, Leo.
[02:05:55.520 --> 02:05:57.600]   But we do think a lot about...
[02:05:57.600 --> 02:06:00.320]   I mean, I'm investing in startups, right.
[02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:02.800]   And so one of the things we think about is where the startup opportunity is going to
[02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:03.800]   be.
[02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:10.880]   If everything is run on from the cloud and it's big companies that dominate what can
[02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:14.240]   be built in the cloud, what are the startup opportunities going to be?
[02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:18.440]   I'm not super cynical and think that there's no opportunities for...
[02:06:18.440 --> 02:06:21.240]   Smaller players to build things.
[02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:27.360]   But I do think that there are some advantages for people being able to locally execute code
[02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:28.680]   and the things that you can build.
[02:06:28.680 --> 02:06:30.960]   And I think not necessarily...
[02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:36.000]   When it's an entirely cloud-based system, the restrictions on what you can do are going
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:37.880]   to be much stronger.
[02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:39.840]   And certainly the ability...
[02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:43.600]   You talk about having a kill switch with TikTok earlier.
[02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:47.840]   It's much easier to kill something from...
[02:06:47.840 --> 02:06:53.560]   TikTok is just an app that's streaming from the Apple server somewhere.
[02:06:53.560 --> 02:06:56.640]   It's really easy for Apple to switch that off.
[02:06:56.640 --> 02:07:00.120]   And so I think that there are a lot of implications for this that...
[02:07:00.120 --> 02:07:05.520]   Talking about unintended consequences a lot of this stuff, you're worried about big tech
[02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:07.640]   companies having even more control over the future.
[02:07:07.640 --> 02:07:08.640]   They would, wouldn't it?
[02:07:08.640 --> 02:07:09.640]   Things.
[02:07:09.640 --> 02:07:12.120]   When everything is streamed off their servers, and there's really only going to be a handful
[02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:14.120]   of companies that can do this.
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:17.280]   I mean, there's only really like three companies that can do...
[02:07:17.280 --> 02:07:18.280]   That's the incentive.
[02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:19.280]   Yeah.
[02:07:19.280 --> 02:07:20.280]   They can do cloud gaming, right?
[02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:25.000]   It's Amazon, it's Google, and it's Microsoft right now.
[02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:29.320]   And it'd be even tough for Facebook to get into that business right now.
[02:07:29.320 --> 02:07:30.320]   And so I think that...
[02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:33.600]   That's an argument that that's going to happen.
[02:07:33.600 --> 02:07:36.680]   That those companies are going to be pushing really hard for that to happen.
[02:07:36.680 --> 02:07:37.840]   Arguably, arguably.
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:42.240]   But the time to be investing in the infrastructure is now, right?
[02:07:42.240 --> 02:07:46.600]   I mean, if Facebook wants to compete, they can't start in three or four years to build
[02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:47.600]   out that...
[02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:50.560]   But doesn't Facebook have particular skill in network scaling?
[02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:51.560]   I mean, they must.
[02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:54.000]   They've two billion users.
[02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:55.000]   Absolutely.
[02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:56.000]   Absolutely.
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:57.000]   They have those skills.
[02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:58.000]   I'm just saying it's non-trivial, that's all.
[02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.240]   And we've seen the fact that...
[02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:03.080]   I mean, Apple has struggled around cloud services, right?
[02:08:03.080 --> 02:08:04.080]   It's been...
[02:08:04.080 --> 02:08:06.800]   It took them a while to catch up to everybody else.
[02:08:06.800 --> 02:08:10.320]   And I'd say arguably they're still catching up in a lot of ways.
[02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:17.160]   And it's been interesting to see the alliance, so to speak, that's developing between Microsoft
[02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:20.200]   and Apple when it comes to the cloud.
[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:27.240]   They are also really well aligned around privacy in a way that Apple wouldn't be with Google
[02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:30.160]   or Facebook around this stuff.
[02:08:30.160 --> 02:08:35.640]   So one of the other big stories of the week is App is a Microsoft buying Bethesda, which
[02:08:35.640 --> 02:08:43.800]   is a big game developer for seven and a half billion dollars, which is, I mean, even for
[02:08:43.800 --> 02:08:46.480]   Microsoft, a hefty amount of money.
[02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:48.400]   Bethesda does Doom.
[02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:49.880]   They do Fallout.
[02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:52.880]   They do Elder Scrolls.
[02:08:52.880 --> 02:08:55.240]   And they do...
[02:08:55.240 --> 02:08:57.680]   What else?
[02:08:57.680 --> 02:08:59.800]   There's some other big games.
[02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:01.480]   Those are big enough, certainly.
[02:09:01.480 --> 02:09:02.480]   Fallout.
[02:09:02.480 --> 02:09:04.040]   Fallout, yeah.
[02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:07.800]   This is a huge play for Microsoft to become big in gaming.
[02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:13.120]   And you really have to ask, why would Microsoft spend more money on Bethesda than they did
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:15.200]   on GitHub?
[02:09:15.200 --> 02:09:18.480]   GitHub makes sense for Microsoft, but why gaming?
[02:09:18.480 --> 02:09:23.560]   And I think that this is more evidence that this is the future, that this streaming gaming
[02:09:23.560 --> 02:09:24.560]   thing.
[02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:28.280]   I mean, you could say, well, initially it's about Xbox.
[02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:31.640]   They have a new Xbox coming out and they need more exclusive titles.
[02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:35.040]   But they have a longer-term strategy.
[02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:39.880]   They immediately have the exclusives for this gen launch, right?
[02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:44.000]   But going forward in the same way that you're like, well, who am I going to subscribe to?
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:47.480]   Netflix or Apple TV Plus?
[02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:48.480]   It's content.
[02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:50.200]   It's all just content.
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:51.200]   Yeah.
[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:52.200]   Yeah.
[02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:57.640]   And I'm feverishly looking for the number, but I think that their internal studios is
[02:09:57.640 --> 02:09:59.840]   like now at 30 or something like this.
[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:05.120]   This jumps them up to the number of gaming studios that they have internally.
[02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:07.840]   And somebody pointed out that is such a big number.
[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:09.840]   Sony couldn't even look at it.
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:13.080]   Their revenue doesn't even approximate that.
[02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:18.000]   It's at a scale that's even Sony with their PlayStation cannot contemplate.
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:25.920]   And also, in terms of prestige, it puts that deal in kind of the same category as all the
[02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:29.200]   ones that Disney has made with Marvel and Pixar.
[02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:31.800]   I think that that's really the way to think of it now.
[02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:32.800]   It's really interesting.
[02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:34.800]   It's content.
[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:37.800]   It's like Netflix spending billions on content.
[02:10:37.800 --> 02:10:38.800]   That's what it is.
[02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:39.800]   Yeah.
[02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:42.200]   Microsoft wants to be the Disney of game.
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:43.200]   Yeah.
[02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:45.200]   So I would say two things about this.
[02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:50.240]   I think one is Microsoft has taken a different strategy for this next generation than Sony,
[02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:51.240]   right?
[02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:54.720]   They're focusing on Xbox being something you subscribe to, like Brian said, and you can
[02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:56.640]   consume across lots of different platforms.
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:10:58.640]   And not just via streaming.
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:02.560]   You can download games and play them on your Xbox or your PC.
[02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:03.800]   But that's what they're trying to think of.
[02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:09.040]   They're trying to shift it to recurring monthly revenue rather than you buy a console every
[02:11:09.040 --> 02:11:15.520]   seven years and then you buy and then they get a cut of some of the titles that you buy.
[02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:19.680]   I think the other part to your point where you're saying about content, Leo, is that
[02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:21.920]   they're buying these universes, right?
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:22.920]   These fictional settings.
[02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:30.160]   And I think the idea that Skyrim could be a fictional setting that people care about
[02:11:30.160 --> 02:11:32.160]   as much as Star Wars--
[02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:33.160]   I do.
[02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:35.160]   --thrones, that is not implausible.
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:36.160]   No.
[02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:40.400]   And I think that-- and actually, I did something about this.
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:43.480]   I'm working on something on the side about these shared creative universes about sort
[02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:45.400]   of GitHub for fictional settings.
[02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:50.520]   The idea of how do you create a platform so people can collaborate together to create
[02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:52.280]   these fictional worlds?
[02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:56.320]   Not just the stories themselves, but the lore and the maps and the genealogies.
[02:11:56.320 --> 02:11:57.320]   There's a term.
[02:11:57.320 --> 02:12:01.080]   Peter, Peter, you said you want to do an invest in metaverses, right?
[02:12:01.080 --> 02:12:02.080]   That's it, right?
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:03.080]   Yeah.
[02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:06.520]   Well, metaverses, I think, are the 3D instantiations of these, right?
[02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:11.480]   But you're saying, like, where I can go to hang out with people, to collaborate with people,
[02:12:11.480 --> 02:12:13.600]   that's the metaverse, yeah.
[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:16.880]   There's a theory-- and I can't remember, Peter, in your research, you probably come across
[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:17.880]   this.
[02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:18.880]   And I can't remember the term.
[02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:19.880]   It's like metaverse.
[02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:26.120]   But this is the Lucas theory, which is you create a giant universe with multiple entry
[02:12:26.120 --> 02:12:30.120]   points, movies, comic books, action figures.
[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:31.480]   You name it.
[02:12:31.480 --> 02:12:38.080]   And that it all becomes one brand that is a marketing behemoth, is an economic behemoth.
[02:12:38.080 --> 02:12:40.440]   I can't remember the term for that.
[02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:41.440]   But there's--
[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:42.440]   Lucas pioneered it.
[02:12:42.440 --> 02:12:45.320]   Yeah, there's a paracosum sometimes.
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:47.560]   Yeah, that's the word.
[02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:51.040]   And that's what I might call my project.
[02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:56.880]   But I think that part of it is that people are going to have these paracosums or fictional
[02:12:56.880 --> 02:13:02.720]   settings or creative universes that they invest a lot of time in as fans and as co-creators.
[02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:08.040]   And I think that owning one of them is going to be incredibly valuable.
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:13.040]   And I think that the fact that Star Wars was able to transition from a story to a setting
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:17.600]   was undervalued if it was at 4 billion.
[02:13:17.600 --> 02:13:19.400]   It's clearly worth more than that.
[02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:20.400]   Oh, man.
[02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:21.400]   Yeah.
[02:13:21.400 --> 02:13:26.760]   But I think that if you think about where people are going to spend their time consuming
[02:13:26.760 --> 02:13:30.920]   content and hanging out with their friends, they may only have two or three of these that
[02:13:30.920 --> 02:13:31.920]   they care about.
[02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:37.840]   And if you can own one of them and have something that people subscribe to to access and participate
[02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:41.240]   in, it's going to be incredibly lucrative going forward.
[02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:47.840]   And I think that I think 10 years from now, the idea that we may spend a lot of our time
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:52.800]   investing and co-creating some sort of fictional setting, that does not seem ludicrous at all
[02:13:52.800 --> 02:13:53.800]   to me.
[02:13:53.800 --> 02:13:54.800]   No.
[02:13:54.800 --> 02:13:56.760]   And you can already think about the exemplars of this.
[02:13:56.760 --> 02:14:00.800]   Lucas is the first Star Wars, but there's Marvel.
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:04.440]   There's Middle Earth for the Tolkien fans.
[02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:06.440]   There's the Harry Potter universe.
[02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:07.440]   Yeah.
[02:14:07.440 --> 02:14:10.000]   And these have taken a life of their own.
[02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:17.840]   I mean, Harry Potter has gone so far beyond the books and the movies even and the games.
[02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:21.600]   You know, it's a part of the Universal theme park.
[02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:23.720]   This is really interesting to watch.
[02:14:23.720 --> 02:14:27.480]   Well, and so what's the best-selling entertainment franchise of all time?
[02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:29.600]   Does anybody know how to tell their head?
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:32.160]   It's not Dr. James Bond, isn't it?
[02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:33.160]   Is it?
[02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:34.160]   James Bond.
[02:14:34.160 --> 02:14:35.160]   Grand Theft Auto.
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:36.160]   Grand Theft Auto.
[02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:37.160]   Holy cow.
[02:14:37.160 --> 02:14:38.160]   In terms of dollar value?
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:39.160]   Really?
[02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:41.320]   Holy cow.
[02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:46.120]   And what's also the best-selling game every year right now?
[02:14:46.120 --> 02:14:47.120]   It's Grand Theft Auto.
[02:14:47.120 --> 02:14:48.120]   Still, seven years after--
[02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:49.120]   Still.
[02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:50.120]   --The thought of five came out.
[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:51.120]   That's impressive.
[02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:52.120]   Because that's horrible.
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:56.120]   It's because of Grand Theft Auto Online.
[02:14:56.120 --> 02:14:57.120]   Yeah.
[02:14:57.120 --> 02:14:59.400]   You know, it's funny, is Rockstar didn't even anticipate-- I mean, the online part was sort
[02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:01.240]   of an afterthought seven years ago.
[02:15:01.240 --> 02:15:05.160]   But now it's a living, breathing place where people role play.
[02:15:05.160 --> 02:15:08.120]   And what is fascinating about Grand Theft Auto Online is like, it's not just about being
[02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:09.120]   a gangster or whatever.
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:11.560]   People are like, oh, I have a store.
[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:12.560]   You know?
[02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:13.560]   Yeah.
[02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:14.560]   Like, I just like sell stuff.
[02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:15.560]   I just like-- I'm just like, yeah, I miss a little shopkeeper.
[02:15:15.560 --> 02:15:16.560]   Yeah.
[02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:18.520]   Oh, and by the way, who owns Rockstar?
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:19.520]   Tencent.
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:20.520]   Tencent.
[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:21.520]   Tencent.
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:22.520]   China.
[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:27.520]   No, it's-- Take two interactive ones.
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:28.520]   Oh, it's Take Two.
[02:15:28.520 --> 02:15:29.520]   I can never mind.
[02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:30.520]   Yeah.
[02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:35.520]   Tencent owns-- they own 40% of Epic, which is more-- Epic.
[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:39.080]   But then they also League of Legends-- The South African Company owns a big part of Tencent.
[02:15:39.080 --> 02:15:40.080]   Yeah.
[02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:41.080]   So it's--
[02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:42.080]   It's complicated.
[02:15:42.080 --> 02:15:43.080]   Like, we're listening to the-- to defend you.
[02:15:43.080 --> 02:15:46.000]   Like, China has bought up so much or has pieces so much.
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:47.240]   It's hard to keep track of it.
[02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:48.240]   Yeah.
[02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:50.000]   Well, if the gaming industry is special, yeah.
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:51.000]   Yeah.
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:52.000]   Yeah.
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:53.000]   Oh, man.
[02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:54.000]   I thought I had a really good one.
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:55.000]   Can-- is this a gesture?
[02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:56.000]   [imitates sound effect]
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:57.000]   Uh, let's-- [LAUGHTER]
[02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:00.240]   Tencent is clear-- no, but Tencent is clearly interested in this, right?
[02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:01.240]   Sure.
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:04.040]   They think they are investing in things that are building the pieces of this.
[02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:08.680]   And I think there's one company that is best positioned to, you know, benefit from this
[02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:09.680]   transition.
[02:16:09.680 --> 02:16:10.680]   It's going to be Tencent.
[02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:11.680]   Yeah.
[02:16:11.680 --> 02:16:18.440]   And if you want to-- so if you are a nation state looking to dominate economically, looking
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:25.640]   to become a world power, what better way than to own a few multiverses, a few paracosms
[02:16:25.640 --> 02:16:29.280]   that are, you know, already in people's heads?
[02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:31.840]   If I could buy QAnon, I would buy it.
[02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:33.920]   That'd be a good thing to own these days.
[02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:35.480]   Let's take a little break.
[02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:36.640]   I'm joking.
[02:16:36.640 --> 02:16:40.080]   Joking, no one can own QAnon.
[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:45.200]   Our show today is brought to you by ExtraHop, the new IT reality.
[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:47.240]   We're talking about it, aren't we?
[02:16:47.240 --> 02:16:54.000]   Remote access on a massive scale, rapid cloud and multi-cloud adoption, Internet of Things
[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.520]   Everywhere.
[02:16:56.520 --> 02:16:57.520]   And you know what?
[02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:00.280]   It's all vulnerable to cybercrime.
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:04.560]   It's so important that as an organization, you can see what's going on in your environment,
[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:08.240]   all the way from the cloud or the data center to the customer.
[02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:09.520]   That's to scale your business.
[02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:11.560]   It's also to protect your business.
[02:17:11.560 --> 02:17:14.440]   And you need more than just, you know, visibility.
[02:17:14.440 --> 02:17:17.680]   You also need to understand what you're seeing.
[02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:23.120]   So when you get a threat or a detection, you can respond to it quickly and intelligently.
[02:17:23.120 --> 02:17:25.840]   And that's what ExtraHop does.
[02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:30.400]   And by doing it, it helps businesses stop reaches 70 percent faster.
[02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:37.720]   It helps you keep your business secure, SaaS-based cloud, native network detection and response.
[02:17:37.720 --> 02:17:40.200]   Lots of people use ExtraHop to keep an eye on their network.
[02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:43.840]   Wizards of the coast, you know, these are the magic, the gathering folks.
[02:17:43.840 --> 02:17:46.960]   They support their AWS cloud with ExtraHop.
[02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:48.280]   We talked to a dam at Daniel.
[02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:51.040]   He's their chief architect and information security officer.
[02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:57.320]   He said, "There's no other company that aligns to supporting our DevOps model, the speed
[02:17:57.320 --> 02:17:59.680]   and the lack of friction than ExtraHop.
[02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:05.160]   Ulta Beauty uses ExtraHop to secure their Google cloud and keep their networking and
[02:18:05.160 --> 02:18:09.040]   security teams closely aligned so engineers have more time to focus on innovation.
[02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:13.360]   If you think about Ulta, they have branches, they have stores all over the world.
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:19.200]   They've got a huge cloud to monitor with transactions going back and forth.
[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:24.320]   In your IT and engineer at Ulta, John Crease says, "Before ExtraHop, we had limited visibility
[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:26.040]   to what was going on in the cloud.
[02:18:26.040 --> 02:18:31.160]   But now we can quickly identify vulnerabilities and exploits and understand how our applications

[02:19:08.800 --> 02:19:10.680]   Quibi.
[02:19:10.680 --> 02:19:19.760]   Oh, I guess that Quibi is not creating a paracosum.
[02:19:19.760 --> 02:19:25.480]   They're now seeking to sell themselves less than six months after launch the $2 billion
[02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:26.480]   play.
[02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:28.720]   I have to admit, a little shot in Freud because I look at Hollywood.
[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:32.200]   I know they're looking at YouTube and saying, "How can we look at those kids over there
[02:19:32.200 --> 02:19:33.640]   on YouTube and TikTok?
[02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:34.840]   How can we get into that?"
[02:19:34.840 --> 02:19:35.840]   "Oh, yeah.
[02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:38.480]   Well, what we need is a Chrissy Teigen is a judge.
[02:19:38.480 --> 02:19:39.960]   That'll do it."
[02:19:39.960 --> 02:19:43.640]   And then short seven minute videos and you can turn it sideways.
[02:19:43.640 --> 02:19:46.960]   I don't know what you would be buying if you bought Quibi at this point, but I can guarantee
[02:19:46.960 --> 02:19:47.960]   you.
[02:19:47.960 --> 02:19:52.000]   Don't forget, Leo, Jeffrey Casenberg said that he knows more about content than--
[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:53.000]   Oh.
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:57.440]   --than-- or I can't remember what the quote was, than he was doing content before you were
[02:19:57.440 --> 02:19:58.440]   born.
[02:19:58.440 --> 02:20:02.200]   I'm doing-- I invented Shrek, god damn it.
[02:20:02.200 --> 02:20:04.480]   Okay, Jeff.
[02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:05.480]   Chill out.
[02:20:05.480 --> 02:20:08.000]   Actually, I'm told he's incredibly litigious.
[02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:09.000]   So I'm sorry, Jeff.
[02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:10.000]   You're a nice guy.
[02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.640]   You're a nice guy.
[02:20:12.640 --> 02:20:15.960]   I'm not celebrating their failure.
[02:20:15.960 --> 02:20:16.960]   It's just--
[02:20:16.960 --> 02:20:17.960]   Well, you know--
[02:20:17.960 --> 02:20:18.960]   It's hard.
[02:20:18.960 --> 02:20:19.960]   It's hard to do what these guys are doing.
[02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:23.360]   To bring it back to TikTok, I, again, can't find this.
[02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:28.120]   I've been searching feverishly, but someone on Twitter made the excellent point that
[02:20:28.120 --> 02:20:32.280]   what if Quibi became the premium version of TikTok?
[02:20:32.280 --> 02:20:34.280]   Oh, TikTok.
[02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:35.280]   That's not a bad idea.
[02:20:35.280 --> 02:20:36.720]   TikTok premium.
[02:20:36.720 --> 02:20:41.480]   So-- and I've said this before, so apologize if you've heard it before, but what this really
[02:20:41.480 --> 02:20:48.280]   illustrates is the very different models that Hollywood has versus social media on the
[02:20:48.280 --> 02:20:49.280]   internet.
[02:20:49.280 --> 02:20:55.240]   YouTube and TikTok succeed because they made platforms where for whatever reason users just
[02:20:55.240 --> 02:20:57.920]   want to put a lot of content on there.
[02:20:57.920 --> 02:20:59.400]   Millions of videos every day.
[02:20:59.400 --> 02:21:00.680]   Just upload, upload.
[02:21:00.680 --> 02:21:04.360]   And then all they had to do, they've got all this content and all they have to do is come
[02:21:04.360 --> 02:21:09.120]   up with an algorithm that surfaces the most popular content and profit.
[02:21:09.120 --> 02:21:13.400]   Meanwhile, Hollywood has this completely different model.
[02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:15.760]   You spent all this money up front.
[02:21:15.760 --> 02:21:19.040]   You know that most of the things you develop will be flops.
[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:24.040]   You hope that one out of 10 is a big enough hit to make enough money to make up for all
[02:21:24.040 --> 02:21:25.360]   the other ones.
[02:21:25.360 --> 02:21:28.040]   And then, you know, you put it out there.
[02:21:28.040 --> 02:21:30.240]   And I think we have a winner.
[02:21:30.240 --> 02:21:32.920]   I think we just have a winner.
[02:21:32.920 --> 02:21:38.800]   It's pretty clear that YouTube and TikTok and basically social media in general, it's
[02:21:38.800 --> 02:21:40.480]   just a better way of doing it.
[02:21:40.480 --> 02:21:42.560]   And I think Hollywood should just give up.
[02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:46.200]   Well, Quibi has a scarcity mindset, right?
[02:21:46.200 --> 02:21:47.200]   That's right.
[02:21:47.200 --> 02:21:51.800]   The problem was that good content was scarce because, you know, it's the ego of saying
[02:21:51.800 --> 02:21:54.200]   only I know how to do content.
[02:21:54.200 --> 02:21:55.200]   Yeah.
[02:21:55.200 --> 02:21:59.880]   And I think that they thought there was a gap in the market that clearly was not there.
[02:21:59.880 --> 02:22:04.840]   There's a lot of things that work really well about TikTok, right?
[02:22:04.840 --> 02:22:06.520]   The algorithm is phenomenal.
[02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:12.400]   And what ByteDance brought to bear there with the acquisition of Musically was not working
[02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:13.400]   really before.
[02:22:13.400 --> 02:22:17.600]   I mean, it was sort of working, but applying the ByteDance personalization algorithm, you
[02:22:17.600 --> 02:22:19.160]   know, supercharge everything.
[02:22:19.160 --> 02:22:22.600]   But the other thing that is underappreciated about TikTok is the tools make it really,
[02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:27.240]   really easy to riff off of other people's work and to create something and engage in
[02:22:27.240 --> 02:22:29.240]   this sort of flow of content.
[02:22:29.240 --> 02:22:36.800]   And I think lowering the bar to participation is something that is really meaningful and
[02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:41.280]   made a big difference and created this abundance of content that when you have a good algorithm
[02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:46.040]   for servicing the best stuff, those two things paired together make something that a lot
[02:22:46.040 --> 02:22:47.960]   of people find very, very compelling.
[02:22:47.960 --> 02:22:51.440]   Quibi is sort of the inverse of all that.
[02:22:51.440 --> 02:22:52.440]   Yeah.
[02:22:52.440 --> 02:22:53.920]   Well, full stop.
[02:22:53.920 --> 02:22:54.920]   Full stop.
[02:22:54.920 --> 02:22:57.600]   Lesson learned.
[02:22:57.600 --> 02:22:58.600]   Lesson learned.
[02:22:58.600 --> 02:23:05.600]   The other thing is who among us when we heard about Quibi said, oh, no, no, that's not
[02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:06.600]   no.
[02:23:06.600 --> 02:23:07.600]   I did.
[02:23:07.600 --> 02:23:09.320]   Yes, I just said no.
[02:23:09.320 --> 02:23:11.040]   Yeah, we all thought it was a flop.
[02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:12.040]   Yeah.
[02:23:12.040 --> 02:23:16.800]   But you know, but in their defense, I remember people thinking Hulu was going to be a flop.
[02:23:16.800 --> 02:23:18.280]   Remember anything called the clown?
[02:23:18.280 --> 02:23:19.280]   How?
[02:23:19.280 --> 02:23:20.280]   How the clown co?
[02:23:20.280 --> 02:23:21.280]   Yeah.
[02:23:21.280 --> 02:23:23.480]   How Hulu is not a flop is mind boggling.
[02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:24.480]   Yeah.
[02:23:24.480 --> 02:23:27.360]   But just saying like sometimes we can be wrong, right?
[02:23:27.360 --> 02:23:28.360]   Oh, yes.
[02:23:28.360 --> 02:23:29.360]   And I always know.
[02:23:29.360 --> 02:23:30.360]   Oh, yes.
[02:23:30.360 --> 02:23:36.880]   Well, in theory, Netflix took the Hollywood model of we're going to throw a ton of money
[02:23:36.880 --> 02:23:41.040]   and good content and it's going to matter.
[02:23:41.040 --> 02:23:42.040]   Good point.
[02:23:42.040 --> 02:23:46.560]   In fact, they're doing all right, right?
[02:23:46.560 --> 02:23:49.800]   Five Republican senators have asked Netflix.
[02:23:49.800 --> 02:23:56.200]   Please, don't make a movie out of a Chinese science fiction novel.
[02:23:56.200 --> 02:23:59.000]   What is wrong with these people?
[02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:03.640]   It is by the way, a fantastic, I think it's a trilogy, right?
[02:24:03.640 --> 02:24:05.600]   John, the three body problem.
[02:24:05.600 --> 02:24:08.080]   We loved it.
[02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:11.520]   Liu Chi Shin wrote it.
[02:24:11.520 --> 02:24:13.720]   Netflix bought the rights to it.
[02:24:13.720 --> 02:24:19.480]   Senators Kevin Kramer, Marsha Blackburn and others said, we don't like this guy because
[02:24:19.480 --> 02:24:24.440]   he's a Chinese parroting Chinese Communist Party propaganda.
[02:24:24.440 --> 02:24:27.360]   So you shouldn't make a movie out of it.
[02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:31.400]   Netflix says, yeah, there's nothing in here about Uyghur Muslims.
[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:33.320]   We're going to make the movie.
[02:24:33.320 --> 02:24:41.480]   No, admittedly, I'm disappointed to know that Liu thinks that Chinese are doing the
[02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:43.960]   right thing with the Chinese with the Muslims.
[02:24:43.960 --> 02:24:49.360]   That's clearly not the case, but I think you can still make the movie because it's a really
[02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:50.920]   good book, right?
[02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:51.840]   We're looking forward to it.
[02:24:51.840 --> 02:24:54.720]   We're looking forward to foundation.
[02:24:54.720 --> 02:24:56.080]   See how Apple does with that?
[02:24:56.080 --> 02:24:58.160]   That'll be interesting.
[02:24:58.160 --> 02:24:59.160]   So you're right.
[02:24:59.160 --> 02:25:03.160]   There's plenty of life left, plenty of gas left in the Hollywood model.
[02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:05.920]   Have you reread foundation recently?
[02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:07.320]   No, why?
[02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:08.320]   Should I?
[02:25:08.320 --> 02:25:09.320]   Should I not?
[02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:15.600]   Because I kind of find it really boring and I'm, there's two things that I came to in
[02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:19.280]   the last three or four years that I had never read that are, you know, embarrassing to
[02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:21.280]   me, which is all the dune books.
[02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:22.280]   What?
[02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:23.280]   And foundation.
[02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:24.280]   I kind of listened.
[02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:25.920]   I'd love to read dune for the first time again.
[02:25:25.920 --> 02:25:28.960]   So I read dune and I was like, oh my God, I get it.
[02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:31.200]   I can see where everything came from.
[02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:32.920]   I can see where Star Wars came from.
[02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:34.720]   I can see everything.
[02:25:34.720 --> 02:25:38.720]   And I'm slogging through the foundation books.
[02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:41.360]   And it's like it was a pretty, it was a long time ago.
[02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:42.360]   Where far longer?
[02:25:42.360 --> 02:25:43.360]   Where are you?
[02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:44.360]   I read them.
[02:25:44.360 --> 02:25:45.360]   Second.
[02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:46.600]   Second one.
[02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:48.560]   And I don't know that I can continue.
[02:25:48.560 --> 02:25:51.160]   You got to get to the second foundation stuff.
[02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:52.160]   Okay.
[02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:53.560]   I'm not very far into the second.
[02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:54.560]   Yeah.
[02:25:54.560 --> 02:25:55.560]   It.
[02:25:55.560 --> 02:25:56.560]   I don't know.
[02:25:56.560 --> 02:25:59.000]   When the second foundation begin, it's not in the second book.
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:00.000]   It's not in the second book.
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:01.000]   No, no, no, you got it.
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:02.000]   You got many, many more books.
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:03.000]   I'm the piece.
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000]   It starts in the third.
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:06.960]   It starts in the third of them.
[02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:09.240]   So you got to get through the second, get to the third.
[02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:10.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:26:10.240 --> 02:26:11.240]   Okay.
[02:26:11.240 --> 02:26:12.240]   So let me give you my beef.
[02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:13.240]   But this is 1953.
[02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:14.240]   This was written.
[02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:15.240]   That's what I was going to say.
[02:26:15.240 --> 02:26:19.000]   It feels to me like watching a science fiction movie from the 50s.
[02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:20.000]   Really?
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.400]   I can see the black and white and like dialogue is.
[02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:27.120]   So like I can't, I don't know what is, I'm trying to get to the ideas that I'm like,
[02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:29.160]   it's similar with doing where it's like, I see the ideas.
[02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:32.480]   I see how these tropes generated.
[02:26:32.480 --> 02:26:36.400]   It's like the, you know, this band created a 300 other bands, even though they never
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:37.400]   sold anything.
[02:26:37.400 --> 02:26:41.800]   I don't know what the ideas are yet that are going to blow my mind.
[02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:45.040]   You know, there's stuff related to the second foundation where it's sort of like everything's
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:48.280]   like a reversal, like everything sort of gets reversed.
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:50.840]   You know, I don't want to spoil things, but like, okay.
[02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:51.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:26:51.840 --> 02:26:52.840]   Don't.
[02:26:52.840 --> 02:26:56.240]   Where it's something it's like, you know, you're like, Oh, wow.
[02:26:56.240 --> 02:27:01.400]   Like, you know, okay, so I'm still at the table setting and the table set, the table
[02:27:01.400 --> 02:27:03.000]   setting is not appetizing yet.
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:06.640]   But if I actually stick with the meal, I'll get it.
[02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:07.640]   Yes.
[02:27:07.640 --> 02:27:12.960]   And I will say this saying that like it's sort of the, you know, it peaks with the second
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:13.960]   foundation stuff.
[02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:19.760]   I have to admit, I read this in high school, which was practically the 50s.
[02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:25.760]   So I probably might have the same reaction had I not read it till today, Brian.
[02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:29.400]   And if you haven't seen everything you've seen since it's on.
[02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:30.400]   Yeah.
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:31.400]   Yeah.
[02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:32.400]   I read it for the first time.
[02:27:32.400 --> 02:27:33.400]   Read a lot of years ago and I enjoyed it.
[02:27:33.400 --> 02:27:34.400]   Really?
[02:27:34.400 --> 02:27:35.400]   Okay.
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:36.400]   Yeah.
[02:27:36.400 --> 02:27:38.840]   I've been saying before Apple comes out with it, I want to reread it because I am, I am
[02:27:38.840 --> 02:27:42.920]   of a strong opinion that in sci-fi, you should always read the book before you see the movie.
[02:27:42.920 --> 02:27:43.920]   Yeah.
[02:27:43.920 --> 02:27:48.040]   Unless it's a Star Wars, unless it's a Star Wars book because it was written after the
[02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:49.040]   movie.
[02:27:49.040 --> 02:27:50.360]   I'm not there.
[02:27:50.360 --> 02:27:54.880]   There's been certain sci-fi stuff like, is it Discworld or it's?
[02:27:54.880 --> 02:27:56.080]   Discworld is so good.
[02:27:56.080 --> 02:27:57.080]   Right.
[02:27:57.080 --> 02:27:58.280]   Which is, which is so good.
[02:27:58.280 --> 02:28:01.880]   But it's so in the 70s or late 60s or whatever that would be written.
[02:28:01.880 --> 02:28:03.080]   But I still love.
[02:28:03.080 --> 02:28:07.600]   No, Heinlein has that same problem where sometimes you go, it's cringey because he's
[02:28:07.600 --> 02:28:13.320]   yes, you know, he's, all the women are buxum and, you know, it's kind of cringey.
[02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:15.480]   Or even what is it, Forever War?
[02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:18.920]   Like that was another one that very, felt very 70s to me, but I still loved it.
[02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:19.920]   Yeah.
[02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:22.280]   I know on the same, on the other hand, I'm not modern science fiction.
[02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:28.040]   Sometimes I can't get into it because it's postmodern somehow in a way that I don't,
[02:28:28.040 --> 02:28:30.640]   I kind of like classic science fiction a little bit.
[02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:35.400]   I'm trying to read right now the first expanse book, The Viacin Away.
[02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:37.000]   Yeah, that's supposedly very good.
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:42.960]   I started, but I, yes, but it's so the TV series was so faithful to it that you already
[02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:43.960]   know it.
[02:28:43.960 --> 02:28:49.280]   There's, you know, it's like I already, I already saw the spoilers and Ray Bradbury
[02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:50.440]   is one who has hold.
[02:28:50.440 --> 02:28:53.280]   Oh, man, is he going to go back and re-brae Bradbury.
[02:28:53.280 --> 02:28:54.280]   Yeah.
[02:28:54.280 --> 02:28:55.280]   He has been.
[02:28:55.280 --> 02:28:57.320]   He definitely doesn't feel cringe.
[02:28:57.320 --> 02:28:58.320]   Yeah.
[02:28:58.320 --> 02:28:59.320]   Yeah.
[02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:00.320]   And Arthur C.
[02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:01.320]   Arthur C.
[02:29:01.320 --> 02:29:02.320]   Clark.
[02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:03.320]   Love Arthur C.
[02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:04.320]   Clark.
[02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:05.320]   He holds up really well.
[02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:14.400]   Hey, you can rent a, for five pounds, you can rent a goat for your next Zoom call.
[02:29:14.400 --> 02:29:18.400]   Crok Shaw, Fold Farm and Lancashire, England, by the way.
[02:29:18.400 --> 02:29:23.600]   You love the banner on the top of their website, coronavirus, forcing websites everywhere to
[02:29:23.600 --> 02:29:29.200]   add a generic banner message.
[02:29:29.200 --> 02:29:32.960]   Spice up your virtual meetings by a while ago.
[02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:37.120]   An upcoming video call, find out if your workmates, friends and family are paying attention
[02:29:37.120 --> 02:29:38.680]   by adding a goat.
[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:41.800]   Here's your choice.
[02:29:41.800 --> 02:29:47.240]   You can have Mary, Lisa, Elizabeth, they're all very cute goats.
[02:29:47.240 --> 02:29:49.400]   I would go for Daisy.
[02:29:49.400 --> 02:29:53.480]   This is the goat that was banned from participating in goat yoga due to head-butting other goats
[02:29:53.480 --> 02:29:57.640]   away from the humans so she can have all the attention.
[02:29:57.640 --> 02:30:00.520]   What to expect from Daisy in your Zoom call?
[02:30:00.520 --> 02:30:03.360]   Age and affection and equal measures.
[02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:06.680]   Then Daisy looks a little crazy.
[02:30:06.680 --> 02:30:13.180]   Oh, man, I don't want to end this show, but we are pretty much, we've, I've been waiting
[02:30:13.180 --> 02:30:15.200]   for the court order, but nothing happened.
[02:30:15.200 --> 02:30:17.240]   I don't know if I want to go all the way to midnight.
[02:30:17.240 --> 02:30:19.640]   Peter, so good to see you again.
[02:30:19.640 --> 02:30:25.720]   Peter Rojas, he anything, you're at beta works, anything, your website, rog.as.
[02:30:25.720 --> 02:30:26.720]   What is that, Austrian?
[02:30:26.720 --> 02:30:27.720]   ROG.
[02:30:27.720 --> 02:30:28.720]   ROG.
[02:30:28.720 --> 02:30:29.720]   ROG.
[02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:30.720]   That's good.
[02:30:30.720 --> 02:30:31.720]   Yeah.
[02:30:31.720 --> 02:30:36.680]   I waited years to get that to work.
[02:30:36.680 --> 02:30:38.400]   Did somebody else have it?
[02:30:38.400 --> 02:30:43.600]   It was a Kurdish socialist workers party.
[02:30:43.600 --> 02:30:45.080]   They're red, right?
[02:30:45.080 --> 02:30:46.080]   The Reds.
[02:30:46.080 --> 02:30:47.480]   I don't even know why they had it.
[02:30:47.480 --> 02:30:50.760]   It's something to do with the initials of the party and something like that.
[02:30:50.760 --> 02:30:52.920]   Did you have to buy it from them or did they let it live?
[02:30:52.920 --> 02:30:54.920]   No, I just waited for it to expire.
[02:30:54.920 --> 02:30:59.160]   I just set up a reminder to check it constantly.
[02:30:59.160 --> 02:31:04.080]   I screwed up because the Royal Bank of Canada had Leo.com and they let it go and somebody
[02:31:04.080 --> 02:31:05.080]   sniped it.
[02:31:05.080 --> 02:31:06.080]   I wish I'd...
[02:31:06.080 --> 02:31:07.080]   Yeah.
[02:31:07.080 --> 02:31:09.440]   Rojas, that's really good.
[02:31:09.440 --> 02:31:10.440]   ROG.as.
[02:31:10.440 --> 02:31:15.600]   Peter Rojas on the Twitter.
[02:31:15.600 --> 02:31:16.760]   Nothing to plug, huh?
[02:31:16.760 --> 02:31:17.760]   No, you got a...
[02:31:17.760 --> 02:31:18.760]   Beta works, beta worksfentures.com.
[02:31:18.760 --> 02:31:21.360]   Surely you got a podcast or something?
[02:31:21.360 --> 02:31:22.360]   You know what?
[02:31:22.360 --> 02:31:27.640]   I just last year called Zero G where I did a history of smartphones before the iPhone.
[02:31:27.640 --> 02:31:28.640]   Nice.
[02:31:28.640 --> 02:31:29.640]   Wow.
[02:31:29.640 --> 02:31:34.360]   Anchor got FM/0 like the number zero and then G.
[02:31:34.360 --> 02:31:36.520]   I'm going to listen to it.
[02:31:36.520 --> 02:31:37.520]   See, that's timeless.
[02:31:37.520 --> 02:31:39.520]   Yeah, it's fun.
[02:31:39.520 --> 02:31:42.680]   And now Brian really wants to get you on his Internet History podcast.
[02:31:42.680 --> 02:31:43.680]   I do.
[02:31:43.680 --> 02:31:44.680]   Let's put it this way.
[02:31:44.680 --> 02:31:47.240]   There's a great story about Ja Rule.
[02:31:47.240 --> 02:31:50.360]   Ja Rule and the pre-smartphone era.
[02:31:50.360 --> 02:31:51.360]   Wow.
[02:31:51.360 --> 02:31:53.880]   That's an episode I got to hear.
[02:31:53.880 --> 02:31:54.880]   Very good.
[02:31:54.880 --> 02:31:55.880]   Brian McCullough, not only...
[02:31:55.880 --> 02:31:58.080]   So how often is the Internet History podcast on?
[02:31:58.080 --> 02:31:59.720]   Is that a weekly thing or...?
[02:31:59.720 --> 02:32:01.920]   No, I haven't done one in about a year.
[02:32:01.920 --> 02:32:04.600]   I stopped at Episode 201.
[02:32:04.600 --> 02:32:05.600]   Okay.
[02:32:05.600 --> 02:32:10.560]   Listen, if Peter follows up and bugs me, then he can be 202.
[02:32:10.560 --> 02:32:11.560]   That's good.
[02:32:11.560 --> 02:32:13.600]   You should do it whenever you feel like it.
[02:32:13.600 --> 02:32:15.200]   Well, yeah, no pressure.
[02:32:15.200 --> 02:32:20.320]   I'm too busy with not to actually plug things, but the tech meme right home because it's
[02:32:20.320 --> 02:32:21.680]   every day as you say Leo.
[02:32:21.680 --> 02:32:25.520]   Yeah, I don't know how you'd have time to do anything else, frankly.
[02:32:25.520 --> 02:32:28.880]   And the great book on the Internet History, which I still have, in fact, I meant to bring
[02:32:28.880 --> 02:32:32.120]   it off the bookshelf for the show today, but I forgot.
[02:32:32.120 --> 02:32:33.120]   How the Internet happened.
[02:32:33.120 --> 02:32:34.880]   How the Internet happened.
[02:32:34.880 --> 02:32:36.240]   It's great to see you.
[02:32:36.240 --> 02:32:37.240]   Thank you, Brian.
[02:32:37.240 --> 02:32:38.640]   Thank you.
[02:32:38.640 --> 02:32:40.440]   And the tech burger himself.
[02:32:40.440 --> 02:32:41.880]   I'm sorry.
[02:32:41.880 --> 02:32:42.880]   I just can't...
[02:32:42.880 --> 02:32:44.360]   I see you now as a...
[02:32:44.360 --> 02:32:47.120]   Just like a slice of tomato, a pickle, some lettuce.
[02:32:47.120 --> 02:32:49.320]   I don't know why.
[02:32:49.320 --> 02:32:54.440]   It's Houston Chronicles, fabulous Dwight Silverman, who briefly thought about getting out of tech
[02:32:54.440 --> 02:32:56.080]   reporting.
[02:32:56.080 --> 02:32:58.000]   Thank God they changed his mind.
[02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.400]   They keep pulling you back in.
[02:33:00.400 --> 02:33:01.400]   Houston...
[02:33:01.400 --> 02:33:02.400]   I've got...
[02:33:02.400 --> 02:33:03.400]   I do this column again.
[02:33:03.400 --> 02:33:09.640]   I've got a newsletter and who knows what else may scroll a little bit and those pictures
[02:33:09.640 --> 02:33:10.640]   should jump into play.
[02:33:10.640 --> 02:33:11.640]   Oh, yeah.
[02:33:11.640 --> 02:33:12.640]   It's not...
[02:33:12.640 --> 02:33:13.640]   Well, that's just me.
[02:33:13.640 --> 02:33:15.960]   I am running so many anti...
[02:33:15.960 --> 02:33:20.640]   I bet you if I turn off my blockers, because it may be if it's loaded from the third party
[02:33:20.640 --> 02:33:21.640]   site or something.
[02:33:21.640 --> 02:33:22.640]   Uh-oh.
[02:33:22.640 --> 02:33:23.640]   Is that in Safari?
[02:33:23.640 --> 02:33:24.640]   It's Firefox.
[02:33:24.640 --> 02:33:26.640]   Oh, there it is.
[02:33:26.640 --> 02:33:27.640]   They loaded.
[02:33:27.640 --> 02:33:28.640]   Yeah, there we go.
[02:33:28.640 --> 02:33:29.640]   There we go.
[02:33:29.640 --> 02:33:30.640]   Yeah.
[02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:33.400]   That AT&T story is really interesting.
[02:33:33.400 --> 02:33:43.600]   I did a story last week about... AT&T was about to end the data cap waiver and it included
[02:33:43.600 --> 02:33:50.000]   a waiver on access from AT&T, which is their $10 low income service.
[02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:55.240]   And if you get hit with an overage fee on that, it doubles your internet price.
[02:33:55.240 --> 02:33:56.240]   Oh, that's terrible.
[02:33:56.240 --> 02:34:02.080]   A family's advocate had spoken up about it and I did the story about that.
[02:34:02.080 --> 02:34:03.080]   Good for you.
[02:34:03.080 --> 02:34:08.920]   And just as we were about to put the story in print on Friday night for Saturday's paper,
[02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:14.160]   AT&T emailed me and said, "We're holding off on the..." and so now it's through the
[02:34:14.160 --> 02:34:15.720]   end of the year.
[02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:16.720]   So...
[02:34:16.720 --> 02:34:17.720]   Good.
[02:34:17.720 --> 02:34:21.320]   Yeah, because COVID did not go away, kids are still using Zoom to go to school.
[02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:22.320]   Right.
[02:34:22.320 --> 02:34:24.120]   Now people are still working for public.
[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:25.120]   Right.
[02:34:25.120 --> 02:34:26.120]   Yeah.
[02:34:26.120 --> 02:34:27.120]   Right.
[02:34:27.120 --> 02:34:28.120]   Good man.
[02:34:28.120 --> 02:34:30.040]   How do I subscribe to the TechBurger newsletter?
[02:34:30.040 --> 02:34:32.720]   You go to houstoncronicle.com/releasenotes.
[02:34:32.720 --> 02:34:42.360]   It's one thing not called TechBurger and you sign up for it and you can see the newsletter.
[02:34:42.360 --> 02:34:44.640]   It's like its own little publication.
[02:34:44.640 --> 02:34:45.640]   Nice.
[02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:47.160]   So...
[02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:48.760]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:34:48.760 --> 02:34:49.760]   We really appreciate it.
[02:34:49.760 --> 02:34:50.760]   Thank you for having me.
[02:34:50.760 --> 02:34:51.760]   Yeah.
[02:34:51.760 --> 02:34:53.000]   No hurricanes in the future.
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:54.000]   I couldn't believe it.
[02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:55.280]   No, we had two dealers.
[02:34:55.280 --> 02:34:56.280]   I know.
[02:34:56.280 --> 02:34:58.840]   We're already to the Greek letters.
[02:34:58.840 --> 02:35:00.920]   Storm Beta.
[02:35:00.920 --> 02:35:01.920]   Because they ran out of names.
[02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:03.920]   So tropical storm.
[02:35:03.920 --> 02:35:06.920]   If Laura had come into Houston.
[02:35:06.920 --> 02:35:07.920]   Oh boy.
[02:35:07.920 --> 02:35:11.920]   That would have been, you know, the poor people in Louisiana, it was terrible there.
[02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:12.920]   But if you had a tropical...
[02:35:12.920 --> 02:35:14.560]   You remember the flooding.
[02:35:14.560 --> 02:35:15.560]   That storm.
[02:35:15.560 --> 02:35:16.560]   Yeah.
[02:35:16.560 --> 02:35:17.560]   Yeah.
[02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:21.480]   Houston has unfortunately paved overall its watershed.
[02:35:21.480 --> 02:35:22.480]   Yes.
[02:35:22.480 --> 02:35:23.480]   Yes.
[02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:24.480]   We're nowhere to go.
[02:35:24.480 --> 02:35:25.480]   Yes.
[02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:26.480]   Yes.
[02:35:26.480 --> 02:35:30.840]   We're water world in the inner range.
[02:35:30.840 --> 02:35:32.840]   Thank you so much for doing the show.
[02:35:32.840 --> 02:35:34.280]   You three, we really appreciate it.
[02:35:34.280 --> 02:35:36.000]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon.
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:37.000]   230 Pacific.
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:38.000]   530 Eastern.
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.440]   2130 UTC.
[02:35:40.440 --> 02:35:42.240]   You can watch the show happen live.
[02:35:42.240 --> 02:35:43.880]   There's live streams of everything we do it.
[02:35:43.880 --> 02:35:44.880]   I don't know why.
[02:35:44.880 --> 02:35:46.240]   That was a bad mistake on my part.
[02:35:46.240 --> 02:35:47.240]   But we do it.
[02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:48.880]   Twit.tv/live.
[02:35:48.880 --> 02:35:53.320]   There's audio and video streams there.
[02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:58.200]   You can also get on demand versions of the show because it is a podcast at the website.
[02:35:58.200 --> 02:35:59.200]   Twit.tv.
[02:35:59.200 --> 02:36:02.520]   There's a YouTube channel.
[02:36:02.520 --> 02:36:07.440]   You can always ask your Amazon Echo or your Google voice assistant to play this week in
[02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:10.800]   Tech Podcast to play the most recent version.
[02:36:10.800 --> 02:36:13.480]   That works for all podcasts, including the Tech meme ride home.
[02:36:13.480 --> 02:36:15.600]   It's a very nice thing to know about.
[02:36:15.600 --> 02:36:23.360]   Although I got stuck, Brian, once in an episode of The Daily from like six months ago.
[02:36:23.360 --> 02:36:27.360]   And every time I say play The Daily Podcast, it plays this old one.
[02:36:27.360 --> 02:36:28.360]   And I had to try all.
[02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:29.600]   I said, play today's daily.
[02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:30.960]   I tried all sorts of things.
[02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:36.840]   Finally, I found out if you say latest, play the latest Tech meme ride home, you will get
[02:36:36.840 --> 02:36:37.840]   the latest one.
[02:36:37.840 --> 02:36:38.840]   So that's a little.
[02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:41.000]   Do you remember the Rio riot?
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:42.000]   Yeah.
[02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.560]   I was right before it.
[02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:45.640]   Yeah, I love the Rio riot.
[02:36:45.640 --> 02:36:50.400]   The Diamond Rio was the first real podcast player.
[02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:53.560]   The Rio riot was the first one that had like a 30 gigabyte hard drive.
[02:36:53.560 --> 02:36:58.400]   But it had this funky thing where it would only play faces.
[02:36:58.400 --> 02:37:05.200]   There was this one song by Faces, which was Rod Stewart's band called Open to Ideas, which
[02:37:05.200 --> 02:37:06.520]   is actually a great song.
[02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:12.280]   But I came to love it because the Rio riot would play over and over and over again on
[02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:13.600]   any playlist you made.
[02:37:13.600 --> 02:37:16.760]   The very last one would always be open to ideas by the faces.
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:18.760]   So there you go.
[02:37:18.760 --> 02:37:21.000]   Oh, software.
[02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:22.880]   It's amazing, isn't it?
[02:37:22.880 --> 02:37:32.560]   By the way, I do want to mention that Walt Mossberg reviewed the Rio riot and the Wall
[02:37:32.560 --> 02:37:37.840]   Street Journal and said if I had never seen Apple computers iPod, I would think the new
[02:37:37.840 --> 02:37:40.920]   Rio riot was pretty cool.
[02:37:40.920 --> 02:37:44.800]   So there you go.
[02:37:44.800 --> 02:37:50.440]   Just a little trip down memory lane with the Internet historian himself, Brian McCullough.
[02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:55.360]   If you have a podcast player, probably on your phone, but your computer or any device,
[02:37:55.360 --> 02:37:56.600]   that's the best way to subscribe.
[02:37:56.600 --> 02:37:59.840]   Just get that app there and say subscribe to this week in tech.
[02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:03.800]   You get the episode, the minute it's available on a Sunday evening.
[02:38:03.800 --> 02:38:09.320]   Just in time for your Monday morning commute with your bathrobe and bunny slippers from
[02:38:09.320 --> 02:38:12.800]   the bedroom to the living room.
[02:38:12.800 --> 02:38:14.320]   Commutes aren't what they were.
[02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:16.200]   They used to be anyway.
[02:38:16.200 --> 02:38:17.920]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:23.880]   Thanks to Jammerby, John Slanina, running the board today, our technical director.
[02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:26.400]   Thanks to our producer, Karsten Bondi.
[02:38:26.400 --> 02:38:27.400]   Have a great week.
[02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:28.400]   We'll see you next time.
[02:38:28.400 --> 02:38:29.400]   Another Twitch.
[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:30.400]   It's amazing.
[02:38:30.400 --> 02:38:30.400]   Bye.
[02:38:30.400 --> 02:38:39.760]   Bye.
[02:38:39.760 --> 02:38:42.340]   (buzzing)
