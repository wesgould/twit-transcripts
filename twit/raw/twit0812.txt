[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.400]   Oh, I'm excited about this show
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.240]   'cause there's three people I adore
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.680]   starting with a guy I haven't seen since South by Southwest.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.320]   It's been a while, Lance Ulinoff, good to see you.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.880]   - Good to be here virtually.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.240]   - A longtime editor of PC Magazine.
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.360]   What are you doing these days?
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.360]   - I'm out of my own floating in space.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.440]   - Floating in space.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.240]   - Eventually we'll tether myself somewhere
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.200]   but writing a lot on medium at the moment.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.160]   Nice, you're a PC mag, you're a mashable.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.920]   You did digital for a while.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.680]   Now on his own. - Life wire,
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.000]   all over the place, yeah.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.680]   TV. - Kind of legendary.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.240]   - Yeah, you took over for me on the live with Regis
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.360]   and well, wasn't Regis, but Kelly and whoever's.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.200]   - Kelly and Ryan.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.040]   - That's right.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.400]   - Yeah, that's fun, isn't it?
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.080]   In fact, the last time we talked,
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.160]   I think you mentioned that Marianne had retired
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.000]   our producer.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.440]   - She had, I love that woman so much.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.880]   - Such a sweetheart and she earned it.
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.040]   I mean, definitely deserved to step away.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.280]   But yeah, so she's gone.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.520]   I have a new producer.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.960]   Actually I work with a few different ones
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.520]   but I have one main guy and honestly,
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.800]   that crew there is just fantastic.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.280]   I love working with those people.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.160]   - Kelly is a really sweet person.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.000]   - Dad, she is, she's very real.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.720]   - Yeah, she's genuine, yeah.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.560]   - Yeah.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.440]   - And I never met Ryan but I'm sure he's fun too.
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.920]   - He's fun, he's real Spitfire.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.440]   - Yeah, Regis was something.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.920]   I kind of, I kind of was Regis.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.040]   He was a amazing guy.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.880]   - Never got to work with me.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.200]   - No, yeah.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.680]   Also with us, Shirulazar,
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.520]   my yoga mate from Peace Inside.Live.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.320]   - Yes, thank you for having me.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.760]   - We hung out. - It's a scene you went out
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.680]   outside your yoga pants.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.920]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.160]   We hung out with a really fun couples yoga thing
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.760]   on Valentine's Eve, Lisa and I,
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.960]   you and your boyfriend and several,
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.120]   a number of other couples.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.760]   The instructor was from Thailand.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.600]   - Thank you.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.440]   - Okay, we're great.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.680]   Are you gonna do more of those at Peace Inside Live?
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.520]   - Yeah, we do virtual retreats,
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.960]   we do workshops and master classes
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.560]   around mindfulness, meditation and movement
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.480]   and we're bringing Peace Inside the workplace.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.920]   So we're doing a lot of work with operations
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.440]   to build wellness programs as well for their teams.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.280]   - Wow.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.480]   And no, I don't have yoga pants.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.680]   They were just shorts.
[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.720]   The chat room's already going, what?
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.480]   Did you say yoga pants?
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.720]   - I was just wearing shorts and a t-shirt.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.360]   Anyway, great to see you Shira, Peace Inside Live,
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.720]   Peace Inside Dot Live.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.080]   If you wanna know more, she's very busy.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.480]   And also it's great to see Devinda Hardroir, editor in chief,
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.360]   I'm sorry, senior editor in gadgets.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.440]   - Senior editor, now you're in chief, no, don't know.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.240]   - Who is EIC over there now?
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.680]   - It is Dana Wollman, who is awesome.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.160]   I've worked with her for a very long time.
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.040]   - You don't wanna be the editor in chief though.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.360]   That's too much work.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.120]   - There's just so much going on.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.120]   - Much more fun. - Yeah, I wanna play
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.160]   with my gadgets.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.320]   - Yeah, exactly, much more fun.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.000]   What are you reviewing right now?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.680]   What are you looking at?
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.760]   - I got a bunch of things.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.080]   I just put up a review of the MSI GS66 gaming laptop.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.320]   That's one of the first 1440p gaming laptops,
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.240]   so that's pretty cool. - Oh, wow.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.080]   - We've been stuck with either 1080 or 4K,
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.080]   so cool options now.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.520]   - There seem to be, suddenly a lot of gaming laptops,
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.920]   Lenovo's Legion, that I see a lot of companies
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.160]   that aren't normally known for,
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.400]   I mean, you don't think of Lenovo and gaming,
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.240]   but long gaming laptops coming out now, all of a sudden.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.280]   - They've been doing that for a while,
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.880]   but I don't think anybody's paying attention.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.240]   Is it a bit more than trying?
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.480]   It's a hot market, yeah.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.200]   - Yeah, it couldn't be a hotter market.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.600]   Everybody's stuck at home.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.280]   What are you gonna do?
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.160]   Meanwhile, I'm playing Animal Crossing.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.560]   Anybody wants to visit my island,
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.000]   I'll give you my dream code.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.080]   So depressing.
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.920]   (laughing)
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.920]   So sad.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.920]   Speaking of gaming, oh, oh,
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.440]   Stadia, Stadia, more coming out about Google's
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.440]   streaming gaming surface.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.280]   Couple of weeks ago,
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.960]   they closed down their own independent game laboratory,
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.520]   laying off hundreds, including Jade Raymond,
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.800]   who is a legendary game designer.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.400]   She was running the Toronto Ubisoft studio.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.480]   She went over to Google one year later.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.620]   She's gone.
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.600]   This is the article at Bloomberg by Jason Schreier,
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.760]   Google's Stadia problem, a video game unit
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.280]   that's not googly enough.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:47.120]   He talks about, I mean, just Google doesn't do content,
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.960]   really, and didn't really understand the idea
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.320]   of creating gaming content.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.480]   I mean, seriously, if you buy an independent gaming studio
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.800]   and you expect a game in a year,
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.360]   you're not smoking something.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.320]   - Oh my gosh, no.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.320]   - I think they're also really bad at consumer products
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.160]   in general.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.520]   I feel like I brought this up so many times on the show,
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.640]   but Google does not have enough faith in its products
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.760]   to keep them around, even something like Google Reader,
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.320]   which was kind of niche, but you can look at a whole bunch
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.320]   of things, everything that happened at Nest,
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.440]   which kind of fell apart, but I guess is kind of hung
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.280]   together now.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.800]   - Yeah, but hung together, consumer product.
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.520]   - Hung together is not like what you call
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.600]   a prosperous company.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.640]   - Yeah, we're hanging together.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.240]   It's okay, we're gonna, we're not,
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.680]   oh, it's a little shaky.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.520]   - Man, I think they do okay with some consumer hardware,
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.000]   but the-- - The Pixel Fomper okay, right?
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.840]   - They're okay.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.920]   I mean, I think that there's-- - Took a while.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.640]   - There is a commitment issue.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.360]   There's a commitment issue that sometimes,
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.000]   but I think they're still committed to sort of pixel phones,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.080]   but I think the point you made about the gaming software,
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.880]   just the game, this is years.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.400]   I mean, literally we've heard of games
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.200]   being developed for over a decade.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.320]   So I don't know what their expectations were there,
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.880]   but the competition's too strong in the gaming space,
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.000]   and if they weren't fully committed,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.920]   and clearly they weren't, they just,
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.040]   and Google by the way is really good
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.280]   at pulling the plug on things.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.280]   I mean, how many things do they shutter a year?
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.440]   - It's sad because I think that they were,
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.480]   the independent division under Stadia
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.200]   was trying to develop stuff,
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.200]   not as every other game company is doing developing stuff
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.720]   for consoles and PCs and every platform,
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.240]   but specifically for a cloud platform
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.840]   where you could use AI, you could say,
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.400]   I want several servers,
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.520]   you had a lot more opportunities
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.080]   to do different kinds of games.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.760]   Unfortunately, in this Bloomberg story,
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.920]   only describes one prototype was described
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.440]   as a cross between a Google Assistant and a Tamagotchi pet.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.440]   - I loved it.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.280]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.280]   - That's what we need.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.280]   - That's a surprise date.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.120]   - It's like it'd be good.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.960]   You probably had a Tamagotchi when you were a kid, didn't you?
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.720]   - I did for a moment.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.600]   But I think it's interesting is that they don't take advantage
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.520]   of their ecosystem.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.120]   So if you're gonna launch a gaming system,
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.240]   why not take advantage of YouTube games
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.440]   and all your stars?
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.400]   - Well, that was the plan, wasn't it?
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.240]   I mean, there is--
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.960]   - But you're not getting it enough time to even go there,
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.680]   which just doesn't make sense.
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.360]   - There is a feature that allows you to pick up a game
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.560]   where your superstar YouTuber left off, right?
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.040]   Devindra, so he could say,
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.760]   okay, I've got you up to this point, take it away.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.600]   That's cool.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.480]   - They promised a lot.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.320]   It's cool.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.880]   In theory, Stadia was a really cool concept
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.240]   and we had seen cloud gaming before
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.960]   and they had so many ideas.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.160]   Like, oh, we have solved all the issues
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.000]   with cloud gaming, the latency.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Don't have to worry about it, right?
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.680]   'Cause your controller connects over WiFi,
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:44.320]   which goes directly to the server.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.320]   It seemed like they had a good pitch,
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.880]   but it's not just the game studios.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.440]   I think Google just fundamentally didn't know
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.640]   what to do with Stadia, right?
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.840]   It launched in a weird beta.
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.120]   It wasn't quite ready.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.880]   That feature, the pickup from somebody else's stream feature
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.720]   isn't here.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.040]   So I don't know why Stadia exists
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.360]   and it's a fundamental problem of, right?
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.200]   You have to buy these games.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.640]   You have to buy these games.
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.680]   - And you don't really own them
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.320]   'cause if Stadia goes under and who knows if you go?
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.160]   - You don't own them.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.600]   Then the Assassin's Creed is gone.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.840]   - Yeah.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:16.560]   - And even though you spent 60 bucks,
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.280]   just like you would have bought a disc.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.120]   - Amazon's leanable disc.
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:20.960]   - Amazon's leanable disc.
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.800]   - Is a subscription, you know?
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.040]   And that's the way everybody expects, yeah.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.120]   - Right.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.960]   I mean, I just wonder if Google took a look
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.360]   at what Microsoft's doing
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.160]   and just realized that they couldn't compete.
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.520]   They could be not just with X-Cloud,
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.640]   but the number of how many different game developers
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.280]   has Microsoft bought up?
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.440]   I mean, it's pulled so much in-house.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.560]   It has so much raw power on the development side
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.560]   and on the cloud side.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.960]   And I think that maybe Google was making
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.520]   a really smart business decision,
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.000]   although they haven't shuttered Stadia,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.560]   but I think we should maybe take bets
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.920]   on whether or not Stadia is around a year or two from now.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.160]   - It feels like they plucked defeat
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.760]   from the jaws of victory.
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:09.160]   Because with Cyberpunk 2077 came out,
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.200]   it was bugged on consoles,
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.200]   unless you had the latest generation.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.600]   People couldn't play it on the PC,
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.920]   but it actually played fine on Stadia streaming.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.800]   It was the one place where you could kind of experience
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.800]   that game.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.480]   - Well, and the PC side played pretty well too.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.320]   - Was it okay?
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.440]   So it was really just the older generation consoles
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.360]   that were given refunds. - Yeah, it was a mess.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.360]   - Yeah, it's good.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.440]   - Wow. - It's still not
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.080]   on the PlayStation Store, it's ridiculous.
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.040]   - Yeah. - It's crazy.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.240]   - So it was an opportunity.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.480]   I mean, people like me, I was playing in on Stadia.
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.720]   There was an opportunity to get to an audience and then,
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:45.720]   you know, and they could have won Shira over with Tamagotchis.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.800]   - Come on.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.160]   - Yeah, had me at Tamagotchis. - They deserve a shot.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.640]   They're so cute.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.720]   - I mean, I have no grounds.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.360]   I just admitted I play Animal Crossing.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.960]   I have no grounds at all to mock anything.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.360]   I had a Tamagotchi when they're,
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.800]   'cause my kids had one, I had one.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.640]   We all did.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.880]   Oh my God, he's got one.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.040]   - Oh my God, are you for real?
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.160]   - So are you for real, Lance?
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.800]   You're gonna, what did you have that on your shelf?
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:10.880]   You just pull it right off?
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.280]   - I did, it's in sitting,
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.200]   'cause we had a couple of my kids had them.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.040]   - The kids had them.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.880]   - My kids had them.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.200]   - The batteries are all dead, right?
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.400]   - I mean, I haven't, I have not fed this guy in a while
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.920]   than done anything with him. - Oh, he's still alive.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.640]   - But, oh, he's so sad looking.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:25.120]   - Yeah, I know, I know he's inside.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.920]   - What do you put new batteries in every couple of years?
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.520]   - I have not, I took this out.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.960]   - I don't know, probably, look, you know,
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.160]   when you're trapped at home,
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.520]   you're still going through drawers,
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.960]   any pulling stuff out,
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.840]   and you're still putting batteries and things,
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.440]   and it's been sitting, so basically,
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.920]   it's been sitting there on my shelf ever since.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.680]   - Oh my God.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.000]   - Yeah.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.160]   - That's impressive.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.000]   - I'm, so for those,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.840]   and I think it's probably the vast majority
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.600]   of our listeners who have no idea
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.080]   what we're talking about, Shiro, what is a Tamagotchi?
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.280]   - It's like a little virtual animal
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.640]   that you have to take care of.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.320]   So for people who are like debating
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.480]   whether they'll be good parents, get a Tamagotchi.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.080]   And already I knew when I was like 10,
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.760]   that I would be a late bloomer as a parent.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.640]   - It's already the worst of both worlds.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.360]   You don't get the cuddling or the affection
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.720]   or the love of an animal,
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:16.600]   but you do have to feed them on a regular basis.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.440]   - Shake them, just hop them to that.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.760]   - Shake them to play with them.
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.600]   - Yeah.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.440]   - Yeah, I guess.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.280]   - It's still around.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.120]   - It's kind of pooped.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:22.960]   - It's kind of pooped.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.800]   - Now an iPad.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.800]   Do Tamagotchi's poop?
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.240]   - Oh yeah, I think they do.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.080]   - Yeah.
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.000]   - I kind of forget honestly, like it's,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.600]   my memory is not very good.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.600]   Good around the Tamagotchi.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.320]   I just remembered it was like an acute little egg type
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.600]   of accessory.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.440]   - Yeah.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.080]   - And you could put it on your key chain.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.160]   - Mid 90s.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.000]   - Yeah.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:41.840]   - From Bondi.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.040]   - This would go on your belt.
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:43.880]   - Yeah.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.040]   - So you'd never go on your belt.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.840]   - Actually that's a Pokemon you got in there.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.520]   - I know, I can't get them out of here.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.680]   (laughing)
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.520]   - I don't know what to do.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.040]   - I got a Pokemon stuck in my Tamagotchi.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.720]   - We used to be how to get this guy
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.560]   came out of his ball.
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.040]   - Sweet Lance Eelinoff on the Twitters.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.160]   How do you get the Pokemon out of the Tamagotchi?
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.280]   - Wow.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.120]   I didn't expect the show would start this way,
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.600]   to be honest with you.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.400]   (laughing)
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.920]   - Expect the unexpected.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.400]   - Expect that when you're listening to the Twit,
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.200]   you never know what's gonna happen.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:17.080]   It's because partly early in the year like this,
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.880]   it's not a lot of news really.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.320]   Should we talk about Twitter?
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.160]   I think you guys are all, tell you what,
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.460]   you all in on the Twitter,
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:28.400]   prepare your Twitter thoughts.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:33.040]   There's some stuff going on, including,
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.760]   Jack says we've found a way we're gonna subscribe,
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:37.680]   we're gonna have subscribers,
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.400]   we've found a way to make people pay for Twitter,
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.640]   to which Lance Eelinoff says, "Never!"
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.400]   (laughing)
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.920]   We'll get to that in just a second.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.400]   What if it's gonna be a fun time?
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.660]   Great panel, Lance Eelinoff,
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.080]   Shira Lazar, The Vendor of Harder War,
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.520]   our show Dig Day brought to you by something
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.640]   I know you guys know all about Udacity,
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.360]   is an amazing story.
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.280]   Sebastian Thrun was actually at Google,
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.800]   and he realized,
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:06.320]   this back in the early part of the decade, 2011, I think, 2012,
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.800]   he realized that the companies like Google, Microsoft,
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.320]   Amazon, needed technical workers,
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.320]   people with real skills,
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.280]   but these skills weren't being taught in schools,
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.480]   he said, "There's gotta be a way
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.560]   "to prepare the modern workforce,"
[00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:20.840]   and he created Udacity,
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.280]   it's like audacity without the A.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.560]   Udacity is the world's fastest,
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.640]   most efficient way to master the skills tech companies want.
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.520]   I think actually, it was right at the beginning,
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.920]   they did the first nano degree, and it was with Google.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.840]   The nano degree program is a unique online educational
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.360]   offering designed to bridge the gap
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.640]   between learning and your career goals.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.440]   You're gonna get a suite of skills
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.960]   that are guaranteed employable
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.320]   because they're created by the companies
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.800]   who need people to do these things.
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.320]   Udacity partners with industry leaders and experts
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.320]   who understand the in-demand skills
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:59.320]   that are applicable to the job market they really need.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.320]   Once you enroll as a student in a specific course,
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.720]   you'll be prompted to view the online course,
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.000]   see the videos, and they're well produced, very clear,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   but taught by real experts who are excellent teachers,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.160]   but, and I think this is super important,
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.240]   you don't just sit and watch,
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.080]   you have to complete a series of projects.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.120]   Don't be scared off.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.520]   This is honestly the way to learn this stuff.
[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.320]   You know, I've done all kinds of online courses,
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:25.920]   and the ones where I just sit and watch,
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.680]   I think, I feel like, oh, I know how to do that,
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.360]   and then when I really have to sit down and do it, I can't.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.480]   I love the ones like the Udacity courses
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.000]   where you actually have to learn by doing.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.240]   And what's great about Udacity is,
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.200]   with your project, you're gonna be reviewed
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.280]   by qualified professionals.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.120]   If you need help, and you will,
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.400]   'cause you're learning, you get real human help,
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.320]   personalized code reviews, if it's a programming course,
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.120]   and access to qualified mentors,
[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.160]   and it's really important, 24/7,
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.720]   because people are taking these courses,
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.920]   many of them have day jobs, it's all over the world,
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:05.160]   160 countries, 13 million registered users.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.680]   And so it's gotta work with your schedule, and it does,
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:12.000]   it does, they've completed 1.3 million plus projects,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.720]   150,000 nanodegrees,
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.960]   just to give you some idea of the scale of this.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.080]   It's the most, I think, the most successful
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.320]   online learning you can get.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.360]   It's incredible.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.920]   They even have free courses that'll help you
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.560]   build your portfolio on GitHub.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.160]   Very important, if you're a programmer or LinkedIn.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.680]   They do have non-programming classes in marketing,
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.520]   product management, tech-adjacent roles.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.280]   There, of course, have classes in the most in-demand skills,
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.160]   like AI and cloud computing.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.960]   You wanna develop self-driving vehicles?
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.840]   They've got autonomous systems classes,
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.840]   they've got data science classes.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:54.760]   These are industry-leading programs built and recognized
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.040]   by top companies worldwide.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.720]   IBM works with them.
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.840]   Microsoft, Google, of course, AWS.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.960]   All over the world, people are getting great jobs,
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.360]   they're learning great skills.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:07.280]   You know what?
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.280]   I'm not looking for work.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.440]   I still took the courses 'cause it's so much fun.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.480]   I've taken their Python, in fact,
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.960]   I'm looking at their second level,
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.880]   their intermediate Python course now.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:22.040]   The projects, I hate to say you have to do a project
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.960]   'cause I know sometimes that scares people,
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.680]   but seriously, it's fun
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.720]   and it's the only way to learn it, to be honest with you.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.800]   And there's some great Udacity free courses too,
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.840]   if you just wanna get some sense of what they do.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.640]   Flexible payment options,
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.840]   you can learn at your own pace and schedule.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.400]   I always like to use some examples
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.240]   like this guy, Francisco Gutierrez,
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.000]   couldn't afford a four-year degree.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.640]   He was a technical, he was interested in technology
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.360]   and he wanted a better life for his family.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.560]   He took programming classes at the community college
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.720]   but they never really translated it into getting a job.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.320]   He participated in a program Udacity has
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.880]   the Grow with Google Udacity Challenge.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.640]   Got a full scholarship for the mobile web specialist
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:05.600]   nano degree, mobile web specialist.
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.280]   It took him step by step.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.040]   Got an internship at Microsoft.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.600]   Udacity is now a full-time software engineer at Microsoft.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.480]   They offered him a full-time job
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.640]   all because of Udacity.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.560]   It's a great story.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.600]   There are lots of them on the page.

[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.160]   Thank you, Udacity.
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.720]   What is Super Follows?
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.240]   This is the newest thing on Twitter.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.240]   Lance, I take it, you're not a fan.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:25.600]   - Yeah, look, I get it that Twitter has to grow.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.600]   It has to, they have plans to get more people
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.320]   using the service and they wanna make more money.
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.040]   They wanna increase revenues by a lot.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.640]   And they also want to compete in this new sort of creator game.
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.640]   If you notice on all the platforms, including TikTok,
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:43.600]   they now are sort of identifying so-called creators,
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.520]   which gives them an opportunity to make money
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.720]   on the platform, so it's very exciting.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.080]   Twitter, you really don't have that opportunity.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.160]   I mean, it's really not that kind of space.
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.960]   And I've been on it, I don't know, 2007,
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.640]   so however many years that is.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.520]   And it's still my favorite social media.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:04.520]   Now, Super Follows would give me the idea
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:09.520]   to create sort of a Supra version of my Twitter content.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.120]   - So who pays to pay?
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.120]   - Or do your followers pay?
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.200]   - No, followers pay.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.560]   So this again, we get subscribers.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.640]   And so when we talk about something like Substack,
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.960]   with people doing newsletters and now getting people
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.760]   to pay a yearly subscription fee
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.200]   for this special information.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.040]   So imagine on Twitter, you've got specialized tweets,
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.200]   so you've got your private concerts,
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.720]   you've got special photos,
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.880]   or maybe I just chart you for doodles
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:35.720]   that I will-
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.880]   - Are they trying to be my Rachel?
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.120]   - Are they being Patreon?
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:39.200]   Is that the idea?
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.400]   - Yeah, a little bit.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:44.280]   It's all in that sort of same mix.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.080]   And I guess, I feel like, look,
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.240]   and I'm not also not that guy.
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.720]   I don't have enough followers to really monetize
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.560]   what I'm doing there.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.880]   I mean, you need a scale.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.840]   There's a bigger conversation to have here.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.760]   We have a ton of people flooding to Substack,
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:58.680]   all these journalists saying,
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.760]   "I'm starting my own newsletter."
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:00.600]   - Well, I Twitter-
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.800]   - Twitter-bought review, another newsletter-
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.480]   - That's, and it's interesting,
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.360]   is I've been on review for years.
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:07.200]   - Oh, really?
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.320]   - I have a newsletter on review.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.440]   Yeah, I mean, it's small, but I've been doing it.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.320]   It's a place where I just kind of talk.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.920]   My newsletter is sort of free-form.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.920]   But yeah, all of this is moving in direction
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.280]   of finding a way to have a section of Twitter
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.480]   be sort of this special premium area
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.560]   where you can pay to get more,
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.560]   to get, if you like Steve Martin's tweets,
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.240]   Steve Martin to go on Twitter.
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.080]   He's funny, right?
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.520]   But he's gonna be even funnier in the super-
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.640]   - If you pay him money.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.680]   - Right, right.
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.160]   I guess I've, look, I'm very lucky to have-
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.840]   - Is Steve Martin doing it, or is that just an example?
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:44.680]   - No, no.
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.200]   Do we know anybody who is doing it?
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.040]   - Am I in?
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:47.880]   - Yeah.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.720]   - It's too soon.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.920]   - No, no, I think that I've not seen anything.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.000]   I'm checking to see if there's something, you know,
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.200]   in my Twitter that would say,
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.360]   "Hey, you have this opportunity."
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.520]   'Cause by the way, they integrated review fast.
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.240]   Like I already had a pop-up that said,
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.920]   "Oh, 'cause if you do a Twitter thread,
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.560]   they know that you like to write."
[00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.120]   So they're like, "Oh, we have a newsletter product now.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.360]   How about you do that?" - Interesting.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.960]   - So Twitter's getting more proactive about this stuff.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:15.000]   I just think that for most people,
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.040]   super-follows, it's not gonna be a thing
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.160]   because most people don't have enough followers
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.240]   to really monetize in a way that makes sense
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.560]   unless you charge a whole lot for premium tweet content
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:26.760]   or Twitter content and then it better be great.
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.960]   So I made a so-called promise yesterday,
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.880]   I believe, where I said, "I will never charge you
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.120]   for my tweets."
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.880]   And then if I beat all the way to the end, I said,
[00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.080]   "Probably." (laughs)
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:38.920]   - Just had to.
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.840]   This is your medium, your article on Medium.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.280]   Okay, I'll never charge you unless I do.
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.120]   And then maybe I will.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.360]   (laughs)
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.720]   - Fine print, read the fine print.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.240]   - So you're a creator, Shira.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.720]   I mean, is this... - Yeah.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:55.720]   - I think, I assume that you understand better than most
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:59.160]   how hard it is to take your product
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.080]   and make money, make a living doing.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.080]   - Yeah.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.520]   It's something I'm thinking about a lot.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:07.440]   You know, I watch the ABC News documentary about only fans.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.160]   And I think it is fascinating, these platforms
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.600]   that are allowing you just the freedom to do this.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.960]   The thing is like, what's the extra thing
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.120]   that you're gonna do and how do you scale it?
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.040]   And is the platform, the right platform to do that
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.400]   for discovery and everything, right?
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.560]   And so I do think like Twitter is actually
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.320]   one of my favorite platforms still
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.720]   because I feel like they're not hiding your tweets.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.240]   There's no algorithm.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.720]   Like it's easy to like get in front of people
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.880]   which other platforms have lost, right?
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:34.800]   - That's really true.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.640]   - Yeah.
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.840]   - Facebook, you have no idea
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.440]   who's gonna see what you post.
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.320]   - And like I feel like it's one place I feel
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.280]   like I still have engagement and I know that people will see it
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.600]   and if you add the right hashtags,
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.320]   it gets into that like grouped in there for discovery.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.840]   So it's like, but then what would that thing be?
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.120]   That would be the extra thing like Lance said
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.200]   that would get people to pay for that.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.200]   Like it would need to be above and beyond what you do.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.400]   And then that's also more work.
[00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.280]   And then you know, you're putting in the effort
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.720]   hoping for more back.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.240]   And so it's always like the thing that you need to think about
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.360]   and I think every platform you're gonna see that club house,
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.440]   you're gonna see a monetization capability.
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.040]   Obviously we have it on Twitter.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.400]   We have it on YouTube, like you have tips
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.840]   or you could also do subscription.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.360]   It's like how much more can you do and create?
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:22.760]   How many hours do you have in the day?
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.800]   You just need to be smart about and strategize.
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.000]   It really depends on your brand.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.040]   There was some criticism of a Squarespace Super Bowl ad
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.840]   where they took Dolly Parton's nine to five
[00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:33.920]   and they made it five to nine.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:37.320]   And it was all about your side hustle.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.080]   And the criticism was I'm exhausted.
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:40.920]   Nine to five.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:44.240]   And now I gotta do shrubbery pruning.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.520]   No, working nine to nine.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.360]   Let's be clear.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.200]   It's nine to nine.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.040]   Nine to nine.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:48.880]   Thank you.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.720]   Or even more six to nine.
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:50.560]   Yeah. Right?
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.440]   And anybody who's done this, especially YouTube creators,
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.320]   it's exhausting.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.160]   It is.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.760]   I think that we need to be able to scale what we do
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.600]   without it being every hour.
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.600]   Right? Like how is it?
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.440]   Yes.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:05.520]   Right now, for me, I need to be there to create.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:10.000]   How can you put in two hours and get six hours from that?
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:10.840]   Right.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:11.680]   That's the question.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.200]   It's like so, and that's where I see like building products.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.880]   Like, you know, if you build a product in e-commerce,
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:20.680]   but then you also have to up front like a startup,
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.480]   you need an up front to develop that product,
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.800]   to produce it, to put Facebook ads
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:25.680]   or Instagrams against it.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.960]   It's like $50,000.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.240]   I'm getting a nervous breakdown, just listening to you.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:36.040]   Yeah, you know, so I had a talk meeting with Vayner Media.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:37.440]   They have a talent management company.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.280]   Gary Vaynerchuk.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.200]   I love Gary.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.240]   So I wasn't talking to Gary.
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.200]   I was talking to one of his people.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.160]   And he goes, Gary's got people now
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:46.240]   because he can't do nine hours a day.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:51.960]   So he goes, you know, you're into vulnerability
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:52.960]   and personal growth and all that.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.400]   Why don't you start a clubhouse?
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.640]   You know, you do that clubhouse.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.920]   You go all in.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.680]   You build a few thousand people listening to,
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.520]   or even just a thousand.
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.280]   You put a sub stack and then you're selling them on sub stack.
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.600]   And it was just like, in my head, it all makes sense.
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:09.680]   But then it's just like, oh my God, it's a lot.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:10.840]   When does it end?
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.160]   Right.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.160]   Mm-hmm.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.680]   So many, so many different platforms.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.960]   I feel so bad for you.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:17.960]   For our attention.
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:18.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.160]   It's hard.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.080]   You don't--
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.840]   What do you put your time and effort?
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:23.520]   It's so--
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:24.520]   Exactly.
[00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.320]   I mean, it's a choice.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.920]   And everybody under 30, I'm sure, feels this pressure to--
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.760]   well, what's your-- what's your insta?
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:32.760]   What's your Twitter?
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.840]   What's your-- where are you going to-- what are you going to--
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.880]   it feels like everybody's expected to be creator.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.560]   And everybody's expected to bust their ass.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.280]   And they're just-- I think everybody under 30 is--
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.960]   maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like it's feeling this intense
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:47.880]   pressure to produce.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:51.880]   And I think that's--
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.800]   That's being that they can.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.640]   And they can produce and become famous.
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:56.140]   Yeah.
[00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:58.240]   There's money that you're famous people.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.680]   There's-- because there are these icons.
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.560]   I'll never play for the NBA, but maybe I could become
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.040]   an insta celebrity or something.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.520]   But none of them realize the amount of work that's involved.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.920]   You talk to somebody like Justine Azaric
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:16.000]   and a decade plus working on YouTube
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.560]   and how hard she's worked.
[00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.800]   I don't understand why she doesn't look like a little old lady.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.400]   I just don't get it.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.760]   She should have bags that are her eyes and her hair.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.200]   I mean, she works insane hours.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.760]   And everybody I know like her does.
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:31.880]   It's great.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.120]   And the pressure-- I just worry that we're
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:36.440]   going to hit a wall that all these people are just going to go,
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.040]   oh, my god.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.120]   Well, it's already happening.
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.720]   But then there's always new crops and generations of talent
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.440]   who are young.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.280]   I mean, it's the same thing for the acting industry or Hollywood.
[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.080]   It's the reason why it's a young industry
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.320]   is because you still have that energy
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:53.480]   and you still have that naivete to go into things that are--
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.840]   when you're a bit older, you see the writing on the wall
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.120]   and then you start thinking about family and sustainability
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:58.880]   and your energy.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.960]   It's just a bit of a different mentality.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:01.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.840]   I think the danger here, by the way,
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.040]   is that a lot of this stuff just looks easy, right?
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.120]   Being in Insta celebrity.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.720]   Just looking-- I'm just sticking some photos.
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.880]   Just chilling with my friends.
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:11.560]   Just taking photos of my food.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:15.720]   But you watch people, especially my younger family, who--
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.280]   oh, they want to frame their Instagram photos perfectly.
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:21.080]   So we order something when we used to go to restaurants.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.080]   It would be five minutes before they could actually eat it.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:24.880]   Right.
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.120]   They would spend all the time perfectly framing everything
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.840]   and adding some lighting and whatnot.
[00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.240]   And as a slightly older millennial,
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:34.120]   I'm on these platforms, but I'm not driven for that.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:38.520]   I'm driven for other reasons, but I am worried about this.
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.600]   I know it's so easy.
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:41.080]   It used to be stardom--
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.360]   people assumed, oh, this requires a lot of work.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.240]   I have to get to Hollywood.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.160]   I have to do other things.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.880]   You have to be driven in one way to do that.
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.040]   I feel like now it's just--
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:48.720]   Simple.
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.680]   It's a symptom of a much--
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:55.080]   I mean, look, I'm sure the vast majority of people--
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.280]   young people don't think they're going to be influencers.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:04.040]   They're busy working their ass off at an Amazon warehouse.
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:09.320]   But I think it's a larger symptom of a real economic problem
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:14.120]   in this country, for sure, and maybe even globally, where
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.080]   you have to have two jobs to survive.
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.840]   You have to have that side hustle just to survive.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.200]   And I just feel like we're going to hit a wall.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.720]   This is not a positive thing.
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.720]   And it doesn't feel like a way--
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.720]   Go ahead, Jia.
[00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:32.560]   I was just going to say that there are big targets right now
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.560]   is--
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:34.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.480]   I was just going to say the big target right now is TikTok.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.520]   I mean, if you want to talk about where they believe they
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.600]   can become famous and how much time they spend asking,
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.680]   how do they become TikTok famous and how they go viral
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:46.880]   and how do they get a deal--
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:49.040]   It was TikTok this year, last year.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:49.640]   It was just--
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:49.640]   Exactly.
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.040]   It's only me something else.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.640]   You know, chope.
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.760]   God, it just breaks my heart.
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.240]   What I was going to say is I was wondering
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.920]   if it was just America, because I feel like here,
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.280]   it's like how many followers you have.
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.520]   You could have any type of business,
[00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.400]   and it's not even a creator anymore.
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.120]   It's like how many followers does your business have.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:08.320]   And I feel like it is a North America phenomenon.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.080]   Other places, of course, this is a global network.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:14.920]   But in other places, your worth isn't based around that
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:15.760]   necessarily.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:17.360]   If you earn Italy and you're like, hey,
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.160]   I have like 10,000 Instagram followers.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.840]   And we're like, fuck you.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.120]   Who cares?
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:22.640]   Pafangoon.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.680]   Yeah, well, like in France, you know?
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:27.240]   There is something to be said about Canada and the US
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.800]   our obsession with this type of notoriety.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:31.880]   Now, you're Canadian.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.880]   I know you don't live there anymore,
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.400]   but you grew up there in Montreal.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.920]   Is it the same in Canada?
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:38.520]   Yeah, I think that is-- it goes back to it.
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.760]   Because in Canada, we were so close to America
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:42.680]   where it was like the American dream, right?
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:48.080]   And so the new dream is the social media, DIY dream.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.600]   And it also goes back to being your boss,
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.760]   getting into the crypto space.
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:54.720]   It's all connected.
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.520]   And then it's also connected to Silicon Valley.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:59.560]   Like if you look at all of it, it's creating it on your own,
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:31:59.560]   right?
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:00.560]   It's the hustle.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.080]   It's the hustle.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:02.240]   It's the hustle.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.640]   And I think like-- and Gary says, it's not just about the hustle.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.040]   It's like really you got to love it.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:08.000]   And sometimes--
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.440]   I blame Gary a little bit.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:12.480]   And I know Gary well, and I love Gary.
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.720]   But I blame him a little because this guy is a ball of energy.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:19.280]   And for 10, maybe 15 years now, he's been preaching this.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.400]   You know, you got to do this.
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.400]   You got to do this.
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:22.000]   You got to do this.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.360]   You got to do this.
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:26.360]   And I think that that's unrealistic for most people.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:29.280]   Well, now he's in a different way
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.920]   where he's saying like, it's about if you enjoy it.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.200]   So he goes, you need to do I am, I enjoy it.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.680]   But then it goes back to the other side of the--
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.880]   Nobody can be Gary Vainica.
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:38.880]   Nobody.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.080]   Like why can't I do like that, right?
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:41.960]   Why what's wrong with me?
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:42.840]   Why don't I have the energy?
[00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.560]   And if I don't have the energy like that, does that mean I'm
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:46.680]   going to fail?
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.400]   So I want to take a quick step back here, by the way,
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.560]   because it does seem like we're going down the negative path
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:52.040]   on this, right?
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:55.040]   Like the overwork and the also assuming nature of being
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.480]   a creative in the world today.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:00.480]   But I do like the super follow feature
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:04.160]   as a way for people who genuinely create value
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.520]   on that social network to get some money, to get paid for it.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:11.240]   I won't be doing it as a reporter just because of the way
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:12.080]   it works.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.200]   You probably can't.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:13.680]   Yeah, news.
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:14.280]   I don't know.
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.280]   News organ that we don't know.
[00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:15.520]   These are all--
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.800]   If you left in gadget, you could.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:18.320]   Probably.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.160]   Yeah, if I was on my own.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.160]   I think that's what happens.
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.000]   News organ may start rules.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.320]   Is brands-- I mean, that's what I did kind of.
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:26.560]   And brands say, why am I working for the man?
[00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.000]   Now there's a way for me to monetize essentially.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.320]   I mean, that's kind of what's happened with the internet.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.440]   This disintermediation is made--
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.960]   That's the entire sub stack push.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.320]   Yes.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:38.640]   It's kind of made it possible for people like Lance, people
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.920]   like Sheera, someday people like you, DaVin, Dre.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.080]   No, I'm not saying that at all.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:49.240]   But for me to say, we don't need the gatekeepers anymore.
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.000]   We can do ourselves.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:50.480]   So you're right.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:53.360]   It is positive in that respect, for sure.
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.880]   And I think like, hey, I look at people on Twitter.
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:34:00.120]   I look at the people creating doesn't long tweet threads.
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:04.560]   Where after certain points, you are making this network better.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.880]   And people may want to--
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:06.640]   And who's benefiting?
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.160]   Who's benefiting?
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:07.880]   Who's benefiting?
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.560]   Who's benefiting?
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:08.920]   Twitter.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:10.840]   And not everybody needs to do a newsletter.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.120]   I think a simple way to pay people for things is good.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.200]   I tell you, every time I see somebody doing a long thread,
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.200]   I feel like such a shadow and get a room.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:17.720]   All right.
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:19.640]   Get a blog.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:24.160]   Why are you trying to write a thousand word article on Twitter?
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.480]   That doesn't make any sense to me.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.080]   But I'm all about that.
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:30.200]   What about-- I think a great idea would be if you have access
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.040]   to an exclusive or you're at a--
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.600]   if you're at the Apple announcement or whatever,
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.400]   and people want to be following you and your take on it,
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.000]   you could say for this event or for this thing,
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.040]   I'm going to be kind of pay wall, right?
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:43.920]   So you need to follow.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.400]   What an idiot.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.880]   I've been giving this stuff away for--
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:46.360]   I know.
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:46.880]   I know.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:47.360]   Exactly.
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:47.680]   Great.
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.880]   If there weren't so many people doing something like that.
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:52.880]   But yeah, I think that's exactly what we're hoping to see.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.760]   And by the way, I feel like this is--
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:57.640]   because maybe I sound a little negative about all this.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.480]   And I'm not at all.
[00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:01.440]   Of course, I'm very positive about everything digital.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.520]   But this is sort of the second state.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.240]   The first stage of the transformation of content
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.840]   was everybody's ability.
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.160]   They're no longer gatekeepers.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.400]   Everybody's ability to deliver content directly
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.680]   to an audience no matter what.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:13.720]   You could just do it.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.080]   And that has been a fundamental shift
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.840]   in the way people have consumed content.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.120]   And now, the second stage is, well, great.
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.600]   How do we get paid for this?
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.560]   And that does make a lot of sense.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.560]   And I understand that we're in that sort of evolutionary stage.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.640]   It's just a question of, is Twitter
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.120]   the really the right place for this?
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:32.940]   Yeah.
[00:35:32.940 --> 00:36:01.700]   I mean, I'll tell you guys, we at the Slash
[00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:06.380]   of the Great-- what's at the Brad Pitt movie?
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.300]   The one where he is an assassin.
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:12.060]   And basically, it ends with, this is America, pay me.
[00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:14.780]   And I feel like that's it.
[00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:15.820]   That's the goal.
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:18.740]   And even though that's part of the evil nature of capitalism
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:20.660]   and everything, if you're contributing,
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:23.460]   if you're actually generating content,
[00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.700]   at a certain degree, you should be paid.
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.940]   Final scene of killing me softly.
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:28.660]   Killing me softly.
[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:29.020]   There we go.
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.100]   Oh, wow.
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.100]   Wow.
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:31.980]   I gotta see that.
[00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:32.780]   I don't know what you show.
[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.740]   There it is.
[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:35.240]   Wow.
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:35.980]   Killing them softly.
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:37.060]   Killing them softly.
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:37.580]   Yeah.
[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:38.660]   It is a weird movie.
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.340]   And I didn't quite like it at first,
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:43.180]   but I think over time, that has resonated for one more.
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.780]   I can't play it because I will get in trouble.
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:46.860]   Do you ever play clips on a Slash film?
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:47.940]   Or do you--
[00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:48.440]   No.
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:48.940]   Yeah, I can't.
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:49.420]   Not at all.
[00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:50.940]   I mean, I'm getting taken down.
[00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:51.460]   No, no, no, no.
[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:55.580]   Well, like, within fair use, you can play a clip
[00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:56.300]   and comment on it.
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:57.620]   So I think that's fine.
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:59.300]   But doing it live is like--
[00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.260]   And doing it on YouTube, we never do it on YouTube
[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:04.060]   because those DMCA notices come in so quick.
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:04.540]   Yeah.
[00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:07.180]   Too bad because if I weren't for the DMCA,
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:09.580]   I could play this parody of Childish Gambino
[00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:12.540]   mashed up with Killing Them Softly called This Is America,
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:14.860]   So Call Me Maybe.
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:16.260]   But I guess I won't.
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:17.260]   That's two different things.
[00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:18.500]   But yes, you do.
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:21.780]   It's a mashup.
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:24.020]   It's a mashup.
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:26.020]   It's America.
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:29.380]   So yeah, I mean, part of this is stimulated
[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:32.100]   by the fact that Twitter, which has been a success
[00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.460]   in the minds of the tech industry and tech pundits
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:36.700]   and journalists, the rest of America
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.020]   doesn't even know what it is.
[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:41.500]   But is desperately trying to figure out how to make money.
[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:44.820]   And apparently, ads is not in.
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:47.020]   They need a model, right?
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:48.660]   Is that kind of what this is?
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.140]   Yeah, they need a better growth.
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:53.100]   I mean, it has to have a better growth trajectory.
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:54.260]   I mean, they're kind of flat.
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:58.500]   Their growth is flat because it's like the Twitter adi
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.140]   is a certain group of people.
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:02.580]   It's not America at large.
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:03.860]   No, it's not.
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:04.340]   Yeah.
[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:06.540]   Even though what happens on Twitter
[00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:08.980]   becomes national and international news--
[00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:11.540]   Thanks to our former president, yes.
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:11.900]   Right.
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:13.940]   And even before then, quite honestly,
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:16.060]   before he got on it, now he's gone.
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.740]   And it still happens.
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:20.700]   But I think that he has given it sort of this outsized
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.620]   reputation as if it is some representation
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:25.220]   of the broader, broader America.
[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:26.660]   And it's simply not.
[00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:31.860]   And Facebook is a better representation of people everywhere.
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.500]   I mean, you look at almost 3 billion people use it
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:38.660]   and about what, monthly, 311 million people,
[00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:41.220]   something like that with Twitter.
[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:43.860]   Yeah, it's a gross mismatch.
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:45.100]   And yet, I think you're right.
[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.420]   In fact, for a long time, it stopped now.
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.900]   But for a long time, you'd watch shows like American Idol
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.660]   and they'd have a little blue bird.
[00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:55.900]   And they'd say, Twitter was very much part of that.
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.380]   That seems to have kind of stopped.
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:00.300]   I don't see that as much as I used to.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:03.980]   But Facebook's definitely still a part of the American psyche,
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:04.540]   for sure.
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:08.780]   It's going to be interesting.
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:11.220]   I'm not rooting against Twitter.
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:14.580]   I have a very mixed feelings about Twitter.
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:18.540]   I think it's value in our society
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:21.020]   has been highly overvalued by the fact
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:22.700]   that the media uses it.
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:26.900]   And anything that happens on Twitter is considered news.
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.180]   And for me, it looks like, well, that's
[00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:31.420]   just the outrage of the moment on Twitter constantly.
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:34.420]   And I think it's really fostered that kind of dialogue.
[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:38.420]   Gotcha journalism, outrageous.
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:40.580]   I think the smallest thing gets blown up
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:41.860]   to the biggest thing on Twitter.
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:45.420]   And then suddenly, it's a big story in our world.
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:46.980]   I don't think that's right.
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:50.420]   Which is why Twitter added context to some of their trends
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:55.100]   because without context, people just like, oh, someone died.
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:57.100]   They had no idea what the words meant.
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:58.300]   It's really true.
[00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:01.580]   When you see a person's name and trending, you know it's dead.
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:02.820]   It's like, oh, my god, it died.
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:04.580]   I think it's like, I think it's like,
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.980]   I think it's like, oh, I'm so glad it wasn't
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:08.940]   that that person was dead.
[00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:12.180]   But by the way, I should say that--
[00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:13.900]   I think I mentioned, for Twitter remains
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:16.700]   my favorite social media platform
[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:18.420]   because it's the one place where I
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:23.020]   feel like I can sort of create a reflection of my psyche,
[00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:25.220]   of my mind, the way my mind works.
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:25.900]   It's always been that.
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:28.180]   I get the feeling you feel the same way, Shira,
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.340]   and they feel the same way to Vindra.
[00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:33.100]   I mean, both of you use Twitter a lot.
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:36.420]   I feel like it's been the easiest, most seamless social
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:38.780]   platform to continue doing.
[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:41.460]   I feel like I have no energy drain around Twitter
[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:43.660]   because they're not changing every moment.
[00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:47.460]   Like every six months, it's a new way of doing it or using it.
[00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:51.740]   And so for me, it feels like the best energy exchange
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:52.500]   social network.
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.700]   Like I most at peace with Twitter.
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:57.020]   Even though it could be annoying, as you said, for some things
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:41:00.500]   like trolling or for obviously this misinformation
[00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:01.700]   on every platform.
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:06.140]   But I feel like you can grow your brand the most on Twitter.
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:07.140]   Really?
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.140]   Really?
[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:09.660]   It's not-- I feel like it's the easiest way to grow it.
[00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:10.660]   Interesting.
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:11.660]   If you're clear about what you do and who you are,
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:14.140]   and it's so easy to connect with people on it.
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:16.500]   I just feel like with Instagram and YouTube,
[00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:20.420]   they made it so hard and even Facebook.
[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:22.180]   Agreed to Vindra?
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:23.940]   Yeah, I mean, totally agree.
[00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:27.580]   For me, I think I've mentioned this before on Twitch.
[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:31.340]   My fascination with the internet started when I hit up AOL
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:33.140]   in the mid '90s and prodigy and everything.
[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:35.580]   It's all this information from all over the world.
[00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:36.860]   And I could talk with all these people.
[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.500]   And it's also seamless.
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:39.940]   And it's right there in front of me.
[00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:42.620]   And Twitter, to me, is the best representation
[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:44.820]   of that idea of all the information in the world.
[00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:46.780]   Sort of like, yeah, the characters in the matrix
[00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:48.660]   just falling down in front of you.
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:49.980]   And it is overwhelming.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:51.580]   It can be too much.
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:53.020]   And I think things can get overblown.
[00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:57.180]   But as a representation of the power of the internet
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:59.580]   and the value of getting so much information out there,
[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:01.740]   I think it's genuinely the best social network.
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:04.660]   Facebook kind of does it too, but gets bogged down
[00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:07.420]   in the interconnectedness and a lot of different things.
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.100]   Just for me and the way I use the internet,
[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:10.220]   Twitter is the best.
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:10.940]   I'm surprised.
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:14.780]   They're not focusing more on the people like us who really
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:16.260]   love it and would pay.
[00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:19.260]   I would gladly pay for some more features.
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:20.020]   Better software.
[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:23.220]   I don't know why TweetDeck is still such a piece of crap.
[00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:24.980]   But we would pay for that too.
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.300]   That's money waiting for them if they ever decide to pick it up.
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:29.140]   And what about--
[00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:30.860]   That's for editable tweets.
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.540]   And what about the last big thing Twitter announced,
[00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:35.740]   "Fleez," is that--
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:38.500]   which looks to me just like Instagram Stories,
[00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.540]   which was a copy of Snapchat Stories is--
[00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:42.380]   Yeah, it's on.
[00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:43.460]   Nothing.
[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:44.300]   That's not going.
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.780]   And now they're turning that into spaces, which
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:51.220]   is a copy of Clubhouse, which is the current hotness,
[00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:52.940]   at least in Silicon Valley.
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:55.820]   Clubhouse is still invite only.
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:59.460]   That's an audio-only chat room that you can listen in on,
[00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:01.540]   which feels very retro when I just describe it.
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:04.820]   Which is powered entirely by hype, I'd say.
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:06.300]   I don't know what happens to Clubhouse.
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:10.820]   When it's less exclusive when everybody can go on there,
[00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:12.540]   it's not a small social network right now.
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:17.540]   But I don't know what the value is beyond you being part
[00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:18.300]   of the special thing.
[00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.540]   And occasionally, Elon Musk shows up.
[00:43:20.540 --> 00:43:21.380]   Well, that's pretty good.
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:22.380]   I think that's--
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:23.140]   That's not bad.
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:23.740]   Mark Suck.
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:24.740]   I think Mark Suck.
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:25.740]   Bill Gates also.
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:26.260]   Bill Gates.
[00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:27.500]   Yeah, there's all these people who've
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:30.740]   walked into these rooms that I find remarkable.
[00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:33.340]   Also, it's Paul Davidson.
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:34.940]   David Sends, one of the people who founded it,
[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:36.940]   was original highlight founder.
[00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:37.740]   Another sort of--
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:37.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:38.340]   --sounds by--
[00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:39.460]   --was the same idea.
[00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:40.260]   Yeah, sort of.
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:43.580]   Well, that was sort of near me technology.
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:47.060]   But it was very, very hyped until people realized it was
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.220]   also a little creepy.
[00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:53.780]   And yeah, and so this is his next truly big thing.
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:55.940]   I mean, the biggest thing he's done since then.
[00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:57.380]   But I don't know.
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:00.700]   This feels like it might have more staying power.
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:01.100]   You're right.
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:02.420]   This is exactly the kind of thing
[00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:04.740]   that would have gone big at South By.
[00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:06.780]   Like everybody's on Clubhouse.
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:07.740]   It's like Muircat.
[00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:09.420]   Didn't that happen with Muircat?
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.180]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:14.020]   You couldn't go five feet in Austin without somebody saying,
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:15.980]   I'm streaming in America.
[00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:16.580]   We had a guy--
[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:17.580]   Well, why would you not--
[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:18.180]   --we had an employee.
[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:20.740]   We finally had to put up a sign and says,
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:23.540]   Jeff, stop Muircatting.
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:24.420]   Stop.
[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:24.820]   Stop.
[00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:26.820]   What would you do if South By was around,
[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:28.020]   and then you're also on Clubhouse?
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:29.180]   Like, you're seeing people in person.
[00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:31.060]   You're like, join our Clubhouse, too.
[00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:31.580]   Oh, god.
[00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:32.900]   Well, I guess you might have a--
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:33.900]   Clubhouse exception.
[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.740]   --in a room like where we are, like the hot spots.
[00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:38.340]   And so everyone would be on it.
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:38.840]   See?
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:39.780]   I know where everyone is.
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:40.860]   See, your mind's working.
[00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:41.820]   You're already working it.
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:42.740]   You already figured that out.
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:45.020]   And you weren't able to hear anybody.
[00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:46.540]   You weren't able to hear anybody.
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:47.020]   Yeah.
[00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:47.860]   You wouldn't hear anything.
[00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:49.900]   Actually, I think Clubhouse would work
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:51.580]   in sort of an after hours thing.
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:54.820]   So after everybody's done, they go back to the rooms,
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:55.700]   and then they all write.
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.740]   The post-sane everybody joins together in the building.
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:59.300]   Oh, so tired man.
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:00.300]   I'm so mad.
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:01.300]   Oh, god.
[00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:02.780]   Oh, man.
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:06.380]   They rebuilt those conference call services from the mid '90s.
[00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:06.940]   That's what it is.
[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:07.700]   Remember, like--
[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:08.700]   Yeah, that's all it is.
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:09.300]   That's all it is.
[00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:11.500]   It's everybody with the same crappy audio quality.
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:12.260]   And so it's like--
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:17.740]   And it's so successful that Mark Cuban has announced a clone,
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:19.820]   fireside.
[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:23.620]   Twitter's got spaces, basically a clone, right?
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:26.540]   Well, do you think that this would have had any chance
[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:28.780]   if it weren't for the pandemic?
[00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:31.460]   I mean, the fact that we can't get together in person
[00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:35.300]   seems like it's just the perfect accelerant for Clubhouse.
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:37.700]   I mean, we're like, suddenly we're back in the room again,
[00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:42.340]   but we're with dozens of people or more, but we're safe.
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:45.980]   This is-- it's also like only fans in this regard.
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:47.780]   And what's the one where you pay somebody
[00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:49.460]   to do a short message for--
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:49.980]   Cameo.
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:50.660]   Cameo.
[00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:51.140]   Cameo.
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:51.500]   Yeah, Cameo.
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:54.300]   The problem is all the movie stars aren't working.
[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:56.220]   So they just sit around.
[00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:59.580]   So suddenly, Jared Leto can wander into Clubhouse
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:00.700]   because he's not working.
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:01.740]   Yeah, true.
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:02.940]   It's easier to get them as guests.
[00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.400]   I think we were already moving into the audio space,
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:09.280]   as we all know, through podcasting.
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:12.360]   And I feel like there was going to be this merger of the live
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:14.440]   streaming and the podcasting.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.200]   And this was it.
[00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.360]   And also radio, right?
[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:19.760]   And would Spotify getting into possibly live audio?
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.640]   I feel like it was going to happen.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:24.920]   And then it got accelerated because of the pandemic.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.260]   Who could have predicted that?
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:29.560]   I just never would have thought.
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.280]   I guess maybe I'm just a little jealous because I
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:34.760]   don't have to know what's for so long.
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:38.720]   So how I want to know, like Leo, like someone like you,
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.280]   are you going to play in Clubhouse with your brand?
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.280]   Or is it just like, OK, this is another thing that happens
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:45.200]   outside of it and is what it is?
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:46.880]   So Justine was on a few weeks ago,
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.280]   sent me an invite.
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.160]   And I went in there.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.560]   And I go, you know, every time I'm
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.840]   sitting around playing Animal Crossing,
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:56.240]   have I mentioned that's my new game?
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.880]   I feel like I'm wasting so much time.
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:58.800]   I should do something.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.680]   So I'll fire up Clubhouse and see if there's something
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:01.760]   I can listen to.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:04.320]   But I haven't really said anything in there.
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:05.880]   I'm too shy to say anything in there.
[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:06.480]   I don't know.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.080]   It's a--
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:07.580]   No.
[00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:08.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:11.440]   Well, it is kind of demoralizing if you set up a room
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:12.480]   and no one comes in.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:13.000]   Oh, God.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:13.480]   Exactly.
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:15.640]   And you're like, then you're standing around virtually.
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:16.320]   Oh, embarrassing.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.400]   OK, then.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.720]   Anybody want to come on the stage?
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:19.920]   Come on, you come on the stage.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:20.400]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:20.880]   It is.
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:21.360]   Much.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:22.640]   I mean, you see people--
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:23.640]   It is everything bad.
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:26.400]   --the fucking thing is to watch people jump in and then jump out.
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:27.720]   Oh, that's depressing.
[00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.600]   I've wondered that because I do that all the time.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.320]   You can see me do that?
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:34.080]   You see you come up.
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:35.040]   Yeah, you come in the--
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:35.560]   Yeah, nice.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:36.480]   --that's so high school.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.040]   I've seen you do that.
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:39.680]   I've never seen you do that.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:40.680]   Leo, look, Pards in here.
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:41.800]   No, he's gone.
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:42.960]   I've done that, though.
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.880]   I'll see someone that's like my friend or somebody
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:46.040]   that's being a long--
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:46.680]   That's hysterical.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:47.840]   --like MGC Eglur.
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:48.520]   Oh, my God.
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:49.800]   Oh, MGC.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.520]   Oh, he's gone.
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:52.760]   He's gone.
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:55.240]   Yeah, you only get 500 words from MGC, and he's gone.
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:48:00.200]   It's really interesting to watch the ferment
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:00.720]   around this.
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:01.520]   You're right.
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.440]   I didn't even think of that.
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:06.240]   But a lot of this probably is because of the quarantine.
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:07.280]   We're just bored.
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:07.760]   We're just bored.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:08.040]   We're just bored.
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:08.960]   It tears.
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.120]   So what happens?
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.560]   I mean, let's best case scenario.
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:13.760]   People are getting vaccinated.
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:16.280]   It's starting to speed up.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:18.440]   I mean, everybody's oh, don't take it.
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:19.440]   Don't take it.
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.760]   We got variants.
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:21.520]   We got mutants.
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:22.600]   You don't know what's going to--
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.720]   But you know what?
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:26.680]   By the summer time, 99%, it's just
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.240]   going to be back to normal.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:29.520]   We'll all be a little gun shy.
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.880]   But we can't wait to get out in the real world.
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:34.560]   Does all this stuff just go down the toilet?
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:35.440]   Oh, most definitely.
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.000]   I hope so.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:37.680]   That's a good question.
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:38.680]   I don't know.
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:40.560]   I don't know if clubhouse gets you by this.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.600]   You think it survives your own world?
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.000]   Not at the level.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.320]   I mean, because you either need to be--
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:46.840]   and I'm not like-- I'm sorry to say this--
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:50.120]   but you need to be single, unemployed.
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:51.040]   There's plenty of--
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:51.040]   And childless.
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.280]   So really spend hours.
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:52.880]   There's plenty of it.
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:55.280]   But I don't get people to come in six hours a day.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:56.520]   They're on clubhouse.
[00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:58.320]   I think that we'll still be using it.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.360]   But it will be like, yeah.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:00.920]   People are walking outside or at the park.
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:03.640]   They'll have-- just like they were catching up on their podcasts,
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.440]   they're going to be on clubhouse, perhaps.
[00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:08.400]   On my group conference call--
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:13.360]   I-- it is everything bad about-- first of all,
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.680]   throwing a party and hoping the anxiety of people
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:17.240]   may not show up.
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:19.360]   But also, the idea of going into a room
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.520]   being like, should I go here?
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:22.240]   Is this a private conversation?
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:25.000]   Am I intruding on what these people are doing?
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.160]   It is all these levels of social anxiety
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:29.960]   that I go through when I just open up clubhouse.
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:31.920]   So yeah, I don't know.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:34.680]   I don't know if it'll stick around.
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:37.440]   It's a very interesting world we live in.
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.400]   That is for sure.
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:42.880]   And I can't wait to see--
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:47.920]   I'm really fascinated by what's going to happen when
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:50.240]   this is over.
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:51.560]   Is it going to be the roaring 20--
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:52.440]   we talked about this before.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:54.680]   Is it going to be the roaring 20s where it's just like--
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:56.560]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:59.400]   Or are people going to be gun shy and PTSD
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:00.760]   and walking around with masks?
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:01.960]   I'm a little bit above.
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:03.840]   Should I shake your hand or fist bump?
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:04.960]   I don't know.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.240]   What's it going to be like?
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:09.600]   And by the way, every company--
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.560]   Salesforce just did it, Spotify did it,
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:13.360]   it says you don't have to come back to work.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:13.880]   You're fine.
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:15.000]   Stay home.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.880]   I think that somebody is going to develop an app
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:21.040]   where you can set up hugfests.
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:22.480]   Like basically, you're going to register.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:24.360]   You can say, I've been vaccinated.
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.200]   Let's meet at this spot, this post-spot.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:27.800]   And everybody's going to hug.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:28.280]   Touch me.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:28.800]   Please.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:29.360]   It's like, right.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:30.840]   It's like, people are literally
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:32.880]   going to be desperate for physical contact,
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.600]   but they're going to have to be smart about it.
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.480]   So they're going to use an app to schedule it
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:38.200]   and ensure they're doing it safely.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:40.480]   But I swear this is going to happen.
[00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:42.480]   And by the way, if anybody creates this app,
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:43.600]   they better talk to them.
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:46.280]   Aren't they worth their cuddle parties before this?
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:47.360]   That I don't want.
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:50.800]   Or maybe that's just a mailing list, I'm on.
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:52.200]   I'm just suffering else.
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.080]   That's something else.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:57.040]   It could be a return of the free hugs.
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.440]   Free hugs that you strip up.
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:50:59.600]   Yeah, hug guys.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.120]   Free hugs.
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:04.200]   That strikes me as a little creepy.
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:04.720]   Don't you think?
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:05.720]   No, free hugs.
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:07.040]   I mean, it's nice.
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:09.160]   Do you notice that you're very--
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:11.280]   I feel like my partner I'm with right now,
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:14.680]   I'm just so desperately needing closeness
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:17.040]   at different points because I'm nonstop on my computer
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.000]   on Zoom.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:18.800]   I don't see people.
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:21.800]   So when I'm with him, I'm just like, oh, I'm a human.
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:23.000]   I have noticed that, actually.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:23.680]   Yes.
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:24.680]   Yep.
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:25.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:26.680]   My poor wife.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:27.680]   My poor wife.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:28.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:29.680]   I mean, it's nice.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.880]   It's probably what we should be doing with our partners.
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:36.480]   So they said there would be a baby boom from the quarantine.
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:38.480]   I don't know if there was one.
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:41.280]   I mean, I know several people within my family that yes.
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:42.280]   OK.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:43.280]   The harder worries are having a baby boom.
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:44.280]   Wow, they're coming.
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.280]   They're coming.
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:46.280]   They're coming.
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.280]   I have a two-year-old right now.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.880]   So talk about being close to just a human all the time.
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:51.880]   Yeah.
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:52.880]   Yeah.
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:56.880]   And it's nice because of just people losing their jobs and money and everything.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:02.800]   And we saw the first dip in the world population or in having babies or something.
[00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:04.800]   There is that too.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:05.800]   I heard that too.
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:09.280]   And also just everybody who wants to travel, do it before the babies, you know, because
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:10.280]   it's so much harder.
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:13.440]   My daughter just said I'm never bringing a child into this world.
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.640]   She said that would be irresponsible to bring a child.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:18.080]   And I think a lot of people-- and that is like the thing.
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:23.480]   We're getting the children of men syndrome into this idea.
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:28.080]   There's a great movie, the great Ethan Hawke movie, first reformed.
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:29.080]   Check it out.
[00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:31.000]   Because that is the moral thrust of that movie.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.960]   The world is falling apart.
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:33.960]   We're killing the environment.
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:37.440]   Why should-- what is the moral responsibility of bringing a child into this world?
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.680]   It's getting harder and harder every day to justify that.
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:40.680]   Yeah.
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:41.680]   So here's the story.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:43.080]   Thanks to the chat room.
[00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:44.680]   Baby bust.
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:47.280]   America's pandemic birth declines.
[00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.880]   Steeper than initially believed.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:53.440]   Some European countries with stronger social safety nets saw gains.
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:55.480]   So that tells you you're exactly right.
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:56.480]   It's economic insecurity.
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:57.480]   It's food insecurity.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:00.680]   People are saying, I'm not having a baby now.
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:01.680]   Right.
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:02.680]   Florida's down--
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:03.680]   It's not hard to have a kid in America.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:04.680]   Florida down year--
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:05.680]   It's so much uncertainty.
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:10.840]   9.3% Arizona down 8.7% Ohio down 8.4%.
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:11.920]   Baby bust.
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:13.440]   That's a significant drop.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.440]   We're going to--
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:15.440]   Yeah.
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:17.320]   --an aging population.
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:18.480]   They better build us robots.
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:21.280]   I'm not going to have the kids to take care of us.
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:23.280]   We're working as fast as we can, Lance.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.280]   OK?
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:25.280]   Just be patient.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:27.280]   We've got the dogs to handle now.
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:30.080]   It's just a question of human beings.
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:31.880]   Well, there you go.
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:37.920]   Twitter-- you know, it's funny because we've watched Twitter change over the years.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:42.240]   They still seem to be chasing active users.
[00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:45.720]   They still seem to be chasing money or monetizing.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:48.160]   They're constantly come up with new stuff.
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:52.000]   I feel like somewhat-- I feel like-- and I've heard people say this.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.440]   Jack Dorsey, the CEO, is kind of a part-time CEO.
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:56.440]   Right.
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:59.720]   And he kind of comes in and says, let's do that.
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:01.720]   And then leaves--
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:02.720]   It's his side hustle.
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:03.720]   It's a side hustle.
[00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:07.120]   I work here from five to nine.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.120]   Literally.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:10.520]   I didn't want to say I'm on repeat for two weeks.
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:12.520]   Yeah.
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:13.520]   When he's not living in a yurt.
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:15.520]   Wow.
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:16.520]   Weaving is beard.
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:17.520]   Let's see.
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:18.520]   You could weave that beard.
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:22.520]   You make quite a nice blanket out of that beard.
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:25.960]   One thing we've noticed, especially like just having covered Twitter in many different
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:30.240]   ways, I don't know how many Twitter people actually use Twitter.
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:31.240]   And that's the thing.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:35.520]   Like they have a fundamentally different idea of what the network can be compared to us
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:40.760]   actually who are there constantly swinging, you know, reloading our feeds every day.
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:45.600]   They don't have any affinity for people who actually use their platform.
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:49.520]   Which is why as a Power Twitter user, it's like, why--
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:50.520]   Tweet that.
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.440]   What happened to Tweet that kind of explains it?
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:53.440]   No, that kind of explains it.
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:54.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:55.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:56.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:57.440]   And then they--
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:58.440]   Go ahead.
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:00.600]   They sometimes don't seem to want to play to that audience.
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:01.600]   Like, yes.
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:07.160]   Alexandra and I, and Share, we're that hardcore audience.
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:12.400]   But over the years, all I've talked about is making Twitter more accessible to people
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:13.920]   who are not into Twitter.
[00:55:13.920 --> 00:55:14.920]   So--
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:15.920]   Well, that's where the growth--
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:16.920]   Tweet deck is-- right.
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:19.360]   And Tweet deck is a side thing to them.
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:21.320]   They've never-- they've always sort of deprecated.
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:22.320]   They bought it.
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:23.320]   I had come--
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:24.320]   They never did anything.
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:27.320]   Yeah.
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:28.320]   Because they didn't kill it, which had been my original concern.
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:29.320]   Right.
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:31.680]   But they're not going to throw lots of money into it because they can't spend all their
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:36.560]   time on the Power users when, as you said, growth remains so important.
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:41.240]   And by the way, growth is not simply a matter of adding people.
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:44.000]   Any service has incredible churn.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.040]   The churn means you are constantly losing people.
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.400]   And they lose people.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:50.200]   They have to clear out bots.
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:53.320]   So it's like this roller coaster ride for them.
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:54.320]   You know, dip down.
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:55.320]   They got to push back up harder.
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:57.000]   Dip down, push back up harder.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:01.360]   So it's a very difficult thing to grow.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:04.920]   They don't-- they're not marching into countries and then suddenly just growing like the next
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:10.480]   big thing and somehow Facebook keeps marching through the world and making sure the people
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:14.080]   have connected so they can continue to grow at that scale.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:17.320]   That's simply not possible for Twitter at this point.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:18.320]   Mm-hmm.
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:22.400]   Also, because they haven't looked at themselves like that, I feel like they never had that
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.480]   Mark Zuckerberg way of looking at their business.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:25.480]   Well, but they--
[00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:26.480]   It was democratization.
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:28.200]   I think they wanted more peace and love.
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:29.200]   Like, I don't know.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.200]   They just didn't want to capitalize on it the way.
[00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:32.200]   But they have to understand--
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.200]   Mark Zuckerberg did.
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:39.760]   The reason-- the thing that makes Twitter appealing is these power users like you guys
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:41.120]   that are putting content on it.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:42.120]   I mean, without--
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:47.760]   Well, the problem is because monetization-- so like, what's trending my company was monetizing
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:53.200]   on video and just like their monetization is just so-- yeah, like for a company like
[00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:56.080]   that, we've gotten kicked out of the program so many times.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:59.000]   Like, we're brought in the program and then we have one video that someone monetizes when
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.720]   it shouldn't be and they're like, you're out.
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:03.920]   And you're like, what-- that doesn't make sense for someone who's created all the time.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:08.680]   Like, it's just so-- and then even with-- if you were doing paid on Twitter, you literally
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:14.720]   email someone like-- like that their manager said that I could do paid on their tweets.
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:16.720]   Like, that's how janky the program is.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:17.720]   It's pretty janky.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:18.720]   Yeah.
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:21.080]   I don't think people know how janky the backend is at Twitter.
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:24.640]   It's very much like very ad hoc.
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:27.200]   Then there's YouTube, which is a powerhouse, right?
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:28.200]   Yeah.
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:29.960]   YouTube seems to know what it's doing.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:32.960]   Is your experience with YouTube better, Shira?
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:36.800]   I mean, no, like YouTube took out their social functionality years ago.
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:40.760]   Like, when I started before what's trending, I started this thing called Partners Project
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:42.320]   and we were interviewing YouTube stars.
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:46.480]   The reason why we grew is because if we covered someone, if they liked it and commented on
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:48.280]   the video, it would appear in their feed.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:49.280]   Oh.
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:50.280]   YouTube took that out.
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:51.280]   Yeah, that's gone.
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:52.680]   And after that, there was no social element to it.
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:57.520]   There was no way for someone to discover the content unless they tweeted it or Instagram
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:58.520]   it.
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:02.040]   So I would have to be on another platform to promote it, which would defeat the purpose.
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:07.120]   Like, why would you then push your social talent, the influence off the platform?
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:08.680]   Is that something TikTok got right?
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:10.120]   It's something TikTok did, right?
[00:58:10.120 --> 00:58:11.120]   And got right.
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:13.120]   That seems like it.
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:14.120]   Right?
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:18.320]   Yeah, that you can like and comment and then it appears in the feed.
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:19.720]   You could see what people are liking.
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:25.360]   I mean, but also encouraging people to do remixes and duets.
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:28.600]   Stitching and stuff like that, the duets.
[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:29.600]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:30.600]   That's brilliant.
[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:32.000]   Honestly, that's brilliant.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:36.100]   And I don't even know why YouTube hasn't generated something like that because that would be
[00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:37.100]   amazing.
[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:39.880]   But it's also works better for shorter video.
[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:42.640]   It's harder when you've got something like a five to 10 minute video.
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:43.640]   But yeah.
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:48.880]   Well, ironically, YouTube is creating a TikTok like short video platform, right?
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:49.880]   So yes.
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:50.880]   Clearly they see.
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:58.440]   All you had to do is say, I collaborated with someone and I put part one and part two on
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:01.440]   theirs and we could both it's like the views go to both.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:04.400]   And it doesn't feel like it's two different sources.
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:05.560]   And then we're both monetizing.
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:07.160]   We're sharing the monetization.
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:09.880]   That could have been like the modern day collaboration, right?
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:13.240]   There's just so many things and even just keeping the like and the comment button where
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:18.840]   my feed would see what I'm liking and commenting on, then it would be a great way for discovery.
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:20.840]   They just, it's just, yeah, it doesn't make sense.
[00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:21.840]   Yes.
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:24.800]   You wrote a piece Lance a couple of days ago on medium.
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:28.600]   The secret to TikTok success is there is no secret.
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:32.560]   Everybody has a theory about how to become TikTok famous.
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:34.280]   But really it's a serendipity.
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:35.280]   It's the algorithm.
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:41.280]   It's just, I mean, who thought long boarding down the street to Fleetwood, Max dreams drinking
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:43.960]   cranberry juice would make you a TikTok star?
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:44.960]   I know.
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:47.000]   It's incredible.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:50.760]   What happens in that in so much time is spent on TikTok.
[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:53.000]   We're trying to figure out the secret.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   Is there no secret?
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   What's going on?
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   It really isn't.
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   But it's, yeah.
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   Well, if you read that.
[00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.600]   Davindra says there is a secret.
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:01.600]   What's the secret?
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.600]   No, no, no.
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:07.720]   I mean, the secret is, and I like your article Lance, but the secret is basically it's easy.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:10.000]   You don't have to do anything really to start.
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   Oh, the platform is.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   The platform is.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   No, no, no.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.920]   There's no secret to how well designed the platform is.
[01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:20.360]   Just like we just talked about the duets, the sharing, how easy it is to create a TikTok.
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:23.360]   All of that is why so many people post.
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:27.080]   And of course, the brilliant thing is you create a platform that encourages and makes
[01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:28.480]   it easy to create.
[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:32.000]   You get millions of people submitting videos, then you let the algorithm pick the hits.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.600]   It's a good algorithm.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.600]   It's profit.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.600]   So that's clear.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.840]   We know that works, but how do you become that person?
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:39.840]   I don't know.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:40.840]   But that's the question.
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:41.840]   Right.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:42.840]   And that goes, I believe me.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:48.920]   I've been talking about TikTok for years now, and I understand why it's successful.
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:49.920]   What I think is hard.
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:53.680]   I think somebody who's on TikTok and terrible, terrible, terrible at it.
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:58.840]   But I spend a lot of time watching TikToks and seeing how people are trying to tease
[01:00:58.840 --> 01:00:59.840]   apart the algorithm.
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:00.840]   Game the algorithm.
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:01.840]   Tease apart.
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:02.840]   You know, right.
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:03.840]   It's this.
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:05.800]   It's sometimes it's weird things.
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:06.800]   And sometimes it's super-
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:11.360]   Who would have thought setting snowballs on fire would be huge on TikTok?
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:12.360]   Right.
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:13.360]   You don't know.
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.360]   You don't know.
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.360]   It's everything.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:18.320]   The things that work on TikTok are the aha moments.
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:19.880]   You know what's the best part?
[01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:23.920]   Who is the celebrities who come on TikTok and it's poof?
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:24.920]   Right.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:25.920]   Not necessarily.
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:26.920]   No, they are.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:28.920]   Who's a hit?
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:30.560]   What celebrities are hit on TikTok?
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:33.800]   I feel like I always see a celebrity that's a group of us.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.000]   So, all right.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   Here's the thing.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.960]   So I was on musically before it was TikTok.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.040]   So I blew up on musically.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.200]   I was an early adopter user.
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:45.640]   Then TikTok came around and because I was putting so much effort on musically, I had
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:50.240]   to start figuring out something else because I wasn't monetizing.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:55.960]   And so I took a year, not off, but then of course as I took the year off, TikTok blew
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:56.960]   up.
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.920]   And now I have like 600,000 followers.
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.560]   Oh, that you brought with you from musically?
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:07.360]   I can't even, and every few months, it feels like it gets harder and harder.
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.600]   You got to start singing into the hairbrush again.
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:11.600]   That's what worked.
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:12.600]   That's what worked.
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:13.600]   It's so funny.
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:18.480]   Like even, you would think that click baby stuff like, "Oh, I'm in my bikini.
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:19.480]   Sometimes that works.
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:20.480]   Sometimes it doesn't."
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:21.480]   Right?
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:25.560]   I think it's like the more shots you take, the more possibility you can get in the algorithm.
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:31.360]   I like that because I've always felt like Instagram's easy if you wear a bikini.
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.360]   But no, seriously.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:37.560]   I mean, I do get more likes when I show something.
[01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:39.320]   And when I dance around, you can see stuff.
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.320]   That's the reality.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.320]   I'm not going to.
[01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:42.320]   Where would that be?
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.320]   Is that on Instagram?
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:44.320]   Is that on TikTok?
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.320]   Where is that?
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:46.320]   At Shira Lazar.
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:47.320]   Okay, thank you.
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:48.320]   I take a lot of my TikToks and I put it on my Instagram.
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.320]   So the thing is, so this is it.
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:51.320]   So now I'm more...
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.120]   Lisa won't let me follow you, Shira.
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:54.720]   She says it's too sexy.
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:57.560]   No, so this is the thing.
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:58.560]   TikTok...
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:01.320]   If I wear my yoga pants on TikTok, you think that would be...
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.320]   No.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.320]   I mean, if that's your brand...
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.320]   No, it's not my brand.
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:07.320]   It's the...
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:10.280]   I find the things that do well for me on TikTok are like the...
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:14.120]   I could make cat sounds and like I had a cat.
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:18.460]   And then out of nowhere, that got more views than my other ones, which were like really
[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:20.360]   thoughtful, serious posts.
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:22.280]   Is that a good thing?
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:23.280]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.840]   It's not a good thing for you because...
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:27.200]   Or any creator because you can't figure it out.
[01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:29.560]   But I think it's a good thing for the platform.
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:33.840]   But once you do, you start doubling down on those things that work.
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:34.840]   Right.
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:35.840]   Right?
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:36.840]   That's the key thing.
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:38.000]   Yeah, that's the key thing.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.160]   And that's... I mean, that's one point that I made in the article is that ultimately it's
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:42.880]   sort of this consistency thing.
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:46.960]   You have something that works and you have really hyper-consistent on it and consistent
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:47.960]   on the quality.
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:49.800]   Like there's a set of guys, I'm sure you...
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.840]   Like Marques Brownlee, for instance.
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:52.840]   Right.
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:53.840]   Right.
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:54.840]   Exactly.
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:55.840]   It's all about quality.
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:58.720]   He doesn't even do that many videos, but his standard is so high.
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:03:59.720]   Oh my God.
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:00.720]   So, yeah.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:01.720]   They're so good.
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:02.720]   There's a guy...
[01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:03.720]   Casey Neistat.
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:04.720]   Same thing, right?
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:05.720]   Just brilliant editor.
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:06.720]   Yeah.
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:07.720]   Although...
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:08.720]   You're doing a really different pet...
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:09.720]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:10.720]   No.
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:11.720]   What's happening to Casey?
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:12.720]   Casey has been on a break.
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:14.360]   Has he taken a break again?
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:16.800]   No, I mean, he's not on YouTube as much as he used to.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:17.800]   He burned out.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:18.800]   That's what happened.
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:19.800]   Yeah.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:20.800]   He was doing so much.
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.280]   He was just like, "I want to spend time with my family and his post, but it's not like
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.120]   he does it in the same way."
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:25.120]   Right.
[01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.120]   Right.
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.120]   Okay.
[01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:28.120]   Sorry.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:29.120]   Go ahead, Lance.
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:30.120]   I got shocked whenever I got it.
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.120]   I was just gonna say, but if you got...
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:35.000]   If there's a couple of guys on TikTok who... their whole thing is they take somebody's questionable
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.520]   or something that they've done and they say, "You'll be amazed.
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:39.520]   This works."
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:41.120]   And they actually say, "Does it work?"
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:44.240]   Like every single TikTok is, "Does this work?"
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:45.560]   And that works.
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:46.560]   They've actually...
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:51.840]   They've really found a way of digging into the platform in a way that feels really intrinsic
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:54.680]   to it and built the wrong brand on top of it.
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:55.840]   But you have to be...
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:00.680]   It's going back to what we were saying at the beginning of this whole talk is that you
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:02.680]   have to have this level of commitment.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.440]   You have to work really hard at it.
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:08.040]   You have to do it multiple times a week or a day.
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:12.040]   And you also have to put up with the fact that often you're going to fail.
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:12.880]   Yeah.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.360]   Mm-hmm.
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:17.080]   It feels like it's a part-time job or a full-time job.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.880]   And then I would say with the celebrities, I mean, I think some celebrities just join
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:22.040]   it and there are some that TikTok knows are joining.
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:23.040]   Right?
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:26.960]   They've been trying to get them on for the past year and then they join and they kind of
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:28.600]   like give them a little boost or discovery.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:29.600]   Well, if I go to the front...
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:30.600]   If I go to the front...
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:34.400]   If I go to the front page of TikTok, suggested it counts.
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:37.280]   Gordon Ramsey, Will Smith, I'm Kevin Hart, Selena Gomez, Snoop Dogg.
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:38.280]   I mean, hello, exactly.
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:40.040]   Jason Derulo all over it.
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.040]   And yet I have a feeling...
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.560]   Oh my God, Jason Derulo is everywhere.
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:43.560]   But are those really...
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:46.240]   I'm sure they're getting paid by the management companies.
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:49.120]   I don't know who knows they might be, but also it's like they...
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.560]   Because they're getting suggested, they know they're going to blow up there so they know
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:54.160]   they're like ahead of it on those platforms.
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:59.440]   But I would say that those guys, Will Smith and Derulo, like a really good example of
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:03.640]   people who understand the platform and use it in a way that makes sense.
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:07.320]   And you can see the difference how some people get on and they're like, "I barely know what
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.320]   I'm doing here."
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:14.560]   Yeah, I'm looking at Will Smith's TikToks, 13.3 million, 7 million, 4.2 million, 30...
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:16.240]   He's like good people around him.
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.040]   Like his YouTube job is also fantastic.
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.040]   So it's like, yeah.
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.880]   So you hire somebody, you hire a young person.
[01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:21.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:22.880]   He has a team.
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:23.880]   He's like, they figured it out.
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:24.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:25.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:26.880]   Mm-hmm.
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.360]   Which is by the way, if you're a young person and you're trying to find fame and fortune,
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.280]   don't do it yourself.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.280]   Just sell yourself as...
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.280]   Hey, I'm a young person.
[01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.280]   I understand how this works.
[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.280]   It's true.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:36.280]   I'm a young person.
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:37.280]   I know how it works.
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:39.720]   You get a job with Jason Derulo or somebody and yeah.
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:40.720]   Yes.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:41.720]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:46.400]   I'm having too much fun and I've skipped way past break time.
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.400]   Uh-oh.
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:50.880]   I showed you and they brought to you by ExtraHop.
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:51.880]   ExtraHop.
[01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:53.200]   We were talking about the SolarWinds attack.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:54.200]   I'm actually...
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:56.720]   When we come back, I want to talk about there's a funny story with that.
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:02.800]   This sunburst attack scared the... but Jesus out of big companies, governments, little
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:06.720]   companies, it was a wake up call, frankly.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:10.080]   Because you know, it was using a trusted service.
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.560]   It was a supply chain attack.
[01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:12.560]   How do you prepare?
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:16.640]   Cyber attacks are getting more advanced, harder to detect.
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:21.320]   And frankly, the most advanced threat actors are the ones already inside the environment,
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:22.880]   the APTs.
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:26.680]   They've been there for a long time without our knowledge or they're the trusted, provide
[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:31.240]   providers who are, you know, we give them complete access because well, that's our security
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.240]   software.
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:37.200]   But the problem is when cyber criminals get past your defenses, they're in.
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.400]   You need a way to detect them and respond to them.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:45.160]   And the old model of just putting up a big wall is not enough.
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:46.960]   ExtraHop Reveal X.
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:51.960]   This is a amazing solution that shows you not just where intruders are going, but where
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:52.960]   they've been.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:56.120]   You know, when a bad guy gets in your network, they spend a lot of time trying to cover up
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:57.120]   their traces.
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:58.840]   They can't with ExtraHop.
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:05.720]   You can investigate incidents and prevent them from turning into full blown breaches.
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:10.280]   The question every security team has to answer every day is, are we, are we okay?
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:11.640]   Have we been compromised?
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:15.000]   ExtraHop Reveal X makes it super simple to answer that question.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:20.040]   You've got 90 days of record look back, complete network visibility across the data center,
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:25.280]   but not just in your on-prem data center, but in the cloud, even all the way to the
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:29.280]   vice edge, which allows security teams to get to real answers in seconds.
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:33.240]   In a post compromise world, your greatest chance of stopping advanced threats is with
[01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:36.640]   ExtraHop network detection and response and D.
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:37.960]   Are you want to know more?
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:39.200]   See this website?
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:42.040]   If you're watching the video, you do extrahop.com/twit.
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:44.360]   If you're not, you can see the demo.
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:46.120]   You can see what it can do.
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:47.520]   You could try it for yourself.
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:53.040]   Learn how ExtraHop stops breaches 84% faster and explore this interactive demo.
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:57.200]   I think once you try it, once you see, you're going to want this on your desktop.
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:05.280]   Every network needs ExtraHop, extrahop.com/twit, extrahop.com/twit.
[01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:09.320]   We had a very fun week this week on the network.
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:10.920]   We're going to have a great time next week.
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:12.400]   I'll tell you what's coming up next week.
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:14.040]   Before we do that, let's look back.
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:16.400]   This is a little video we made for you.
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:20.560]   Come on, it has an offer right now where if you buy a participating product, they will
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:24.200]   give you a 14 or 30-day Xbox Game Pass Ultimate code.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:26.200]   Poptarts, Pringles, and Cheezits, right?
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:30.200]   This is the holy trinity of stuff you should never be sticking in your body.
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.680]   Just don't do this, folks.
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:33.240]   My tip is, you can say that.
[01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:34.800]   You're not to do this.
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:38.480]   Previously on Twit, this week in Google.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:43.200]   Biden signs executive order to just chip shortage through a review to strengthen supply chains.
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:48.480]   For those of you who are not just riveted by the chip industry, there has been a huge
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:51.560]   shortage of semiconductors.
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:55.480]   People actually can't make cars right now because they don't have enough money to sell
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:56.480]   it to them.
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:57.480]   It's amazing.
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:58.480]   Yeah.
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:09:59.480]   Hands on tech.
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:05.400]   This week, I'm actually able to take a look at this camera right here, the Sony A7C.
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:07.080]   Ooh boy.
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:10.480]   Have quite a bit to say about this camera.
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:11.480]   Windows Weekly.
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:16.760]   The stupidest folder in all of Windows is going to be removed in the future.
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:21.000]   That folder is 3D objects.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   They finally give an eye.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.800]   I've always, like, why on earth?
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:28.680]   At least back to when they were going to use HoloLens for consumer stuff.
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:31.720]   So you see, we did have breaking news at the top of the show.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:32.720]   Twit.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:35.560]   You guys are screwing out with this nonsense about the Federal Reserve, and I was looking
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:38.200]   at the important issues of the day.
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.120]   The stupidest folder in Windows.
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:44.040]   Actually, I'm going to come back with Mary Jo and Paul, of course, Wednesday of this
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.560]   week for Windows Weekly.
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:48.120]   But Tuesday, Mary Jo gave me a little insight.
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.760]   She said, "We weren't going to do it."
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:57.760]   But she said, "You should absolutely stream the Satya Nadella keynote from Ignite, part
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:58.760]   two."
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:03.480]   That's 8.30 AM Pacific, 11.30 Eastern time this coming Tuesday.
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:05.000]   I will be here.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.440]   We expect because Alex Kippman is really the keynoter.
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:10.920]   Nadella, the CEO, is going to introduce Kippman.
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:13.240]   Kippman's responsible for HoloLens.
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:17.440]   And I'm starting to hear the rumor mill that there's going to be a big HoloLens announcement
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:21.200]   or some sort of big AR mixed reality VR.
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:27.240]   This is, we keep hoping that somebody's going to come up with something that lives up to
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:29.240]   the hype for AR and mixed reality.
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:32.240]   The HoloLens, I don't think they quite did.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.800]   We'll see.
[01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:36.040]   That's Tuesday on Twit.
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:39.880]   We'll be streaming that live.
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:40.880]   Okay.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.880]   Now what?
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:43.880]   We did Twitter.
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:46.960]   We haven't, we did Clubhouse.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.600]   We did TikTok.
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:51.920]   Let's talk about the Solar, SolarWinds hack.
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:54.640]   There's really only one hysterical story.
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:12:00.240]   X CEO of SolarWinds testifying in front of Congress.
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:06.880]   It turns out that, and I don't know if this was the whole story behind the SolarWinds
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:09.240]   hack, but it was a big part of it.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:16.720]   Back in 2017, for reasons unknown, they let an intern set the password for their GitHub
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:21.840]   repository for all the source code for their updates.
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:32.640]   In 2017, the intern set the password, SolarWinds123, which to paraphrase space balls, might
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:38.600]   be a good password for your luggage, but for your update, for your update facility.
[01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:43.280]   The worst part is it had to have been used by employees and passed around for years.
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:47.080]   It wasn't "discovered till 2019."
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:51.320]   No, God.
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:54.760]   Katie Porter, representative of Katie Porter says, "I've got a stronger password than
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:59.440]   SolarWinds123s to stop my kids from watching too much YouTube on their iPad.
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:03.600]   You're supposed to be preventing the Russians from reading Defense Department emails."
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:06.160]   What's the story?
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:09.880]   Microsoft has been very involved in this Brad Smith, President of Microsoft, testified as
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:17.480]   well, saying, "No evidence the Pentagon was actually affected by the Russian spying campaign."
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:20.880]   Well, I'm not sure what that means, "affected."
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:21.880]   Yeah.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:25.040]   Sounds like a weasel word.
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:26.480]   They got in.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:29.280]   They didn't launch any missiles, so I guess it's okay.
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.640]   They don't know.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.320]   They don't know.
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:37.360]   But furthermore, they don't know what will happen in future because they haven't eliminated
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:39.200]   these people.
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:47.520]   Anyway, Rashida Tlaib confronted former solo and CEO Kevin Thompson.
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:48.760]   He said, "It was a mistake.
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:49.760]   An intern made it.
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:51.760]   Don't blame me."
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.760]   Jase Louise.
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:54.760]   Wow.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:59.200]   "Verizon's now advising users on Twitter.
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:03.240]   If your battery life's not great, turn off 5G."
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:04.240]   D'Findreff.
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:05.240]   Yeah.
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:08.240]   Listen, I work for Verizon technically.
[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:15.560]   So, it's a good policy ever, whatever the company says.
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:18.320]   I think you can take a nice look.
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:24.880]   Maybe 5G was a questionable upgrade for a lot of folks and no comment, no further comment.
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:32.840]   There is, to be fair, because there are fewer 5G cells, right, there are a few 5G towers,
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:37.520]   your phone will work harder if you're on 5G trying to seek.
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:38.520]   Right.
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:39.920]   And when it's seeking, you're draining more battery.
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:43.640]   So, it's not necessarily the act of being on 5G.
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:46.320]   It could be the act of garbage 5G.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:51.360]   I, for example, live in a garbage 5G area where it's-
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:52.840]   Is that the United States?
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:55.480]   Is that where you live?
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:59.560]   I can leave, honestly, if I leave my house, which I almost never do, I can actually get
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.560]   some decent 5G.
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:02.880]   Are you going to say, Lance, where are you?
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:05.120]   I'm out on Long Island, New York.
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:06.120]   Long Island.
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:11.280]   So, if you went into Manhattan and you were on Fifth Avenue between 110th and 104th, you'd
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:12.280]   get great 5G.
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:13.280]   Right.
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:17.360]   As long as I'm not standing next to like a big building that's blocking the direct line.
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:19.520]   If you're 115th in the air.
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.520]   Right.
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:25.360]   I mean, that's the thing about 5G that there are these issues about just keeping connected
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:26.360]   to it.
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:27.960]   Once you have it, it's amazing.
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:34.480]   But getting it, keeping it and stressing it might put on the battery for your new phone,
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:35.480]   that can be an issue.
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:36.480]   Yeah.
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:41.600]   Even within New York, like, I think we, in our testing gadget, like we got a good 5G
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:43.120]   at like Bryant Park.
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:48.040]   Maybe it's some of that like in the park where you have a lot of space.
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:49.040]   Yeah.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:50.040]   Yeah.
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:51.040]   You can see the antenna.
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:54.320]   But once you go into any street or anything, then it's like you're blocked.
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:55.840]   And this relies so much online in sight.
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:58.240]   It is, yeah, you got nothing beyond that.
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:03.800]   Like me, I see 5G on my phones, but most of the 5G, most people are getting is the low
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:10.000]   bands, 800 or 700 megahertz 5G, not the ultra millimeter wave super fast.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.960]   I G and low band 5G is right.
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:15.560]   David pretty much the same as LTE is a little fast.
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:16.560]   It's not much different.
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:17.560]   Yeah.
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:18.560]   Yeah.
[01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:19.560]   Yeah.
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:24.080]   And you're paying for it and you had to get a, I mean, this, this iPhone cost more and had
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:28.600]   to have a special little window on the side so that the millimeter wave, which I will
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:32.080]   never in my life encounter could get in.
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:35.720]   So it's not unreasonable for Verizon to say this is actually, they don't say turn off
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:36.720]   5G.
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:38.200]   They're not that dumb.
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:41.240]   They say, are you noticing your battery life is draining faster than normal?
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:42.920]   This was on Twitter this morning.
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:51.160]   One way to help conserve battery life is to turn on LTE, which turns off 5G.
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.680]   But keeps 5G in your plan.
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:53.680]   Keeps 5G in your plan.
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:54.680]   Yeah.
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:55.680]   You keep paying for it.
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:56.680]   Yeah.
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:57.680]   Keep it there.
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:58.680]   Yeah.
[01:16:58.680 --> 01:16:59.680]   Yeah.
[01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:01.040]   Oh Lord, do you have 5G's here?
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:02.040]   Are you enjoying it?
[01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:03.040]   I don't.
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.040]   You don't.
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:06.040]   I mean, I don't think so.
[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:07.040]   I know.
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:09.880]   That's the, that is the universal reaction.
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:14.080]   I mean, I literally go back and forth between my Wi-Fi and LTE.
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:15.080]   Yeah.
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.080]   We're all in Wi-Fi.
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:17.080]   That's true.
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:18.600]   And when it's on 4G, even it doesn't work.
[01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.800]   So I'm not a 5G.
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:24.440]   Jeez, Louise.
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:32.840]   I don't know if this is going to happen, but a court has ordered in the epic Apple dispute,
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:39.880]   a court has ordered steam, which is completely unrelated, to hand over aggregate historical
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:47.800]   sales, price and other information on 436 games hosted on the steam store on Apple.
[01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:48.800]   Yeah.
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:51.240]   Steam is like, Valve is like, make me.
[01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:52.240]   Why?
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:53.240]   Private company.
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:54.240]   I'd be furious.
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:55.240]   This is ridiculous.
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:56.240]   Yeah.
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:02.160]   The US magistrate judge Thomas Hickson, who's hearing the case, ordered that Apple's,
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:06.760]   asked for it, ordered that Apple subpoena for the data was valid.
[01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:09.600]   However, said, I love this.
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:14.040]   And this is a direct quote, Apple has salted the earth with subpoenas.
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:16.920]   Tell, and tell Valve, don't worry.
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:17.920]   It's not just you.
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:18.920]   Right.
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:19.920]   We're going after everybody.
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:21.440]   They're going to get everybody.
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:23.200]   They're probably coming after us.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:25.320]   Tell us how many people listen to your show, Leo.
[01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.320]   Yeah.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:30.560]   They want to prove that, you know, that, that this is how people make money with apps,
[01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:34.940]   that everybody's taking their cut, that it's not just them, that, you know, when Apple
[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:40.600]   has put out lots of comparative tables that show you exactly, everybody's sheet for how
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:42.640]   much they're charging for all these things.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:48.000]   And I think that, that sort of, that discovery, that shedding light on this is how Apple believes
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:53.520]   they win, that they say, you know, you're picking on us, but this is how the world works.
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.000]   And in fact, I think Valve charges 30%, right?
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.960]   I think that's the standard rate.
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:18:59.880]   It is on consoles.
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:03.560]   I don't know what Valve's cut is, but I'm sure that's why they're subpoenaing this.
[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:08.960]   By the way, Apple's lawyer said, hey, we could have asked for data on all 30,000 games.
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:10.960]   We just asking for 436.
[01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:13.200]   That's nothing.
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:14.600]   Valve says, we're a small company.
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.920]   We got to, we don't have time to do this.
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:18.240]   What are you nuts?
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:23.040]   They would have to dedicate multiple employees working full time.
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:30.320]   Okay, this, this, Epic Apple battles got nuglier and uglier.
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:32.520]   Let's see, that was the Apple story.
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:37.040]   How about the new Echo Show 10 with the rotating follow you camera?
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:40.240]   You get one of these in your house there, Dabendra?
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:41.240]   Look at that.
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:42.240]   No, that's not everywhere.
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:43.240]   It's really, it's cool.
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:48.540]   It's kind of cool and weird and creepy.
[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:49.540]   We were viewed it.
[01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:50.880]   I believe it was Nicole Lee in gadget.
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:55.640]   She, she found it kind of cool and useful, but also super creepy.
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:58.320]   I don't, we're surrounded by screens and now.
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:59.320]   You don't want it following me.
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:00.320]   Which is creepier this.
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:01.320]   The matter what I'm doing.
[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:03.920]   Or the drone that Amazon is, the ring drone.
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:04.920]   Oh, that's so weird.
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:05.920]   I don't think that's ever coming out.
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:06.920]   That's what I'm doing.
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:07.920]   You know, I haven't seen it.
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:08.920]   It was supposed to happen.
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:09.920]   Why?
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:10.920]   Yeah.
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:11.920]   I just lost it.
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:14.040]   That thing takes off when you're expected and why?
[01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:15.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:16.040]   Why?
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:17.040]   It's really loud.
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:18.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:20.000]   It couldn't sneak up on you.
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.000]   Oh, thanks.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000]   That's good.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000]   All right.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.840]   The Echo Show 10 is $250.
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:28.060]   I like the out-old-
[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:29.920]   Which is bad for that level of hardware.
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:30.920]   Yeah.
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:31.920]   Like that's a decent price.
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:32.920]   10.1 is screen.
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:33.920]   You need that feature.
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:35.240]   We use our Echo in the kitchen.
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:37.880]   We watch, you know, the Tonight Show monologue and stuff on it.
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:38.880]   It's great.
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:42.960]   I could see the doorbell and, you know, see who's waiting at the door.
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:43.960]   Okay.
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:45.280]   So there you go.
[01:20:45.280 --> 01:20:46.280]   There's that.
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:53.000]   It's, it does, it is kind of like heightening Amazon's like level of surveillance, I guess,
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000]   because yeah, now the camera can follow you pretty soon.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:58.440]   It's going to be on a roller ball, like BB-8, you know, and running around after you in
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:20:59.440]   the house.
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:00.540]   So it's getting greepier.
[01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:02.240]   It's starting to make that roll up.
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:03.240]   Yeah.
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:04.240]   That's real.
[01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:05.240]   They did make that roll up.
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:06.240]   That's really bad that's going up over here.
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:08.240]   And they're probably around the house.
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:09.240]   Yeah.
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.240]   Doesn't it work though?
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.440]   Then if someone's in there, like instead of you having it in the corner and then they
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:17.160]   can go to places where they can get it, you know, the camera and just be like all when
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:19.000]   you're not there and look all around.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.520]   Well, you could just have a Facebook portal, which has a special camera that basically
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:24.520]   doesn't move.
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:25.520]   It doesn't move at all.
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:31.680]   It doesn't have to because it uses technology to cheat it and can focus in on different
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:33.000]   things in the room.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.760]   Oh, yeah, I guess that's true.
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:39.560]   What if it's like for your grandparent or someone, you're dating someone from out of
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:41.880]   town and they want to like check in?
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:42.880]   Oh, great.
[01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:44.880]   That's me, the boyfriend.
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:45.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:51.400]   Well, if you can look down on the floor to check that grandma hasn't taken a fall, then
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:52.920]   that's useful for it.
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:55.480]   But grandma doesn't really want you to have a camera at her house.
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:57.400]   I'm pretty sure.
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:05.920]   If you have a Roomba I7 or S9 robot vacuum, you may have noticed it acting a little bit
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:09.280]   odd lately.
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:19.520]   The update for version 3.12.8 of the software is causing people to say Roomba, your go home,
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:23.520]   your drunk.
[01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:30.560]   Their robot cleans in strange patterns, gets stuck in an empty area, doesn't...
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:32.240]   That's Roomba on a good day.
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:33.240]   Yeah.
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.240]   I actually...
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:36.600]   Those are supposed to be the most expensive ones.
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:37.600]   Yeah.
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:38.600]   Yeah.
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:41.440]   They're very expensive, but it drove me crazy.
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:47.880]   This is a time lapse of the I7 attempting to return to clean base.
[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:52.000]   The Roomba is supposed to vacuum and is supposed to vacuum in such a way that it gets every
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   spot.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.680]   And then before it dies, go back to the charger.
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:57.040]   This is what his Roomba was doing.
[01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:59.280]   This is a time lapse, obviously.
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:00.280]   It's just...
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:01.760]   You guys are taking over my ghost.
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:02.760]   You're rushing.
[01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:03.760]   The Russian car.
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:04.760]   Oh, I can't get to the base.
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:05.760]   Oh, this explains a lot.
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:06.760]   I know.
[01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:07.760]   I do.
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:09.920]   I appreciate this empty room, though.
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:12.000]   I got to say, most rooms are not like that.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:13.000]   Yeah, no.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000]   I really think room for Roomba.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.960]   He cleaned up for the Roomba.
[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:17.240]   Still couldn't get to the charger, though.
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:19.600]   In fact, the battery died.
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:22.400]   I just kept doing that.
[01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:25.000]   This is also a major mystery of what's happening in my house, though.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000]   Yeah, thank you, Leo.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.680]   I've told this story before.
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:29.200]   Forgive me if you've heard it.
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.720]   But we had one of those fancy Roombas.
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:34.040]   And it was just a big...
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:36.400]   It would get up in the middle of the night.
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.840]   It would make it...
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:40.240]   So that's bad.
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:41.840]   And then it would start vacuuming.
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:44.720]   And then invariably it would get stuck.
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:47.760]   It couldn't get under something and it would start going boom, boom.
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:49.480]   Oh, that's down there.
[01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:50.720]   Boom, boom.
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:51.720]   So I would get up.
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:54.240]   It's three in the morning because we don't want the Roomba to do it when we're walking
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:55.240]   around.
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:56.760]   So I'd get up in three in the morning.
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:02.120]   Take it, take it, okay, little Roomba, put it back on its charger next night.
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:03.600]   Boom.
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:05.360]   So finally, the last...
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:06.360]   What?
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:09.000]   You scheduled it to run the middle of the night, Leo?
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.840]   Yes, because otherwise there's people walking around.
[01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:12.840]   You could complain about making noise.
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:14.800]   The vacuum crew would never do that.
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.800]   My Roomba gets stuck once.
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.000]   What do you do, Leo?
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.440]   Well, do you don't want it when you're awake?
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:21.840]   It's going to hit you.
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:24.160]   You let it run it during the day out of the way.
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:26.160]   When you go...
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:27.160]   When you leave that house.
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.160]   Yeah, Leo.
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.160]   Yeah, Leo.
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:30.160]   Okay.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:31.160]   Also, I would leave you like more.
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:32.160]   Nobody leaves anymore.
[01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:33.760]   You're the way you say that sound, Leo, to I robot.
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:34.760]   I would love if my eye robot...
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:36.760]   Yeah, the way you do it.
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:37.760]   That would be awesome.
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:38.760]   Finally, the last...
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:41.120]   That's about the fifth time that happened.
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:44.520]   I took it, instead of bringing it back to the charger, I brought it into the garage and
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:46.760]   I put it under the tire of Lisa's car.
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:48.520]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:50.520]   She saw it before she ran.
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:51.520]   That's so sad.
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:52.520]   I know.
[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:54.920]   But Roomba's like, "You programmed me to do this.
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:56.160]   I'm doing this because of you."
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:57.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:00.600]   This is robot abuse.
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:01.600]   It's robot-side.
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:02.600]   Roomba-side.
[01:25:02.600 --> 01:25:03.600]   Wow.
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:08.600]   The pedo for Roomba is coming.
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:09.600]   Uh-oh.
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:14.240]   I'm going to be the first on the wall when they come.
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:18.200]   Okay, so we have Amazon's rotating camera not going to do that.
[01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:20.440]   Helicopter never going to be released, which is too bad.
[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:21.440]   I'm disappointed.
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:25.840]   We are going to see the helicopter perseverance is helicopter fly on Mars next week, right?
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:26.840]   Very good.
[01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:27.840]   Three weeks.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:28.840]   Okay.
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:29.840]   That's very exciting.
[01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:34.200]   So by the way, making Linux the number one operating system on Mars, which is I think.
[01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:36.200]   I will never get tired of that joke.
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:37.200]   Yeah.
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:38.200]   You've heard it before.
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:39.200]   Finally, Linux wins.
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:40.200]   Linux wins.
[01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:43.000]   Linux wins on Mars.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:47.000]   Facebook is considering face recognition in its upcoming smart glasses.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.640]   This is according to Facebook Vice President Andrew Bosworth.
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:52.640]   They're evaluating-
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:53.640]   That's in our name.
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:54.640]   Are you surprised?
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:55.640]   Yeah.
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:58.480]   They're evaluating the legal and privacy issues around it.
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:25:59.480]   Mm-hmm.
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:02.640]   Ryan Mac, ready for BuzzFeed.
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:08.960]   Here's the quote, "Face recognition might be the thorniest issue where the benefits are
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:14.240]   so clear and the risks are so clear and we don't know where to balance those things."
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:15.240]   Oh, come on, Bosworth.
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:16.240]   Your Facebook.
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:17.640]   Just do it.
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:21.800]   We think after destroying the US democracy that we can really tackle this problem to you.
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:22.800]   This is something really good.
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:23.800]   We're really experienced.
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:24.800]   Really, really good.
[01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:25.800]   It's a shame.
[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:28.480]   I really want a pair of glasses that tell me who I'm looking at.
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:29.480]   I know.
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:30.480]   I know.
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:31.480]   I get names all the time.
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:32.480]   Yep.
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:37.160]   But to Facebook, maybe the worst company to do it because of their reputation.
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:39.840]   Google was not a better company to do it, by the way.
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:41.480]   So maybe Apple-
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:42.480]   Give me LinkedIn glasses.
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:43.480]   I've linked it.
[01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:45.480]   But Apple's already linked in.
[01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:46.480]   LinkedIn.
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:47.480]   LinkedIn.
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:48.480]   They can't do anything.
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:49.480]   Just don't make them possible.
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:50.480]   They're so boring.
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:51.480]   LinkedIn doesn't make anything.
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:52.480]   Yup.
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:53.480]   They should, though.
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:54.480]   That's a good idea.
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:55.480]   The LinkedIn glasses.
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:56.480]   Yeah.
[01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:57.480]   I like it.
[01:26:57.480 --> 01:26:59.000]   That's another shot at this.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000]   All of us.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000]   Yeah.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000]   That's true.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.000]   Did you stock up?
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.040]   That's what they're announcing on Tuesday.
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:09.960]   Or a robotic vacuum that doesn't get drunk, maybe.
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:10.960]   Instead of the...
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:12.720]   It'll play the Windows startup sound.
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:14.320]   Oh, that'll be good.
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:18.520]   Did you get it on the GameStop big run up there?
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:19.520]   100%?
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:20.520]   No.
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:21.520]   I wish.
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:22.520]   I wish.
[01:27:22.520 --> 01:27:24.520]   No.
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:27.440]   This is funny because this is CNBC and they're trying to pretend it's a big deal.
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:31.880]   It has something to do with actual news.
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:35.120]   GameStop announced its CFO will resign on March 26th.
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:36.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:37.960]   That's why the stock doubled.
[01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:38.960]   Please.
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:39.960]   Sure.
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:40.960]   Sure.
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:44.640]   That's what it was.
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:47.120]   Had nothing to do with those guys on Reddit.
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.120]   No.
[01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:54.120]   Actually, I guess the Reddit guys might have gotten excited because he was being forced
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:28:02.520]   out by Ryan Cohen who is the guy who's been pushing GameStop to go online to be a download
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:04.840]   company instead of a brick and mortar store.
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:09.520]   Maybe there is some legit.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:16.040]   There's also some evidence according to Reuters that bots hyped up GameStop on social media
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:17.040]   platforms.
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.040]   You don't say?
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:19.040]   Wow.
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:20.040]   Really?
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:21.040]   Yeah.
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:22.040]   Yeah.
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:23.040]   Not surprised.
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:28.120]   These things like it's easy to game the system if you really wanted to to create hype.
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:29.120]   Yeah.
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.120]   Yeah.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:36.800]   I know these retail investors who are on social media and on Reddit, the trigger is, because
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:39.960]   used to be hard to trade, like for average people to trade.
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:40.960]   Then there's Robinhood.
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:41.960]   Right.
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:42.960]   Right.
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:45.400]   So now it's easy with an app like Robinhood and I think there's like public, there's a
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:52.760]   few others and so they see something and they react and we see that huge 165% jump
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:53.760]   in an afternoon.
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:54.760]   Yeah.
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:58.040]   One of the other ones is We Bull, which is Chinese company.
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:00.200]   So that's interesting.
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:05.920]   Robinhood, according to Bloomberg, is planning a confidential IPO filing as soon as next
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:06.920]   month.
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:07.920]   Big shot.
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:09.160]   Not so confidential anymore.
[01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:10.160]   No.
[01:29:10.160 --> 01:29:13.920]   They don't really want it to be confidential, do they?
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:14.920]   No.
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:20.360]   I'm sure the investors are going to jump on this one saying, "Hey, this is the time to
[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:25.880]   get some money out of the market since Robinhood's in the news."
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:28.480]   Square bought some Bitcoin.
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:31.560]   Kind of a, I don't know if I support this.
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:37.960]   This is in the Square financial statements, their fourth quarter results.
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:43.920]   They bought 3,318 Bitcoins at a purchase price of $107.
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:46.120]   This is where Jack Dorsey is really paying attention.
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:47.120]   Oh man, Jack.
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:48.120]   He's not really on this.
[01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:50.120]   Jack, this was between obviously between $5 and $9.
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:55.240]   Jack was over at Twitter at $51,000.
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:56.840]   What is Bitcoin right now?
[01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:58.320]   It's not that high.
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:29:59.320]   Uh-oh.
[01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:00.320]   Uh-oh.
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:01.960]   Let's see, $45,000.
[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:02.960]   So.
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:06.080]   But still insanely high.
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:07.080]   It's crazy.
[01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:08.080]   Yeah.
[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:10.720]   How much Bitcoin do you have?
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:11.720]   Zero.
[01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:13.480]   No Bitcoin.
[01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:18.880]   I swear honestly, years ago, when people were barely talking about it, somebody gave me
[01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:22.520]   the information, told me how to set up to start mining it.
[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:28.240]   And I remember I started trying, and my computer basically, you know, it had a heart attack.
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:29.880]   You couldn't do it.
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:32.280]   And I kind of just walked away.
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:36.400]   I was kind of like, who's ever going to care about this anyway?
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:37.960]   This will never be worth it.
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:38.960]   Yeah.
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:39.960]   Right.
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:40.960]   Right.
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:42.200]   Who knew?
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:46.680]   Um, you did a story to vendor.
[01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:52.120]   I just, I forgot about this, uh, on, uh, cyberpunk and project read.
[01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:53.120]   Yeah.
[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:54.120]   It is a mess.
[01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:55.600]   What is going on at project read?
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:56.600]   They got hacked.
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:57.840]   I mean, they got hacked.
[01:30:57.840 --> 01:30:59.560]   They won't pay the ransomware.
[01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:03.720]   And then there was a follow up story, basically, that after this news came out about the next
[01:31:03.720 --> 01:31:09.520]   major patch being delayed till March, um, apparently a lot of the folks at CD project
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:13.480]   read have been locked out of their work work station because of that ransomware.
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:14.480]   Oh my God.
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:16.040]   And they've decided not to pay.
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:19.560]   They're, I mean, yeah, yeah, they're not paying.
[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:22.880]   I think of a lot of companies that they probably would do the same thing because you could
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:27.840]   still recover, but this, uh, and this like halt in productivity is going to be a big
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:28.840]   problem for them.
[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:29.840]   Yeah.
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:30.840]   Yeah.
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:31.840]   Yeah.
[01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:32.840]   Yeah.
[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:33.840]   Yeah.
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:34.840]   Maybe they have backups, uh, and it's going to take them a while and they're going to get
[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:37.320]   everything back to normal and they'll get going, but that's going to slow everything else
[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:38.320]   down.
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:39.680]   They need to use your computer first.
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:43.280]   So yeah, I've heard so many bad things about this game.
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:47.840]   I haven't gotten far enough to see the bugs and the problems and logic and so forth.
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:49.080]   I was really excited about it.
[01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:50.320]   Is it not a good game?
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:51.880]   Have you been playing it?
[01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:54.160]   It depends on, I guess it really depends on how you're playing.
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:55.160]   I like open rules.
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:56.160]   I'd be playing it.
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:57.160]   Yeah.
[01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:58.920]   I like open world games too.
[01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:01.440]   And I think it's been hyped up for so long.
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:06.320]   Um, there are certainly like legit criticisms over how empty and dead this world feels in
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:09.320]   this game, but I do think there's a lot of, there's great writing in there.
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:10.320]   There's some really good missions.
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:14.680]   I had a lot of fun with it, but it's not the game I was hoping it would be after waiting
[01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:15.680]   so long for it.
[01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:20.160]   It's not as open and dead as what was that space exploration game with the generated
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:23.480]   planets and there was like an infinite number of planets.
[01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:27.560]   No man's sky, which by the way, they flipped back around and is now apparently incredible.
[01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:28.960]   Oh, I have to play it.
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:31.840]   So that have made it very good and welcoming.
[01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:33.120]   You played in VR now.
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:37.880]   Like they sat down and focused on that game because that's all they had.
[01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:40.200]   But yeah, I'm not sure what's going to happen with cyberpunk.
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:41.200]   I hope it turns around.
[01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:42.200]   Yeah.
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:44.320]   You know, that's often the case.
[01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:48.480]   It's so hard to make these games and make them working until you get them out and especially
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:51.440]   multiplayer games until you get them out into a big audience.
[01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:53.680]   You maybe don't know what the problems are going to be and.
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:55.200]   Oh, they knew what the issues were.
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:59.640]   We, the coverage of this game was like, oh, they knew there were bugs.
[01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:00.640]   Giving them some benefit.
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:03.280]   They just pushed it out there.
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:07.760]   I think at some point they should have been like, yeah, we cannot put this on the PlayStation
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:10.920]   before or Xbox one because it will catch fire.
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:11.920]   Yeah.
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:12.920]   This game just cannot happen.
[01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:13.920]   Wow.
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:15.680]   And they just never admitted to that.
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:16.680]   Yeah.
[01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:20.960]   I was going to say that for people, the big problem seemed to be that, you know, the biggest
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:25.880]   market for this game was on the existing consoles, not the next general once.
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:30.800]   And all those people, including my own, you know, my kids here, my daughter were hyped.
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:31.800]   She got the game.
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:35.360]   She was like, I can't wait to play it on my Xbox one.
[01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:38.320]   And as she was getting it, all the stories were hitting.
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:42.480]   And so she made the executive decision to not play it until the patches come.
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:43.920]   So she won't touch the game.
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:44.920]   She was smart.
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:45.920]   He was smart.
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:46.920]   He was to have that experience.
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:51.080]   So, you know, it's, but I think that's a terrible thing, you know, that they didn't
[01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:54.240]   prepare people for that, that it was like surprise.
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:56.080]   I should have worked with everyone.
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:58.440]   I should have waited two years to play No Man's Sky.
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:00.240]   Maybe I would have really enjoyed it.
[01:34:00.240 --> 01:34:01.240]   Yeah.
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:04.560]   Hey, I spent like 150 bucks on the limited edition.
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:05.560]   Me too.
[01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:07.480]   Because I was so excited for it with a little spaceship.
[01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:08.720]   And it was cool.
[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:10.360]   It's a cool spaceship.
[01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:14.680]   And hey, I've gone back and played it and they've done a great job making that thing
[01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:15.680]   good.
[01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:16.680]   Yeah.
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:17.680]   And I hopes for it.
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:20.600]   And this is part of the problem is you get so hyped.
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:26.360]   Both both Cyberpunk and No Man's Sky were insanely hyped for, I mean, they show trailers
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:29.680]   at E3 a year ahead of time and people get so excited.
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:31.480]   Nothing can live up to that.
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:32.480]   Nothing.
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:34.480]   Do you play any games?
[01:34:34.480 --> 01:34:35.480]   I don't play games.
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:36.480]   I don't play games.
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:38.480]   You're busy creating.
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:44.480]   Well, I mean, there's a lot of creators that game, but I actually was a host for GameStop
[01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:46.480]   highlights in store at a start.
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:47.480]   No, really?
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:49.880]   So I was hired by a company to do all those highlights.
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:52.480]   And I remember getting called out because I called Mario Mario.
[01:34:52.480 --> 01:34:53.480]   Oh my God.
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:59.520]   And then I went to the GameStop Developers Conference or not developers GameStop like
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:01.320]   managers conference.
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:04.640]   And that was really interesting because all of them like knew us because this is all
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:06.640]   they watch all the time.
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:07.640]   You're a celebrity.
[01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:08.640]   I was a celebrity.
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:13.000]   You guys, I'd gone into the gaming world and then I got more into pop culture and all
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000]   that.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.440]   And I follow what's happening, but I don't necessarily game.
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:17.440]   Like I'm a complete noob.
[01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:18.440]   I'm really bad at it.
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:20.440]   I get super anxious when I play.
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:22.680]   They should have paid you in GameStop stock.
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:24.320]   If I'm only a noob.
[01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:25.320]   Only a noob.
[01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:29.480]   It's like the woman who painted the mural.
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:31.480]   The old Facebook office.
[01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:33.400]   I remember that.
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:35.400]   They said, well, we don't have any money.
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:36.880]   Would you take stock?
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:43.640]   And I believe she's a multi-billionaire as a matter of fact.
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:49.400]   Speaking of games, the PS5 is going to get its PlayStation VR headset.
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:53.120]   I thought PlayStation VR was pretty nice on the PS4.
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:54.640]   I kind of enjoyed it.
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:55.640]   Surprisingly nice.
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:56.640]   Yeah.
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:57.640]   It was good.
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:59.640]   It's just because you're sitting down.
[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:03.760]   It's hard to get nauseous if you're sitting down, I guess.
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:05.280]   You could do that with PCVR too.
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:08.480]   It's more like it was somehow worked.
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:12.480]   Somehow they made a pretty cheap console.
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:13.840]   It just required a ton of wires.
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:15.000]   The moves were dopey.
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:16.240]   I wasn't crazy about them.
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:17.240]   It was all right.
[01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:18.240]   Controllers stink.
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:19.240]   Yeah.
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.240]   But the head's still glowing.
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:22.280]   Yeah, the little move ones.
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:23.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:25.320]   Your little ping-pong, your glowing ping-pong ball ones.
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:26.320]   That's it.
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:27.320]   That's true.
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:29.320]   I'm sure they're getting very anxious.
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:30.320]   I do that.
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:31.320]   I would do that.
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:32.320]   What I was really good at?
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:34.240]   What was the thing?
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:35.240]   It was the...
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:37.720]   We're not tennis or something where you had to move your...
[01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:38.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:39.720]   We tennis.
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:40.720]   I was really good at we.
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:41.720]   I was really good at we.
[01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:43.120]   And in the game, that was fun.
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:44.120]   That was fun.
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:45.120]   We.
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:46.120]   Was that before or after your Tamagotchi?
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:48.120]   That was half fun.
[01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:49.120]   Okay.
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:51.120]   I'm aging myself.
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:52.120]   I...
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:53.560]   We have a we at home.
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:55.520]   I even bought this silly...
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:57.520]   It's actually a Pilates thing.
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:58.520]   Yeah, like...
[01:36:58.520 --> 01:36:59.520]   It's great.
[01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:00.520]   It's great.
[01:37:00.520 --> 01:37:01.520]   It's great.
[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:02.520]   The dance dance revolution ones.
[01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:03.520]   I love anything that's more physical.
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:08.360]   Like anything where I need to kill people or I have to create things and go through like
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:09.360]   off the line.
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:10.360]   You would love animal crossing.
[01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:11.360]   You need to get a switch.
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:12.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:13.840]   You basically, you're landing the island.
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:17.360]   You just have a tent and you get to design the whole thing.
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:19.360]   And it takes thousands of hours.
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:21.360]   I don't know if I would like that.
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:22.360]   That would give me anxiety.
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:23.360]   Oh, shake trees.
[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:24.360]   Shake trees.
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:25.360]   Shake trees.
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:26.360]   You've done that.
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:27.360]   That's right.
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:28.360]   You shake trees.
[01:37:28.360 --> 01:37:33.760]   Like I said, I have finally got to the stage where I'm growing golden roses.
[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:34.760]   And those are quite lucrative.
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:35.760]   Nice.
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:36.760]   Yeah, I have a little golden rose farm.
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:39.400]   So that's good.
[01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:41.880]   This is our gaming segment such as it is.
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:42.880]   Sorry.
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:50.080]   HP is buying HyperX, which is a well-known accessory, gaming accessory.
[01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:52.160]   Great headsets from them.
[01:37:52.160 --> 01:37:53.160]   Yeah.
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:55.160]   $325 million.
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:56.800]   Good for them.
[01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:57.800]   Yikes.
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:37:58.800]   Good for them.
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:37:59.800]   Good for them.
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:00.800]   And good for HP.
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:05.720]   HP needs better accessories because they every time I review like a good HP desktop, I reviewed
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:10.240]   an all-in-one from early last year, it was a great thing.
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:11.880]   Terrible keyboard, terrible mouse.
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:14.080]   Like they need help with lots of different things.
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:15.080]   Yeah.
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:16.080]   Very vanilla stuff.
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:21.320]   I do feel like though that HP's split was good for the PC side.
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:27.160]   So getting HP Enterprise off to do their thing, I feel like the help PC side focus and make
[01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:28.160]   better products.
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:29.360]   They were making very bad.
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:32.920]   I mean, the pavilions were nightmare products for years.
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:35.360]   Now these Envy's, they're beautiful.
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:36.360]   The spectres are gorgeous.
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:37.360]   And the spectres, yeah.
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:38.360]   I love the spectra.
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:39.960]   Yeah, that's a go-to here.
[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:40.960]   Yeah.
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:41.960]   Like spectra.
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:42.960]   Gorgeous.
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:45.640]   And they don't have all the junkware they used to have on them and all of that stuff.
[01:38:45.640 --> 01:38:47.760]   They made a laptop out of leather.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:48.760]   You know?
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:49.760]   They did.
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:50.760]   It feels good.
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:51.760]   It's a football leather, right?
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:53.080]   It was a nice thick, yeah.
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:54.080]   Picskin.
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:58.640]   Tell us about this MSI you reviewed as long as we're talking about gaming.
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:38:59.640]   The GS66.
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:03.320]   I mean, the GS66 Stealth.
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:04.320]   It's a gaming laptop.
[01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:08.680]   But I think what's really interesting is that it's one of the first with a 1440p screen.
[01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:11.400]   And this is where we get really technical.
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:17.920]   But you know, games like to be 1440, not 1080, not 2166.
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:20.040]   They like it in the sweet spot in the middle there.
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:24.800]   It's a good sweet spot because before gaming laptops were all like either 1080p, which
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:29.560]   is the original HD standard, and they were getting faster and faster in terms of refresh
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:33.200]   rate or they could be 4K, which was hell on your GPU.
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:36.120]   Just really hard to actually render a game at that resolution.
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:37.120]   Too much.
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:40.920]   So 1440p, slightly sharper with a high refresh rate.
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:41.920]   It's great.
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:42.920]   It's like a great middle ground.
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:44.720]   It also comes with a 3080.
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:47.720]   Isn't that a desktop GPU?
[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:48.720]   It can.
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:49.720]   It's a laptop with a 3080.
[01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:50.720]   Okay.
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:51.720]   Yeah.
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:57.200]   Well, they've been doing basically slimmer, less powerful versions of their GPUs for laptops,
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:59.240]   but they're still really good.
[01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:00.760]   It just costs a ton.
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:01.760]   Right.
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:02.760]   And you can get it though.
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:04.360]   I mean, it's such a shortage.
[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:05.360]   Yeah.
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:06.360]   It's a nightmare.
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:07.360]   All right.
[01:40:07.360 --> 01:40:08.360]   It's a nightmare.
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:09.360]   It's the whole chip shortage.
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:10.360]   Yeah.
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:11.360]   There's the gaming segment.
[01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:15.160]   I hope you all enjoyed that.
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:16.880]   We don't do a lot of gaming covers.
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:18.200]   We should probably should do more.
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:21.760]   It's always been difficult though because there's so many.
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:24.520]   It's not one monolithic thing.
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:28.240]   There's PC gamers, there's console gamers, there's Nintendo switch gamers, there's casual
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:29.240]   gamers.
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:33.080]   It's too and neither kind of a large market that you should probably be covering.
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:34.080]   It is.
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:41.320]   But the PC gamers mock the console gamers who mock the iPad gamers.
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:42.800]   Nobody everybody thinks they're real.
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:43.800]   The real gamers.
[01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:44.800]   The whole thing.
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:45.800]   Yeah.
[01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:46.800]   It's crazy.
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:52.240]   Let me talk about the game of getting insurance car or home.
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:53.240]   Nice.
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:54.240]   You like that?
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:55.240]   You like that?
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:56.240]   Very good.
[01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:57.240]   Very good.
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:00.240]   Actually, there's a story behind this.
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:01.240]   It's a true story.
[01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:05.520]   Lisa, about months ago, said, "Ah!"
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:06.520]   She said, "What?"
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:10.760]   She said, "They just raised our house insurance $8,000."
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:15.720]   This is because we live in the forest, wildfire territory, I guess.
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:16.720]   I don't know.
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:17.920]   That was their excuse.
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:19.360]   So I said, "No, no, no problem.
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:21.080]   I've got a computer.
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:22.400]   I can do this.
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:24.040]   We're going to shop."
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:27.120]   After about three sites, it's like, "Oh my God."
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:31.640]   Because you're entering the same stuff over and over and over again.
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:37.760]   Then I saw that ad with Hanu saying, "Guys, did a Gabi and Sean so you don't have to do
[01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:38.760]   that."
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:41.560]   It was like he was talking to me.
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:45.880]   I heard it and I think I probably saw it a couple of times.
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:48.040]   I finally said, "All right, I'm getting Gabi.
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:49.040]   G-A-B-I.
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:52.040]   It's an app you put on your phone."
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:57.240]   What they do, and actually it's cool, I think geeks will appreciate this, they basically,
[01:41:57.240 --> 01:41:59.520]   there's something nobody else does.
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:04.720]   They convinced insurance companies, and they've got 40 of the biggest insurance providers,
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:08.120]   progressive nationwide travelers, home and auto.
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:11.520]   They convinced them to create a API.
[01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:14.600]   That's the last thing insurance companies ever wanted to do.
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:17.320]   They want you to go to their website and type things in.
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:22.560]   Gabi says it's about 1,100 characters on average that you have to type per site.
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:23.640]   They don't want you to shop.
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:26.560]   You give them the credentials for your existing insurance.
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:28.200]   You don't even have to type that in once.
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:32.240]   They get all the data from your insurance company, and then they shop it to these 40
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:33.760]   different companies.
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:36.840]   All you do is you link in your current insurance.
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:40.160]   In most cases, you'll receive quotes in a few minutes for the same coverage you have,
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:41.400]   and that's the whole point.
[01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:43.880]   They want to match that coverage.
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:44.880]   That's exactly what we did.
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:47.600]   If you want to move forward, by the way, no obligation at this point.
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:48.640]   You haven't agreed to anything.
[01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:53.040]   If you want to move forward with one of the quotes the insurance company you selected,
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:56.480]   will of course have to underwrite it so they'll review all the details and confirm the final
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:58.120]   price.
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:05.520]   On average, they save their customers an extra $961 a year in their pocket.
[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:09.760]   That's how much Gabi customers save per year on average car and home insurance.
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:14.320]   I put in the car insurance and I put in the home insurance.
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:15.920]   It came back within a couple of minutes.
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:17.480]   This wasn't typing a lot of stuff.
[01:43:17.480 --> 01:43:19.200]   This was very quick, very simple.
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:20.960]   I just gave them the credentials to log in.
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:24.000]   I won't say the names of the insurance companies, but log into our car insurance and our home
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.680]   to separate companies.
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:26.680]   They came back and said, "You know what?
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:28.400]   You're getting the best deal you could get on a car insurance.
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:29.400]   We can't find anything better.
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:30.400]   That's a great deal."
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:32.080]   That actually made me feel pretty good.
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:34.880]   None of this is costing me anything at this point, by the way.
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:38.480]   They said, "But we think we could save you a couple of thousand dollars on that home insurance."
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:42.640]   Oh, okay.
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:45.520]   Then they said, "Okay, if you want to move forward to the quote, still I've paid nothing.
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:47.880]   I've committed to nothing."
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:50.960]   They say, "Okay, we're going to give your information to this insurance company.
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:52.600]   They haven't done that yet."
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:55.720]   Sometimes the insurance company depends on how old-fashioned they are.
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:57.280]   Sometimes they'll call you.
[01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:58.720]   Sometimes it's automatic.
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:03.000]   Sometimes a Gabi agent will call you, but they have to review the details, do the real
[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:04.640]   underwriting, and then confirm the price.
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:05.800]   You still have paid nothing.
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:08.080]   You still have committed to nothing.
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:09.840]   Sometimes there'll be an adjustment there.
[01:44:09.840 --> 01:44:10.840]   It was.
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:12.600]   It was originally a little more.
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:16.120]   Went down a little bit when they realized where we lived.
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:18.920]   We saved almost $2,000.
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:20.640]   We got the insurance policy the other day.
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:21.640]   It's done.
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:23.160]   It cost us nothing.
[01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:25.000]   It was an incredible thing.
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.720]   I just wanted to tell you about it.
[01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:28.720]   It's a great way.
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:30.240]   It is so simple and so easy.
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:32.560]   You could do it while you're watching the Gabi ad on TV.
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:36.360]   Save on home and auto insurance today.
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:38.000]   On average, $961.
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.000]   We saved more.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000]   We saved more.
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.640]   It was an amazing experience.
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:42.640]   It's fast.
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:43.640]   It's easy.
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:44.640]   By the way, don't worry.
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:46.680]   They never sell your info.
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:49.600]   I'm always so nervous when I sign up for these things.
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:52.880]   I use a phone, a real phone number, but not my real phone number.
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:53.880]   You know what I mean?
[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:57.520]   I use a dummy number and a dummy email address.
[01:44:57.520 --> 01:45:00.040]   Since we did this, no spam, nothing.
[01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:01.880]   I always check nothing.
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:02.880]   They don't sell your info.
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:04.640]   No robo calls, no spam.
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:06.040]   It's all very private.
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:07.480]   But boy, it really works.
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:08.840]   Gabi, I want you to try it.
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:09.840]   You may be overpaying.
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:11.680]   You probably are on your car and home insurance.
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:14.440]   Most people are because it's too much of a pain to shop it.
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:16.720]   Let Gabi do the work.
[01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:19.400]   Using their technology, see how much Gabi can save you.
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:20.400]   It's free to check.
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:23.200]   Again, no obligation, no commitment.
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:25.560]   You don't have to push that button until the very end.
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:27.560]   Go to gabby.com/twit.
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:30.280]   Go to gabby.com/twit.
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:34.040]   G-A-B-I.com/twit.
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:35.600]   Gabi, thank you.
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:36.600]   You saved us big.
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:38.600]   I really appreciate it.
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:41.480]   Oh, these are creepy.
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:43.440]   I don't know if this is a good thing or not.
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:45.280]   Have you seen this MyHeritage?
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:46.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:48.280]   Oh, is this creepy?
[01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:49.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:51.720]   Oh, oh my God.
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:52.720]   Whoa.
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:54.720]   Deep fake of your grandma?
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:56.720]   Yeah, grandma's deep fake.
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:59.520]   Yeah, it's worse when you do it with someone you know.
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:02.560]   It just freaks you out.
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:03.920]   I did it with my grandmother.
[01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:06.440]   I've been told by my wife I'm not allowed to do it with any
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:07.440]   of her relatives.
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:08.440]   Really?
[01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:09.440]   Yeah.
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:14.080]   So it's somebody you don't know, it doesn't look so weird because you what?
[01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:15.080]   It's not-
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:16.080]   I think you just don't have that connection.
[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:17.080]   Yeah.
[01:46:17.080 --> 01:46:19.240]   But if it's somebody you knew, it's like, I know.
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:22.400]   So there's examples with Abe Lincoln.
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:24.760]   Let me see if I can find that.
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:25.760]   Yeah.
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:26.760]   They call it-
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:27.760]   You can do it with any hearing.
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:28.760]   Yeah.
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:33.200]   You can do it with a Spock figure I have here.
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:35.400]   You can really just anything that's not moving.
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:38.440]   You can get a picture of it, pop it in.
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:39.440]   All right.
[01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:40.440]   Let me-
[01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:41.440]   This is so weird.
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:43.440]   Let me pull this up and see if I can-
[01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:44.440]   Yeah, Lincoln.
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:45.440]   It's so weird.
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:50.920]   Abe Lincoln, as you've never seen him before.
[01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:51.920]   Is this it?
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:52.920]   Is he moving?
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:53.920]   Yeah.
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:54.920]   Oh, here it is.
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:55.920]   It's a video.
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:56.920]   Okay.
[01:46:56.920 --> 01:46:57.920]   Let me play it.
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:46:58.920]   Oh, gosh.
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:01.320]   Let me play the audio too.
[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:02.320]   Yep.
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:03.320]   He's-
[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:04.320]   He's-
[01:47:04.320 --> 01:47:05.320]   Oh, my God.
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:06.320]   Oh, my God.
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:07.320]   Abe Lincoln's doing an ad for my heritage.
[01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:08.320]   Oh, my God.
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:10.160]   That's just creepy.
[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:18.840]   So is that a deep fake?
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:19.840]   What is it?
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:21.080]   Yeah, I think that is right.
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:22.080]   It's not really that specific.
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:23.560]   No, it's not really deep fake.
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:26.080]   It's more like an AI because it's-
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:27.080]   AI, yeah.
[01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:34.280]   Taking the image and what it understands about normal human facial movements and
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:40.200]   basically combining them, it doesn't- I know that what's happening there is they're connecting
[01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:46.240]   it directly, I think, to somebody who might be talking or you're animated, but it's not entirely-
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:48.920]   Deepfakes is a little bit different.
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:49.920]   Yeah.
[01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:50.920]   Okay.
[01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:52.920]   Have you guys seen the Deepfake Tom thing going around?
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:53.920]   Yes, that is a lot of stuff.
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:54.920]   That is terrifying.
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:55.920]   Wait a minute.
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:56.920]   You mean my space Tom?
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:57.920]   No, it's so crude.
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:47:58.920]   No, no, no.
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:47:59.920]   No, no, no.
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:00.920]   Search for Deepfake Tom.
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:01.920]   Deepfake Tom.
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:02.920]   Yeah.
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:07.440]   Some viral videos going around the craziest, like, very good deepfakes I've seen.
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:08.440]   All right, let me see.
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:09.440]   It's a TikTok.
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:10.440]   It's a TikTok, of course.
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:11.440]   Yeah, deepfake Tom.
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:12.440]   Yeah.
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:13.440]   Here it is.
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:15.440]   So this is not really Tom Cruise.
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:16.440]   Is that what you're telling me?
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:17.440]   No.
[01:48:17.440 --> 01:48:18.440]   It's not Tom Cruise.
[01:48:18.440 --> 01:48:19.440]   What's up, TikTok?
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:23.040]   You guys cool if I play some sports?
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:27.240]   It does look like Tom Cruise, but he doesn't- the guy doesn't look like that.
[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:28.240]   I don't know.
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:29.240]   I don't know.
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:30.240]   We don't know-
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:31.240]   He's got a little bit more.
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:32.240]   It's a audio experience.
[01:48:32.240 --> 01:48:33.240]   Yeah.
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:36.840]   It's- have you guys ever watched Corridor Crew?
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:37.840]   No.
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:38.840]   Which is the momentum.
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:40.720]   They're a YouTube channel.
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:43.680]   They do a lot of special effects stuff, and they actually do something like this.
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:45.520]   I'd be pissed if I was Tom Cruise.
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:50.200]   I guess because he's a celebrity, you can't copyright his look.
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:52.600]   I think his last version of the video.
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:53.600]   Well, he's a major thing.
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:54.600]   Can you?
[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:55.600]   Yeah.
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:49:00.760]   I feel like that will be the future where there will be AI that can scan the web and
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:04.760]   see if your likeness is being used in other ways.
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:06.560]   It's not approved.
[01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:09.200]   So this is one way to become famous on TikTok.
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:10.840]   Deep fake Tom Cruise.
[01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:14.120]   Yeah, but nobody- it's kind of like we don't know what the deal is.
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:17.120]   Like some actor with a decent Tom Cruise impression.
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:19.760]   He doesn't sound like Tom Cruise that much.
[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:20.760]   What he's got-
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:21.760]   Yeah, a little bit.
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:22.760]   Yeah, he's a little bit.
[01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:23.760]   Yeah.
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:29.360]   And they clearly have shot video of him and then modified the face to look more like-
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:31.600]   Okay, because he has the Tom Cruise movement.
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:33.040]   It's like a mapping.
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:38.200]   It's kind of like a mapping technology because they'll have like the Tom Cruise and all of
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:41.400]   Tom Cruise's different expressions.
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:45.080]   And that allows the actor to sort of do whatever they want.
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:49.600]   And the AI can say, I know what to do with the face with the Tom Cruise space to make
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:51.440]   it look like it's part of your face.
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:53.440]   It's really sophisticated.
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:58.360]   This is the best deep fake that I've seen for Tom Cruise that I've really seen.
[01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:00.040]   I've seen a lot of different deep fakes.
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:01.240]   I've seen a lot of deep fakes.
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:03.280]   This one is totally incredible, right?
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:04.280]   It's totally-
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:05.280]   Yeah.
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:06.280]   Show it again, John.
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:07.280]   It's totally credible.
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:10.520]   I mean, it's not- if I didn't know ahead of time, I would think that's Tom Cruise.
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:11.520]   Yeah.
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:16.360]   When he turns sometimes, like if he does a full turn to the file, that's kind of falls,
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:17.360]   right?
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:18.360]   Yeah.
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:19.360]   Yeah.
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:20.360]   He's got a schnaz.
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:22.200]   His forehead hink wrinkles also disappear sometimes.
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:23.360]   Oh, that's not good.
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:24.360]   Yeah.
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:25.360]   Yeah.
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:26.360]   Wow.
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:27.360]   There are little bits and pieces.
[01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:28.360]   Wow.
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:29.360]   All right.
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:31.000]   I don't think that my heritage.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.000]   Yeah.
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.440]   I've been doing a deep fake this entire time and not actually-
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:36.080]   That's not you.
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:38.360]   It's actually, he's Tom Cruise, believe it or not.
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:39.360]   That's right.
[01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:40.680]   That's the way to scale your likeness.
[01:50:40.680 --> 01:50:44.800]   It's like if you don't have enough time in the day, you just get someone like an intern
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:47.440]   to do deep fake of you on a show or-
[01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:49.280]   I honestly-
[01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:54.760]   Honestly, it sounds like a joke, but I honestly believe there are many- there's more than
[01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:58.040]   100,000 hours of video of me doing these shows.
[01:50:58.040 --> 01:50:59.040]   Uh-huh.
[01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:01.120]   Which are completely saved and recorded.
[01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:06.080]   And I believe at some point it's not going to be in the next 10 years, but at some point-
[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:10.680]   I'm hoping it's before I die- there will be a synthetic Leo and these shows can continue
[01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:11.680]   forever.
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:14.440]   So, yeah, here's the thing my friend Taryn, you should totally have-
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:16.280]   I think it's totally possible.
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:20.320]   She works with this Israeli company who's doing these AIs and she created an AI version
[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:24.240]   of herself as a host because she does hosting in her own YouTube channel, Taryn Southern,
[01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:25.240]   check it out.
[01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:28.880]   And so now she has an AI of herself that she could just use to host shows and interview
[01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:31.040]   people and she doesn't need to do it.
[01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:32.520]   That's amazing.
[01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:33.520]   Are you kidding?
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:35.160]   Is it pretty good?
[01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:36.160]   Yeah.
[01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:38.160]   Go to her youtube.com/TarynSouthern.
[01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:39.160]   Okay.
[01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:41.160]   You can check it out.
[01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:42.160]   Okay.
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:44.240]   And then, okay, here's your- is this her?
[01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:45.600]   No, wait a minute, that's a song.
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:47.160]   No, that was a music video.
[01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:48.160]   Okay.
[01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:49.160]   Okay, let's-
[01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:50.160]   I'm like a bug on your screen.
[01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:51.160]   Okay, here's the-
[01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:52.160]   All right, go to your-
[01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:53.160]   Making my clones.
[01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:54.160]   Is this it?
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:55.160]   Oh, here it is.
[01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:56.160]   It's on.
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:57.480]   Okay, so this is not real.
[01:51:57.480 --> 01:51:59.680]   This is a generated Taryn Southern.
[01:51:59.680 --> 01:52:00.680]   Yeah, I mean-
[01:52:00.680 --> 01:52:01.680]   Okay.
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:02.680]   Let's see.
[01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:03.680]   Hey guys, I can't believe it's been here five years-
[01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:04.680]   It's not perfect.
[01:52:04.680 --> 01:52:05.680]   I see.
[01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:06.680]   I see.
[01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:07.680]   I'm posting regular videos to YouTube.
[01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:08.680]   I see the mouth.
[01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:09.680]   It's a little weird, right?
[01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:12.600]   The real Taryn Southern, AI Taryn can speak different languages.
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:15.880]   A solution, I have my phones in Titish and karak, Tianguhu.
[01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:16.880]   Oh boy.
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:17.880]   It's a habit different faces.
[01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:18.880]   This is weird.
[01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:19.880]   Genders.
[01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:22.640]   AI Taryn can sing.
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:24.920]   So if we could do this now.
[01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:27.080]   I'm telling you, there's enough video of me.
[01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:29.160]   It won't require my cooperation.
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:31.960]   You can even re-loan for your-
[01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:33.960]   There's enough video and photos of my-
[01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:34.960]   Sure, yeah.
[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:35.960]   I want you to keep an eye on Lisa.
[01:52:35.960 --> 01:52:36.960]   And if all of a sudden-
[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:37.960]   [laughter]
[01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:42.600]   She's got a new man, but the shows keep going.
[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:43.600]   I'm suspicious.
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:45.000]   I know what's happening.
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000]   I don't know.
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.840]   I can happen.
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:49.360]   I think we're getting close.
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:50.360]   It's just-
[01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:54.880]   It's a matter of maybe a year or two or maybe five.
[01:52:54.880 --> 01:52:56.680]   Before you really will see something-
[01:52:56.680 --> 01:52:57.680]   I'm that Tom Cruise.
[01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:00.560]   Hugo will see something and you won't know if that's real or not.
[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:01.560]   Right?
[01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:02.560]   What does that do?
[01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:03.720]   There's deep big porn, which is super-
[01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:04.720]   Yeah, that's scary.
[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:06.360]   Nobody's doing that with me.
[01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:07.360]   I'm sorry.
[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:11.080]   Look at these movies where they're bringing back stars, dead stars.
[01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:13.280]   I mean, still none of them are great yet.
[01:53:13.280 --> 01:53:15.120]   Well, the Star Wars stuff was terrible.
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:17.160]   I mean, they had to put-
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:18.160]   They do better.
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:20.400]   Put them in dark with things and they had little clips.
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:21.400]   It wasn't great.
[01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:25.040]   But I think we're making rapid progress.
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:26.040]   It's getting better.
[01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:27.040]   I don't know.
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:28.040]   I feel like-
[01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:32.160]   Have you guys seen the movie called The Congress, which is something I referenced quite a bit.
[01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:36.920]   Directed by Ari Fulman, but it's a movie starring Robin Wright about a world where actors can
[01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:43.280]   digitize themselves, choose to capture their likeness and sell that off to a studio.
[01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:46.400]   Then they can't act personally anymore, but their likeness can go on.
[01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:47.960]   Because they've licensed it.
[01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:48.960]   Yes.
[01:53:48.960 --> 01:53:51.160]   Oh, you talk to me about this.
[01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:52.480]   I did start watching this.
[01:53:52.480 --> 01:53:54.560]   This is with Robin Wright.
[01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:55.560]   It's fantastic.
[01:53:55.560 --> 01:53:56.560]   I did start watching this.
[01:53:56.560 --> 01:53:58.120]   More and more precious every day.
[01:53:58.120 --> 01:53:59.120]   The Congress.
[01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:00.120]   Oh, the Congress.
[01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:02.440]   Yeah, because she licensed herself, right?
[01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:03.440]   That was the same.
[01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:04.440]   Yeah.
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:05.440]   Yeah.
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:06.440]   I would do that.
[01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:08.840]   That's a way to scale yourself and have a life.
[01:54:08.840 --> 01:54:09.840]   And retire.
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:10.840]   Yeah.
[01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:11.840]   But then you can't create control.
[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:15.200]   Yeah, it's illegal for you to perform yourself.
[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:16.200]   Right.
[01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:17.200]   Because your self is someone else.
[01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:18.200]   You can't compete with the-
[01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:20.720]   She's already sold her the rights off.
[01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:24.920]   But that happens if you're in the music industry, you sell off your catalog.
[01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:26.720]   You don't own your music anymore.
[01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:29.520]   It's completely credible.
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:30.920]   Completely credible.
[01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:32.920]   Bad news if you're crossing the border.
[01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:36.720]   When you go home to Montreal, sure.
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:39.720]   I mean, I always thought the mouties were tough going into Canada.
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:44.520]   But now, according to a new court ruling, when you come back in the United States, border
[01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:49.360]   agents can search your phone with absolutely no limit without probable cause.
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:50.360]   Oh, wow.
[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:54.000]   The US Appeals Court, this was actually overturned.
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:55:02.880]   I mean, this was actually prevented and Judge Sander Lynch has overturned an earlier ruling
[01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:07.480]   that customs and border protection agents can conduct in-depth searches of phones and
[01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:09.000]   laptops.
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:14.840]   That's both basic and quote advanced searches, which include reviewing and copying data from
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:17.840]   your device without a warrant.
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:19.920]   It's fully constitutional according to this judge.
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:22.480]   I don't know if I know.
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:24.160]   I don't know if this will be a appeal.
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:25.160]   It's a level, is that judge yet?
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:26.160]   No kidding.
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:29.760]   Well, is that the Canadian government or the US government?
[01:55:29.760 --> 01:55:30.760]   US government.
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:32.400]   It's always been bad going into Canada.
[01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:34.800]   The mouties are tough.
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:38.360]   But at least, well, you're a citizen now of the US.
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:39.360]   No.
[01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:40.960]   No, I'm a still citizen of Canada.
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:44.000]   So you probably it's a little easier for you.
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:45.000]   Or I don't know.
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:46.800]   I haven't seen my family in a year and a half because I remember.
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:47.800]   Yeah.
[01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:48.800]   I know.
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:49.800]   That must be awful.
[01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:50.800]   Yeah.
[01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:51.800]   You know.
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:57.320]   This, the ruling that overturned this said there's no, you don't have to have, you have
[01:55:57.320 --> 01:56:00.680]   to have reasonable suspicion.
[01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:01.840]   Lynch disagreed.
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:04.880]   And this is the quote that really pissed me off.
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:09.000]   The judge said, "Electronic device searches do not fit neatly into other categories of
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:10.640]   property searches.
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:16.560]   But the bottom line is basic border searches of electronic devices do not involve an intrusive
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:18.680]   search of a person."
[01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:19.680]   That's ridiculous.
[01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:21.680]   It's an invasion of privacy.
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:23.120]   You should have a lawyer like that sometimes.
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:24.640]   Everything's on your phone.
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:26.200]   Everything's on your phone.
[01:56:26.200 --> 01:56:27.200]   I mean, it's like them.
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:30.760]   And it's basically like being able to enter your house and rummage through every single
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:32.880]   thing in every closet, every drawer.
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:34.760]   No probable cause.
[01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:36.640]   Just I don't like how you look Lance.
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:37.640]   Yeah.
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:38.640]   And maybe you got something.
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:39.640]   Yeah.
[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:41.400]   I want to see what's on your phone buddy.
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:42.400]   Hand it over.
[01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:43.400]   Yeah.
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:44.400]   That's, that's incredible.
[01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:45.560]   And I don't think that's going to hold up.
[01:56:45.560 --> 01:56:49.880]   If that keeps making its way through the courts, that's going to get appealed and go all the
[01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:51.040]   way to the Supreme Court.
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:52.520]   It's not going to hold up.
[01:56:52.520 --> 01:56:54.360]   We shall see.
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:58.600]   The judge said, you know, Congress should establish clearer rules.
[01:56:58.600 --> 01:57:01.400]   Congress could say there is more protection.
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:04.760]   But she says, "The Constitution does not."
[01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:10.720]   ACLU said, "Warnless and suspicionless electronic device searches can give border officers unfettered
[01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:14.840]   access to vast amounts of private information about our lives.
[01:57:14.840 --> 01:57:19.640]   We're disappointed with the ruling and evaluating all options to ensure we don't lose our privacy
[01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:20.640]   rights when we travel."
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:28.040]   So I presume that sounds like the ACLU might want to pursue this.
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:31.120]   It was an EFF and an ACLU lawsuit.
[01:57:31.120 --> 01:57:32.120]   So yeah, you know what?
[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:33.560]   They're going to appeal it.
[01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:35.320]   They got to appeal it.
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:38.320]   Not that I have any confidence the Supreme Court will understand how smartphones work
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:44.320]   any better than anybody.
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:45.320]   There is some good news.
[01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:46.520]   I'll give you some of the good news.
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:48.000]   You saw it on the promo.
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:55.120]   The president has ordered a broad supply chain review to address chip shortages.
[01:57:55.120 --> 01:58:01.240]   The aim is eventually to increase domestic production of these chips, which I think everybody
[01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:05.160]   would support.
[01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:09.440]   I don't know if there's anything to do in the short term.
[01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:11.400]   It's hard to build these factories.
[01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:16.400]   It takes years.
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:17.400]   It takes years.
[01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:19.400]   It takes training of the workforce.
[01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:21.400]   It also, how are we competitive?
[01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:27.840]   Foxconn and these companies that have employees that they pay so little.
[01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:31.040]   That's the thing that really we have to be competitive to do this.
[01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:32.720]   So they got to figure that out.
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:38.160]   I think probably that's the point of this is, look, this isn't going to happen overnight,
[01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:40.720]   but it's clear now because of this shortage.
[01:58:40.720 --> 01:58:44.920]   This is a prop Ford had to cut production of the F-150 pickup.
[01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:50.560]   General Motors has shut down some North American plants into next month because the car makers
[01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:55.160]   can't get the chips.
[01:58:55.160 --> 01:58:57.960]   Maybe you can't fix it today, but you got to start sometime.
[01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:00.120]   Now's the time.
[01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:06.600]   Incent companies to build fabs in the United States, the intel is about ready, I suspect,
[01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:13.120]   to close down its fabs in Oregon and start outsourcing fabs.
[01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:16.680]   We got to do something about that.
[01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:21.960]   California can finally enforce its net neutrality law.
[01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:24.640]   You remember when the FCC overturned net neutrality?
[01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:27.400]   That was a couple of years ago.
[01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:37.320]   The state of California in 2017 passed a law to restore net neutrality.
[01:59:37.320 --> 01:59:45.000]   The Department of Justice under Trump sued the telecom industry sued, but the DOJ under
[01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:50.000]   Biden has dropped that suit and the Judge John Mendez declined to grant the telecom
[01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.760]   industry a preliminary injunction.
[01:59:52.760 --> 01:59:55.040]   So the law can go into effect now.
[01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:56.120]   There'll still be a trial.
[01:59:56.120 --> 01:59:57.360]   It's not over.
[01:59:57.360 --> 02:00:05.200]   But at least for now, net neutrality survives in the great state of California.
[02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:10.480]   Current temporary interim chair of the FCC, Jessica Rosenworzel, tweeted, "When the FCC
[02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:15.200]   over my objection rolled back net neutrality policies, states like California sought to
[02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:19.080]   fill the void with their own laws tonight, a court in California decided the state law
[02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:20.920]   can go into effect.
[02:00:20.920 --> 02:00:22.560]   This is big news for open internet.
[02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:27.160]   But the big news is that the chairman of the FCC is supporting it is fantastic."
[02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:28.360]   All right.
[02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:34.880]   Let's take a quick break and then I want to talk about non-fungible tokens with our
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:38.120]   brilliant team of panelists.
[02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:43.240]   Lance Ulanoff, great to have you, lanceulinoff.com, U-L-A-N-O-F-F.
[02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:45.120]   He's also Lance Ulanoff on the Twitter.
[02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:48.880]   And I'm sure if anything exciting is coming up, you will tweet about it.
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:51.560]   You will let us know via the Twitter.
[02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:54.240]   That's Shira Lazar, peaceinside.live.
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:01:00.600]   If you ever get a chance to have a yogasmic experience with Shira, I strongly encourage
[02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:01.600]   it.
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:02.600]   Actually, that was really fun.
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:06.640]   It was a Valentine's Day Zoom yoga class.
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:08.480]   I'd never done a Zoom yoga class.
[02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:10.320]   It worked pretty well.
[02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:11.320]   Peaceinside.live.
[02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:12.320]   And you're going to do some work.
[02:01:12.320 --> 02:01:13.320]   Yeah, it was so fun.
[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:17.160]   It was really, really wonderful.
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:18.720]   There's little windows.
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:23.360]   And I could have gone big on the instructor, but at least I wanted to see the other couples.
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:25.600]   And everybody was so cute.
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:26.600]   Everybody was so in love.
[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:27.600]   It was really sweet.
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:29.560]   Good to know you were watching all of us.
[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:30.720]   Yeah, we were watching.
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:32.120]   Were you not watching?
[02:01:32.120 --> 02:01:33.600]   Did you just go full on the instructor?
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:34.600]   Yeah, we just got lost.
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:37.040]   Yeah, we put her full frame on my laptop.
[02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:38.200]   Yeah, that was smart.
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:40.680]   And then we were just doing our own thing.
[02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:42.360]   Yeah, I could tell.
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:43.840]   It was fun to watch.
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:45.760]   No, no, I'm just kidding.
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:46.760]   There was one woman who said...
[02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:47.760]   I don't care.
[02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:48.760]   Hey, Jolo.
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:50.800]   It was one woman who came in there and said, "You're recording this?
[02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:51.800]   I'm out of here."
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:52.800]   She left.
[02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:53.800]   Oh, yeah, they got...
[02:01:53.800 --> 02:01:55.840]   Well, we ended up stopping to record because, you know, they were recording for themselves
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:56.840]   for their own internals.
[02:01:56.840 --> 02:01:57.840]   Yeah, not me.
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:01:59.480]   They weren't recording you or me.
[02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:00.480]   They were anybody.
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:01.480]   Yeah, I was a mean.
[02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:04.360]   They were just recording themselves, their own image, which was fine with me.
[02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:05.560]   I don't care.
[02:02:05.560 --> 02:02:07.560]   Anyway, it was really fun.
[02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:08.560]   Peaceinside.
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:09.560]   Live.
[02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:10.560]   That's not the only thing they do.
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:16.200]   They have lots of helpful virtual wellness in this tough time for all of us.
[02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:20.280]   I'm so glad you created that among all the other wonderful things you do.
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:25.480]   And of course, from Engadget senior editor, Devendra Hardowar, don't forget he's got that
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:29.240]   great film podcast, slash film.
[02:02:29.240 --> 02:02:31.440]   Yes, slash filmcast.
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:32.600]   Slash filmcast.
[02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:37.240]   What is the latest?
[02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:38.840]   Anything interesting going on?
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:39.840]   What are you talking about?
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:40.840]   Good question.
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:41.840]   You don't know.
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:43.840]   Well, we just reviewed Nomad Land, which is...
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:44.840]   Oh, God, I love that.
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:45.840]   Oh, my God, I saw that.
[02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:46.840]   Fantastic film.
[02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:47.920]   Oh, my God, I love that.
[02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:48.920]   What did you think, Shira?
[02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:49.920]   Did you not like it?
[02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:51.240]   I know I liked it.
[02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:53.440]   I found it really relevant and fascinating.
[02:02:53.440 --> 02:02:56.560]   I'll be honest, we fell asleep at the end the last 10 minutes.
[02:02:56.560 --> 02:02:57.560]   You didn't miss anything.
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:03:00.360]   I can't say you could stay off her whole movie this day.
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:01.360]   No spoilers.
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:02.360]   But I was impressed.
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:03.360]   Frances and Dorman is amazing.
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:04.360]   She's wonderful.
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:06.360]   Touch is on the state of where we're at here.
[02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:12.080]   Well, in fact, I almost referenced it earlier when we were talking about people working so
[02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:17.160]   hard to make ends meet, the movie was based on an article in Harper's Magazine many years
[02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:22.960]   ago, I think 2011, about how many retirees had so little retirement funds and Social
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:25.200]   Security was so low, they had to keep working.
[02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:27.600]   They never ending retirement.
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:33.600]   That was the basis for a book, which then became the film with Frances McDormand.
[02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:38.240]   It's a funny film because you can't really say there's a plot, but it's so moving and
[02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:39.240]   beautiful.
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:40.240]   It's really about people.
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:41.240]   It's just wonderful.
[02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:42.240]   Yeah.
[02:03:42.240 --> 02:03:46.120]   It's kind of they call it like a tone poem or something, but it is really about how America
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:49.160]   is broken and capitalism is destroying us all.
[02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:50.160]   Yeah.
[02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:51.160]   That's it.
[02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:52.160]   That's the movie and everybody should see it.
[02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:53.160]   Wow.
[02:03:53.160 --> 02:03:54.160]   Now that I know that, I don't want to watch it.
[02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:55.160]   Yeah.
[02:03:55.160 --> 02:03:56.160]   I love it.
[02:03:56.160 --> 02:03:57.160]   I loved it.
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:03:58.160]   I loved it.
[02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:01.440]   That's the latest episode 607.
[02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:05.920]   The slash film cast highly recommended.
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:08.040]   Our show today brought to you by Ryan Reynolds.
[02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:11.280]   Mint Mobile is my favorite.
[02:04:11.280 --> 02:04:14.120]   It's called an MVNO, mobile virtual network operator.
[02:04:14.120 --> 02:04:21.160]   So you know the big guys, T-Mobile and Sprint, I guess, together for Rise and AT&T, Devender
[02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:23.560]   is Boss.
[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:30.840]   Those guys, they float along charging 80, 90, 100 bucks a month for data plus phone calls
[02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:32.720]   plus text.
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:34.320]   Along comes this little guy Mint Mobile.
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:40.680]   In those stores, Ryan Reynolds probably plunging a lot of his fortune into that.
[02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:47.360]   They offer premium wireless, not 80, 90 bucks a month, $15 a month, $15.
[02:04:47.360 --> 02:04:52.760]   That's unlimited talk, unlimited text and high speed data.
[02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:55.360]   And it's on the nation's largest 5G network.
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:56.640]   It's a T-Mobile.
[02:04:56.640 --> 02:05:02.640]   So if you've got good T-Mobile service, you're going to get the same service for a fraction
[02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:04.120]   of the price.
[02:05:04.120 --> 02:05:05.120]   It's just amazing.
[02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:06.120]   I loved it so much.
[02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:11.760]   I did the $15 deal and they said, "I want the unlimited deal, 30 bucks a month."
[02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:14.400]   That's amazing.
[02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:18.480]   For 300 bucks, I paid a year ahead of time, which is 25 bucks a month.
[02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:19.720]   I got 12 gigabytes.
[02:05:19.720 --> 02:05:22.080]   That's effectively unlimited for me.
[02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:27.040]   And always unlimited talk and text on a great 5G network.
[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:28.960]   You can bring your own phone and they'll send you the SIM.
[02:05:28.960 --> 02:05:30.560]   There's no charge for the SIM.
[02:05:30.560 --> 02:05:33.840]   You can put your number over and it's painless.
[02:05:33.840 --> 02:05:34.840]   They actually sell phones.
[02:05:34.840 --> 02:05:37.400]   I got an iPhone SE, very inexpensive.
[02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:40.080]   It was 15 bucks a month plus the 15 bucks a month.
[02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:42.200]   For 30 bucks a month, you get a phone and coverage.
[02:05:42.200 --> 02:05:43.200]   It's incredible.
[02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:45.280]   Mint mobile.
[02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:47.560]   Switch now and you'll get premium wireless service.
[02:05:47.560 --> 02:05:52.320]   And of course, if you get it and it doesn't work or whatever in your neighborhood, you're
[02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:54.600]   always covered with their seven day money back guarantee.
[02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:56.080]   So there's no risk.
[02:05:56.080 --> 02:06:00.520]   To get your new wireless plan, just $15 a month and get the plan shipped to your door
[02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:03.120]   free, mintmobile.com/twit.
[02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:05.560]   Mintmobile.com/twit.
[02:06:05.560 --> 02:06:12.120]   Cut your wireless bill to as low as $15 a month.
[02:06:12.120 --> 02:06:15.320]   Mintmobile.com/twit.
[02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:17.080]   You're going to love Mint Mobile.
[02:06:17.080 --> 02:06:18.560]   Great service at a great price.
[02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:22.080]   I don't know why anybody would pay more.
[02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:24.880]   Plus Ryan Reynolds.
[02:06:24.880 --> 02:06:26.040]   I love this story.
[02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:27.040]   Mississippi.
[02:06:27.040 --> 02:06:30.080]   Gulfport and Biloxi.
[02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:35.600]   You don't hear a lot of great stories about the internet in this country.
[02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:39.520]   When the COVID relief package came out in March, the state of Mississippi decided to
[02:06:39.520 --> 02:06:47.000]   dedicate about $150 million of it to improving broadband, especially in poorly served rural
[02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:51.400]   areas of Mississippi like Gulfport and Biloxi.
[02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:52.680]   But they said there's a catch.
[02:06:52.680 --> 02:06:53.680]   You can get the money.
[02:06:53.680 --> 02:06:57.200]   You have to match it to these internet service providers.
[02:06:57.200 --> 02:07:00.440]   And you have to roll it out by the end of 2020.
[02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:01.440]   They did.
[02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:05.920]   We're getting -- people are getting going from 10 megabits to 300 megabits.
[02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:12.000]   It's just a great story and it shows what you can do.
[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:16.600]   I really believe municipal Wi-Fi and government run Wi-Fi is probably the best way to go,
[02:07:16.600 --> 02:07:18.280]   but the telecoms hate that.
[02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:21.320]   So maybe this is the next biggest, best thing.
[02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:22.680]   Good going, Mississippi.
[02:07:22.680 --> 02:07:23.680]   Well done.
[02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:29.160]   FCC has approved a $50 high-speed internet subsidy.
[02:07:29.160 --> 02:07:34.720]   So if you have a low-income household -- and as you know, this is a big problem during
[02:07:34.720 --> 02:07:37.320]   the pandemic because the kids need to zoom.
[02:07:37.320 --> 02:07:39.800]   You need to zoom if you've got a job.
[02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:45.200]   So the Federal Communications Commission, thank you, Jessica Worsen, Rosenworsel, approved
[02:07:45.200 --> 02:07:50.640]   a $50 a month to low-income households up to $75 a month to Native American households
[02:07:50.640 --> 02:07:52.920]   for broadband service.
[02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:55.640]   So a couple of good stories about the internet.
[02:07:55.640 --> 02:07:58.080]   Starting to see the internet as a human right.
[02:07:58.080 --> 02:07:59.080]   It is.
[02:07:59.080 --> 02:08:00.080]   Yup.
[02:08:00.080 --> 02:08:02.040]   So crying out loud.
[02:08:02.040 --> 02:08:14.200]   And now you can go to NBA top stars and buy some non-fungible tokens or maybe some crypto
[02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:15.200]   kitties.
[02:08:15.200 --> 02:08:18.160]   Going from a good area, sorry to a bad one.
[02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:21.440]   This is what you're going to do with all your bandwidth.
[02:08:21.440 --> 02:08:22.720]   You guys have to explain this to me.
[02:08:22.720 --> 02:08:27.320]   I see a lot of groups on clubhouse talking about NFTs.
[02:08:27.320 --> 02:08:28.320]   Yes.
[02:08:28.320 --> 02:08:30.280]   My first fungible tokens.
[02:08:30.280 --> 02:08:31.720]   Non-fungible tokens.
[02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:32.720]   What is that, Lance?
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:33.720]   What is that?
[02:08:33.720 --> 02:08:39.520]   I mean, this is the idea of a, you know, identifying -- so I've heard it talked about
[02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:41.680]   in the area of art.
[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:46.400]   Like you can identify, like you connect the token to a piece of art and then it's basically
[02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:52.960]   it can't be, you know, counterfeited, you have a clear idea of ownership.
[02:08:52.960 --> 02:08:57.840]   Because blockchain, the magic of blockchain.
[02:08:57.840 --> 02:09:01.960]   And this is not, you know, I've seen this with collectibles.
[02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:07.760]   Do you know who one of the people who got in on this early, William Shatner with a
[02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:08.960]   material?
[02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:10.960]   What is material?
[02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:16.720]   William is another sort of cryptocurrency and the way in which when he has all of this
[02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:21.320]   stuff that he sells, he is like paraphernalia from his massive career.
[02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:23.400]   But it's real tangible goods, right?
[02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:24.400]   You're getting a viola.
[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:25.400]   But it's tangible goods.
[02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:30.400]   But the key is how do you verify the authenticity of these things?
[02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:31.400]   Big problem.
[02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:32.400]   That's why.
[02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:34.840]   It's a big problem in autographs and baseball and sport memorabilia.
[02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:35.840]   Yes.
[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:39.040]   Because you don't know, is that really, you know, Mookiee, Wilson's signature?
[02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:40.040]   I don't know.
[02:09:40.040 --> 02:09:41.640]   How many times do you look on?
[02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:42.800]   Well, you're not on Twitter as much.
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:46.240]   But if you're on Twitter, you'll see people asking, for example, Mark Hamill, is this
[02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:47.760]   autograph thing that I got?
[02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:48.760]   Is this real?
[02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:52.200]   And nine times I think he's like, nope, I never signed that thing.
[02:09:52.200 --> 02:09:53.200]   He knows, of course.
[02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:54.200]   Wow.
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:55.200]   Yeah.
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:09:56.200]   Mark to authenticate.
[02:09:56.200 --> 02:09:57.200]   That's a good idea.
[02:09:57.200 --> 02:10:01.840]   Unless he probably signed a lot of them, you know, all the time, he might not know everything
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:02.840]   he signed.
[02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:03.840]   True.
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:06.240]   Yeah, but it's usually connected to some like item.
[02:10:06.240 --> 02:10:07.240]   Yeah.
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:08.240]   I didn't sign that poster.
[02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:09.240]   I wasn't even in that movie.
[02:10:09.240 --> 02:10:10.240]   Right.
[02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:11.240]   Yeah.
[02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:12.240]   Yeah.
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:13.640]   I remember when my kid was little, we went to spring training.
[02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:14.640]   I love spring.
[02:10:14.640 --> 02:10:15.640]   Used to love it.
[02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:16.640]   I guess it's a big thing now.
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:18.440]   But in the old days, it was quiet.
[02:10:18.440 --> 02:10:20.800]   It was Conway was down in Arizona.
[02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:22.880]   Scottsdale watched the Giants.
[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:24.800]   And Barry Bonds was a giant star.
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:25.800]   And it was so much fun.
[02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:28.120]   And Henry was about eight or nine.
[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:29.120]   Ran down.
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:32.920]   He got a baseball, ran down, got an autograph, ran down, got an autograph.
[02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:33.920]   We get on the plane.
[02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:34.920]   He says, look at this.
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:37.880]   And it was signed three times by it looked like Barry Bonds.
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:41.480]   B, B, I thought you got you.
[02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:44.240]   He said, I just kept going back to him and he kept signing it.
[02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:45.800]   So that's awesome.
[02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:47.400]   And I'm showing it around other people on the plane.
[02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:48.400]   The guy looks at us.
[02:10:48.400 --> 02:10:49.400]   It's not Barry Bonds.
[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:50.400]   That's Boof Bonds.
[02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:55.880]   By the way, never did get called up.
[02:10:55.880 --> 02:10:56.880]   But we have a baseball.
[02:10:56.880 --> 02:10:59.400]   Anybody wants it with three Boof Bonds or autographs.
[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:00.400]   Oh my God.
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:02.240]   Look, just like Barry Bonds.
[02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:03.240]   Boof, you got to change.
[02:11:03.240 --> 02:11:04.240]   You got to do something.
[02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:06.680]   You got to put a zer in there or something.
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:09.640]   So that's the problem, authentication.
[02:11:09.640 --> 02:11:15.920]   This does is, but NFTs is not even material goods.
[02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:17.080]   It's mind blowing.
[02:11:17.080 --> 02:11:19.040]   It is like a neon cat, right?
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:22.280]   The rainbow cat sold for $580,000.
[02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:25.000]   But you don't get a real neon cat.
[02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:26.000]   You don't get it.
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:27.000]   You own the real one.
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:28.280]   You can't hang it on your wall.
[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:30.280]   It's a digital good.
[02:11:30.280 --> 02:11:36.040]   So number one of these is selling NBA highlights.
[02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:37.360]   NBA tops shot.
[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:38.360]   I said it wrong.
[02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:39.360]   Top shot.
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:46.040]   $217 million in sales in the last 30 days.
[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:48.520]   Can you then license that thing then?
[02:11:48.520 --> 02:11:53.760]   So if you own it, like if anyone ever wants to play that or view it inside, I think it's
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:54.760]   a damn.
[02:11:54.760 --> 02:11:56.280]   No, there's no revenue opportunity.
[02:11:56.280 --> 02:11:57.360]   You just own it.
[02:11:57.360 --> 02:11:59.400]   Well, that just seems stupid.
[02:11:59.400 --> 02:12:00.400]   Sorry.
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:03.840]   Well, you're wrong to the $270 million.
[02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:06.440]   In one month.
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:07.440]   Wow.
[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:12.920]   It's like, let's create the artificial scarcity of the diamond industry, but at scale digitally.
[02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:14.240]   Let's just make it happen.
[02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:15.240]   Yeah.
[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:16.240]   Yeah.
[02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:17.240]   Yes.
[02:12:17.240 --> 02:12:20.080]   I guess if you own an NBA high, somebody's got to explain this to me.
[02:12:20.080 --> 02:12:24.840]   If you own an NBA highlight, you are the only owner of that highlight.
[02:12:24.840 --> 02:12:25.840]   What does that even mean?
[02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:26.840]   I don't know what that means.
[02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:27.840]   It just makes sense.
[02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:28.840]   It's a good question.
[02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:29.840]   It's a good question.
[02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:30.840]   Working on a bunch of people own it.
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:33.360]   So each, like a bunch of people have ownership of it.
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:34.360]   No, no, no.
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:36.680]   Well, I guess you could make a syndicate.
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:42.920]   But so this highlight on the front page got sold for $779.
[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:43.840]   You own the moment.
[02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:45.440]   You own the moment.
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:49.360]   But the only reason this is worth anything is because you think someday somebody's going
[02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:52.160]   to give you $799 for it.
[02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:53.160]   Yeah.
[02:12:53.160 --> 02:12:55.520]   You're banging on the kitchen hold.
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:57.120]   For something you can't hold.
[02:12:57.120 --> 02:13:01.880]   That's the idea with CryptoKitties was you bought these cartoon cats and some of them
[02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:02.880]   are rarer than others.
[02:13:02.880 --> 02:13:05.040]   They would breed so you could create new cats.
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:10.400]   I don't think you can create new NBA highlights.
[02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:12.600]   It's what a world.
[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:13.600]   What a world.
[02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:18.520]   Well, if we live in virtual worlds, one of those things that we own and those spaces
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:20.600]   be brought into that space.
[02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:23.600]   Oh, like as part of our virtual ownership.
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:24.600]   So we--
[02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:26.880]   It is a lot of clouding of everything.
[02:13:26.880 --> 02:13:27.880]   Yeah.
[02:13:27.880 --> 02:13:29.120]   Are we recreating second life?
[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:30.880]   I mean, what are we doing?
[02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:31.880]   I don't know.
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:32.880]   What are we doing?
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:35.960]   That is the motto of the 21st century.
[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:38.000]   What the hell are we doing?
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:43.160]   I'm sorry to say a real tangible good fries, which probably a lot of our listeners are
[02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:44.880]   not as familiar with fries.
[02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:50.600]   But in California and Texas and Georgia fries was the electronics store.
[02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:52.200]   Do you ever go to a fries?
[02:13:52.200 --> 02:13:53.200]   You know what fries is--
[02:13:53.200 --> 02:13:54.200]   I've never went to fries.
[02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:56.040]   I didn't know there was a fries in Georgia until--
[02:13:56.040 --> 02:13:57.040]   Aww.
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:13:58.040]   --thing this thing happened.
[02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:00.320]   But I grew up in New England always wanting to go to fries.
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:01.320]   So you knew about it.
[02:14:01.320 --> 02:14:02.320]   It was legend.
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:03.320]   I knew about it.
[02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:04.320]   Yeah.
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:05.320]   So fries is joining--
[02:14:05.320 --> 02:14:06.320]   Because of the U.K.
[02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:07.320]   California nerds, that's why.
[02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:13.760]   Joining Circuit City, joining Radio Shack in the great tech store in the sky after 36 years
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:18.080]   in business, it was really-- the Silicon Valley, fries in Sunnyvale.
[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:22.320]   I spent a lot of time haunting those aisles as did probably every geek in Silicon Valley.
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:25.680]   I mean, it was just really a fun place to visit.
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:32.000]   But between the pandemic and Newegg and Amazon, there's really not a lot of room for a brick
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:33.000]   and mortar.
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:34.000]   They hadn't been doing it for a while, right?
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:35.000]   No.
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.920]   Like people with post photos of just almost empty stores for years.
[02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:38.920]   Yeah.
[02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:39.920]   Yeah.
[02:14:39.920 --> 02:14:40.920]   They hung on as long as they could.
[02:14:40.920 --> 02:14:42.920]   But I think the pandemic was the last day on the coffin.
[02:14:42.920 --> 02:14:47.640]   But honestly, it was-- how can you-- you know, you're not going to make money selling computer
[02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:52.480]   parts and hard drives in a giant-- these were former grocery stores.
[02:14:52.480 --> 02:14:53.480]   They were giant.
[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:54.480]   They're huge.
[02:14:54.480 --> 02:14:55.480]   Yeah, they're nobody.
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:14:56.640]   Microcenter's still around.
[02:14:56.640 --> 02:14:58.960]   Like I have a microcenter in 10 minutes from me.
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:14:59.960]   And it's doing really well.
[02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:00.960]   Wow.
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:01.960]   Is it doing well?
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:02.960]   Yeah.
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:03.960]   I don't know.
[02:15:03.960 --> 02:15:04.960]   We have one in our area too.
[02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:05.960]   Yeah.
[02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:06.960]   I haven't been there in ages.
[02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:07.960]   Wow.
[02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:08.960]   It's very strange.
[02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:09.960]   That's cool.
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:12.600]   Well, I always-- another physical thing that died this week, Leo.
[02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:14.040]   Did you see SinFX Magazine?
[02:15:14.040 --> 02:15:15.040]   Oh, yeah.
[02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:16.040]   I heard that.
[02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:17.280]   Amazing magazine.
[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:18.280]   Dawn.
[02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:22.520]   172 issues.
[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:26.840]   Was it for-- it was for the film "Buff" or "The Thing"?
[02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:28.560]   It was for the public.
[02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:29.560]   It was for both, I think.
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:34.000]   And it was one of those trade journals that was sold on newsstands, right?
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:37.920]   When I used to go to borders or Barnes & Noble and sit in the cafe, it would be right there
[02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:38.920]   next to entertainment weekly.
[02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:39.920]   And you could pick it up.
[02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:43.520]   It's a huge thing with huge interviews.
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:46.480]   It was so unique and so sad to see it go.
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:49.000]   My magazines have a tough time surviving.
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:50.200]   Do you remember "Premier" back?
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:51.200]   Oh, yeah.
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:52.200]   I love "Premier."
[02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:53.920]   This is beautiful, though.
[02:15:53.920 --> 02:15:56.080]   Look at how beautifully produced it is.
[02:15:56.080 --> 02:16:01.800]   Obviously, that's part of the problem is it was a $15 magazine.
[02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:05.480]   Produced by monthly, so not even like a pure film buff.
[02:16:05.480 --> 02:16:06.480]   Holy cow.
[02:16:06.480 --> 02:16:07.480]   Holy cow.
[02:16:07.480 --> 02:16:08.480]   So sad.
[02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:12.200]   Well, we always do the obituaries at the end of the show.
[02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:16.400]   The good news is nobody died that I know of anyway.
[02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:19.560]   No geeks, no big tech people died.
[02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:25.040]   But there were a few businesses that said so long.
[02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:29.720]   Now we have to say so long to you are a steamed panel, always so much fun.
[02:16:29.720 --> 02:16:31.720]   To vendor Hardewar, thank you so much.
[02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:33.640]   How's the baby sleeping?
[02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:35.120]   She is doing well.
[02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:39.240]   She, I mean, she woke up at 6 a.m. this morning and didn't nap.
[02:16:39.240 --> 02:16:43.000]   So my wife has had to fight her to sleep while I'm on the show.
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.680]   So I hope she succeeded, you know?
[02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:48.600]   Well, I don't know.
[02:16:48.600 --> 02:16:49.800]   It's not the middle of the night or anything.
[02:16:49.800 --> 02:16:51.640]   It's only 8 o'clock, right?
[02:16:51.640 --> 02:16:55.200]   It's only 8 o'clock, but she should have been sleeping.
[02:16:55.200 --> 02:17:00.040]   So yeah, having kids is great, but oh man, does it take all your energy, especially
[02:17:00.040 --> 02:17:01.040]   during a pandemic?
[02:17:01.040 --> 02:17:02.040]   I bet it does.
[02:17:02.040 --> 02:17:03.040]   At least she's not in school.
[02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:06.920]   You know, I really feel for his people with kids in kindergarten through 8th grade.
[02:17:06.920 --> 02:17:07.920]   It's just tough.
[02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:13.840]   Our son who's a senior in high school, but he's been going, he's been doing online schooling
[02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:14.840]   for a couple of years.
[02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:17.560]   So he's pretty comfortable with it.
[02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:21.320]   They just said, Petaloma Schools April 13th.
[02:17:21.320 --> 02:17:23.360]   And he says, I don't want to go.
[02:17:23.360 --> 02:17:25.800]   I don't want to go.
[02:17:25.800 --> 02:17:27.560]   I don't want to go.
[02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:28.560]   I don't want to go.
[02:17:28.560 --> 02:17:30.360]   I said, Michael, you can, you can walk.
[02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:31.460]   You're going to have a graduation.
[02:17:31.460 --> 02:17:32.460]   You can order.
[02:17:32.460 --> 02:17:34.920]   They're actually saying time to order your cap and gown.
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:40.600]   That's to me such a relief because I thought he wasn't going to get to walk.
[02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:43.240]   So he says, no, I don't care.
[02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:46.360]   Kids today, I tell you.
[02:17:46.360 --> 02:17:49.960]   I tell you, speaking of kids, Cheryl is our.
[02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:50.960]   Oh, yeah.
[02:17:50.960 --> 02:17:51.960]   I'm a child at heart.
[02:17:51.960 --> 02:17:54.920]   A useful, useful person.
[02:17:54.920 --> 02:17:56.920]   It's so lovely to have you on.
[02:17:56.920 --> 02:17:57.920]   Always is.
[02:17:57.920 --> 02:18:00.080]   I hope you do another yogasmic experience next week.
[02:18:00.080 --> 02:18:01.080]   I will.
[02:18:01.080 --> 02:18:02.080]   Yeah, you keep mentioning it.
[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:03.080]   I do.
[02:18:03.080 --> 02:18:04.080]   Well, I was good.
[02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:05.080]   It was good.
[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:06.080]   First, some people will get a good group together.
[02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:07.080]   Yeah.
[02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:08.080]   Yeah.
[02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:09.080]   And well, you know what?
[02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:11.000]   We should give you a plug on the Twitter so you can get, you know, thousands of people
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:12.000]   in there.
[02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:13.000]   Yeah.
[02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.440]   If they can join you and you'll get a big experience, we did being intrigued definitely.
[02:18:15.440 --> 02:18:16.440]   No, I have to do it.
[02:18:16.440 --> 02:18:21.760]   When I have an event coming up or retreat, we'll jump on here and promise not to wear
[02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:22.760]   yoga pants.
[02:18:22.760 --> 02:18:23.760]   How about that?
[02:18:23.760 --> 02:18:24.760]   That'll help.
[02:18:24.760 --> 02:18:25.760]   Whatever works.
[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:26.760]   Peace inside live.
[02:18:26.760 --> 02:18:27.760]   What else you want to plug?
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:28.760]   You're still doing what's trending.
[02:18:28.760 --> 02:18:29.760]   I love that.
[02:18:29.760 --> 02:18:35.280]   Yeah, which trending.com, youtube.com/what's trending for all your latest social media trend,
[02:18:35.280 --> 02:18:38.720]   digital culture news, viral videos, so on and so forth.
[02:18:38.720 --> 02:18:42.200]   And then I have a radio show on channel Q. We are channel Q.com.
[02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:43.760]   You do that every day.
[02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:45.480]   Yeah, weekdays.
[02:18:45.480 --> 02:18:50.160]   So it's, we catch you up on current events, pop culture, social issues.
[02:18:50.160 --> 02:18:53.280]   Do you have a traffic reporter like the, the eye in the sky?
[02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:56.280]   Oh, we're like, you're going to go four or five right now.
[02:18:56.280 --> 02:18:58.280]   Are you, I can be the fake traffic reporter.
[02:18:58.280 --> 02:18:59.280]   We're across the country.
[02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:00.280]   Oh, you're national.
[02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:01.280]   Yeah.
[02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:02.280]   Yeah.
[02:19:02.280 --> 02:19:03.280]   Yeah.
[02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:05.360]   Somebody in the chat was saying again with the yoga pants.
[02:19:05.360 --> 02:19:06.560]   What is it with yoga?
[02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:07.560]   I'm sorry.
[02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:08.560]   I said anything.
[02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:09.560]   I apologize.
[02:19:09.560 --> 02:19:10.560]   It's worse than profanity.
[02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:11.560]   Thank you, sure.
[02:19:11.560 --> 02:19:12.560]   It's great to have you.
[02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:13.560]   Of course, Lance.
[02:19:13.560 --> 02:19:15.200]   Lovely Italian Lance, you're a little off.
[02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:16.440]   I haven't seen you in so long.
[02:19:16.440 --> 02:19:17.680]   It's so good to see you again.
[02:19:17.680 --> 02:19:18.840]   I'm glad things are going well.
[02:19:18.840 --> 02:19:22.160]   I'm still glad your Tamogotchi is still alive.
[02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:23.800]   More or less.
[02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:24.800]   More or less.
[02:19:24.800 --> 02:19:26.240]   How did you get a Pokemon in there?
[02:19:26.240 --> 02:19:27.240]   I want to find out more.
[02:19:27.240 --> 02:19:28.720]   It's hard to, it's what the kids.
[02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:29.720]   We got them to the kids.
[02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:34.800]   But the kids, by the way, I was going to say the Devindra, you know, as a parent of adult
[02:19:34.800 --> 02:19:41.160]   children now, whatever their sleeping habits are when their babies get used to it.
[02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:43.040]   That's their sleeping habits for life.
[02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:44.040]   Oh, wow.
[02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:47.680]   I thought you were going to say it's going to reverse when they're teenage or something.
[02:19:47.680 --> 02:19:48.680]   No, no.
[02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:49.680]   There's everything.
[02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:54.000]   I mean, more broadly, the personality that you're looking at right now.
[02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:59.440]   That's the bizarist thing ever because you think you have some influence on your kids.
[02:19:59.440 --> 02:20:01.840]   But they come out fully baked.
[02:20:01.840 --> 02:20:02.920]   They are the way.
[02:20:02.920 --> 02:20:04.680]   And it's so funny to watch the cotton.
[02:20:04.680 --> 02:20:07.040]   I agree with you because my kids are grown too.
[02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:09.040]   The continuity is fascinating.
[02:20:09.040 --> 02:20:10.040]   Oh, yeah.
[02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:15.040]   Oh, yeah, it's Jennifer L. Talk about our daughter and we'll go, yeah, remember when she did
[02:20:15.040 --> 02:20:16.040]   that?
[02:20:16.040 --> 02:20:17.040]   She's still doing that.
[02:20:17.040 --> 02:20:18.040]   That's so interesting.
[02:20:18.040 --> 02:20:20.960]   Do you want to put things into perspective with yourself?
[02:20:20.960 --> 02:20:24.040]   Like how maybe you just have always had those behaviors?
[02:20:24.040 --> 02:20:27.960]   Well, the best thing about kids is talk about self perspective.
[02:20:27.960 --> 02:20:29.600]   They tell you the truth.
[02:20:29.600 --> 02:20:32.200]   You immediately know what a jerk you are.
[02:20:32.200 --> 02:20:33.200]   I'm scared.
[02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:36.560]   Oh, they threw it right back at you.
[02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:37.960]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[02:20:37.960 --> 02:20:42.840]   Oh, you know, I never got better.
[02:20:42.840 --> 02:20:48.320]   But I remember when I first got a blackberry, how upset they get off your blackberry dad,
[02:20:48.320 --> 02:20:49.320]   get off it.
[02:20:49.320 --> 02:20:50.320]   They're like eight or nine.
[02:20:50.320 --> 02:20:51.320]   Get off the blackberry.
[02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:53.400]   No, but I got to get off it.
[02:20:53.400 --> 02:20:54.400]   They were so mean.
[02:20:54.400 --> 02:20:56.840]   And now, of course, it all comes round.
[02:20:56.840 --> 02:20:57.840]   I'm at dinner with them.
[02:20:57.840 --> 02:20:59.280]   I said, get off the Instagram.
[02:20:59.280 --> 02:21:00.280]   Stop snap chatting.
[02:21:00.280 --> 02:21:01.280]   What are you doing?
[02:21:01.280 --> 02:21:05.040]   It's like it's like it's like a Harry Chapin song.
[02:21:05.040 --> 02:21:07.920]   It all comes rushing back.
[02:21:07.920 --> 02:21:10.720]   How old are your kids, Lance?
[02:21:10.720 --> 02:21:12.560]   26 and 22.
[02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:15.640]   It's minor 26 and 28, almost 29.
[02:21:15.640 --> 02:21:17.840]   It should be 29 in a month.
[02:21:17.840 --> 02:21:18.840]   Yeah, sure adults.
[02:21:18.840 --> 02:21:19.840]   Sure knows Abby.
[02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:20.840]   We had.
[02:21:20.840 --> 02:21:21.840]   Yes, we got from way back.
[02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:22.840]   Way back.
[02:21:22.840 --> 02:21:24.840]   Way from the good old days.
[02:21:24.840 --> 02:21:26.840]   Oh, yeah.
[02:21:26.840 --> 02:21:29.440]   You get all days.
[02:21:29.440 --> 02:21:32.800]   I had hair when I first had kids.
[02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:33.800]   Wow.
[02:21:33.800 --> 02:21:34.800]   Did they?
[02:21:34.800 --> 02:21:35.800]   It's a terrible thing.
[02:21:35.800 --> 02:21:36.800]   Yeah.
[02:21:36.800 --> 02:21:37.800]   Oh, yeah.
[02:21:37.800 --> 02:21:38.800]   Because of the kids, right?
[02:21:38.800 --> 02:21:39.800]   You tear it out.
[02:21:39.800 --> 02:21:41.720]   Yeah, I don't know.
[02:21:41.720 --> 02:21:43.640]   We do knows what happened.
[02:21:43.640 --> 02:21:49.120]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon after the radio show about 230 Pacific, 530 Eastern
[02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:51.080]   time, 22, 230 UTC.
[02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:55.640]   I mentioned the time we do it because, in fact, I would suggest tuning in earlier because
[02:21:55.640 --> 02:21:57.560]   we start the stream.
[02:21:57.560 --> 02:21:58.560]   We don't.
[02:21:58.560 --> 02:21:59.560]   We just don't stop it, I guess.
[02:21:59.560 --> 02:22:00.560]   We continue it.
[02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:05.080]   And so you can watch live as we're doing it and see the stuff before, see the stuff after.
[02:22:05.080 --> 02:22:08.120]   It's all on the website, twitter.tv/live.
[02:22:08.120 --> 02:22:09.680]   There's audio and video.
[02:22:09.680 --> 02:22:13.320]   If you're watching live or listening live, chat live.
[02:22:13.320 --> 02:22:14.680]   We have a great chat room.
[02:22:14.680 --> 02:22:18.840]   It runs 24/7, but it's most active when we're doing live shows.
[02:22:18.840 --> 02:22:19.840]   Some great people in there.
[02:22:19.840 --> 02:22:21.440]   A lot of fun.
[02:22:21.440 --> 02:22:22.760]   IRC.twit.tv.
[02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:26.000]   That's our little chat community.
[02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:30.000]   We also have a forum for people who aren't watching live.
[02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.760]   Great place to go twitter.community.
[02:22:32.760 --> 02:22:34.480]   And you can sign up there.
[02:22:34.480 --> 02:22:36.960]   There's no charge, obviously.
[02:22:36.960 --> 02:22:42.240]   The only thing I have to approve every sign on, just to make sure we don't get spammers,
[02:22:42.240 --> 02:22:45.520]   we haven't had spam problems lately.
[02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:50.320]   I will approve you, but I'll do that within the 24 hours because I want you to be in there.
[02:22:50.320 --> 02:22:54.440]   We also have a twitter clone called Mastodon.
[02:22:54.440 --> 02:22:57.480]   Our own Mastodon instance at twitter.social.
[02:22:57.480 --> 02:22:58.840]   I don't do twitter anymore.
[02:22:58.840 --> 02:22:59.920]   I just do Mastodon.
[02:22:59.920 --> 02:23:00.920]   It's so fun.
[02:23:00.920 --> 02:23:01.920]   It's so great.
[02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:02.920]   I love it.
[02:23:02.920 --> 02:23:05.080]   You have to say why you want to join.
[02:23:05.080 --> 02:23:07.160]   Just mention, "Oh, Leo sent me."
[02:23:07.160 --> 02:23:08.720]   You'd be amazed.
[02:23:08.720 --> 02:23:10.440]   I'm approving these people.
[02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:15.320]   So many people come in to say things like, "Because I'd like to market my Viagra business."
[02:23:15.320 --> 02:23:19.360]   Or, "It's like, okay, okay, no."
[02:23:19.360 --> 02:23:24.400]   There are people, spammers sometimes, they go, "I want to sell stuff."
[02:23:24.400 --> 02:23:27.280]   And then, or they say, "I want to meet people."
[02:23:27.280 --> 02:23:32.720]   And their handle is, buyusedrealestate.com.
[02:23:32.720 --> 02:23:35.320]   And it's like, "Well, I think I know what you're here for."
[02:23:35.320 --> 02:23:38.480]   Yeah, usedrealestate.
[02:23:38.480 --> 02:23:39.480]   Never buy new.
[02:23:39.480 --> 02:23:40.480]   Always buyusedrealestate.
[02:23:40.480 --> 02:23:41.480]   That's my tip to you.
[02:23:41.480 --> 02:23:46.080]   Something you can take away after this long show.
[02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:47.080]   Where was I?
[02:23:47.080 --> 02:23:51.000]   On demand versions of the show available at the website for everything we do, twit.tv.
[02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:54.240]   Of course, there's a YouTube channel.
[02:23:54.240 --> 02:23:55.400]   You can watch there if you want.
[02:23:55.400 --> 02:23:56.880]   You can subscribe there.
[02:23:56.880 --> 02:24:01.720]   As the kids say, "Mesh, the bell," and hit the button or whatever that is.
[02:24:01.720 --> 02:24:03.480]   Smash that like button.
[02:24:03.480 --> 02:24:05.240]   Smash that like button.
[02:24:05.240 --> 02:24:06.240]   Subscribe.
[02:24:06.240 --> 02:24:07.240]   Smash that like button.
[02:24:07.240 --> 02:24:08.240]   Okay, guys?
[02:24:08.240 --> 02:24:13.920]   And actually, the more civilized way to subscribe is to get a podcast application.
[02:24:13.920 --> 02:24:15.160]   There are many.
[02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:17.880]   And subscribe there, and you'll get either the audio or the video.
[02:24:17.880 --> 02:24:20.880]   The minute it's available on a Sunday evening.
[02:24:20.880 --> 02:24:22.120]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:24:22.120 --> 02:24:23.120]   We really appreciate it.
[02:24:23.120 --> 02:24:24.760]   We'll see you next time.
[02:24:24.760 --> 02:24:25.760]   Another twit.
[02:24:25.760 --> 02:24:36.320]   Bye bye.
[02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:59.520]   [ Silence ]
