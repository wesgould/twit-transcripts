[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.940]   And we are going to talk about all tech news.
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.300]   We've got lots of it, but let me introduce our panel
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.180]   first starting all the way to my right with Dwight Silverman
[00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.740]   because he's the guy on Skype from the Houston Chronicle.
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.020]   Hey, Dwight.
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.100]   How are you, Leo?
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.860]   Blog.chron.com/techblock.
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.340]   You last time you were on, and I want to clarify this,
[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.020]   you said I'm not writing for the paper anymore.
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.620]   I'm not writing for the print edition.
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.660]   I'm all digital all the time.
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.420]   I have my blog, but my main job,
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.860]   I'm the social media manager for the Chronicles editorial group.
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.180]   I run the Twitter account and the Facebook account
[00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.780]   and teach people how to do Twitter and Facebook.
[00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.100]   It's becoming more and more important in our business to do it.
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.460]   We've been doing it for a long time,
[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.300]   but it's picking up steam this year.
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.180]   It's cool.
[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.180]   Usually it's fun and fun.
[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.100]   Usually I imagine that the interns job.
[00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.900]   Hey, kid, you know how to use Twitter, come here.
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.340]   Show me.
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.820]   Show me how to use that Twitter thing.
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.860]   The 24-year-old intern may not have a lot of success
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.820]   going to the grizzled newspaper,
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.980]   veteran covering City Hall and saying, you need to do this.
[00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.620]   It kind of helps to have somebody who's had some experience
[00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.180]   doing it.
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.980]   And plus, I think when you have somebody who's my age,
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.620]   who's excited and enjoys social media and understands it,
[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.540]   it helps other people realize that, hey, they can get into it too.
[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.660]   It's not just for kids anymore.
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.180]   You can do it for a long time, but we always can get better.
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.700]   Also with us, from all things deal,
[00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.540]   Liz Gaines is here.
[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.380]   It's good to see you.
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.880]   Thank you.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:51.380]   Good to see you.
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.580]   Yeah.
[00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.820]   I haven't seen you in ages.
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:53.300]   Ages.
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.340]   How's everything going?
[00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.820]   Good.
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.320]   Good.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.740]   I'm not at South by Southwest.
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.260]   I was going to mention that.
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.580]   There's something this panel has in common.
[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.820]   FOMO, F-O-M-O, fear of missing out,
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.100]   because none of us are at South by Southwest.
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.660]   Oh, not afraid.
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:08.380]   Not afraid.
[00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.100]   No fear.
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.860]   Relief.
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.500]   Jolie Odell has no fear either.
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.380]   I hate health.
[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.780]   I am getting plenty of sleep, and I am not
[00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.700]   interacting with D-bags.
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.020]   Happy.
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:24.460]   I got a call at 7 AM on Friday morning from Cara, my head,
[00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.260]   honcho, and she.
[00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.060]   Cara Swisher.
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.060]   Cara Swisher says, did you get my email?
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.940]   I say, what?
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.380]   She says, I emailed you.
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.860]   Look back.
[00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.820]   She emailed me at 1 that morning, say,
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.180]   can you go to South by Southwest today?
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.680]   Oh.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.460]   Cara went, though.
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.140]   She's there.
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.780]   She was already there, but there's
[00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.100]   a snowstorm on the East Coast blocked Peter from coming.
[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.980]   So she said, Liz will you go at 7 o'clock,
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:44.860]   not having seen her email.
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.140]   I said, no.
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.620]   Good.
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.540]   And oh.
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.380]   Good.
[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.900]   So have you all-- I take it you've all been to South by Southwest.
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.100]   I have never been.
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.020]   You live in Houston.
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.540]   You're just-- you're in the same state.
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.980]   I've never been.
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:57.860]   I've never been.
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.100]   So for those who don't know, this was originally--
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.500]   it was a music festival, then branched out
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.500]   into a film festival.
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.540]   And I don't know how long, maybe 10 years ago,
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.260]   they did this thing called South by Southwest Interactive
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.820]   to kind of honor this new thing on the World Wide Web.
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.300]   And it's become massive.
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.060]   Yeah, 28,000 people there.
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.700]   Holy cow.
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.700]   Counting or not counting the gatecrashers,
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.980]   because they suck.
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:18.340]   Counting.
[00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.060]   And there are way too many of them.
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.940]   People in town?
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.860]   Yeah, no, it's insane.
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.500]   And the lobby, conning.
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.460]   I think you could argue that Interactive now is at parity
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.700]   with music and film, maybe even bigger.
[00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.340]   It's certainly a big event.
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.460]   Probably the landmark moment for South by Southwest
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.540]   was in 2007 when Twitter was discovered at South by Southwest.
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.700]   It had launched in 2006, but everybody was using it there.
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.980]   And that really put them on the map a year later.
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.300]   Same thing happened to Four Square.
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.900]   Everybody was using Four Square.
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.260]   And then what happened was every app in the world realized
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.180]   if you want to launch at South by--
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.500]   go to South by.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.140]   And now nobody can launch because there's
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.340]   1,000 new apps there.
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.860]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.060]   And so everyone's phones are dead because all these GPS
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.980]   apps are killing the batteries.
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.580]   They're killing the batteries.
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.340]   How come you never went, Dwight?
[00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.780]   Actually, I should have meant that.
[00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.580]   I went once.
[00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.500]   I was-- the Austin Statesman does social media awards.
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.900]   And several years ago, I got one.
[00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.620]   And I saw I went for that.
[00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.380]   But I've never been-- it's just--
[00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.820]   I've never had the need to.
[00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.980]   It started out, like you said, as a music and movie conference.
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.580]   And other people from the Chronicle went.
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.180]   And then by the time the interactive kind of picked up
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.020]   steam, I wasn't covering that as a beat anymore.
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.940]   I was working on the website, so I just didn't go.
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.340]   I would like to go, I think.
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.340]   But it's just become such a zoo.
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.540]   It's like CES and that the logistics
[00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:43.340]   and trying to get around and planning and so forth
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.820]   is so intense that I think you could almost cover it better
[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:47.900]   by not being there.
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.060]   Austin's a great city.
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.540]   I think part of the success of this
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.740]   is that it's just really fun.
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.500]   The music in Austin is great.
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.660]   And because the music festival follows the interactive festival,
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.780]   a lot of people are there.
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:58.460]   Bands are there.
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.860]   And so there's just wonderful music.
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.500]   But I think that we went there the last few years.
[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.020]   We stopped last year because it just
[00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.860]   didn't seem like there was a story there,
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.140]   except that it's a party.
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.460]   And it didn't seem like there was any big--
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.340]   now, Aaron launched his company.
[00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.380]   Your husband has a company.
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:18.540]   It's an app called CSAW for the--
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.300]   TSL.co, go download it now.
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.140]   It's amazing.
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.220]   It's a decision-making app.
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.340]   Did he launch it south by?
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.580]   Honey, he has not been at Southby.
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.980]   And he said he has had his most productive engineering week.
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.100]   When everybody else is there.
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.020]   In his life, just by having all those guys in San Francisco
[00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.780]   in the office, just with their heads down,
[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:37.980]   just getting things done.
[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.540]   Maybe that's the value of it.
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.500]   Get all the debags out of town.
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.420]   Isolate them, eliminate them.
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.140]   They normally stop him from doing his job.
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.140]   Depends.
[00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:48.820]   I guess.
[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:49.820]   I don't know.
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:52.020]   They just talk and they want to socialize.
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:52.620]   I'm talking.
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.860]   It is a great party.
[00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.220]   It's mostly scoble.
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.540]   Well, I mean, define a great--
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.100]   regarding my idea.
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.300]   My idea of a great party is dropping a laptop and a bathtub.
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.460]   Yeah, that was a party.
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:02.980]   I imagine.
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.420]   No, but I mean, I don't think it's a great party at all.
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.980]   I think it's a bunch of drunk people
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.060]   who don't know each other trying to socially climb their way up
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:11.420]   this interval.
[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.060]   There's a bit of a lot of that going on.
[00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.420]   There's a lot of that going on.
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.340]   But Cara goes.
[00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:17.220]   It must be important for all things.
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:17.700]   Do you, right?
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.700]   I actually wrote it up for Vanity Fair today.
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:20.540]   Oh, there you go.
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.700]   That says it all, right?
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.100]   It's not an all things these stories.
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.660]   It's a Vanity Fair story.
[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.700]   That kind of says it all.
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.740]   I will not say what all it says, but I agree.
[00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.420]   And why didn't you want to go, Liz?
[00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.420]   Why did you say no way?
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.980]   I mean, you had a free trip down there.
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.700]   It's a free trip to hell.
[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:38.700]   That's not that bad.
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.340]   I was at Ted last week.
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.340]   I had my travel this month.
[00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:42.140]   You did your Ted.
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:42.980]   It was great.
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:43.420]   Yeah.
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.420]   How was Ted?
[00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.060]   It was pretty awesome, actually.
[00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.940]   They're starting to put out some of the good talks.
[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.340]   And it's good just for me as a reporter,
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.380]   because there's all these people there.
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.740]   It's a great place to know each other.
[00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:55.100]   They drink a lot.
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.740]   It's great.
[00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.420]   Somebody said that Ted represents what's
[00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.020]   something they're called the idea industry now.
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:06.860]   But there's an industry that has risen around ideas.
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:10.100]   And I wonder if that kind of spoils it a little bit.
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.340]   Oh, it's totally spoiled.
[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.140]   And it's very smug and elitist and terrible in all those ways.
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.660]   But it's also wonderful.
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:16.180]   Right.
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.660]   If you have a grand a ways, why not?
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:18.160]   Sure.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.740]   Or get a press pass.
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.060]   Some of the talks that have already come out are really good.
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:26.060]   There's one by Amanda Palmer on art and giving or asking.
[00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.140]   She's a musician.
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:27.660]   Asking.
[00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.780]   Raise money on Kickstarter to create an album.
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.100]   And it's really an inspirational figure, I think.
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:32.780]   So that would be--
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.800]   I mean, this is a really great distillation.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.120]   I think it's like 12 minutes long.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.660]   And it's her just saying she started out as a busker,
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.260]   as a person in a wedding dress, asking for money.
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.860]   And that kind of lack of shame that she developed
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:49.020]   over five years of asking people to give her a buck on the street
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.060]   has kind of put her in a place in her career
[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.720]   where she feels comfortable valuing her art
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.360]   and asking people to pay for it.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.620]   And she tells it in a beautiful way.
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.020]   I'm not spoiling it by saying that.
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:58.980]   But that is the lesson.
[00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.960]   And the other advantage of these is they're short.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.460]   Yeah.
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:02.960]   Right?
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.760]   Well, they're 18 minutes, isn't it?
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.000]   They're not too many YouTube videos.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.400]   Yeah, they're 12 to 18.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.760]   I think they varied a little more.
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.800]   But there's some good ones and thought-provoking ones.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.800]   There was a bunch on philanthropy this year.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.800]   Interspecies internet communication.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:19.280]   It was a huge--
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.560]   What other species?
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.000]   Dolphins, among others.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.480]   Dolphins use the internet?
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.800]   There was actually a woman who showed this really cool,
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.860]   wearable computer where you can mimic dolphin sounds
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:31.980]   when you're swimming with them.
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.820]   You need that for the best of.
[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.380]   You can speak back and forth to them.
[00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.460]   And your mobile computers translate what they just said.
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.540]   So they said, throw me the red ball or whatever.
[00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:41.540]   Yeah.
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:42.040]   Wow.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.260]   So they would expose you to the whole location for that.
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.180]   That helps people or just helps them not do stuff other
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.540]   than swim with dolphins.
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.620]   Well, I mean, these are marine biologists studying dolphins.
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.420]   So understanding what they're thinking and wanting
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.180]   and asking is probably helpful for them.
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.460]   I don't want to say really thinking something.
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.360]   You want to play with a ball, please?
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:01.880]   I think sometimes we might project.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:02.720]   I don't know.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.920]   I just thought for a tweet.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.800]   But I just sometimes feel like they might not be a jiggy man.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.840]   Anyways, it's an idea of bath.
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.680]   It's a bath of ideas.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.840]   A warm--
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.640]   Don't drop your laptop.
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.840]   --salty, enveloping bath of ideas.
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.760]   Much better than--
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:15.260]   Salty?
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.520]   --south by Southwest.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.120]   No, no, no.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.680]   I just picked that one this year.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:23.160]   Let's take a break.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.800]   And then we're going to talk about daylight savings time
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.760]   because we really have no-- no, we have tech stories.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.560]   I want to talk about the new Facebook timeline, what you guys
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:29.720]   think, and if you've got it--
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.320]   I've got it.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.240]   --I'm jealous.
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.240]   I do not have-- I don't even have the search one.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.200]   Oh, what?
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.160]   That's so--
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.360]   That's so last year.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.600]   I feel like I'm in the last century.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.600]   What?
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.240]   There's double-up re-rollings that--
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.240]   No, not at all.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.440]   Holy moly.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.040]   If anyone from Facebook is watching,
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.000]   they should go ahead and push it out to us now
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.440]   so we can talk about it.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.160]   That would be good.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:52.600]   Push that.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.440]   But I applied.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.040]   So if you go to Facebook.com/newsfeed at the bottom,
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.160]   there's a green button that says, yes, yeah.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.760]   Hello, I'd like to try that.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.440]   Please, Mr. Kata.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.880]   And I got the--
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.160]   I got the search graph pretty quick after I did that one.
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:06.560]   Yeah, me too.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.480]   A day or so.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:07.960]   And some of you--
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.440]   Maybe Liz hasn't done that.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.040]   I did it.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:10.400]   I did.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.360]   I'm on the list.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.440]   Well, I put myself on the list.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.520]   I know if I'm on the real list.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.520]   Which is say it's South by--
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.120]   Yes, right.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:15.720]   I'm on the list.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.800]   I have the VIP pass.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.800]   That was like three years ago when South by Southwest
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.240]   turned into--
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.240]   Are you on the--
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:23.920]   Are you on the list?
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.680]   Yeah, which list?
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.600]   Oh, my God.
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.400]   And then there was the VVIP, because my boss
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.520]   was going for the first time this year.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.720]   And he was like, do you have any advice?
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.560]   And I was like, just no.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.040]   VIP is completely meaningless.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.280]   It means nothing.
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.200]   It's a trade for all.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.960]   It's a VVIP.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.560]   VVIP is even meaningless.
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.400]   It doesn't mean anything.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.760]   Just wear a Purell suit and come home
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.720]   as to this beautiful whole whole whole whole whole whole--
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.520]   You might think that we sound jaded and bitter.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.560]   Maybe a little jealous.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.000]   And we are.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.720]   All of us except Jolie, who really doesn't want to be there
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.320]   at all.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:59.400]   Not one bit.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.120]   Our show today brought to you by audible.com.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.880]   Great site for audio books.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.720]   100,000 total.
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.680]   More, actually.
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.680]   Audio books.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.280]   Titles of all kinds from kids, which is great, by the way.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.080]   The Neverwinter saga is available.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:13.800]   Hunger Games.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.520]   There are a lot of young adult novels on there.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.040]   Great way to get your kid reading.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.400]   And the reason I say that is my 18-year-old, who's
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.680]   a little-- either ADD or dyslexic.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:22.920]   I'm not sure what.
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.440]   Or maybe he's just high.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.760]   But he doesn't like to read.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.840]   On the other hand, once I turn him on to audible,
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.120]   he can't stop listening.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:31.720]   And I think that's just as good.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.800]   Just as good.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.160]   He's been listening to science.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.360]   He got into psychology, anthropology.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.880]   There's fiction and nonfiction.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:39.600]   There's history.
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.000]   I love listening to biographies.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.200]   There's tons of that.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:46.040]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E audible.com.
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.360]   And I'm going to tell you how you can get two free books.
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.560]   Right now, oh, I see the audio nominees are out.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.840]   These are the best audio books of the year.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:54.320]   Here's one.
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.640]   If you're into technology just debuted at South by Southwest,
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.680]   it's called All the Rave, The Rise
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.640]   and Fall of Sean Fanning's Napster.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:04.680]   Wouldn't that be a fun book to read?
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.200]   But yeah, it's got to be an interesting story.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.440]   Joseph Minh.
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.360]   You also just scroll by Cheryl Sandberg's book
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:10.960]   that's coming out this week.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:13.000]   Oh, Lean In is unaudible, huh?
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.080]   I wonder if she reads it or someone else does.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.000]   Where is that?
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:16.360]   Point of--
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.080]   It was just a little--
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:17.720]   To touch screen.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.280]   You could actually touch my screen if you want.
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:19.780]   Yeah.
[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:20.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.280]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.160]   Ooh.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.920]   Lean In, Women, Work and the Will to Lead.
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.120]   Have you read the-- oh, it's pre-order,
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.360]   so it's not out quite yet.
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.000]   Yeah, I think it comes out this week.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.160]   You mean the book's not even out?
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:30.720]   No, no.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.000]   Everybody's talking about that as if they'd known it.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.040]   No, I think she's going to be on like 60 minutes tonight.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.400]   Good morning, America tomorrow.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:36.760]   She's--
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.840]   Created by Eliza Donovan.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:39.200]   Donovan.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.760]   She's the C-O-O at Facebook.
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:41.680]   She's an actress, yes.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.520]   Eliza Donovan.
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.440]   Yeah, oh, yeah.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.480]   Oh, that's one of the things that's great about audible.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:50.480]   They're not drawing, and then I told Mark that he had to put--
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.720]   it's somebody who is going to bring it to life.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.720]   That's one of the best things.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.960]   She'll never even got time for that, Bo.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.080]   Yeah, I don't think she'd be--
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:56.960]   I don't think she'd be real.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.160]   I don't think it's Bo-mess.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.480]   She said to see women.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.920]   So OK, so there's two books right there.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.360]   If you're interested in the tech industry,
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.600]   you might want to get--
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.560]   here's how you get them free.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.360]   Go to audible.com/twit2.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.080]   You'll be signing up for the Platinum account.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:14.040]   That's two books a month subscription, which is what I do.
[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.120]   Because I go through these things like candy.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.120]   But your first month's free, your first two books are free.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.600]   If you cancel in the first 30 days, you'll pay nothing.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.960]   But the books are yours to keep.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.760]   I don't think you're going to want to cancel.
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:27.000]   Cheryl's book comes out tomorrow.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.400]   So you sign up today.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.440]   You'll get that book tomorrow.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.240]   Lean in, women.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.240]   I got to read that.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.080]   Got to read that.
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.360]   It's not that long.
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.600]   It's only six and a half hours.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.520]   It's a short book.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:37.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.880]   What's a long book?
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.520]   Long will be-- most books are around 10 hours.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.320]   Game of Thrones, like 43 hours.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.840]   So I'm not kidding.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.800]   It varies.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.320]   By the way, that'd be another good one.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.680]   If you haven't read the Game of Thrones,
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.680]   you should really read it before you watch it on TV.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.800]   I think wonderful books.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:55.960]   They're all there on Audible 2.
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.560]   If you're in San Francisco, by the way,
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.880]   all things D is doing a Game of Thrones event next week.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:01.400]   How fun?
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.360]   Like for the debut?
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.200]   With HBO.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.880]   Yeah, for the debut, we're doing like a conversation.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:06.600]   It's on the 20th.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.240]   Hold that thought.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:07.840]   Hold that thought.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:08.800]   I want to do that.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.480]   So anyway, audible.com/twit2.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.360]   Try it today.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.120]   You're going to love it.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.440]   I promise.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.200]   I've been a member since 2000.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.880]   It literally-- it kept me from driving off the road more
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.160]   than once with my long commute.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:23.760]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.120]   So the Game of Thrones is big at South by Southwest.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:26.560]   You see that?
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.480]   They have the Game of Thrones petty cabs.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.160]   Really?
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:34.000]   With the iron throne, the sword's thrown in the petty cab.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.040]   You sitting in this, riding along?
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.160]   I've seen pictures.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:38.520]   I know.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.080]   It's true.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.680]   So you're doing a deal with HBO.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.720]   It launches March this Sunday.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.000]   A week from today, right?
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.840]   The event is on the 20th.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.360]   Oh, OK.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.360]   So maybe it launches in two weeks.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.960]   Storm of Swords.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.760]   Keep with us.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.120]   Series three.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.840]   Are you a fan?
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.160]   No.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.120]   She has never even seen it.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:57.880]   I didn't say anything.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.200]   She has no idea.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.680]   So you don't share our excitement.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.800]   Have you seen it, Jolie Adele?
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.840]   And in the bathtub did you watch?
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.280]   Is that one of the way the series premiere was just like,
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.600]   boobs, boobs, boobs.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.120]   Yeah, that was it.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:09.160]   Violence, yelling.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:09.840]   Boobs.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:10.840]   Yeah, I saw that.
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.320]   Yeah, well, HBO, I don't know why, but I think they feel the need.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.880]   Yeah, there was no need to do that.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.880]   There was a lot of nudity in the first few episodes.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.360]   I mean, I agree with you.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.200]   I need some need for television.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.760]   But if there's television, there should be boobs.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.720]   I don't know.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.560]   It wasn't-- there weren't boobs in the book, at least not
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:27.800]   that I remember.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.040]   How do you put boobs in a book?
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:29.640]   That's not a book.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.600]   That's a magazine, sir.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.240]   Maybe that was the pilot, and it was actually
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:34.240]   to sell all the mail.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.560]   I swear to God, it was because they really toned down us
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.400]   the first three episodes, much less nudity.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.840]   And I swear to God, it was to draw people in.
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:43.680]   And then it goes away.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.120]   And then it kind of goes away.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.120]   That's terrible.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.400]   See, if you're going to have boobs in the pilot,
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.960]   you need boobs throughout, like a boob arc,
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.360]   you know, for the whole series.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.600]   So the reason he has me on these things--
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.800]   I'm not going to say a thing because it's just going
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.480]   to get in trouble.
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.920]   Ever since she brought hot cross-pluns to the studio
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.120]   and their first appearance here, it's been downhill.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:10.400]   So Facebook's redesign, since only you have it, Jolie O'Dell,
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.840]   can you perhaps fill us in?
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:16.440]   I mean, we can look at it at the demo site, Facebook.com/newsfeed.
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:16.760]   I don't know.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.320]   Is there a way for the camera to look over my shoulder?
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.520]   I'll show-- here, why don't I show?
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.760]   This is what they're showing.
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.280]   So it says, "Goodbye, clutter.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.240]   Hello, bright, beautiful stories."
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:26.840]   It is--
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.840]   Pictures are bigger.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.520]   Pictures are bigger.
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.520]   I mean, as you can see here, it's kind of--
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.160]   You just grab it because most of Ryan's
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.440]   is on audio anyway, so it doesn't--
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.640]   Well, what you would expect.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.480]   You know how you go to a modern web application.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.360]   And what you get is very magazine-like full bleed
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.080]   photos with text overlaid on the photos.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.160]   And it's all very visually oriented.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.280]   Like, say Google+, I wouldn't know.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:48.920]   No one uses that.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:49.880]   Does this look like Google+?
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:50.400]   No one uses that.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.400]   It does look like Google+.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.200]   It feels to me like Google+ heavily influences.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:54.720]   Well, I mean--
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.720]   And like Flipboard.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.040]   I would say it's not so much influenced by any application
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.760]   as following an existing trend with web and mobile,
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.520]   especially iPad and tablet applications.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:10.760]   It's just bringing a very old, old, ugly, ugly interface
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.600]   up to speed with the rest of the entire internet.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.840]   And they do it pretty well.
[00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.760]   Now, they don't break any new ground.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.720]   They are not giving you something revolutionary,
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.480]   but they're also not giving you something that's
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.120]   so difficult to navigate that users are going to quote revolt.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.440]   It's very visual.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.120]   It's gorgeous.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:26.600]   It's pretty.
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.800]   I do feel like Facebook is in this kind of endless cycle,
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.440]   though, of taking out features and then putting
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.680]   the same features back in.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.760]   I mean, it's a move forward.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:33.680]   It's more modernized.
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.080]   But they used to show us everything,
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.000]   and then people don't want everything when
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.960]   they were jealous of Twitter for a while.
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.440]   And then they took that away.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.880]   And now there's a feed where you can see everything.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:47.160]   And they used to give you the ability
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.600]   to sort by the type of update.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.240]   And then they took that away because they said people
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.120]   didn't use those controls.
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.680]   And now they're back in.
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.360]   I think that what I got from talking
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.480]   to some of the product people when I was there
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.560]   and some of the engineers is that they just
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.480]   get these overwhelming complaints.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.360]   I'm not seeing my friends' updates in my news feed.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.720]   That is the number one complaint about news feed.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.120]   And that's what they were trying to fix.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:09.800]   So now they know--
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:10.920]   But did they fix it?
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:12.280]   They did, because now there's a feed--
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:13.200]   There's categories.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.120]   Can you say-- well, here-- I'll give you an example.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.200]   And this was very controversial.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:21.320]   Nick Bilton writing in the bits blog of New York Times
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:25.480]   pointed out that subscribers basically
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.520]   see very little of your content, your friends see
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.080]   your content.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.280]   But Facebook-- remember they added this ability
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.520]   to subscribe to somebody.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:35.640]   So for instance, I have my friends,
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:36.720]   and it's just a few hundred of them,
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.440]   but anybody can subscribe to my Facebook feed.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:43.400]   But what Nick seems to have found is that nobody sees
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.520]   these posts.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.440]   Well, that's what Facebook is trying to change now.
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.400]   They're trying to look at different kinds of content.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.360]   The people you subscribe to, the people you're
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.800]   very close friends with, and then different kinds of content
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.800]   by the type of content itself, whether it's photos or music
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.240]   or whatever.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.000]   They're trying to fix this.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.160]   Every user has their own-- I didn't
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.560]   see enough of blank today on Facebook.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.040]   And they're trying to appeal to everybody at the same time.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.080]   Now, are they going forward?
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:09.880]   Are they going back?
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:10.600]   Are they flip-flopping?
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:11.960]   I think they're trying to make something that
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.040]   works for a billion people.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:17.000]   And we're watching them do it in the public eye.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:17.960]   Here, Kaza.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.440]   They're not doing it all behind doors.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.360]   Adobe, for example, when they make Photoshop,
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.720]   they roll out their Photoshop update, and that's it.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.040]   And they don't update it again for however long a year.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:27.800]   It's six bugs, but they don't make any big changes.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:28.280]   Right.
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:28.800]   And we're seeing--
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.920]   Facebook's iterating.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:30.600]   In real time.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:31.360]   Which is what you're doing.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:31.760]   Which is what you do.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.520]   Yes, it is.
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.840]   So, Jolise, did you have it?
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.280]   Can I ask a question as a person?
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:36.840]   Sure.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:41.400]   Publisher, and somebody we put out our content on Facebook
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.720]   and hope people in Houston share it.
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:49.240]   And so there's some concern here about how much publishers
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.000]   content will be seen if people are
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.840]   able to select specific feeds and thus not
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:58.760]   see the stories that we're putting out.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:03.240]   So when you have the all items feed,
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:06.680]   do you see the brands that you have followed?
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.560]   Or do you just see all of your friends?
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.760]   I mean, I don't follow any brands,
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.800]   so I'm probably not the best person to answer that.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.720]   But--
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.720]   I do.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.480]   I do, and I see nothing but ads for those.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.000]   I mean, it's just so--
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.320]   now I don't have the new feed.
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.040]   But that's one of the things that really bugs me.
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:24.880]   In fact, that was Nick's contention,
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.920]   is that really he wouldn't get engagement on stuff
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.720]   he shared unless he paid.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.400]   You know what, though?
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.840]   That's Nick's friggin' problem.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.600]   If you're bad at social media--
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.240]   I don't think so.
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:34.880]   No, no, no, no.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:35.400]   I don't think he's--
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.320]   If you think that you are sharing--
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:36.960]   Nick has got bad socials.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.280]   Not relevant to other people.
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:39.120]   If they don't want to be sharing--
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.360]   No, I think that that's not true.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:41.320]   That's on you.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.920]   Now, Peter Kafka did have Facebook's response,
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.360]   if I can find this.
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.200]   He says, Siri, he says, Facebook said,
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.040]   there's no pay to play scheme here.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.720]   Because Nick really implied that he did an experiment.
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.760]   He has 25,000 subscribers.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:57.960]   Nobody saw anything.
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.960]   None of them saw anything he posted unless he paid for it.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:05.600]   Facebook said, no, that's not true.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:09.520]   But then later, Facebook came back last week and said,
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.200]   yes, there was a bug in our code.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.040]   Right.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.360]   He fixed it.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.840]   And in fact, we noticed more people seeing our stuff
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:20.640]   before than the numbers had shown us previously, which
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.600]   made us feel better.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.200]   But still, it doesn't seem like you
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.680]   get in front of as many people.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.480]   You know, what we're sharing is news stories.
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.880]   We're not necessarily-- these aren't ads.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:33.560]   They're stuff that people may want to share with each other.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:37.240]   And so it's frustrating to us to kind of have our stories out
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:40.560]   there and not be promoted unless we pay for it.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.240]   Well, exactly.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.760]   And that's kind of what Nick was saying.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.760]   He's a New York Times writer.
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:45.560]   It's not gossip.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.160]   He's putting it out here.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.160]   No, I think he really has a point, which is--
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.480]   he's being a little bit whiny.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:50.000]   He's crying.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.080]   I mean, people didn't like his Facebook posts.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.320]   He's an email for T-roll.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:53.840]   I have.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.840]   I'm this instant, sorry.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.480]   I have 800,000 Facebook subscribers or something.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:57.980]   Wow.
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:59.560]   And I don't think they see my stuff either.
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.200]   I've noticed the same trend that he's seen.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.400]   Well, so what's whiny?
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.280]   I think that Facebook-- what actually does come back to
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.920]   is what Jolie is talking about, which is Facebook
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.000]   puts out all these features.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.360]   And then they don't necessarily have
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.680]   the follow through on them later.
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.160]   And so they launched a subscription thing.
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.000]   It must have been like a side project or something.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.920]   And a year later, they left it out of the algorithm.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.440]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.200]   That's what they said.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.400]   That's what they told Peter.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.080]   They said Facebook says, we tweak our news feed algorithms
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:23.560]   all the time.
[00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.640]   We tweak everything all the time.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.960]   It's a moving target.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.840]   And they said, people like Billton, who started accumulating
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.640]   followers, these subscribers, via the site subscribe option,
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.680]   early may have seen engagement drop,
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.040]   but they don't say why.
[00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.480]   So maybe it's a bug.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.080]   Well, I don't know that it's a bug.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.760]   I think that Facebook has a few things that
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.800]   are really core to its user experience.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:50.920]   One is your friendships.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.600]   People you know who know you, that mutual thing that
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:58.040]   is really strong and really valuable and genuine, real.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.400]   And then the other thing is--
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.440]   But they added the subscribers.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.680]   And things you like it.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.600]   But they added subscribers so they should support it
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:04.800]   or not put it in at all.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.600]   I don't think it's core to their product and their values
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.280]   as a company.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.920]   And I think that they put it in as an experiment more
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.240]   than anything else.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.520]   And I just don't think that it's--
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:15.800]   when you think about Facebook, I think
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:19.240]   it's kind of tangential to the whole point of Facebook.
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.240]   And it's easy for them.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.760]   It's in RSS feed.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.640]   Is that our fire alarm going on?
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.920]   I'm on fire.
[00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.120]   Could you check that, John?
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:28.280]   No, that's me.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.200]   That's you.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.240]   That's me.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.680]   Is that-- Dwight, do you want to get out of the house?
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:36.600]   Dwight is coming from inside the house.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:40.320]   My-- your wife is cooking.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.240]   My wife is cooking.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.240]   We have-- or stupidly, we have a fire sensor.
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.960]   I have the same thing.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.920]   It's so annoying.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:48.520]   It goes off.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.240]   Every time you cook--
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:54.920]   We were going to evacuate to Studio by the time we see it.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.720]   John's run, run, John.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.160]   Find out what's--
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:58.960]   I'm on fire.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.320]   Oh my god.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.280]   No, and actually--
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.640]   I'll try to mute that if it happens.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.080]   I won't say whiny because I think that's unfair to Nick.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.880]   But it is true that the only people who care about subscribers
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.440]   are public figures, that the subscribers was created
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.560]   because public figures were adding--
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.520]   and there was a limit of 5,000 people adding friends as--
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:19.920]   fans as friends.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.120]   And public figures were saying, well, this is no good.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.560]   And they were talking at a 5,000.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.160]   So Facebook said, all right, all right, all right.
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.360]   We're going to create a new thing.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.920]   If you're really popular, you can have people subscribe.
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.920]   That's a different category.
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.040]   You can still share to family and friends.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.160]   And a lot of-- the only people who care about that
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:35.840]   are public figures.
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.320]   And so--
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:36.880]   Well, I mean--
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.720]   --some Facebook said--
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:39.120]   Who we don't care about.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.960]   That content is just less valuable.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.560]   If you and I are friends, what you have to say is very valuable.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.400]   So it's going to rise higher.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.280]   It's going to rise higher.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.640]   Now, if I'm just a fan of yours, your content may not
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.000]   be as important as updates from my mom, my best friend,
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.280]   my best friend's cat, whatever.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.720]   But whose to decide that?
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.880]   Is Facebook-- what if I follow George DeKay?
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.600]   Because I care a lot about his posts.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.520]   His stuff comes through.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:58.200]   I follow him, too.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.400]   And it's there every day.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.800]   I think he gets a lot of engagement.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:01.760]   He gets a lot of engagement.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.240]   So it's how many people click, why?
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:03.760]   Can all of them?
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.040]   There's a social media site called Twitter,
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:05.600]   where people show you--
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.560]   Everybody gets to do it.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.400]   --it's very effective because that's what people use it for.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.760]   Well, and it's completely unfiltered, but it's not
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:14.920]   technically called edge rank, but the algorithm that
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.240]   is popularly called edge rank that Facebook has considers
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.040]   is Nick built-in posting stuff that people interact with
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.520]   consistently, voluminously.
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.680]   If that is the case, as with George DeKay,
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.560]   then we're going to push it to the top of the feet.
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:30.080]   We're going to determine how much people actually
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.720]   want to see this, because as soon as Facebook starts to mess up
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.880]   on how much people want to see something,
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.000]   they get people upset.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.400]   And then they have to change everything.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:37.960]   I'll grant you that.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.080]   I guess the only, then the last thing I would say about it
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:44.880]   is, of course, if you give Facebook money,
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.600]   suddenly everything you say is engaging.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.640]   You can pay to be on that feed.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.600]   It's called advertising.
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:52.000]   Well, I guess.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.960]   I mean, my-- for instance, my feed-- and I follow a lot of people
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.160]   on Facebook-- is almost all brands.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.400]   I can't show it, because I can't lie.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.440]   I have to get my-- could John, could you get my phone?
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.440]   It's on the-- I have to log in on this machine.
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.160]   I haven't done it before, and I have second factor on here.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.080]   I think your life on Facebook, though, is pretty different,
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.840]   because you're-- you've been famous since before Facebook
[00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.600]   started, so I don't think that you've ever had, like,
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:13.360]   a legitimate--
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.520]   That's my new Facebook deal, James.
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.840]   It's going to be my new tagline.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:21.520]   Famous before there was Facebook.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.040]   I mean, it would be totally different if you were,
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.720]   like, a teeny-bauper celebrity who'd
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.080]   emerged through that medium, right?
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.080]   Like Justin Bieber?
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.120]   So should he put his shirt on or not?
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.720]   He took a title from him.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.600]   He's been walking around down with his shirt off, apparently.
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:38.720]   Put it on, Justin.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.120]   That's what somebody said.
[00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:43.960]   All right, let me just enter my one-time code, and then I can--
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.120]   hey, I'm talking here.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.120]   Nice.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.880]   Sorry.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.640]   Do you turn on second factor authentication
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.280]   on your Facebook page?
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:55.840]   No.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:56.920]   You should.
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.800]   My security reporter tells us that we
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.000]   should be doing all that kind of stuff.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:00.560]   And you don't do it.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.560]   It's just a pain in the butt.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.040]   You see here, I had to get my phone and, nah, mah, mah.
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:06.400]   And yeah, I still don't have that fancy feed.
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.480]   But see, I don't think I liked your book.org,
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.280]   but it's the number two post right on here, right?
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.120]   I know I didn't like that.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.040]   The number two is always an ad.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:12.960]   That's an ad, OK.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.840]   Honestly, I've got a new--
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.600]   There's Justin Bieber with his shirt off.
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.240]   That's nice.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.680]   There's no suggested anything on the new news feed
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.640]   that I can see.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.000]   Now, these are all friends now.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.520]   OK, that would be nice.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.800]   But I have a feeling that's not going to last.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:29.120]   I think that you can go to different kinds of feeds,
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:32.760]   and one of them has got to be sponsored or brands
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:33.760]   or something like that.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.640]   OK, so Liz has told me something I didn't know.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.160]   Here, look, follow--
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.000]   That's always an ad.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:38.480]   What?
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:39.240]   The second item.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.320]   Yeah, I think, well--
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:40.920]   You're right, though.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:41.600]   I think you're right.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.320]   It's always an ad.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.320]   So I should ignore that.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.280]   All right.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:44.640]   That's easy.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.080]   Well, if you look over here, it's got a separate feed
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.680]   for following, and you can see the icon for your following
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.000]   feed is an RSS icon.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.600]   So that's what they've added is now you can say,
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:54.880]   I just want to see stuff I'm following.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.080]   So Nick built in goes there under the RSS button.
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:57.720]   That's fine.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.520]   That's a good way to fix that.
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.200]   That's for people who are interested in brands
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.120]   and online celebrities.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.280]   Like, that's their special button.
[00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:03.280]   That's a good way to fix it.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.240]   But you know what, in six months, they're going to be like,
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.880]   no, I never use those that we're taking them away.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.160]   Yes, so we're taking them away.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.160]   Exactly.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.280]   All right.
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.080]   [SIGH]
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:15.720]   So who else cried on the internet this week?
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.280]   Winers, you're a bunch of winers.
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.120]   Facebook acquired Story Lane.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.560]   Is that Memo-- is that Memo Land?
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:22.320]   Is that the same?
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:22.840]   No.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.200]   What's Memo Lane died?
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.760]   And somebody acquired them that we don't know.
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:29.280]   Story Lane was just a really duplicative blogging
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.440]   platform.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.360]   I think it was hard to know what they were--
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.000]   yeah.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.960]   I mean, I think they copied the features of name, a CMS,
[00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.960]   or a sharing platform.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:43.000]   Storify, or medium, or anything like that.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.760]   I think it was just really a fun little idea that
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.240]   wasn't very innovative.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:50.120]   But they probably had a really great team,
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.040]   because a couple months out of the gate,
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.360]   Facebook just snapped them up.
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.640]   What's funny is they snapped them up two days after launching
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:56.440]   an iPhone app.
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.960]   I know, right?
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.960]   So kids.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.560]   And they're shutting it down probably, right?
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:01.680]   Yeah, I'm sure.
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.240]   Just a little point.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.680]   Launch an iPhone app.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.040]   Best way to get known.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.320]   Best way to get known.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:12.240]   Nine new open graph actions for developers.
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:12.680]   Do we care?
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.040]   I don't care.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:18.120]   All right, that's enough of Facebook.
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:19.920]   I've had it with Facebook.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.280]   I think you guys have been a good job of making me feel better
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.120]   about Facebook, and I'm going to use it more.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.160]   Oh.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.040]   OK.
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:27.600]   Promise.
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.760]   So some interesting stories out of Google.
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.000]   YouTube is going to apparently start a music share.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.240]   A service kind of like Spotify.
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.520]   They're going to go after Spotify.
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.800]   Is that all things D I read that on?
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:40.400]   It might have been.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.760]   No, you read a good takedown of that on all things D.
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:43.280]   Oh.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:43.480]   Which is--
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.520]   Not so, huh?
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.680]   Well, I think Google is trying a whole bunch
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.080]   of different music services.
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.320]   Probably the most prominent one is
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.240]   through the Android division is trying
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.040]   to make it part of Google Play.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:54.680]   Right.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.440]   So YouTube's having--
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.640]   And that's been out for a while.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.160]   And they have deals.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.600]   Right.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.680]   YouTube has that relationship with Vivo.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.680]   So there's a lot of different--
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:08.800]   I mean, Google's a huge company with a lot of overlapping
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:09.920]   efforts to do music things.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:12.680]   And it would be easy if you were a reporter covering this space
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:17.960]   as CNN Fortune is to assume that that meant they were going
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.440]   to launch a YouTube music service.
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.320]   But they're talking to these people all the time about a lot
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:22.000]   of different things.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:22.500]   Yeah.
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.160]   I think Peter's point was they don't have the deals to do that
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:24.520]   yet.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.720]   They only have Warner music.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:29.240]   Like they have two labels for this particular kind of thing.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:31.240]   Well, that's two more than a lot of the streaming music
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.960]   services had when they started out.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:33.960]   Yeah.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:34.460]   Yeah.
[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:35.720]   I mean, Spotify didn't launch in the US
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.440]   until they had all the time.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.720]   It took a while.
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.280]   It'd be hard to launch a Spotify-style service
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.280]   if you had one quarter of the albums.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:43.400]   Why would anybody join you?
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.720]   Well, when you come to the music label with a platform
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.400]   like YouTube and like Android, which is less than 10,
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.120]   hundreds of millions of people, billions of people even,
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.200]   I think you have a little bit more negotiating power
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.440]   than Spotify, which nobody had heard of.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.440]   Right.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:59.720]   I mean, I think that YouTube is now used as the jukebox
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.720]   for the world.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.560]   Most kids, when you listen to music,
[00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.080]   they're watching the videos on YouTube.
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.080]   So there's an opportunity to do something more there
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.640]   to maybe have a little bit higher quality,
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.200]   but to also be really convenient.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.280]   Well, and that's the pitch you could do if the music industry.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:14.480]   Look, your kids are watching the videos on YouTube now.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.880]   You can keep asking them to take them down,
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:19.720]   or maybe we could do a deal, and this could be a business
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:20.160]   for you.
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.520]   That's a good pitch.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.160]   Well, I think the pitch worked when they started Vivo.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.160]   That's Vivo.
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.800]   For a while, Vivo, the last I heard Vivo was going to go independent,
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.040]   and then they changed their mind.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.640]   Yeah, there were some interesting negotiations around that.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.760]   You think it was YouTube saying, "No, you stick around.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.160]   We got much more to come."
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.280]   Well, everybody loves YouTube because it has distribution,
[00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.880]   but it doesn't pay as much as everyone thinks they deserve it.
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.760]   It doesn't pay anything, hardly anything.
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.760]   That's terrible.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:47.160]   Well, didn't sign any $1,000 off that one.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.760]   Sign made $8 million on not bowl gangam style,
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:50.960]   but he had how many views?
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:53.160]   But that's the most popular video of all time.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.160]   Yeah, billion views.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.160]   You should make some money.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.160]   I think that last I heard is, at least for advertising,
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:02.160]   it's about $1,000 per million views.
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.160]   So you've got to work pretty hard if you're going to make money on YouTube.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:07.160]   Not that big for the billion views.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:11.160]   I've never got one video, got a million views.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:16.160]   And I had to take it down my parole officer sit away.
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:20.160]   Google is building a same-day Amazon prime competitor,
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:23.160]   Google Shopping Express, according to Alexia Sotsis and Tech Crime.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:24.160]   Sotsis and Tech Crunch.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.160]   Google's--
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:26.160]   They really are.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.160]   They really are.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:28.160]   I mean, Amazon has become enormous.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:30.160]   There's no way to compete in e-commerce because Amazon is so big.
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.160]   So Google's taking them on.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.160]   So Amazon Prime, brilliant marketing.
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:35.160]   Prime member?
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.160]   Yes.
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:37.160]   Who isn't?
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.160]   Prime member?
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.160]   Of course you are.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.160]   Do I--
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.160]   You're a prime member.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:42.160]   Yep.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:43.160]   You're a prime member.
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:44.160]   And Jolie, you probably--
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.160]   No, you don't even order things.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.160]   She goes down to buy stuff from knitting shops.
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.160]   I'm not even a person.
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:55.160]   Everything from eBay.
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.160]   Everything from eBay.
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:57.160]   Everything from eBay.
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.160]   All outfit.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:05.160]   So Google has spent the last year stripping down all this stuff, getting rid of things that
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.160]   weren't part of its core.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.160]   And now it's adding on other things that aren't part of its core.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.160]   But that makes sense.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.160]   But that makes sense.
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.160]   What you want to do is kill stuff that's not working.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.160]   Iterate.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.160]   Try other stuff.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.160]   Try other stuff.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.160]   Try other stuff that they're trying is like, let's do what this other big guy is doing.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.160]   Well, it's hard to innovate.
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.160]   And this has the whiff of like 1997.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:29.160]   You know, this sounds like the same thing with Amazon doing it with trying to do, you
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:31.160]   know, local delivery and same day delivery.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.160]   Right.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:36.160]   There was a haul, there was a huge infrastructure issue and a lot of costs involved with that.
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:39.160]   The price of fuel alone is a big deal.
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:44.160]   And so I'm kind of-- I don't think this is going to go that far unless they have some kind of maybe
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.160]   affiliate system where they're partnering with people who are already doing it in local
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.160]   markets.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:52.160]   One advantage Google has though, they do have many people's credit card numbers because
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.160]   of Google Wallet, right?
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:59.160]   So they-- I mean, I noticed it's very friction-free for me to buy stuff at play and so forth
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.160]   because they already have my credit card.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:05.160]   It's kind of-- so they are at least a player to that point, much like Apple and Amazon.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.160]   Right.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.160]   But it's still they have to get the goods to you.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.160]   That's the trick.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:13.160]   Well, and supposedly, according to this article, they're talking to people like Walmart and
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.160]   Target and Walgreens and Safeway.
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.160]   I mean, I think the biggest-- one of the biggest things that's going to happen in tech in like
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:23.160]   the next five years is that we'll have almost instantaneous delivery right now.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.160]   You know, it's not too much doer.
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.160]   I don't care.
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:29.160]   I don't-- the whole point was I didn't want to get in the car and drive to Target or I would have bought it there.
[00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.160]   Right.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:33.160]   So one version of the world that I was talking to venture capitalists last week and he was like,
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:39.160]   well, you know, eBay or-- sorry, Walmart and Target and Kmart, you know, when they all go out of business,
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:42.160]   what they'll turn into is just distribution centers because they already have the whole shipping
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.160]   network.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.160]   It's big lock boxes.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.160]   And then they'll deliver stuff to your house so you never have to leave.
[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.160]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:49.160]   So you still get delivery in your door.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.160]   Well, the only thing shipping is expanding all over the place.
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:55.160]   Or a different alternate reality is like Uber has delivered-- has turned into this massive logistics network.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:59.160]   So what if instead of delivering you for one place to another in a black car, they bring you--
[00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.160]   Wait a minute, though.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.160]   --your phone you just ordered.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.160]   Isn't there-- I just got it.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.160]   There's already a company that comes to my door every day.
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.160]   They could be--
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:10.160]   Is it a company that lost 15.9 million left here?
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.160]   Yeah, the post, but they have to.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.160]   That's by contract with the government.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.160]   They have to lose money.
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.160]   No, seriously.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.160]   It's kind of like this scam.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.160]   It's not a real cost.
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.160]   But they're already coming to my door every day.
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.160]   They could just bring me stuff.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.160]   But the male guy comes.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:24.160]   He could just bring me stuff and then deliver it.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.160]   Wouldn't that--
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.160]   But did you order it 10 minutes ago?
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.160]   Nah, that's the key.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.160]   I thought you were talking about the pizza delivery guy.
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.160]   The pizza guy.
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.160]   So here's how we fix everybody's problems.
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.160]   You get the post off just today.
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.160]   To deliver pizza.
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:36.160]   To deliver pizza.
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.160]   Oh.
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.160]   No, Leo.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.160]   And then they make a billion dollars.
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.160]   We get our stuff the same day.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.160]   Yeah.
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.160]   Unicorns come into being spontaneously.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.160]   That would be nice.
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.160]   Yeah.
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.160]   Can the post man ride a unicorn?
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.160]   Why the hell not?
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.160]   Why the hell not?
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.160]   Isn't that snow crash?
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.160]   Isn't it snow crash?
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:01.160]   The government, the only thing the government does is the post office and pizza delivery.
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.160]   I think that's a snow crash.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.160]   You know, I think, am I wrong, but isn't the post office in the Constitution?
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:10.160]   No, isn't that a constitutional thing?
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.160]   No.
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:14.160]   They'd have to have a constitutional amendment to get rid of the--
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.160]   No.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.160]   They just announced they're stopping Saturday service.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.160]   But that's not in the Constitution.
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.160]   But you have to have a post office.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:24.160]   Well, now see, I'm seeing people nod, but they could be from Sweden.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.160]   So let me--
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.160]   I'm sure in Sweden it's in the Constitution.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.160]   What's the system in Buenos Aires?
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:36.160]   The postal clause, Article 1, Section 8, Clause 7 of the United States Constitution.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:41.160]   Empowers Congress to, quote, "establish post offices and post roads."
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:42.160]   Slow clap and be--
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.160]   What happened to the post roads?
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.160]   Nice, wicked pediatric.
[00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.160]   Do we--
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:46.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:47.160]   The roads we used today.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.160]   Oh, that's the highway.
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:49.160]   Yes.
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:53.160]   But maybe, you know, I'm thinking, and this is the problem with the Constitution.
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:55.160]   Maybe to them--
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:57.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.160]   A post office might mean something different to what we think of.
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:03.160]   It could be an office on the post road.
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:07.160]   But maybe it's like a shared office space where you could have a computer and a--
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.160]   See?
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.160]   Look at that.
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.160]   See?
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.160]   Isn't that good?
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.160]   Don't you like touch?
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.160]   I like it a lot.
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.160]   She's reaching over and touching my laptop.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.160]   There's a whole section on it.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.160]   We'll have it written or it's needing where I'm from.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:19.160]   Yeah, you read that and then we'll just--
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:20.160]   That'll be the show.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:22.160]   Uh--
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:24.160]   The Lord.
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:30.160]   The postal clause was added to the Constitution to primarily to facilitate interstate communication,
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:34.160]   as well as to create a revenue source for the early US.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:38.800]   John Jay in a letter to George Washington, a pint, that the postal service should not be
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.800]   burdened with a response.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.160]   Oh, you know why it was?
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.160]   I remember this now.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:48.160]   Ben Franklin established a private postal service because he was a newspaper publisher
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:52.160]   and he established it so he can get the scoops before anybody else in Philadelphia.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:56.160]   It was a-- it was a-- when an M profit things.
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.160]   Anyway, I'm going to move on now.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.160]   It's not going anywhere.
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:06.160]   I just-- I just think the post office could start delivering pizza and that would be really
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.160]   great.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.160]   Uh--
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.160]   The people who have to deliver you guys could start delivering mail.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.160]   Or advice to versa.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.160]   It doesn't really matter to me.
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.160]   If somebody comes to my door and brings my stuff, I'm happy.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:18.160]   We're going to take a break and talk about SimCity when we get back.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:19.160]   Play SimCity?
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.160]   You must play SimCity.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.160]   No, I have a job, Steve.
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:22.160]   I don't have a job.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.160]   There's my problem.
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.160]   If only I had to do something.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.160]   Dwight, you play SimCity?
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.160]   I started playing it today.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.160]   Yes, good.
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.160]   We'll talk about it.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.160]   First, I want to give you an iPad.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.160]   How about that?
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.160]   We got a giveaway from our friends at Citrix.
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.760]   Go to meeting.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:39.160]   You know about go to meeting, right, with HD faces.
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.560]   Awesome.

[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:53.240]   So with go to meeting, even though people are distributed all over both the people you're
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:56.960]   pitching to, clients, but also colleagues, it's hard to work together.

[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:13.760]   You're seeing their screen.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:16.080]   You're collaborating on documents online.

[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.680]   Did you all y'all got here on time?
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:57.840]   Y'all everybody sit there because now with computers it does it automatically, right?
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:00.840]   In fact, I have some clocks that don't and it feels like it's like a pain in the bus.
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:03.240]   Like why don't you set yourself automatically?
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.240]   What's wrong with you?
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:06.600]   I had to turn my watch ahead.
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:08.560]   Do we really need daylight savings time?
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:09.720]   Another Ben Frank saving.
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:10.720]   Oh, I see.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:11.720]   All right.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:12.720]   See, you see that?
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:13.720]   He's put a sign up because I say savings.
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:14.720]   I was wondering what that is.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:15.720]   Do you say saving good?
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:18.000]   Saving daylight saving time.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   That makes more sense.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   It makes more sense.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   But it's saving savings.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   Yeah, it's saving.
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   Like no one says the extra R in February.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.080]   He's saving the man at you.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.080]   What are you doing?
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.080]   You're saving daylight.
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.080]   You're saving daylight.
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:29.080]   John, John.
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:30.080]   Why isn't there a hyphen?
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.080]   Daylight saving time.
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:35.800]   When you put, did we talk about that before when you put the sign up about saving?
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:36.800]   Let's go.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:37.800]   Okay.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:38.800]   You were just writing the hyphenation.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:39.800]   That's right.
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.240]   No, he knew I would say.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.240]   So here's the deal.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.080]   There's a petition at whitehouse.gov.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:48.640]   You eliminate the biannual time change caused by daylight savings.
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:52.080]   15,000 googers can't be wrong.
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:53.080]   You need 100,000 votes.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.080]   I mean, we're adults.
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:56.080]   We have 100,000 votes.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.080]   Well, they said that.
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:59.120]   It says it needs 100,000 votes.
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:00.120]   Then the White House will respond.
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:01.120]   You're right.
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:02.120]   It seems like that number's gotten bigger.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.120]   Yeah, wasn't it like 25?
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:04.120]   Yeah, it used to be.
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:06.320]   Yes, they increased it after, I think, the text.
[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:07.320]   It's gotten too popular.
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:09.520]   It got too easy.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.760]   I talked to somebody on the digital team at the White House.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:12.760]   He says, we don't care about that.
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:14.720]   We just want your email address so we can mail you.
[00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.120]   They just did the cell phone unlocking thing, though.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.480]   They just reversed themselves on that because of the petition.
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.680]   But they had no way of law.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:22.680]   No.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:24.680]   But now there's a bill proposed.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:25.680]   Right, right.
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.680]   So it can have some white.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.680]   You're right.
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:30.760]   There was a petition that said it should be legal because it's currently illegal to unlock
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:32.520]   your cell phone.
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:33.880]   So somebody created a petition.
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:35.040]   It got sufficient signatures.
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:37.400]   The White House responded and said, we agree.
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:40.280]   And now, three members of Congress have proposed such a law.
[00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.280]   I think they're right.
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.280]   You made two different proposals.
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:43.280]   It's become a thing.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:48.120]   And AT&T says, by the way, regardless, we're going to unlock it if you're a customer in
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.120]   good standing.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.360]   So don't worry about it.
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.480]   I think the AT&T doesn't want to law passed.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.320]   They just, they said, we'll take, trust us.
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.320]   We'll unlock it.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:57.400]   It's not a problem.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:00.640]   Anyway, daylight saving time, bad idea, good idea.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.280]   I ask you, panel.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.280]   I'm pro daylight.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:04.280]   It's kids.
[00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.120]   I'm with Liz.
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.120]   I think it's fine.
[00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.120]   I think it should stay.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:11.720]   And I think if that's the thing, you're going to petition the government to change.
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:13.320]   It does seem like a minor.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.400]   Priorities, y'all.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.520]   We got gay marriage on the table.
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:19.400]   We've got phone unlocking still relatively minor.
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:23.520]   There are people in our country who are hungry, who are homeless, who are uneducated, who are
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:24.520]   illiterate.
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:25.520]   But they could be doing it in the sun, huh?
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:28.680]   Daylight saving time is what you're picking on with the potential.
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.320]   The government could multitask.
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:31.320]   It could do more than one thing.
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.320]   That's a good point.
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:33.320]   This is just so minor.
[00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:37.000]   And I can't imagine that anybody but stoners really cares about this.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:43.720]   So if you've had kids and you spent a few kids, try to get them to go to sleep at night
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.320]   and it's still light out.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:50.760]   And particularly if you had a place like you're in Seattle, where it stays late until 1030
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.840]   at night, daylight saving time is kind of anachronistic.
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:46:01.040]   It was originally set up to provide the extra daylight and to prevent the burning of electric
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:08.360]   lights, but electric lights now are so minimal a part of what burns electricity that it isn't
[00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.160]   having that much of an effect.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.360]   And it's confusing.
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:14.960]   They're also apparently are health issues related to it.
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.400]   So I think it's the sun.
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:22.320]   Yes, he's all sex disorder syndrome.
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:24.440]   So it does seem anachronistic.
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:29.680]   I think it was really for farmers to give them more daylight to perform their chores.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:32.160]   But now we have lights.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:35.280]   But farmers are still listening.
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:39.600]   And there's never been any evidence that saves energy, which was the more modern excuse,
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:40.600]   right?
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:41.600]   Oh, it's good for energy saving.
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:44.000]   How about we've been doing it this long.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.280]   Why stop now?
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:50.480]   This is one of the least fact based arguments I've ever had.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:51.880]   Heart attacks.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:54.520]   Okay, I'll give you some.
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:57.120]   This is from the Huffington Post.
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:03.800]   Sarah Klein writing, "Heart attacks go up in the first few days after the change, as
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.840]   do workplace injuries.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:07.840]   Workers are less productive.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:13.520]   And according to this article, more likely to waste time perusing the internet."
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.880]   It's good for the internet, but bad for the economy.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:23.200]   This comes from the American Psychological Institute or Association, lost sleep and cyber
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:28.480]   loafing evidence from the lab and a daylight savings time quasi experiment.
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:29.480]   Cyber loafing.
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:30.480]   Cyber loafing.
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:34.320]   Say that one more time with a straight face.
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:35.320]   Cyber loafing.
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.000]   You can order that on Amazon Prime.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.600]   The internet, this is the abstract.
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.760]   The internet is a powerful tool that has changed the way people work.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:46.480]   However, the ubiquity of the internet has led to a new workplace threat to productivity.
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.040]   Cyber loafing.
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:52.960]   As opposed to water cooler loafing or all the other kinds of loafing that people used
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:53.960]   to do.
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:59.480]   But you see, this builds on the ego depletion model of self regulation.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:00.720]   Tell me more about that.
[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:06.200]   In this we examine how lost and low quality sleep influence employees cyber loafing behaviors.
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.560]   Don't, isn't that true though, really?
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.360]   If you didn't sleep well, don't you kind of...
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:13.040]   What kind of adult can't just remember to go to bed now or early?
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:17.000]   Because your body doesn't know that, your brain does, but your body thinks it's an hour
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.680]   early, right?
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:19.680]   That's the problem.
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:20.680]   It's just not a real problem.
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:23.760]   You'll have heart attacks, the number of car crashes increases on the Monday after the
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:25.360]   time switch.
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:27.720]   The fatal alcohol related accidents go up.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.000]   Is this not a strong argument?
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   Alcohol related accidents.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   I was going to blame that on...
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   I was going to blame that on...
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   Do you like seeing that a few years ago?
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.640]   And as, when I was there, they were changing the side of the road that people drove on.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:38.640]   Oh, that's not a good idea.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:39.640]   Talk about something.
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.880]   That's an artificial change that the government makes.
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:42.880]   Why?
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:45.880]   Because they're more, that used to be more aligned with the US economy and now they're
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:47.480]   more aligned with the New Zealand economy.
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.480]   And so the cars that they get coming in.
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:50.480]   Have a steering wheel.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:52.000]   Have a steering wheel on the other side.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.360]   But if you talk about like, so overnight they repainted the roads with arrows, just the middle
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:59.360]   of the arrow, just the lengthy part.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:05.360]   And then in the middle of the night they went in and erased the triangle part on one side
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:06.760]   and put it on the other side.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:07.760]   Horrible.
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:08.760]   Talk about something that...
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:12.080]   It's accidents.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:17.080]   So this study comes from the Health and Human Service Department at Mendocino College.
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:21.240]   The hypothesis was that sleepiness and alcohol interact to increase the risk of alcohol for
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.280]   related traffic fatalities.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:28.640]   They assessed total alcohol-related fatal traffic crashes in the state of New Mexico
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:33.360]   from 1989 through 1992 for each of the seven days that preceded the changes to and from
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.400]   daylight savings time.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:40.840]   Consistent with our hypothesis, the percentage of alcohol-related fatal crashes increased significantly
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:41.840]   during the first seven days.
[00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:44.000]   No, no, I'm calling BS on this.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   This is a study.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.320]   Alcohol-related fatalities in car crashes is due to people, poor judgment.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.040]   But they went up because they were sleepy.
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:54.600]   No, because they were drinking and driving, sir.
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:55.600]   Not because they were sleepy.
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:56.800]   But they always drink and drive.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.760]   But it was worse during the...
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:49:59.760]   Because it was dark.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.480]   I feel like I need a hug.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:02.480]   This is a terrible...
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.120]   Aww, thanks for the muffins.
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:08.480]   According to a poll conducted by mattress company Sleepies
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:17.800]   of people
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:22.600]   Support switching the start of daylight saving time to 2 a.m. Saturday morning
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:26.720]   So so there's one the drunk drivers in the mattress and the mattress company
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:33.040]   Thousands of sleepyheads have signed to weed the people petition to do away with day-night savings time or make it a year-round
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:39.840]   Standard I think that's reasonable. It's really hard for the body to adjust. I'm tired right now. Maybe it's a story. I don't know
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:44.720]   Moving along. That's not even a tech story. What kind of muffins did you bring us?
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:50.000]   Double chocolate orange muffins with a creamy quantro glaze. Would you like one orange?
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:56.880]   Muffin that sounds like a cupcake. No, no girl. It's a muffin. It is a muffin here. I'll have a third one just to prove it
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:02.040]   I am so jealous. I think the thing that keeps it from being a cupcake is
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.780]   It doesn't have a muffin top though for nunciation
[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:09.560]   Well, some of them have muffin tops. You just got to get one that's
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:17.760]   So cute. All right. Yeah, Liz go on keep your strength up because of that daylight savings time
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:22.200]   All right, what about the eye watch? Well, the quantro make me drive drunk on my way home. Yes
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:27.680]   I've boiled out all the alcohol, so it's all just like orange flavored
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.440]   Should we talk about the eye watch?
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:39.080]   Okay, sure that Liz has a mouthful of muffins. So we'll let you Leo. Can you can you get Google shopping express to bring me a muffin, please?
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:42.360]   Same day delivery
[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:47.360]   Yeah, that'd be cool too bad. They don't have Sunday deliveries at the post office anymore
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:52.800]   Or Saturday sim city. Oh you played sim city. I like sim city and of course
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:58.520]   this is the first new version in years right how many years since the last sim city four or five years but
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:02.240]   a lot of complex how many 10 years
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:05.080]   Wow
[00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:09.200]   Wow, wow don't confuse sim city with the sims. They've been doing sim sim sims
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:18.120]   But they're back to the city although you can zoom on on the city and see like sim like things inside the buildings folks say that it's
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:19.800]   as
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:25.080]   Complex as urban planning. It's like a hair spread the way from actual urban planning
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.440]   well somebody at
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:31.760]   Electronic arts out of plan some server planning because just
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:35.880]   mess in fact such a mess that they're giving everybody who
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:40.000]   Bought sim city in the first couple of weeks of the month a free game
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.840]   they acknowledged it and
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:50.600]   Part of the problem is this is this is now you guys obviously play sim city. You're like really into it right in our front row
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:55.200]   Yeah, so this is a single-player game. It's not a social game or is it?
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:58.600]   Oh, it is a social game. It is a social game the new one is sort of social
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:02.240]   But but you can't even play the single-player game without logging in
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:07.320]   Right, so if you want to build up your city while you're on an airplane you cannot do it
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:13.280]   Oh, it's a great way to kill time on an airplane because it's so intricate and so detailed and
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:18.960]   But you but you know unless it has Wi-Fi and a decent Wi-Fi connection at that you're not gonna be able to do it
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:24.200]   Well and because in the first few days of the launch the servers were killed or slammed
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:27.800]   There were a lot of people who had the game who could not play because they couldn't get into a server
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:36.680]   When I installed it today it gave me a list of servers that were available and I would say maybe only about a third of the servers that
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:42.520]   Were were available were optional where where I could get on to the rest of them were all full
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:48.040]   And this despite the fact that electronic arts has put on a bunch of new servers for this
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:51.160]   Let me see if I can get into a server here
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:58.280]   In fact, I saw a story just before we went on the air that they are taking the existing servers down to update them one by one and bring
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:02.640]   The backup so it's gonna be it worked to be bad. It's gonna get worse before it gets better
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:06.360]   I just want to talk to somebody who does like their infrastructure stuff
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:09.960]   That would be a really fascinating conversation to see what they're doing
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:14.720]   Years the next 10 years. Yeah, so this kind of crap doesn't happen
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:18.640]   Well, but also more people get online and have disposable income to do this kind of crap
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:23.240]   I think that you should not have to get online to every the whole time you're playing
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:30.000]   Basically, this is copy protection. They make sure that only you are playing your copy of SimCity
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:35.440]   I remember playing SimCity in the mid 90s in our school computer lab with the dial up connection
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:39.840]   And that was like the reason you played it with school because you could actually get online. It was faster
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:44.480]   Let me see. I've just gotten back online. I had to restart because they had an update
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:47.360]   They've been updating almost every day. It seems like every time I launch it
[00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:49.800]   Okay, North America
[00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:54.800]   Europe West is full oceanic. It looks like I can get North America West to is available
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:56.760]   But there are a lot as you can see there are a lot of full servers
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:03.920]   But there are there are sufficient I would say number available in fact. They've these are this is many more North American servers
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:07.840]   And they've had in the past and I this is the first time I've seen so many available
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:10.240]   It's a fun game
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:15.560]   It's a great game. It's a lot, but it is it's like it's much more work than the previous
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:19.400]   I mean they've all been very detail oriented you had to pay attention to a lot of different things
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:23.720]   But this like Jolie said is like up at a level almost like city planning
[00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:28.840]   When we when one of the earlier versions came out and I was working at the San Antonio newspaper
[00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:36.120]   We got the city manager in San Antonio to sit down and play the game and see how he did he didn't do very well
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:38.120]   Which I thought
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:45.300]   Maxis senior vice president Lucy Bradshaw said a lot more people logged on than we expected more people
[00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:50.120]   Played and played in ways we never saw in the beta. That's kind of interesting to you you let it out to the public
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:58.320]   She says okay. We agree that was dumb, but we're committed to fixing it. We've increased server capacity by a hundred twenty percent in the last 48 hours
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:03.120]   Does that mean they just threw more machines at it? Yeah, the real question is
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:09.080]   Which she's dodging a little bit is should you have to be able to log on to play a game if you're just playing by yourself
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:14.680]   Do you it really does seem like it's a copy protection scheme that failed
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:16.880]   there's a chat realmer
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:20.500]   Pete Fick who had a chat log with some of the
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:24.220]   People and he asked for his money back and they said no
[00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.100]   We're not gonna give you your money back and then he said well
[00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:30.020]   I can just cancel it on the account and they'll say well will ban your EA account
[00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:34.140]   Wow if you try to do that EA now while that was a you know horrible
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:39.340]   Response from them EA did actually respond and say that they won't ban his account Wow
[00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:45.920]   All right, well, that's the price we pay it. It's not the first time this kind of thing has happened
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:51.780]   In fact, I think back to some blizzard games and so forth. This is not that three Diablo three Diablo three. Yeah
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:58.400]   I mentioned the eye watch I probably should should talk about it. I'm sick to death of it
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:05.140]   Have you got any you have one you got one on you? No, no, you got a band Wow. I've seen one of those
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:11.740]   That's a dinosaur. No, this is the new one. That's the new up. Yeah, it works. You didn't you didn't you didn't you didn't die
[00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:15.620]   My mind neither, but I just decided to stop worrying because everybody else has died
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:20.540]   Well now you have people to share with so but here okay, so you're wearing one of those
[00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:25.420]   I wore the Nike life band and there's a lot of other stuff. This one has the nicest software
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:28.340]   I've tried all and I like job on software
[00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:33.260]   I agree it actually and it does the sleep stuff right with this with a single device instead of having you put on a
[00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:37.340]   Different wristband for sleep and that's good. I then fuel band is a beautiful watch
[00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:43.260]   It is a nice watch you press the button tells you that you're a prime candidate then for an Apple watch aren't you?
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:47.380]   Well, I think the Apple watches maybe a little bit more like the pebble where it would be like a
[00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:51.820]   Tie to a phone a fake yeah like an alternate notification screen, which would be nice
[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:56.260]   But then if it also did GPS if it did both of those things together. Yeah, that'd be pretty cool
[00:57:56.260 --> 00:58:02.220]   Would you prefer Google Glass? I also pre-ordered a Google Glass. Yeah, so do that you too. Yep
[00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:06.100]   Don't you think we're gonna look like a bunch of dorks in about three months when we're sitting here with a little
[00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:11.140]   My husband oh you're like Aaron where let him look like a door you wouldn't wear so you bought it as a gift
[00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:17.580]   I bought it as a gift. I'm not you wouldn't I don't like always on technology. I find it invasive and dehumanizing
[00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:22.860]   You don't even carry a cell phone. You're the last person. I actually I do I had to start my boss yelled at me so much
[00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:25.540]   I had to start carrying where you know again where do you leave your cell phone?
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:30.980]   I I had no phone for six months and fast six months of my life that I went to a feature phone
[00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:32.980]   I know I'm using a smartphone again
[00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:36.220]   I'm sure at Google I'll be testing whatever they roll out there for a while
[00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:42.780]   So I met you Google I will be giving out something like a glass last year you could pre-order the glass and
[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:46.540]   It hasn't even like shipped they haven't shipped the pre-orders yet
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:47.620]   And this is almost a year ago
[00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:52.860]   Right if they give away glass for free that I had to pre-order that would be annoying price of a car
[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:58.740]   That would be beyond but they haven't charged us. They haven't charges yet. So presumably they wouldn't charge you if they gave it to you
[00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:06.340]   Right, maybe they're just assessing interest. Maybe how many people would actually say they'd pay $1,500 for this we did
[00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:09.540]   Yeah, quite a few yeah, thousand thousand
[00:59:09.540 --> 00:59:12.140]   500 how many fifty five hundred Wow
[00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:17.860]   Did you get one - do I know I know that I'm just not gonna pay that much for it
[00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:20.180]   But I'll get it when it's fit when it's 500. I
[00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:23.620]   Don't think I wonder if it'll ever be 500. Yes
[00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:28.100]   So I have a question about it that I haven't seen answered if you already wear glasses
[00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:33.780]   How does how do you deal with they are apparently the rumor is they're gonna be working with companies like Warby Parker?
[00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:36.940]   To offer prescription lens versions
[00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:40.860]   Yeah, I've seen a question a bunch of times and yeah
[00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:43.240]   Well a lot of the people on the team wear glasses
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:50.340]   So they they have some kind of ride-along modifier when they also have ones with sunglasses right snap-in lenses. Yeah
[00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:56.740]   I'm not wearing it on top Raffi and our Ralph in our chat room says you just put it right over your glasses. No, that's not a good look
[00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:59.140]   I am not doing that
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:04.140]   It's just cool
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:07.680]   Really? Yeah, what would you do with Google Glass if you had glasses they say
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:14.720]   Well, I think that you would stop having good eye contact with other you would you be looking over their shoulder most of the time
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:23.200]   Your sentences are like being able to stop suddenly you wouldn't have to do this reach down to your screen and Wikipedia something because you'd already be doing it
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:23.960]   How would I do that?
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:29.880]   I would have to stop the conversation go like rub my temple and say Wikipedia postal service
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:34.180]   Constitution well, I mean, it's what you already do when you have a conversation on your smartphone
[01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:38.040]   I mean it pisses everybody it pisses me off so much to see people in the middle of a conversation
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:40.480]   Just look like they're not paying attention at all when they're looking things up
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:46.660]   Yeah, I think it's really weird paradox where there's where you're trying to get away from the smartphone universe where you're walking around with this phone
[01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:49.840]   Attached to your hand all the time and you're putting in a different place in your body
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:53.560]   That's like less intrusive for you, but way more intrusive for everyone else
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:59.600]   It's just you know, it's a trade-off. We're just walking towards what where at some point the embedded device will be embedded in
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:05.360]   Us or it'll be like a contact lens or it'll be an earpiece or something. We're getting there
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:10.360]   We're getting there slowly and I think the one comparison that people don't make as much as they could is that
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.960]   Google Glass is actually really like the pebble
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:18.720]   Yes, it takes pictures and videos and you can swing your kids around and take a video of them like every single demo
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:19.480]   They've ever done
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:24.280]   But you also the main thing for is you get a text message and it pops up saying like here's your text message
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.440]   It's right over your right eye
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:29.280]   You can see what it is you can decide if you want to take deal with it or not in that moment
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.960]   And that's why I also pre-ordered the pebble watch and I still haven't gone because I chose changed my color
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:36.840]   I got red and I don't have mine either. Why did I change my color?
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:41.480]   Everybody with blacks got them. Yeah, so but that's like, you know, you're washing the dishes and you look down your hand
[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:42.800]   Oh, do I want to deal with that text message?
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:47.200]   So it gets it gets you a little bit back into your environment and back into doing what you want to do
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:53.120]   Guy wearing Google Glass walks into a Seattle dive bar. Wait a minute not so fast apparently not
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:58.700]   The Emerald City 5 point bar is banning Google Glasses. This is a good PR
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:02.200]   This would be the kind of joint I would run. It's a good PR stunt
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:06.120]   It doesn't exist no one has yet walked in wearing it, but we're gonna ban it
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:11.720]   And you're talking about it. I got I got everywhere everybody picked it up. It's a big story. It's on the UPI
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:19.760]   What do you okay? We got two women here. What do you think about Sergei Bryn saying looking at a phone is emasculating?
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:22.600]   This was it Ted you were there I was and I I
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:28.880]   Wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt and think that he had some weird word choice going on there or that he was
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:34.720]   Using some other definition that wasn't totally weird in sexist, but I don't know. I mean he's up on stage
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:39.840]   He knows he's being watched and he did say that I think what he was basically saying is that when you're hunched over your phone
[01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:41.560]   Sorry, I was finishing my bite of yeah
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:45.200]   I noticed I haven't bit in mind because I am when you're hunched over your phone
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:49.680]   You're away from the world. It's not a power position. You're kind of like being submissive
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:52.680]   I don't know. I don't even want to go there because that's just a horrible
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:57.760]   It's a bad choice and you know when you're an executive of one of the top companies in the world and you're talking
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:01.240]   This was it Ted that he said this you're talking to a room full of eggheads
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:05.160]   You would think you would choose your words remarkably carefully
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:07.280]   Yeah, so maybe he chose the word and
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.880]   Masculating on purpose to make a controversial
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:13.600]   Sexist so we talk about it so that we talk about it now
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:16.520]   I think he's just a huge nerd who doesn't think about what his words mean
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:20.240]   No, you have to know that someone reviewed what he was going to say and someone somewhere
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.840]   He was just pulled up on stage out of the audience. You know he might be a huge
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.340]   You're a he's an I shouldn't say that
[01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:27.880]   If you look at your phone, he's a sex
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:38.000]   It's pretty obnoxious I don't in so many ways even for guys
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.480]   It's obnoxious for both men and women to say that yeah, I mean I look at my phone all the time
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:45.480]   I don't feel that it's a masculine
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.480]   Is she masculated? I
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:50.720]   Feel so good when I'm on my computer
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:56.160]   I just you know that was that was totally an infomercial and
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:01.840]   Well, I'll tell you I figured out what's going on the whole thing that's going on right now is they understand that if you
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:06.920]   Wear these things you look like a you know freak. It's the same problem the same way right right the segue was really cool
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:09.080]   But anybody a road one looked like a dork
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:16.560]   So there is a campaign a very active campaign going on and Sergei's leading it to make it cool to wear these
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:21.600]   To look like a dork right right so you can either look like a dork or be emasculated your children
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:25.600]   I mean, you heard the dork and own it be like I am proud to be a dork
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:28.380]   He and his wife has nothing to do with gender or masculating
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:30.560]   Did you see that his wife turned up on TMZ?
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:37.440]   Yeah, she was wearing it and it was it was at the Oscars after party at Vanity Fair and a TMZ photographer
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:42.240]   Interviews her puts up story up and they're like we found a mysterious woman who has a pair of Google Glass
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:46.580]   She calls herself and 12 hours later update. She's married to
[01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:50.400]   Are you a moron TNC?
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:56.520]   Mysterious and what's your key? Well, Chadi say that what chick-chee what chick-chee? Wojcicki. All right
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:05.900]   But Sergei and and both wear these glasses to the Vanity Fair party. Yes, you know why marketing celebrities talk to them
[01:05:05.900 --> 01:05:11.520]   But also the point is to try to make this
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:14.480]   Hip isn't it yes
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:23.560]   I mean that the segue for your face metaphor really works. It's I didn't come up with it, but I can't forget it
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:28.480]   Yeah, yeah, cuz segue was brilliant segue is cool segway the technology and segue is amazing
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:33.000]   Nobody's denying that but anybody who rides one around looks like a 10-foot tall dork
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.640]   Yes, and that's and I I'm in the opinion
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.720]   That's what killed it because in every other respect. It's very neat
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:45.240]   But if you look like a dork riding around on it, it's also just technology for technology sake well that might be and it crosses weird borders
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:47.240]   I mean it's motorized vehicle
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:53.920]   Okay technology for technology sake check crosses weird borders check. Yeah, you look like an alien
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:06:00.280]   And you're tapping your temple all the time and looking over people's shoulders
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:03.760]   Yeah, taking videos of people in locker rooms and doing all sorts of really offensive
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:07.400]   I get I've been on a tear about this for a couple of weeks, and I'm gonna stop but okay
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:12.560]   And I get a lot of email for people say you just have no vision Leo. You have no foresight
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:19.200]   You're you're such a troll. This is obviously the next big thing and I will wear it. You're the troll. I'm the troll
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:25.440]   Okay, you're aware wondering who the troll so the so the best profession for this is journalists
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:30.920]   I mean I can see every journalist when I have this you know because you don't have to touch you know take notes
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:36.280]   You can you can take web video probably initially not broadcast quality video
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:40.480]   But this is a journalist tool and that's why journalists are all excited and talking about it
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:46.480]   I don't think anybody you know in real life is necessarily thrilled about Google Glass. It's tech journalists
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:48.480]   That's what I think and that's kind of the point I've been making
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:51.480]   I don't mean
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:55.040]   Interviews from your face
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:59.880]   Yeah, right I mean what about someone who's a biker and they just don't want to check their phone when they get an email
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:06.120]   There I mean there's okay. They're use cases. That's all you need is things popping up while you're right, you know
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:12.880]   Writing downhill quick. What if you're a sculpting ice sculptures of tigers like the person in the demo video?
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:18.600]   I mean I do that all the time. There's four of those. Okay, that's more I'll tell you one thing
[01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:21.760]   There'll be more drunk driving accidents the day Google Glass comes out
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:34.760]   All right, we're gonna talk about why Marissa Meyer put out that memo because it turns out she had data she's data driven
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:39.760]   We all know that but first I was two weeks ago story is that really old?
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:46.120]   No, but but we now know according to business insider that she figured it out by looking at the parking lot and
[01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:48.720]   the sparse VPN logins and
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:54.400]   Figured out the people not only are not here, but they're not logging into VPN. They're just slacking slacking
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:57.960]   Okay, you're right. There's nothing more here
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:05.860]   I'll talk about Microsoft having to pay money to the Danish government until you how about that?
[01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:13.040]   What oh no the Marissa Meyer's in late. She's just a bad person and that's why she did it
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:16.000]   No, I had a theory which I think this confirms which is
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.040]   she saw read she looked she saw these numbers and
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:23.400]   It would have been wise for her to not
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:27.080]   Go ballistic, but she did and she wrote and she said you know what?
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:31.200]   This is stopping because I'm pissed off and the wise thing to do would be just to quietly
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.560]   fire those people
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:36.960]   And no one would have said anything but putting out a memo
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:49.480]   I mean, I think it's an interesting approach to a problem. It's not a manager's approach. It's like an engineer's approach, right?
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:51.160]   I mean she's a driven baby. Yeah
[01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:56.440]   So you know it everyone expects Yahoo to do layoffs because they're accompanied in trouble that she's trying to do a
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:00.040]   Turn around should be no big story by instead. She says well. Here's a good way
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:04.360]   We can isolate a large percentage of right slackers, right?
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:06.060]   I'm not them keep their jobs still
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:11.400]   And I think it's a policy that's insensitive to a lot of things that you should be respectful of as a CEO
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:14.120]   Number chiefly PR
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:18.320]   Frankly, I mean really if she if she had run this by the PR division
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:21.000]   There's that you know we can handle this without getting in the news
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.640]   You're gonna get in the news if you put out this memo
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:26.960]   They're gonna get in the news no matter what she does anything if she sneezes is wrong
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.960]   It's gonna be written up by business insider
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:37.160]   Not if you put out a you know if you have a company policy where the HR manager calls the person and says you know
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:39.760]   You're not you know, this is working out. They sent out
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:44.820]   They sent out welcome back packages to people that they had fired and that became a news story like anything
[01:09:44.820 --> 01:09:49.840]   She does gonna be a right maybe you're right. Yeah, I think she said we're just gonna take the bull by the horns
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:54.680]   You're right. It was insensitive to you know people who have families people who want better quality of life
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:56.680]   And don't have to drive down the Yahoo every day
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:58.880]   They still have jobs
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:00.360]   That's the good news
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:06.120]   Somebody told me the real there is some of the other theory other conspiracy theory was this was to get rid of these people without having to pay
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:09.600]   Unemployment because she figured they'd quit as soon as they were told now you're gonna come to the office
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.520]   They go screw that and
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:15.520]   Then we wouldn't have to worry about it. They're just all gonna quit actually might have been the real strategy
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:17.520]   I don't know I could see that happening
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:22.720]   It's because unemployment's you know, that's not cheap our show brought to you by carbonite online
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:26.600]   Backup if you are not backing up well, I don't want to hear from you saying
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:30.640]   Oh, I lost all my financial records or my emails or those baby pictures
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:35.160]   Replacible pictures from my wedding you got your wedding pictures on your hard drive a bit Jolie
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:41.800]   No, you you have a book you have a printed book don't you of my wedding pictures? Yeah, I think there's still um a
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:43.800]   CD some
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:48.640]   See gotta back them up yes, I do and if you're the photographer you really cuz you don't want a bride
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:53.260]   Zilla named Jolie Odell coming at you say where's my pictures exactly no one wants that no one
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:11:00.840]   He weren't a bride Zilla you were probably really fun. I was a great way. It was my day of cake
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:04.200]   Yeah, how could I not be this is every day a day of cake for you though?
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:07.940]   I'm thinking let's lent now so muffins. What did you give up you gave up cake for Lynn?
[01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:11.000]   That's why you're calling them cupcake or muffins. You got it girl
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:18.760]   No, I'm just doing like traditional fasting. Oh, that's good. You don't eat during the day
[01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:23.640]   I eat just drink rock star during the day to make me not crazy. Well, Sunday's a day of
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:27.040]   lenience on that stuff. It's good. Let's get back to this good for you
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:29.040]   About backing up that sounds fascinating
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.880]   Tell it again Leo
[01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:39.240]   Carmanite online back. Okay, here's the here's the three things it is automatic
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:42.120]   So you don't have to think about it continuous whenever you're online. It's backing up
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:45.880]   So you make a change to a document boom is backed up and off site
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:50.240]   That's the most important thing because if there's a fire a flood if something breaks in and steals all your stuff
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:53.480]   You don't want the backups to go with the original you want to have a backup off site
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:59.280]   Carbonite does it for you Mac or PC. It's secure uses SSL so you can use it anywhere

[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.400]   car boom night
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.200]   So
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:53.640]   Good news and bad news for Microsoft the bad news is they may owe Denmark a billion dollars in taxes
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:58.760]   The Danish government says yeah, you didn't pay your taxes. They didn't say it like that though
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:02.600]   Maybe they did I don't it was probably written down
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:05.080]   It was probably they probably didn't call
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:09.880]   Several billion Danish croner
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:15.800]   According to a report from the Danish national broadcasting company is that
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:23.040]   Microsoft or the company they acquired that it was because they acquired an Amazon now. It's Microsoft now an ad vision
[01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:27.400]   I should say now it's their problem. Yeah, and they got a huge fine
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:34.360]   A billion here billion there starts to add up
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:40.840]   700 was it 732 million dollars to the EU for a mistake?
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:47.040]   This was we talked about this on Windows weekly when it happened. We just we were stunned so Microsoft the EU and
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:49.320]   Microsoft agreed in an antitrust
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:56.480]   Case with the EU the EU said, you know you browse you by building in Internet Explorer the same old story
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:01.400]   You're not giving the competitors an affair shake so Microsoft in a settlement said all right
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:07.520]   We'll put a ballot in in the European Union. It's the goofiest thing the browser ballot when you first start up Windows
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:10.120]   You'll get a ballot that says
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:13.200]   here's here's your choices and
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:21.320]   And which browser would you like to use let me see if I can find a picture of the of the browser
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.320]   Do you you had one shed that was it's just crazy
[01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:27.440]   But the crazier thing is they did it and
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:33.480]   Then they issued a service pack that accidentally took it out and no one noticed for there it is
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:37.960]   Select your web browser and by the way it randomizes the eight or nine browsers
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:40.000]   So you don't know what the first one will be right there
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:47.800]   It looks like Chrome firefox Safari Internet Explorer and Opera. What is this from this is Windows in Europe when you install it
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:51.240]   You choose because of this this decision
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:52.960]   however
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:56.880]   Whoops took it out no one noticed for like a year
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:02.680]   And now the stories that Google might have ratted them out and opera no one
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:05.560]   We don't know no one noticed no one
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:14.440]   Notice apparently the regulator they accidentally removed the opportunity for competition and no one noticed no one sort of thing
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:22.080]   Well, no one said anything, but I mean Microsoft may have noticed well, I think they well
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.080]   I know you remember the 90s man
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:32.200]   So they say you remember that that one time I know but that one time but but seriously you you it took a year and a half
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:38.660]   The commission didn't even pay any attention sounds like they got lucky for a year and a half
[01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:44.440]   I eat going on they said it was service pack one a technical glitch released February 2011 and
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:48.320]   So the European Union sat up and noticed
[01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:52.680]   One of their engineers would have noticed the next day seems like it
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:56.040]   It does seem like it that's logical
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:00.040]   Um go with me I
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:02.960]   Can only speculate
[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:08.240]   So the Commission says between February 2011 and July 2012 when it was discovered
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:14.280]   Roughly 15 million Europeans who purchased new PCs running service pack one weren't shown the screen
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:16.800]   So they find Microsoft
[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:19.000]   $732 million
[01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:24.040]   How much money did they make in a year and a half off?
[01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:30.720]   I don't think you make more money off of IE than if somebody installs Chrome. Do you yeah because like default search stuff?
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:33.120]   Yeah, it's yeah, they wouldn't use Bing
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:41.200]   I what do you think Dwight? Do you think it's a mistake or it was intentional that profit though?
[01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:47.080]   Like if you just might be might be I don't know I think it's a mistake, but I think they noticed it then they just said
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:54.140]   But but what do you think they would assume that they'd get caught eventually remember the 90s?
[01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:58.600]   You didn't notice it the EU didn't I the regulator was hard to believe you know
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:03.720]   They have to inspect the code. I mean aren't they in that part of the deals it parent? Well, this was okay
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:07.280]   So it turns out they hadn't really set up any compliance
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:10.560]   Stuff yeah, I think this is the first time they ever
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:15.720]   Headalized someone breaking so they've now said oh and from now on we will be checking
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:22.680]   But they left that part they didn't set up any compliance group and so nobody was checking I
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:26.480]   I'm sure they assumed that opera would bitch if that happened
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:35.080]   Do you remember when windows Vista came out go back into the distant miss of time and when do the windows Vista came out?
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:38.560]   it was the first version of windows that had any kind of
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:46.000]   security software and it had Windows defender right and the companies that make security software like Norton and
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:52.360]   McAfee complained and so when you started up Vista when you first installed it it gave you the opportunity to choose
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:57.960]   Antivirus programs and there was a screen and it was randomized. I don't remember that
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:06.440]   It was built into Vista Wow and and I think it may even be in the first version of Windows 7, but it's not there now and
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:09.880]   I just wonder if when they took it out of
[01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:13.880]   Windows 7 it also oops got taken out of
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:16.880]   The weird maybe that's it
[01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:22.360]   Somebody in the chatroom asked a good question. Do you think the EU will make Chrome OS have a browser ballot?
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:26.480]   I'm sorry you have to use IE with Chrome
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:31.160]   Well, you can't use you can only use IE on the Metro side of
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:33.920]   Of Windows 8 right?
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:38.680]   No, I can use Chrome. I think that there's a Chrome on the Metro on the Metro side now
[01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:44.080]   I think there was a button that said would you like to use it? I don't know I can't remember but I think I think I think it
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:49.040]   Will make it the default and it will go back, but I think it's actually a classic version of Chrome
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:52.240]   I don't think it actually is a Metro version. Okay
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:58.200]   No, you're right and frankly the the desktop version of Chrome is not very good on Windows 8
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:02.240]   It's at least not on a good screen. It doesn't look very good
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:12.600]   Yeah, I think it was a mistake I think it is forgot okay
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:17.800]   Why would you why would you try to get away with that? It's such a great
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:19.040]   I came across
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:24.800]   You might like might be interested in it's like it's like saying I'll steal these muffins. No one will notice
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:30.800]   It's just like it was a mistake and they didn't notice for a year and they didn't they were right. I think they noticed
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:33.200]   But they stayed quiet. I agreed right
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:39.260]   That like I like that that's a good that's you you split the baby very solemn
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:44.840]   They did notice but they didn't mention well, you know once you have
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:50.120]   Nothing, but IE downloads coming out of or IE use coming out of Europe
[01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:55.760]   Don't you think you would see that in your servers and your server logs? Yeah, right because if they if they don't have it
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:20:03.040]   Well, they say they say it really impacted made Microsoft's Internet Explorer number three in Europe because of this and they didn't notice
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:07.760]   Number three the number three browser. I mean after the ballot
[01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:13.520]   Yeah, you're right. They must have noticed that what we're coming back. We're coming back
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:17.400]   No, cuz no, you know why cuz they said no, but we are that good of course. We're coming back
[01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:22.600]   Right. Yeah, it's not the browser ballot. We're just better
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:29.180]   IE is getting better. It's getting faster. I know I use it on this Windows
[01:20:29.180 --> 01:20:31.600]   focus on HTML5 and
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:34.400]   optimization for modern web applications
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:38.680]   Let's talk about privacy
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:46.600]   The United States customs and the Department of Homeland Security
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:53.400]   As said for some time that if you are within 100 miles of a border of a United States border
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:21:01.080]   We can search all your electronics forensically. We can go through everything without probable cause without any suspicion
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:04.080]   We just have have the right to do that
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:08.440]   The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals this week said no
[01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:17.720]   That is not okay. They slapped down the claim that customs agents can look at your stuff for evidence without reasonable suspicion
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:20.360]   This is really good news in fact. It's just stunning
[01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:23.920]   That the federal that the US government thought it could do this
[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:30.200]   Yeah, I find it's stunning that anyone thinks they wouldn't already just do it and that they have to ask anyone's permission or that they care
[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:32.960]   What the circuit says if you cross the border?
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:38.720]   They have to ask your permission because they have to say can I have your laptop so I can look for something on it
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:42.160]   Can I see what's going on with your laptop and people have been doing this?
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:45.000]   fortunately
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:50.160]   Somebody appealed in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has said no you have to have reasonable suspicion
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:55.800]   Before you can do this hard wear but they can still look at like all your online activity logs
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:22:01.920]   Can they without having well I assume they could use some sort of magical device. You're doing but for them
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:09.200]   The judges said a quick look or unintrusive search of a laptop things like saying can you turn it on?
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:13.480]   Let me see what windows you have open is okay the court said well
[01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:18.160]   It's like they said I think a judge said that without a warrant police can search a
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:23.280]   Mobile phone to find the phone number only without looking at any of the other data not in Texas anymore
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:26.360]   We're gonna talk about that. Oh, okay. Is that a thing to know? That's a thing to
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:31.520]   The Homeland Security now said we have the right to just seize the thing
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:37.280]   The seized to take take the computer and keep it and go through it whether there's reason a
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:42.760]   Caught reasonable cause or any reason to think there's this I mean this is criminal and it's been going on all this time
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:50.760]   The court said that a criminal history previous criminal history is sufficient cause I
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:57.040]   Mean there is I guess a higher standard if you're crossing into the United States, right? I mean you but
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:02.120]   The idea that they could just look at your stuff and see what's going on and really going fishing expeditions
[01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:07.240]   Let's see if you got any child pornography on here. Let's see if you got any bomb, you know blueprints on here
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:10.320]   Let's see what you're up to where what's in that bomb folder there?
[01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:14.120]   And you know I
[01:23:14.120 --> 01:23:22.600]   We I've heard from many visitors from international visitors over the years about this happening about just a terribly intrusive searches
[01:23:24.240 --> 01:23:27.040]   They may take it for you know weeks even months
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:32.800]   Just pretty awful. So I'm glad that this was written although
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:38.600]   There were a couple of dissents saying the government should mostly be free from the Fourth Amendment in this case
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:42.640]   Yeah, that's depressing isn't it?
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:45.600]   Wow
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:52.080]   No, I'll give you some good news and this comes out of Texas Texas is proposing one of the most sweeping mobile privacy laws
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:55.120]   Which would require law enforcement to get a warrant
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:59.760]   Even to get location data now, you know that's going on right now these so-called pen registers
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:07.080]   Which are not warrants they affect all the major mobile phone companies have portals that law enforcement can go to and for a fee
[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:11.960]   It's a spy guide is what it is and it's not just mobile phone companies and carriers
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:19.320]   It's every internet company they are required to comply with law enforcement requests about personal information right right?
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:21.600]   but
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:28.400]   In fact they like you so so sprint and T-Mobile and 18 T and Verizon you go to a website if you're a law enforcement
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:31.560]   You pay a buck 50 and I can say where was Jolie all week?
[01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:37.560]   You could even say I want to see all the emails who they went to and from you can't read the email
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.560]   But you can read who they went to and from
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:45.200]   These bills this bill is in front of the Texas legislature
[01:24:45.200 --> 01:24:49.440]   According to privacy experts the most sweeping ever
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:54.480]   In fact better protection than the federal than the federal bill. It was introduced this week
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:25:01.640]   Go ahead tell us about this a lot of this has some of its root in there's a lot of anti federalism sentiment
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:04.680]   Right, Texas legislature right very much a red state very much
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:10.400]   Tea party control I love the I love the Civil War statute in front of the state house
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:19.200]   Which says it's not it's not a civil war statute. It's the war between the states memorial right and it was the war over states rights
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:27.680]   Yes, yes, that's very very much a southern thing and and actually there was a lot of this anti federalism even during the
[01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:33.960]   George W Bush years, but obviously having a Democrat in the White House has intensified that
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:42.440]   But but this also goes against you know Texans are very much privacy oriented and and I think that this also kind of fits into that
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:48.600]   What's what's the most interesting thing about this is that it's not clear if the governor will sign this or not
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:52.920]   He's he in the past is not necessarily been friendly to this kind of thing funny
[01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:59.440]   It's you know, it's because he wants these powers. He wants text the Texas law enforcement to have these powers
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:05.200]   Well, and again, this is it'd be interesting to see what happens if this runs afoul of
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:07.640]   federal law that isn't this strict
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:17.240]   There was a Supreme Court decision last year that said that law enforcement could not put a GPS tracking device on a car without warrant
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:22.640]   But they can track you by your cell phone so they don't really need to right
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:29.960]   It's great because the ACLU of Northern California is in agreement with the Texas legislature. This is something you'll rarely see
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:33.880]   But I'm an agreement to I think that I hope this passes
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:42.800]   Who's the guy's who's the governor Rick Perry? Oh Rick Perry Rick Perry. Yes. Oh governor oops
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:49.120]   I'm glad he got a job. That's good
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:55.520]   He probably will get reelected also is he popular. Yeah. Yes. He is very popular. Yeah
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:27:00.880]   Well so interesting so he says so Perry says man, maybe I won't sign that
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:04.840]   He there has been there's
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:09.760]   Nothing firm. He's holding his cards close to chest, but the reporting that I've seen here
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:12.360]   It's not clear if he will or not
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:17.240]   Samsung is saying Windows 8 is the reason why nobody's buying PCs
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:20.240]   Wait what?
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:22.240]   Jung dung sue
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:30.000]   He's Samsung electronics head of memory chips as a dislikes windows 8 so much he told reporters in Seoul, South Korea today
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.640]   That the reason global peace she shipments are on in decline is that
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:37.200]   Windows 8 is no better than Vista
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:42.320]   Not because of you know the general trend toward mobile phones and tablets well
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:45.280]   That's what everybody else is saying and you know the bad economy and so forth
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:49.560]   But I have to say windows 8 has not been a boon for PC sales
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:53.000]   I don't think it's been
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:59.240]   Commercially available for long enough to even make that statement yet. Yeah has it came out in September. We've had a quarter
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:01.680]   We've had a quarter. I
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:05.720]   Think he's probably being a little mean it could it could be something mean. Yeah
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:11.440]   I feel like he's testing out the you know, we're Samsung now everyone's attention to us
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:19.560]   Yeah, and in fact, I bet you that has a relationship with Microsoft and you know, and they're not they want to be the power player
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:22.400]   Thanks. They're a loser saying that yeah, right?
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:31.640]   But these are the OEMs who were kind of burned a little bit by Microsoft releasing their first computers windows surface tablets and
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:35.280]   They may be they'd be a little miffed about that. I
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:40.520]   Don't know you think when I windows 8 I have these mixed opinions not I
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:46.680]   The reason I got this Acer laptop is I really wanted to give it a chance with really great hardware design for Windows 8
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:48.280]   I do like to touch
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:52.280]   But there's just some strange things like in fact the conclusion
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:58.200]   I've come to and Paul Thorett of our Windows weekly show kind of backs it up is the real problem with Windows 8 is it's two operating systems
[01:28:58.200 --> 01:29:02.720]   It's a touch tablet operating system and a desktop operating system
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:06.320]   And it's a little confusing because sometimes you'll launch a program and it behaves one way
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:10.320]   But oh, that's because I'm using the Metro program and not the desktop program
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:13.200]   And it's just have you Dwight are you using windows 8 nonstop now?
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:19.080]   I'm using windows 8 on a home-built Windows machine. Usually I use a Mac
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:25.280]   One of that I had that frustration to and you probably like it better because you have it on a touchscreen desktop
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:32.320]   That does make a difference. Yeah, I recently bought a touchpad designed by Logitech. It's called the T650
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:37.000]   That mimics the same gestures you have on the screen and it works really well
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.760]   It's about the size of the magic touchpad for the Mac
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:45.640]   Right and you can swipe from the edges and so forth just as you can on a touchscreen
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:48.960]   But you don't have to raise your hand up and so I find
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:54.760]   Using that that Windows 8 is a much better experience than it is if you're using it just with a mouse
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:30:00.160]   It's really strange to have to mouse to the corner to find the charms and all of that stuff, right?
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:03.240]   Right this this is a great product. I did a review of it
[01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:09.440]   And I think it is it really makes a big difference if you're using windows 8 on a traditional desktop
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:14.840]   Having said that and I'd agree with you. It's still a little weird
[01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:20.340]   Joly you're using a Mac which I don't even understand. I've never seen you use a Mac in my life
[01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:24.900]   It's my husband. So where's your so are you using windows 7 still bathtub?
[01:30:24.900 --> 01:30:29.480]   Yeah, no, I'm still using windows 7. Yeah cling to it to the bitter end. I actually enjoy it
[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:34.900]   But I think you would have I like windows 7 I think you and many people use what a 7 would go would be a little
[01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:37.360]   fuddled you know
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:40.640]   And I talked to the Microsoft folks about this
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:48.360]   I think that what they're doing right here is they're setting expectations for touch interaction that are not intuitive yet
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:52.720]   Because we are still babies when it comes to how do we use a touch operating system?
[01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:56.160]   What is a touch operating system? That's not just confined to a tiny mobile screen
[01:30:56.520 --> 01:31:02.240]   So I think that what they're doing is gonna cause some discomfort and I'm not willing to be uncomfortable yet
[01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:04.840]   So windows 7 right darn it. Yeah
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:09.400]   I mean if you go on the Chromebook pixel and then you try to start doing a multi-touch, you know
[01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:12.360]   It's not because it's not designed for it. Yeah, I mean
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:18.840]   But that's the other thing even on windows 8 some pages you can pinch right right
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:23.000]   So you can't think much and so we are in the early days of touch
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:27.540]   I disagree with you Jolie that touch is not intuitive. I think when well done and the iPhone and the iPhone and the
[01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:31.160]   Apple this four fingers down from that's not
[01:31:31.160 --> 01:31:34.680]   The Easter that's just bad design. I mean that's just bad
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:40.200]   Well, it's not bad design. It's just no one knows what the heck good design is when it's not discoverable
[01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:42.440]   Yeah, there's a universal language of touch
[01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:46.800]   I think Microsoft is trying to get in on that conversation
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:50.640]   They're also going a step ahead and they're sending out like
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:54.600]   They did a big old white paper for designers and developers on
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:32:03.320]   Interactions for gestural control. So they're trying to set the stage and set the conversation for how we interact once touch screens
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:06.320]   Are a thing of the past once we're just interacting in 3d space?
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:09.320]   And I think they're trying to kind of get ahead of the curve
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:12.440]   Way ahead of the curve on that one. Yeah, a little bit behind the curve
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:16.600]   Speaking of that have you have you used leap motion yet? Oh, no, have you oh, it's so cool
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:20.760]   So the idea of this is it you gesture. Yeah, I mean like so touch is like
[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:26.120]   Interface starts to disappear because there's an authentic relationship between what you're doing and what's manipulating
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:31.240]   So you actually feel like you're touching the thing and making it happen. So with leap motion
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:35.640]   It detects within the field in front of the computer instead of you know
[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:38.680]   It's a little quick kind of in front of your left
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:43.960]   If you use that you understand it and you use it understands the points of your five fingers
[01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:46.040]   So the demo that I did that was really cool was um
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:52.040]   a piece of clay rotating around and you stick your finger out and as if you
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:54.600]   It's rotating it you you carve
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:33:00.520]   A groove into it as it comes around and then you kind of go like this and shows you the next angle
[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:04.920]   So you're getting you're just like you're feeling like you're actually interacting with a virtual object
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:07.480]   The same kind of leap forward that you get with the touch screen now
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:09.800]   It's like even beyond that because you're not
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:12.360]   Because you have space you have multiple dimensions
[01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:16.520]   Now that's I think that's a case where gorilla arms or zombie arms or whatever you want to call it
[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:21.080]   Would actually be a problem and I think microsoft in their white paper on gestural interactions
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:25.320]   They mentioned that you can't have people just waving your hands in the air all day. Yeah. Yeah, yeah
[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:31.400]   You want it for a special thing, but um either that or we're gonna have huge biceps in the future. I've been to take me to the gun show
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:33.880]   I'm ready
[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:37.880]   No, but uh what's it called like fruit ninja. I was playing with that on on lee. It's natural
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:41.800]   It's really fun. Like you're you learn it so quickly. It's much more intuitive
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:45.720]   I think that's true here is that you may use a mix of gestures that are appropriate
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:52.280]   Well, can you imagine using windows 8 with connect for windows and being able to pull those icons through 3d space?
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:58.040]   That might be interesting. It will be interesting. It's gonna have so the leap will be available may 13th
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:03.320]   Yeah, they just announced that but that's uh the windows version for windows actually work like in a bug freeway
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:09.320]   Well people use it. Love it. You used it. Yeah. Well, I mean I used it with their demo software. I mean it's a
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:13.160]   developer platform model meaning it won't get figured out right away, right?
[01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:16.120]   7999 so that helps
[01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:22.520]   Yeah, affordable best buys taking pre-orders on the 13th and we'll have it in store main 19th. I'll buy one
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:29.080]   Any of us that you can only use it with this futuristic stuff where it's like you're starting to understand where
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:35.080]   Interfaces can go and how they kind of melt away now this says it'll windows 7 and 8 OS 10 10.7 and 10.8
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:37.320]   Oh nice. So maybe they have added mac
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:39.720]   Support cool. Well, I want to see it for mobile
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:46.040]   What you put your phone it says because your phone you put your phone down and put the thing in front of your phone and then wave at your phone
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:48.440]   You know what?
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:51.160]   I saw the uh, this is I'm gonna sound
[01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:56.840]   Stupid but I was watching the series finale of weeds about a billion years ago
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:59.720]   And there was a point where they had you know little clear transparent phone
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:05.240]   Samsung has been demoing those for ages and they would set it down and it would project a keyboard on the table in front of them
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:11.480]   So you could you were just typing on the table in front of you, but you could see the keyboard and you could interact with that weeds 2019
[01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:16.440]   I must have missed this one. It's like five years in the future. Whatever, but I think we're getting to that point where it's not
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:24.360]   Unfathomable that you would be doing gestural control with a smartphone like device or even like with Google Glass
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:28.840]   That's gonna need gestural control. You're not gonna be able to talk to it or think at it or just roll your eyes
[01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:32.600]   Like a crazy person. Oh, that's not a bad gesture. There's like
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:40.840]   I roll. Yeah, you wouldn't look like a but-head in conversation ever Leo. Hi, jolly. Nice to see you
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:45.000]   Nice to see you too. I'm sorry. I'm just sorting some files. I'll be with you
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.400]   I'm fruit ninja eating over here
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:56.200]   Yeah, now my eyes hurt. I want to do I want to do interviews with all the spouses of people who are using Google Glass right now
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:36:00.840]   I make him kind of off when he comes to bed
[01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:05.800]   It's just so nice to have a real conversation with someone. I think it's the first thing they would say
[01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:10.360]   It's made him a much better cook. Yeah, I don't know go back to the emasculating thing. Yeah
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:17.240]   Yeah, you see Google Glass is emasculating. That's the whole reason he said that you understand because
[01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:20.520]   He's trying to make this emasculating when in fact
[01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:23.320]   There's nothing more dumb
[01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:28.280]   Let's not say emasculating but dumb than wearing these glasses and looking off to the corner and going like this all the time
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:30.920]   with your temple that's dumb
[01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:35.960]   I don't think you have to do this anymore. I think you just talked to it. Yeah. Oh, that's much better
[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:40.440]   You don't touch it. You just talked to us. Let's talk next month. Hey glasses
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:43.000]   Oh glasses
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:48.360]   As soon as they come out we'll have a reunion. We'll all wear ours. Oh, we should definitely know where I'm
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:52.920]   I'm gonna have a headache with it in minutes. I know I am
[01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:58.680]   So if you have a bunch of people all wearing it all talking to their glasses and all paying attention
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:03.000]   To the stuff on the in their eye. I mean that would be just like a terrible gathering
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:08.360]   My point exactly what it yeah, that's why only the rich people should have them
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:13.960]   A dinner party in fact people all wearing google glasses. That's exactly what's going on. It's the seventh ring of hell. Yeah
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:17.720]   Um, it's not exciting though
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:21.720]   I would just sit and watch Netflix and let everything everyone else just do this
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:28.520]   Thing you haven't tried it right? Is it good enough to watch it? Really five minutes. Could you what oh you have so you could watch a movie
[01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:33.640]   What did you do? I was watching well, I was I used I was it was at google. I owe they just gave us like that
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:36.280]   You're one of the ones that they let you touch it
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:43.480]   Yeah, but it was it wasn't my personalized experience. So it wasn't really like a demo. Yeah. Yeah, I had like fireworks playing in the
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:45.640]   Yeah, it was a video. What did it look like?
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:47.880]   How much of your view did it take up?
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:53.720]   Surprising little that was that was what was interesting because looking up above your head is not something you do all that much
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:57.640]   So it's kind of a headache so fast. Well, it's there if you want it, but you also it's there
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:00.760]   If you it doesn't have to be in your way. I want a google monocle
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:05.080]   Well, isn't it a monocle? I thought it was just the one that I
[01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:07.720]   And a little I was a mascot
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:10.360]   and a
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:15.240]   So cbs told cnet you can't make hopper the best of ces
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:21.560]   Even though they had already done so now they're telling their tv stars. You can't even tweet about hopper
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:24.200]   Oh man, katie. Well, how do you pronounce that quokko?
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:26.920]   She's a star a big bang theory
[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:31.400]   tweeted amazing watch watching live tv anywhere on the hopper looks pretty awesome
[01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:36.840]   Now where can I find a tanny beer now? This was an ad by the way. Oh, well look see she tweeted out an ad
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:39.880]   She tweeted an ad so maybe that's not with the hashtag
[01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:43.560]   The sponsor tweet first of all kaley, please aren't you making enough money?
[01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:46.920]   You have to tweet was it sponsored? Yeah, it says ad
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:50.680]   So she got paid by hopper for that
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:56.520]   Yeah, and it links to a hopper commercial if you've read anything about television on the internet in the last six months
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:39:01.640]   They have paid so many people to leave comments and they leave actually like
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:05.960]   Um, so sorry dish pays people to say i'm a hopper user
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:09.800]   But you they have two sentences of educated commentary about the show
[01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:12.520]   They actually watch the show and then they say good thing
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:17.000]   I'll be able to catch up next week because I have a dish hopper and it's so obnoxious
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:21.080]   There's I mean they're spraying some knock it off dish. You don't need to no wait
[01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:24.840]   CBS is having people
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:28.760]   Their tweets yes
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:36.680]   So so CBS said you got to pull that tweet
[01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:43.240]   Well cbs said denies it don't they in the story didn't they say that they had nothing to do with it
[01:39:43.560 --> 01:39:45.560]   Oh CBS said once again
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:51.720]   This is great dish ceo joklatan demonstrates his dubious gift for hyperbole and
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:54.280]   Hoxterism no demands were made
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:40:00.040]   But it's clear dishes culture of fabrication is alive and well
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:03.960]   Maybe she just got embarrassed that she was tweeting an ad that she was at ad right?
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:06.600]   Yeah, she actually CBS said no we didn't even talk to her
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:09.320]   Or the check bounced
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:15.960]   You know the the you just say you were hacked come on it worked for Anthony wiener
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:21.880]   My twitter account we hacked it's all I know I know I know what he's doing
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:22.840]   Good grief
[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:28.280]   Well, that's interesting so dish is also a bad actor here. It's not just CBS dishes also doing like
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:31.640]   Kind of it's not sleazy but slightly
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:36.680]   The I mean, you know to pay people the carist scoundrels they're all scoundrels
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:40.600]   Um
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:43.160]   What's going on with hulu?
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:49.160]   This is this is I feel so sorry for hulu hulu has such potential and I love it
[01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:54.680]   And the problem is you've got you basically you the people who own it hate each other
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:41:02.120]   So it's impossible for hulu to succeed. So now Disney and news corp. I mean what strange bedfellows
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:05.240]   They are the the primary owners of hulu
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:11.880]   Completely disagree over what hulu should be Disney says it should be a free ad supported
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:15.800]   News corp which of course likes paywall say oh no no no no
[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:18.440]   It should be subscriber
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:22.840]   Well, they already have both they have that's why they have both they have a free version and a little plus
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:27.480]   Yeah, what where are they each own a third and guess who the guess who the other third is owned by
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:29.960]   Comcast
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:32.840]   To be nbc. Yeah nbc universal right
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:38.680]   Comcast cannot participate in any operational capacity
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:46.840]   So the the question posed by some including this article in the verge is uh, what's gonna happen
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:52.120]   Hulu plus has three million subscribers compare that to the almost 30 million at netflix
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:54.120]   Um
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:59.640]   I don't know if there's news here or they're just that this oh yeah the news is the ceo is stepping down next month
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:02.600]   Well that he announced that a little bit ago. Yeah, blue
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:05.000]   Well, that was the first actual bit of news in a while
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:09.800]   I mean this hulu story has been kind of the same thing not that it matters for users necessarily
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:16.680]   But the ceo is actually finally stepping down so the issue is who's going to be in control and according to bloomberg the two aren't
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:23.720]   debating disney and news corp debating who should get it and and and who should buy the other side out
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:30.280]   What would you like? Well, I think I would prefer a free ad supported medium, but that's but that's what I do
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:34.760]   Um on the other hand netflix is very successful with the paywall
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:37.160]   Yeah, but it's very different content
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:40.760]   They do well. I mean some of it is duplicative and some of it's very very different
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:46.280]   I think like a lot of that network you're gonna get ads whatever happens kind of content the sitcom
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:49.080]   I don't like that. See if I pay bucks a month. I don't want any ads at all
[01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:53.720]   Can I do it? Can I can they do not on hulu? No, but why not?
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:56.520]   Well on hulu you guys will cure blood
[01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:59.800]   Enough money. There's not enough money to make good television anymore
[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:02.840]   Oh, who is that?
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:07.640]   You're not watching premium premium. They already made their money. It's uh incremental income
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:10.760]   They already made their money. It's just it's just like the new dvr
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:13.000]   right
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.280]   With ads speaking of which the new roku i'm seeing
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:21.000]   roku 3 which just came out. I just ordered has an interesting little twist on it
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:25.400]   I love the roku 2 imagine this if you were a time Warner subscriber
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:31.160]   You could use it as a set up box. You wouldn't need a cable connection anymore
[01:43:31.160 --> 01:43:35.160]   Just an internet connection with the roku 3 and I really wonder
[01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:37.960]   if other
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:40.920]   You know other cable companies are coming along for the ride
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:44.840]   Eliminating the set top box. You just you have to have a cable subscription
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:46.120]   Maybe you have to have one set top box
[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:51.320]   But you could put a roku on the other tv and get it all over the internet wasn't that how hbo go kind of works
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:55.800]   Yeah, I mean I talked to the the roku ceo anthony would
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:43:59.000]   Has really good relationships with all those big cable guys
[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:03.240]   I think he comes from that like business background of working with cable folks in the past
[01:44:03.240 --> 01:44:08.040]   I could have hallucinated that part of the conversation, but i'm pretty sure he has a cable background
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:14.360]   But um, anyway, you know he knows about all the contracts and all the negotiation and where their vision is and where their pain points are
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:21.320]   So I think that if anybody stands a chance to bring cable into more modern homes
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:23.640]   I would love that. Wouldn't that be awesome?
[01:44:23.800 --> 01:44:25.800]   God it would be really great. I would love that
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:28.280]   Comcast called me this past week and said um
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:30.920]   Comcast called me this past week and was like
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:33.320]   We want to see if we can change your plan and I said great
[01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:36.760]   Can we do the plan where I don't have to pay for tv and they said
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:39.480]   Here are our options
[01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:43.400]   That's not in the notebook. Let me let me give you some other choices
[01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:50.200]   Jishi I said I don't really watch tv except for on hulu and netflix and she says people say that but they don't really mean that
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:57.880]   Please stop streaming me like an idiot and tell me if I can just have internet. Nope. You can't just have internet
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:45:02.760]   Okay, well then this conversation is that that's the new that's the new thing because wasn't it last week that
[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:05.960]   Who was it time Warner said people don't really want gigabit ethernet?
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:11.720]   We asked and and nobody really that google thing. Nobody wants. So this is the new cable model
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:14.680]   No, people say that but they don't really they don't
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:20.760]   People say that but you know when we actually inquire you're watching tv. We know you are
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:27.320]   No, this is not me. No, so liz liz I have um Comcast internet and no television
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:33.400]   Nice I have you I've you verse television and you can get it unbundled call them back. How do you get it?
[01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:37.160]   What does it cost? You could pay I think it cost me for a
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:43.480]   I know you pay like 10 bucks more you paid more for less services. Yeah, that does not make any sense
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:48.200]   In other words you're paying a discount for the bundle right?
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:52.280]   And so you get this they add 10 bucks to your your internet fee and that's your new fee
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:54.760]   But you don't have to pay for tv so you're saving money
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:59.160]   But I never I yeah, but you don't watch tv. See you. Yeah, I mean I watch tv
[01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:01.880]   I just don't mind watching you the day later and I know I love it
[01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:05.880]   You're a cord cutter, but you can't cut the cord because the cable company won't let you cut the cord
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:09.800]   No, this so you just go to a company like is it monkey brains or one of the other
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:15.960]   Guys who only does Wi-Fi or only does internet connections for your residents? Yeah, it depends on
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:20.440]   No, it just depends on because a lot of those services piggyback on
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:27.960]   Existing bandwidth bandwidth and then you get AT&T's crappy banner or you steal your neighbor's Wi-Fi password
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:35.960]   That's a different plan. I use I've got options. I'm trying to help if you go to the pirate bay all the shows you want available free in
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:39.800]   Are we doing an ad again
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:42.360]   Of course the program brought to you
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:47.720]   No, but that really seriously that's the thing to tell them is well, I'm I'm want to give you money
[01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:51.080]   But be honest with you. I can get all these shows for free
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:57.240]   I want to pay for these shows, but if you don't give me an option that makes sense. I'm just gonna steal them
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:01.560]   Now what do you say comp guests? Well people often say that but they don't really mean it
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:04.920]   Well, she does I could tell

[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:14.920]   All right, what is so Liz Liz gains? What are you going to be covering this week? I know it's not south by south west
[01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:16.920]   What's the big story for you this week?
[01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:23.240]   Did you see actually out of south by south west that maker bot is going to do a scanner? Yes, how is that a desktop scanner?
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:27.960]   That is so cool. So you take like this an object you put it in the scanner scans it
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:32.440]   Then you send it to your maker bot and you print it but the one thing I would say is I try
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:36.280]   I've tried to do 3d scanning with the big expensive machines, right and it's bad
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:40.040]   So I'm worried about doing 3d scanning with a cheap machine
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:43.880]   But I'm glad that someone's working on it to make it better and more accessible
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:46.760]   I think it's possible to do well. Have you seen one two 3d catch?
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:49.640]   Isn't that awesome? You use your phone and you take pictures
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:54.760]   I could do it all around your head and then it combines in different pictures from angles and then it
[01:49:55.320 --> 01:50:00.440]   It's amazing effectively a scan. Yeah, so who knows? I mean, I think they're getting better and better at this
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:06.680]   It's funny how how the maker movement has kind of ebbed and flowed over the past 30 or 40 years
[01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:12.040]   And yeah, what they're doing now is amazing. I think Brie Pettis is um, I love maker maker
[01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:15.640]   What does it make her bot? Yeah, maker bot. Make a bot
[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:20.600]   And Brie is Brie is just a good spokesman for all of this because he's so enthusiastic and so cool
[01:50:20.680 --> 01:50:28.600]   He's charismatic and yeah great hair all that stuff great hair very important. I think in a 3d printing engine to have good hair
[01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:35.720]   Um, what are you gonna be covering jolio del adventure beat any big stories on your horizon?
[01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:45.720]   I am getting a thermostat installed on thursday. No, it's it's one for old fashioned victorian baseboard type eaters
[01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:48.280]   That's my big story for this week
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:54.920]   Computer controlling my victorian ancient house. You're getting a thermostat. That's not Wi-Fi enabled it is
[01:50:54.920 --> 01:51:02.360]   But it wires up to the existing baseboard heaters. What's this called? I don't know how well makes it
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:07.560]   So they're like trying to kill honey. Well, uh, they're trying to kill nests. So I guess I'm
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:12.120]   This wasn't my decision. I just want to say that publicly
[01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:15.880]   You got a but nest is cool because like I can turn down my thermostat from here
[01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:21.400]   Chatty you ever do that you go online to your nest with a honey well thing too. I guess you just completely ripped it off
[01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:23.560]   They did and why not that's the business
[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:27.720]   To them to eat it. They honey well or sud nest or nest or nest or any well
[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:29.720]   I think they went back and forth behind
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:34.680]   Does nest work if you don't have sexual through them over round thermostats. No, yes, wait what?
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:36.840]   No
[01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:41.080]   They say they own the round thermostat design. Look it up
[01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:44.120]   Unbelievable
[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:46.760]   You can't trademark a circle no
[01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:51.000]   Or pat maybe you can though. I mean this is such a crazy someone write that down
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:56.520]   You shouldn't be able to write that down control your nest. We I gave chat a nest have you uh
[01:51:56.520 --> 01:52:03.800]   I haven't set up my uh user account yet, but um it has already learned my schedule
[01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:07.800]   That's so like once I wake up. I can tell the heater kicks on. Yeah me too
[01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:11.800]   Yeah, it's like your happy little friend who wants to warm the place up for you before you get out of bed
[01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:16.520]   It also has a little motion sensor. So when I walk by it like turns on the screen and it's like hey
[01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:21.800]   You're 70 degrees. It's almost like a cat. It's yeah very much like a cat
[01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:26.440]   Uh, let's see. So just google searching honey. Well, Wi-Fi. Um
[01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:32.280]   Is that that's not round man? It's not well. No. No, I mean they might have the this is you know
[01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:34.920]   They may have that's not look at the nest, but come on
[01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:38.920]   I have to come along. That looks like a tv on your wall. Um
[01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:42.680]   I think there I think their patent was not so much for the circle
[01:52:42.680 --> 01:52:47.320]   But for that that feature where you could reach up and turn it's in this
[01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:49.000]   fashion
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:54.440]   And that's there. Uh, that's their patent. Oh, what'd you do with the nest? So this is my jolly. This is my home
[01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:59.080]   It knows that it's 69. Wow. It's a nice day outside 69 degrees in petaloma
[01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:04.120]   So the heat right now see the green leaf and they send you an email by the way saying you had more green leaves this
[01:53:04.120 --> 01:53:09.240]   This month than last month. They actually rate you and then I can turn my thermostat up or down
[01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:10.920]   And it changes at home
[01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:12.920]   So i'm gonna be i'm on my way home

[01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:31.800]   You know last night i went to the drag show of a life. This is super relevant to this show
[01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:39.720]   Paris is burning the ultimate drag documentary presented by some of the winners of rupaul's drag race

[02:00:29.080 --> 02:00:34.040]   Okay, he thought he looked down with a beard and I was like, baby, you know, you're so great with a beard
[02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:40.760]   Because as a woman, I don't like kissing stubble. I like kissing something that's like smooth like a baby's bottom
[02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:44.280]   Yeah, but a man's face is a beard better than a scratchy face
