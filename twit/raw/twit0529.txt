[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Natalie Morris is back. Haven't seen anyone ages from CMC.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Oh, I know, but you just called me the best.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   You are. You're wonderful and great to see you and how's Clayton Morris doing and your kids and everybody good?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   They're good. They're good.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Nice. Wonderful to see you again. Natalie Morris.com CNBC.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Also here, Alex Wilhelm. We swore we'd never bring him back, but hey.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Then you want someone to fill the chair.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   It's not all that.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Alex is from TechCrunch at Alex. He has the best Twitter handle ever.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Which he purchased for. Remind me again.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   60 bucks. 2008 off a guy in Mexico.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Nice. That's entrepreneurship.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Or just almost betting on the wrong platform.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I don't think the wrong platform.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   No, we worked out great. I'm not saying that I really had the best intentions in mind.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I have the letter L on Jaiku. That was good. So close.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Jaiku is still very relevant.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Oh, close. Right up there with Orchid.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   And Friend Feed. Oh, Friend Feed. Yeah.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I was a big Friend Feeder.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   That's Patrick Norton. Hi, everybody.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I see you from Tech Fang.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   I want to call it Thang, but that wouldn't be how you spell it.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   It's Tech Thing. Tech Thing.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   T-O-K-T-H-N-G. Aren't you tempted when the show you and Snubsy begin the show to say,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   "Welcome to Tech Fang." She's more Missouri than I am.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Yeah, she could do it. She could do it. Yeah.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   In a heartbeat. Good to have you.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   How many of you waited in line at the store yesterday?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   No. Nobody. Anybody to get a fine new iPhone?
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Anybody? Nobody?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   I have it.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   People don't need to do that anymore.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   You know, I did it last year.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   You waited in line by yourself.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   No, actually, John, you were there and you and you and you were there.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   We had quite a few people, actually, there.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   It was fun.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Except the line, John, correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   It seemed like it was half filled with bums.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   A lot of people were buying phones for reset.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   They weren't buying phones for themselves.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   And see, that's what's changed in the early days of the iPhone line.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   It was like cool people, Apple fans.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Not New York, though.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   In New York, you usually do have the people who are doing it for corporate sponsorship or selling it or trying to get on the news for their own video purposes.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Well, one thing that's changed is you can now buy the iPhone illegally and officially in China.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   So, when a lot of the squatters used to be people were going to buy them and resell them immediately in China.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   It's a big business actually in Brazil, Argentina, and other countries like that.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Where you can't get them?
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Yeah, where you can't get them or not soon enough.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   People just check down 35 iPhones and so they bought up and charge like twice much for them.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   There's a store in New Zealand that keeps complaining about these Americans coming to get iPhones in the middle of the night.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   I fix it, that's what they do.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   They go down, they buy it because that's the first place, right, where the sun rises.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   And then they...
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   It's so... That store must be horrible because there's people dropping them, putting them in blenders, taking them apart.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   It's like, it must be the worst to work at that Apple store.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   I think they make them take them outside.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Yeah, well, yeah, don't do it in here.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   But it's just supposed to be so sad.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   You see, all these phones go out the door and then be destroyed.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   On camera.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   So, Natalie, which one did you get?
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   I have the pink one.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Big one or a little one.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   You got the plus.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I'm a plus size.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   I am a plus size two and more ways than one.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   You are only a plus size and phone.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   And I also got pink, although we were debating before the show began.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Because I think there's some other shades in there when you tilt it.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   It's like a little gold, a little copper.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Oh, we match it on the paint chip.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Match it only when you don't rotate it.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   What did you find romance?
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Was that the color?
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   I saved it.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   It's many shades of pink.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   That's what I think.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   It's shimmer.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   It's 50 shades.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Sherman Williams, 63-23 romance.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   That's a funny close.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   You have that shot because that is about as close as you get.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Did you buy that paint on paint or old iPhone so it looks like the new one?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   That works.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   You're good.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   I'm just going to go on record and say that I really like this color.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   I was actually a little worried that it was going to be just pink, pink, pink.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   But it's more interesting.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   It's a little kind of iridescent with some copper.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Which one?
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   I think it's a little bit more than a pink pink.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   But even so, it's not likely that you don't put a case on it, right?
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   So nobody knows that I've got this awesome pink phone, which is too bad.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   But I've got a new pink band.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   Do you like that?
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   For your watch?
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Oh, you got that.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Yeah, that's the...
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Oh, that's Flora Oelastomer.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   All I know is I had to pay $50 to get the new extra large band so I could actually wear
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   it for more than two hours at a pop and that way.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   My hand being ready to fall off.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Oh, that's funny because mine are too small.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.840]   And they won't even at the smallest one.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.360]   It doesn't read my heart rate all that well.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.880]   So I have to push it to me.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.880]   So I'm tiny.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.960]   But also when I went to Disney World, I had to pull off the adult size adapter and wear
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.320]   the child's band for the magic band.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.240]   So I just got tiny bands.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.240]   Just a tiny, tiny band.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.240]   Tiny hands.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.240]   I have heard women come...
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.240]   What's that?
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.240]   What's that?
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.240]   Small hands.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.920]   It's a big, tiny, big heart.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.960]   My wife also got the 6 plus...
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:58.800]   And I thought that women didn't like the big one because it won't fit in your pocket.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.800]   Because women have...
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.800]   I didn't know this.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.800]   I just learned this.
[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.800]   Women have shallow pockets.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.800]   How did you not know that?
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.800]   How did you know it?
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.240]   Because I hang out with women sometimes.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.240]   I'm just getting to know women for the first time.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:14.400]   It's like on the IT crowd, he's like, "Oh, the women's pants."
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.400]   Which is not fair.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.400]   Women's pants.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.080]   Can you please check the tag on his Levi's?
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.000]   I think that you can get women's pants with deep pockets.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   You must be able to.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Well, sure.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.800]   You want to wear car hearts, but...
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.800]   Alright.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.800]   But you...
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.800]   They're actually pretty stylish now.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.800]   The type with the long slacks, sort of, fellish.
[00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.280]   Yeah, no, this fits in the pants.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.320]   It's good for the purse, though, because if it's too small, then it goes all the way down
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.520]   to the bottom of your purse and you can't find it.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.520]   That's a good point, too.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.520]   You want it to flow.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.520]   So 6 plus floats on the purse to treat us?
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.520]   Because yeah, you stink.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.520]   There's too much stuff.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.680]   But my friends at work that have paid larger iPhones that are women that are smaller have
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.240]   a hand problem, because their hands are so small compared to their phone, they almost
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.080]   have to always have two hands on it and it's all done.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.920]   Remember, I've turned it off on this one, so I can't demo.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.520]   Remember Apple made a big deal last year about the double tap this and the screen goes
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.520]   down halfway?
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.520]   How's it down to you?
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.520]   Do you use that?
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.520]   No, I never use that.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.520]   That seems so dopey to me.
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:06.080]   And when it happens, I'm like, "Get out of here."
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.320]   Yeah, that's why I disabled it.
[00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.440]   I don't want to see it.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.120]   But that's to solve that problem, right?
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.120]   No.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.120]   Or at least to address it.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.120]   I don't think I should solve that problem.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.120]   No, I don't have any icons to use.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.120]   I have small hands.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.720]   I assure you, half sizing the screen does not solve the problem.
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.520]   It just kisses you off.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.520]   That's what I think.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.040]   You don't want icons to move on their own.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:25.160]   So I have to say, having used this for a while, and Natalie, I'd be curious what your
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.160]   experience is.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.440]   Unfortunately, Patrick just bought the iPhone 6.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.160]   Yeah, I'm a little behind the curve.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.120]   Well, but that puts you in an awkward position, because it's too early to find.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.520]   No, pink and popping for you, Patrick.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.560]   I have to say, and I've been using Android for two years, because I kind of just got
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.560]   fed up with the closed ecosystem and I like widgets.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.560]   I like the back button.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.000]   I just felt like Android was more flexible and cable.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.600]   I probably will go back to this.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.440]   I'm very-- look at the-- you were mentioning peak and pop.
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:54.600]   So right now, it's just Apple Apps and Instagram, oddly enough.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.080]   But if I just touch Instagram lightly--
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.280]   Nope, that's the wrong thing.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.280]   I know.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.280]   I'm just showing them.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.280]   Oh, sorry.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.280]   You get the jiggle, jiggle.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.280]   Still, just like before.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.280]   Right.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.080]   Now, if you touch it a little harder, you get a pop-up-- I have done it with the wrong
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.080]   hand.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:12.240]   You get a pop-up menu that shows you the-- up to four commands typically would be the
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.680]   four most used commands.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.880]   I feel like this is a power user feature.
[00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.800]   You can go right to the part-- I'm going to take a selfie.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   Right to the part you want.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.800]   It's awesome is what it is.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.600]   And it makes so much more sense than the interface on the watch.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.080]   Well, that's why I was very skeptical, because for a touch on the watch, I know it's terrible.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.640]   Somebody wrote a really interesting article that they pointed out that there were just
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:36.600]   too many ways to interface with the watch, especially given how hard Apple had worked.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.280]   David Polk proposed-- and it's the funniest thing.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.320]   He says, "The watch is too complicated, and I have a proposal."
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.960]   And that was the most complex-- I could even figure it out from reading it-- his proposed
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:51.680]   simplification, which underscores, "It's just hard to make a user interface on a device
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.080]   that's small that's in any way usable."
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.960]   I mean, look at the icons on this.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.960]   You can't.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.720]   That's almost-- that's almost-- and it's like a mean to make icons that small.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.400]   Well, I mean, the other thing is you have entirely too many inputs.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.240]   You've got the screen, the button, the crown.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.240]   No, Apple, the device.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.400]   Apple Jobs was famous for not even putting two buttons on a mouse.
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.160]   This thing has like four different-- you force touch, you've got the crown, you've got the
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.920]   button, they all do different things.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.040]   It's almost like Jobs is dead.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.680]   That's not a fun joke.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.840]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.840]   But fundamentally accurate.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.840]   I mean--
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.640]   You've been drinking, haven't you?
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.080]   No, my point is-- I'm not surprised.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.080]   Everybody just stopped.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.080]   Wow.
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.080]   It was awesome.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.080]   I'll see myself out, I apologize.
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.080]   I can't wonder.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.440]   My point was that there's a different person in charge of the company and different products
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.440]   and so I'm not surprised.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.440]   Here's the thing.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.440]   And I was talking about this in the radio show today.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.880]   I like went on for me.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.400]   That Apple has a problem because there are very credible phones.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:50.400]   You're mentioning a Moto G that's 200 bucks, 300 bucks.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.760]   Around the world, people use smartphones.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.840]   You look at the Syrian refugee camps, they all have smartphones.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.680]   So you can't-- obviously, Apple is in a different market.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.160]   They won't make a cheap phone.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.520]   This phone here, Natalie, I bet yours is like that too.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.520]   This cost me $950.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.680]   128 gigabytes.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.920]   It's ridiculous.
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:08.920]   So Apple--
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:09.920]   Not if you're Apple.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.880]   Well, but the point being that the other companies making almost equivalent phones,
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.600]   or maybe in some ways equivalent phones for a lot less money, it's very clear.
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.320]   Apple's got a great profit margin.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.320]   They're smart.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.640]   They went, they made it as cheap as they could.
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:26.560]   And then they decided we're going to go with fashion because there's one business in the
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:31.760]   world, Natalie, tell me, you know this to be true, people say, oh, how much did that
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:32.760]   cost to make?
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:33.760]   I'm overpaying.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:34.760]   And that's high fashion.
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:39.560]   You don't ask Hermes, how much did that silk scarf cost you to make?
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.560]   You don't care?
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.560]   No, you don't.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:49.000]   No, yeah, what's the economic term for that is a-- a Vavlin good is that it's desirable
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   because it's more-- because it costs more--
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Exactly.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   --of the--
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   --of the Vavlin good.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.920]   So Apple has-- I mean, this is a good business strategy.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.880]   You make it as cheaply as you can.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.880]   Right.
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.160]   And you sell it for as dear as you can.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.160]   And the best way to do that is to make your goods be-- what is that?
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.440]   You called them, Natalie, somehow magical.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:15.000]   I think it's a-- a Vavlin good is what you wanted because it costs more.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.400]   Yeah, the Wall Street Journal back in July, Apple's share of smartphone industry's profits
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.560]   sourced to 92%.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.080]   They sell 20% of the smartphones.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.600]   They make 92% of the profits.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.160]   I don't think they're doing anything wrong from a business capitalist perspective.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.520]   Hell no, if you're a stockholder, you're very happy.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.200]   Vavlin, is that named after a Thorsten Vavlin?
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.200]   Oh, it is.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.480]   Material commodities, for which the demand is proportional to its high price, which is
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.360]   an apparent contradiction of the law of demand.
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.800]   Vavlin goods are also commodities that function as positional goods.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.800]   Exactly.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.800]   It's a status symbol.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.800]   That's the place.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.800]   It's a status symbol in Wikipedia.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.080]   And which makes sense, which is exactly why Apple's going--
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.440]   I was like quoting Wikipedia for the record.
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.440]   I was quoting Wikipedia for the record.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.440]   Yes, yes.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.400]   I thought I said it, in case I didn't.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.880]   But wait a minute, watch this, though.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:58.880]   Hey, Siri.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.080]   Oh, gosh.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.200]   That's a Veblin good.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.600]   I found some information about Veblin good on Wikipedia.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.400]   Would you like me to read it to you?
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.400]   Yes, please.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.400]   Yes.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.800]   In economics, Veblin goods are types of material.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:16.800]   That's something new.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.440]   That's actually very, very cool.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.000]   I think that's really cool.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.400]   Lisa and I were taking a walk yesterday and we saw a street sign I'd never seen before.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.400]   It said Speed Table.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:28.240]   I don't want to speed.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.440]   What's a speed table?
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.520]   The Lisa asked her phone.
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.920]   And it told us.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.240]   And I'm walking down the street having this kind of moment where I'm thinking, I'm living
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.240]   in the future.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.240]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:44.080]   But remember, there was a time when we thought that we would use, like, what's the term for
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.600]   it?
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.800]   We would have our streaming reality, like the Google Glass.
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.600]   Virtual reality and always be augmented reality.
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.000]   Augmented reality, right?
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.880]   When we thought we would just point the phone and have it tell us, right?
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.840]   But now, I think what we're realizing now is we do want to drive a little bit more.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.240]   We don't want it always there.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:07.320]   We want to know or to tell it when we want it and then otherwise not have it.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.320]   As a caveat to the discussion about cost of build versus cost of sale, when Microsoft
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.080]   built the original Surface, I was up on their campus with Stemos Novsky.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.920]   And they were just running the first time in public, these devices were out.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.760]   And he said, look, they're going to tear it down and give you a component cost.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:23.760]   Ignore that.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:24.760]   They're totally off base.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.760]   And don't try to calculate our margins on these devices.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.280]   Apple said the same thing too.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.160]   You can't tell how much it costs us.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.160]   You know what?
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.160]   It costs less.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.160]   I believe that in time.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.160]   It doesn't cost more.
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.400]   Apple didn't get $200 billion in cash by accident.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.520]   They're one of the most amazing corporations I think in history.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.360]   But this is a brilliant solution to that problem.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:45.040]   Nobody's going to ask how much a Gucci dress costs to make.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.520]   That has nothing to do with it.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:51.600]   In fact, as you point out, Natalie, it's worth more because it's worth more cost more.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.920]   I'm thinking about the Apple Watch.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:53.920]   Same thing.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.320]   I mean, I'm thinking about the Apple car.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.320]   We'll get to that in a moment.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:03.560]   But I realize that the point of the watch is not about a technology product or computer.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.800]   It's hard to use.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.800]   It's at $18,000.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.520]   It's ridiculously overpriced.
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.720]   That's a good thing because what this is is a stand is simple.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:15.200]   In fact, what it really is is a signal that you're one of us.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:19.040]   If you're wearing an Apple watch, you go up and you say, hi, how do you like that Apple
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.040]   watch?
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.600]   Can I thank you, my heart, babe?
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:28.120]   And so this is really, these guys are clearly figuring this out and saying, look, we got
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.120]   a problem here.
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.840]   Phones are going to get cheaper.
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:34.200]   They're going to be just as good for 200 bucks for less.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.200]   What are we going to do?
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.600]   Because we want to keep our margins up and they solved it.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.600]   I think they elicked it.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.600]   But you know what the time it takes?
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.600]   That's why it's pink.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:46.200]   There were brands that did this way before phones were cheap that just charged a lot for
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.200]   phones.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.200]   For two.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.200]   Remember, for two?
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.200]   For two was, yeah.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.200]   It was a...
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.200]   And they're crappy phones.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.200]   Oh, the aliens.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.200]   It was terrible.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.200]   But I mean, look at that.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.200]   That is basically a Nokia phone from 1990.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.200]   It was a place to make.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.200]   Right.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.440]   I think they cost like $10,000 if they had leather on the outside.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.440]   Exactly.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.840]   Look, there's a guy with gloves making it.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.200]   That's how you know it's expensive.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.200]   Right.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:14.480]   What do you call it when they sort of piggy bank off of Sprint's network, that kind of
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.480]   ... Mvno.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.480]   They have their own network.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.480]   That's what it is.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.480]   No, they were an Mvno.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.800]   Are you...before they made the phone or overpay by two orders of magnitude for less...
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.800]   Right.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.560]   ...reverb of crappy service and lower speed?
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.440]   The point was it just was a bit like that.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.240]   This cost more than an Apple watch.
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.920]   Is that $19,400 for a phone?
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:35.920]   But this is like $7,000.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:40.200]   And no one thought that phones would be status symbols this way.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:44.520]   I've been to the Virtus store in Las Vegas and that people do buy these.
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:48.040]   You're obviously, if you buy this, you're not a technology maven.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.040]   It's the Kardashians of the world.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.040]   It's the status symbol.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.120]   If I saw you with that phone, I would like you less because you had it.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.320]   Well, isn't the Apple watch a douchebag detector?
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.320]   Really?
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.320]   Did you see me wearing one?
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.440]   I mean, seriously, that's what Kevin Rose called it.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.960]   It goes both ways.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:08.680]   If you're wearing an Hermes scarf or a Virtu phone or an Apple watch, some people will gravitate
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.520]   towards you and some people will go, "Oh."
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.520]   So you pronounce that kind.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.520]   It's a pronounced Hermes.
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.760]   I thought it was Herms.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.600]   And that's why we don't let you in the store.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.600]   Yeah, I'm currently not.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.600]   I do like that.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.600]   I do like that.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.480]   I make a little apology though for this kind of thing.
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.080]   You know this stuff.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.000]   You're fashion forward, aren't you?
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   Me?
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   I guess.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   I have a Rent the Runway Unlimited subscription.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Okay.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   Okay.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.480]   You know, that's a TV thing though because Becky Worley also does that.
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.800]   That's because when you go on TV, you can't wear the same thing.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.240]   I need different clothes.
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.000]   Which is baffling to me that women are supposed to wear different clothes every day.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.200]   And we don't even know what we're doing.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.640]   The next thing you'll tell me is there's a double standard in payment for services done.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.640]   Same thing.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.840]   If your buttons are on the other side, they toss twice as much as I'm drag-lained.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:58.840]   Mm.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.720]   You know what's really awesome when a friend of yours with an engineering degree from
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.800]   MIT walks into fries and they try to give her the stupid girl upsell?
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.840]   That's one of the most awesome things I've ever seen.
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:08.840]   What do they do?
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.360]   Oh yeah, that happens to me at Best Buy too.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.360]   What do they do?
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.360]   You don't want that.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.720]   I really, you don't want this many hurts about this many hurts.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.880]   And I'm like, I know what I'm talking about.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.200]   I just want to just kick them when they do that.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:29.200]   And I never do like a, you know, who I am kind of thing, but I'm kind of like, no, this
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.040]   is something I know what I'm talking about actually.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.120]   When it comes to cars, I may be a little bit less in the no, but you know, they sort of
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.320]   go out like, oh yeah.
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:40.480]   I hate standing at a computer store and I'll hear them do that.
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.800]   Or say something like, just patently wrong.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.400]   You really need 32 gigabytes of RAM.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.400]   You're not going to get the best out of that new screen unless you get like one of the,
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.560]   you know, the HDMI cables with the gold plating.
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:55.000]   It's a superior transmissions and as yours and ones, you see, that's only going to be
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.920]   $130, but it's really going to make the image pop.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:58.920]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.920]   That was good action actually.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.520]   Did you ever work in one of them?
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.520]   Best Buy there?
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.640]   No, but I've spent a lot of time in retail.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:11.800]   So I did a piece on CNET where I interviewed David Katzmeyer, who's the TV reviewer.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:16.760]   And he says, you know, when you go into Best Buy, they're going to tune the TV so that
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.720]   the cheapest one looks the crappiest.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.680]   They do it on purpose.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:24.040]   And Best Buy wouldn't let us publish that part of the video because we were filming
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.040]   in their store and they're like, whoa, whoa, excuse me.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.720]   Well, do you blame them?
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.960]   I would have stepped outside the store and say, let's say that again.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:33.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.440]   Just cut it in later in the edit.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.680]   So anyway, I don't know.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.680]   I guess it's not.
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.800]   I mean, I feel like I had an epiphany.
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:40.800]   Obviously, I didn't.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.960]   The apples just brilliant in terms of they always have been a marketing.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.160]   But what's happened is they've really reposition themselves as a fashion brand and they can
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.600]   get away with this price.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.440]   Having said that, I don't know if they've done it, but they're trying really hard.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.440]   You're true.
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.520]   Well, yeah, maybe not.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:59.760]   I mean, having said that, I do really like this phone.
[00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:02.120]   They've sped up the touch ID.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.280]   Natalie, have you noticed that?
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:08.280]   If you were in the habit of turning on the phone to see your notifications or what time
[00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.920]   it was by pressing the home button, you can't do that anymore because it's so fast that
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.240]   as soon as you press the home button, it's unlocked here.
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.000]   I'll turn it off.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.640]   So you have to now use the on/off button.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.080]   So I think a lot of people, let me see what time it is.
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.080]   I'll just--
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.920]   Oh, that is smoking fast.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.080]   I didn't see it.
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:26.080]   Let's do that.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.080]   Let's do that again.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.080]   Let me see what time it is here.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.840]   Oh, I turned Siri on by accident.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:30.840]   Here we go.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:31.840]   Oh, this is another thing.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.920]   In fact, I learned this because I want to show this.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.920]   The live photos.
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.240]   Now, I don't know if this is going to take off.
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:39.120]   This is a live photo lock screen.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:44.040]   So if you force touch it, that 3D touch thing, it comes alive, which I think is kind of cool.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.320]   I have a picture of my dog that to me really--
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.760]   Let's see if I can find this here.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.840]   This is what you want to see, isn't it?
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.120]   Some guy is swiping through his photos.
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:58.280]   So here's Aussie in the car.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.360]   Now that's a kind of fun picture and you get a sense of motion.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:07.440]   Because I held the phone still for a second and a half before and, like usual, after taking
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.600]   the picture, I didn't drop the phone.
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.400]   I kept it up for another second and a half.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:16.080]   Now I force touch it and you've got the video behind the picture, which I think is kind
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.080]   of cool.
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:18.080]   Audio too.
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.240]   Yeah, I'm really impressed by it.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:22.560]   I think it's given how easy it is to actually capture the images and store them.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.560]   It's going to be popular.
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.880]   It's not a lot of extra work.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:26.360]   And so people may actually pick it up.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.760]   It's one of the reasons I got 128 gigs because I'm going to fill this sucker up with this
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.760]   stuff.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:36.960]   One of the problems with this is that someone will take the picture and then immediately
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.160]   drop the phone and go off on their day.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:42.320]   And so you'll get a blur at the end of it.
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.320]   I got a million of those.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.320]   Right.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:51.360]   And so what they're going to do in the next iteration is they'll remember what they're
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.360]   going to do something.
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.360]   And that's a sulfur fix.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.560]   They'll use a gyroscope so that when you drop it it'll turn off.
[00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.320]   So here's the cheese board.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.920]   And I thought I'd take it.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:01.920]   That's what you get.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:06.480]   A picture of your elbow because I thought I was just taking a picture.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.040]   So you can, by the way, turn that off in the camera.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:10.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.040]   Look at my daughter here.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:12.040]   I'll show you one.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.040]   Let's see.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.040]   Hold it up here.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.040]   Camera watch.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.120]   See, parents are going to love that.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.120]   And there.
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:19.120]   And then you forget.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:21.120]   And then I was like, okay, that's good.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.120]   I thought that was enough.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.520]   But you can see she just kind of playing on her little bike.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.520]   It's cute.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.520]   Awesome.
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:27.520]   It's super cute for the kids.
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:28.520]   Okay, I know we're saying.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.240]   But can you send them to anyone?
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.960]   No, you can only send them to other Apple people.
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:33.960]   Okay.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.960]   By the way, brilliant.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.920]   Next time I go to New Safari, I actually watch all the events.
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.280]   Yeah, it's just a JPEG or a movie.
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.360]   So the NMOV file.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:47.880]   So it isn't a non-standard format, but nobody supports it yet.
[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.960]   Facebook says said at the event that they were going to support it on iOS versions of
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:55.160]   Facebook, which I think would make that compelling.
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.640]   Actually, I'm more interested in this 360 video.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.800]   Did you see the Star Wars 360 video on Facebook?
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:02.800]   Yes.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.000]   And that's supported by Facebook.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.640]   Well, it's funny because the Oculus Rift thing was this week and they announced the Windows
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.080]   10 Minecraft is going to be ready for the Oculus Rift.
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:19.040]   There's going to be a $99 gear VR from Samsung coming in November just in time for the holiday
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.040]   season.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.560]   But you of course need a Samsung phone to use it.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.760]   And it's interesting to watch.
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:29.320]   It's almost like Facebook knows they need to ease people into the glorious concept of
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.840]   360 degree content.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:35.080]   They're doing it by a 2D window on the website just to get people jammed with the idea.
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:39.600]   Yeah, you need to help them really to make it work.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.040]   It was more compelling than I expected it to be on Facebook.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.040]   That's pretty cool.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.480]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:45.400]   Here it is.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.240]   So it looks like you're watching your stream.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.240]   Do me a favor.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:55.600]   I want to make it full screen and see what the performance is like because earlier this
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:00.640]   week it was choking and I didn't know that was my laptop connection.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.600]   The idea is you have a 360 degree video.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.320]   I guess does it keep playing?
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.240]   Oh yeah, I can move around while I'm.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:11.200]   You can use the mouse to look straight up if you want to.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.600]   I think you're right.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.320]   I think it's not.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.280]   But so you're right.
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:20.400]   This isn't as compelling as it would be if you're watching in a helmet or cardboard or
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.280]   gear VR.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:24.160]   But it's a nice transition.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:25.160]   That's next, right?
[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.160]   Yeah.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.160]   Also, it's beautiful.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:29.160]   Just flat out.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.160]   That's just one of your Star Wars fan.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.160]   You want to go.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.160]   Oh, well, let's look at this.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.160]   Oh, let's look at this.
[00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.160]   What's that?
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.160]   How many suns are there?
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.160]   Are there two moons?
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.160]   What is that?
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.160]   What am I looking at?
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.160]   Where's the moon?
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.160]   It's a space.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.160]   It's a space.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.680]   What are you looking at?
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.080]   I mean, that's kind of cool.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:46.000]   So I get you're right.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.800]   You're preparing us for it at day when we all have virtual reality helmets.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:54.840]   One of the announcements Oculus made this week was that there'll be a $99 Samsung helmet
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.840]   as much as you have seven.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:57.840]   I just said seven.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:02.280]   You can't quote him three paragraphs later and expect you to learn from Patrick Norton.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.800]   No, because I have the $200 version.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.200]   I didn't hear it.
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:11.040]   But you have to have a $1,000 Samsung phone to do it.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.640]   Well, there's basically a new Samsung gear VR for $99 coming into a website.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:15.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.640]   I was laughing because I was feeling my worst.
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.880]   I was looking at Star Wars.
[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.080]   I was like, "Hey, Star Wars.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.080]   Nice."
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.200]   Well, also YouTube does that, right?
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.200]   Google cardboard.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.200]   Same thing.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.400]   So are you going to get this theta S?
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.600]   That's what I want.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.600]   Man.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.040]   I've ordered it already.
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:36.080]   Rico is making a fairly inexpensive.
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.800]   It's just a couple of hundred bucks.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.800]   3D camera.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:39.800]   I saw the original one.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.480]   The quality wasn't really great, but the new one supposedly quality will be better.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:49.720]   Natalie, you need this for the Lake Tinky Wink because what you do, you don't move it.
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:50.720]   You don't need to.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.320]   It's taking-- there's a camera on the other side as well.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.600]   It's taking HD 360 degree video.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:26:00.400]   The only thing better than fancy photos on your iPhone you can't share with grandma
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.880]   are fancy 360 degree videos.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:09.240]   You won't be able to access online, but you can put it on Facebook soon and YouTube, right?
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.000]   Wouldn't that be doing that?
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Right.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   How much is that going to cost?
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   It was a couple hundred.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   I bought one.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   I can't remember.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   Let me see.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   Bye.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.920]   It's much less than you would pay for something like the GoPro, which is like $6,000.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:23.920]   Really?
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.960]   That's a really strong price point.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:27.960]   I mean, it's for pros.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:28.960]   That's for pros.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:29.960]   Sure.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.360]   You're talking about a collection of GoPros that are all 350 together.
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.360]   It's not bad.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.360]   It's not bad.
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.760]   How bad is the fisheye on the images?
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:37.760]   It's pretty good.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.360]   If you search for theta S on YouTube, you'll see a lot of videos.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.200]   Dick DiBartolo did it.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.360]   He was at the event where Rico announced it, and they went to Times Square.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.360]   Perfect place to use it, right?
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.480]   Oh, of course, because everything's going on.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.480]   Everything's all around you.
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.280]   So it's quite a good looking, to be honest.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:55.000]   It looks like kind of, it's about the size of an Apple remote.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   It looks like just a little--
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   Oh, is it that small?
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   Yeah, it's really small.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.280]   That's a lot of technology for such small package.
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.280]   You know?
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:02.280]   Some presents?
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.120]   We're on the verge of this.
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.440]   I really feel like-- there you go.
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.520]   We're really on the verge of this.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:13.760]   I feel like that $99 VR helmets, hard boards even cheaper, there's Times Square.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.640]   Yeah, and there's Dick.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:20.880]   That's kind of the amazing thing is I want to do vlogs like that, where you're looking
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.840]   at me, but if you turn around, there's a four-alarm fire going on in the background,
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:30.400]   or dancing girls, or I don't know what, Natalie wearing an Hermes scarf, something exciting
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.400]   on the other side.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.400]   See, that's what I'm saying, Natalie.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.960]   You could do that, and you could almost do two shows.
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.280]   Clayton could be on one side, you could be on the other.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.000]   Foxy, NBC, NBC is the same time.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.440]   There's a periscope that people would tune into.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.560]   I don't you think?
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.560]   I don't know.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:52.160]   I don't know who would want to see that, but we do it, we try.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.320]   Battery life, very good on this.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.080]   Have you had-- what do you think?
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:59.400]   I feel like it's very good on the 6S Plus, even though it's a smaller battery than last
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.400]   year.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.240]   The Reclamation iOS 9 is going to give you an hour better battery life.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.760]   They have the power saving mode.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.400]   It's been off the charger since 6 AM, 79% still.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.400]   It's pretty good.
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.400]   And I've been using it a lot.
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.400]   Absolutely.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.560]   This is a little power mode, though, just a less bright screen.
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.120]   Less bright screen, and they start shutting off background.
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.120]   Oh, I see.
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.120]   The screen--
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.120]   But I won't get to that.
[00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:22.320]   I mean, at this point, I'm not going to get to that till tomorrow.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.440]   And I have to say, that's one thing Android has not been able to do very well, is get
[00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.480]   that battery life up, right?
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:30.960]   Well, I'm also getting really frustrated, but they keep making phones thinner.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.560]   Like, we've had an ability to do a thinner, and we took another 700--
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.560]   --you know, milliamp--
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.120]   Yeah, like, make it 2 millimeters thinner.
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:43.120]   It can be another 1,000 milliamp hours on the battery life, and make my entire experience
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.280]   that much better.
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.280]   What did Clayton get?
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:47.680]   Did he get a new iPhone, too?
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:50.640]   Yeah, I think he got the regular gold.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.640]   Because I think Pink would look good on him.
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.640]   Yeah, see?
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.800]   He wears Pink good.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:03.400]   But also, they said that there's actually a lot of new hardware in this phone, not
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.640]   just all new software.
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:08.680]   So it's a stronger back, so we'll get less of this sort of bending issue.
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:09.680]   Yeah.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:14.280]   It's some kind of like space grade titanium or something like that.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:21.720]   I feel like, unlike previous S years, that this is a much-- I have to say I mocked them,
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:22.720]   because those tag--
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.720]   S years?
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:24.720]   This is an S year.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:25.720]   You didn't know that?
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:26.720]   Yeah, yeah, no.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.040]   You mocked the S years or you--
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:32.160]   No, I mocked Apple because they said the only thing that's changed is everything.
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:36.040]   And I thought, yeah, that's the kind of thing you'd say when you have nothing to show off.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.640]   Absolutely nothing to show off.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.200]   But in fact, they do.
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.960]   This is really-- there's a lot in this.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.840]   And they say that because the stock market dumps on them every time they're gonna--
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:45.840]   I know, yes, first stock market.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.680]   But I mean, if you go back to the original iPhone, which I think we probably all had
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:49.680]   years and years ago, 2007--
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.240]   I still haven't like over there, yeah.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:55.080]   I mean, you'd fire up the phone today using iOS 1, and you could still use it.
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.280]   You would know how to get around it.
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.960]   So things have changed a lot in the packaging and the technology behind the screen.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:04.480]   But I feel like the actual iOS core experience is relatively similar to where it was.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.480]   What is it?
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.480]   Eight years ago now, which I like, by the way.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.480]   It works great.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.480]   Yeah, that's the knock-eye.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.480]   It's still a grid of icons.
[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.480]   I know.
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.560]   It's like, couldn't you do better-- but you know what?
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.960]   By not doing that, by not doing widgets, that's one of the reasons you get better even
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.920]   life, by eliminating background stuff is one of the-- look at this.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.920]   This is really cool.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:24.080]   I didn't know this until Jason Stelz showed me yesterday.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:28.760]   Can you show that if you swipe in from the left-- this is a very Microsoft gesture-- you
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:35.520]   swipe in from the left with Force Touch, you see your previous apps, or you can see if
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.400]   you do that, you'll see the switcher.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.800]   Do we like that new app switch screen?
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.280]   I've had a hard time not closing the right app.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.560]   Everything I've heard is like, if you have Force Touch, it's a lot easier to use than
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.560]   if you're using it on a pre-sus phone.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.560]   Yeah, I'm on six.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.120]   Yeah, I think that's the key is Force Touch.
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:57.040]   I really think that-- and that's an example, Alex Wilham, of a fairly large change in UI,
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.200]   I think.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:02.800]   This is the right click, the right mouse button.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.120]   And we haven't had that before.
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:08.080]   I don't think somebody coming from an iPhone 1 would know, oh, if you press it a little
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.080]   harder.
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.080]   Well, you'd find it by accident.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.640]   Plus, eventually, you definitely would.
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.360]   But I mean, that's not a great onboarding experience if you want to show off what's
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.360]   new.
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.560]   Well, I mean, I think it was funny, a bunch of friends of mine who got this.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:21.880]   The first thing is it was like, oh my goodness, I can log in instantly with my fingerprint.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.640]   And the other thing they said was, they basically spent like three or four hours force touching
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.320]   every single application just to see which one's actually--
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.280]   Because you want to find something that'll do something.
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.280]   Phrasing.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.360]   There still has to be phrasing whenever we say Force Touching all the apps.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.360]   I feel always--
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.360]   You're on the other country.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.360]   --three D touching all the apps.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.360]   That sounds a lot better.
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:38.360]   It's an apple.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.360]   It's an apple crackle pop.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.360]   I touched you.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.440]   Wait, no, no, no, okay.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.440]   But then there's weirdness.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.800]   Like, here's the Apple Watch app.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:47.960]   The Apple Watch app, of course, touched that.
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:48.960]   Nothing happens.
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:49.960]   Oh, the irony.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:54.960]   Well, the other thing is, they were supposed to come out with the new version of the iOS,
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:57.040]   the Watch iOS, the Watch OS.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.040]   Watch OS 2.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.040]   Which has been delayed.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.040]   You know what?
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.040]   It came out Wednesday.
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.040]   Oh, it did.
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.040]   I thought they still had--
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.040]   It doesn't change much.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.040]   Look at this.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.040]   Watch this time machine.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.440]   Ooh, I can go back in time.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.880]   I can go forward in time.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.880]   You seem so enthusiastically.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:16.280]   So impressed with this digital crown.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:17.840]   Your life looks exciting.
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:18.840]   I have an example.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.760]   Well, I have calendar appointments almost all the time.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:21.760]   I know.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:22.760]   You don't stop talking, actually.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:23.760]   It's amazing.
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:24.760]   I don't always get.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:25.760]   What?
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:26.760]   Your voice always sounds so good.
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:27.760]   I get hoarse.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.760]   That's like half an hour of talking.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:31.240]   The first thousand hours after that it gets in.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.560]   Many years of Jack Daniels and cigars.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.000]   And four hour radio shows.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   Oh, Jirce.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   Yeah, that'll do it.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.320]   Do you remember, though, those long CES and Comdex events in Vegas by the end?
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:44.480]   We'd sound like this.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.480]   Yes.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.480]   I'm here to talk about Jim Laderbach.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.560]   That's the name I haven't heard in a while.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.560]   You do feel like Jim.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:55.560]   How?
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:56.560]   How?
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.560]   Good.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.920]   Natalie, give us your pros and cons.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:04.560]   Would you upgrade if you had a six like Mr. Norton?
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:05.560]   Probably not.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.560]   No.
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:09.440]   And you know, the six was the six, I had a six class before.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.680]   So I'm looking at my phone now.
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:16.840]   And so now from the six was just such a good phone that normally by the time September
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:20.440]   comes around, I'm like, oh, yeah, I need it because I'm hard on them or I don't know.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:24.360]   But the six, like it held up to my lifestyle.
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.360]   It is.
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:26.360]   It's pretty nice.
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:27.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.360]   So I didn't need a new one.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:29.360]   I, you know, this is, this doesn't belong to me.
[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:30.360]   I should say that it's a, it's a tester.
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.360]   It has to go back.
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.520]   So we will go back to the old days.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:34.680]   I bet you won't.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.680]   To my own.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.680]   Probably not to.
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.680]   I'll probably.
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:38.680]   I bet you'll want to upgrade.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.680]   And same with the watch.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:41.680]   It doesn't belong to me.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.680]   It's for TV purposes.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.680]   It's a, it's a loner.
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:47.240]   But yeah, I would purchase these in a heartbeat, but what I probably wouldn't even need to go
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:52.240]   from six plus to six S plus because six good, six was good.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.960]   Yeah, I think I think I was nine is very good.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:34:00.520]   I think that iPhone six line of iPhones are just so strong by themselves that I don't
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:01.520]   have a lot of reasons to upgrade.
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.600]   Like these are cool little features, but I can just wait a year.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.800]   You know, I'm not, I'm not in a big rush because my phone's so good already.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.080]   I mean, I broke the screen.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:12.440]   I'm dumb, but I mean, aside from that, I broke the screen and bent mine in the first five
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:17.200]   days and, and that, which is because normally I don't use a phone without, you know, so
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:21.160]   I'm sort of industrial case around it and I tried and it just turned out horribly for
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:26.960]   everyone involved, especially the phone, but it was, I was actually shocked at how light
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.480]   the case was on the six.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.560]   That's like my only complaint about the six and the one really attracted thing about the
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:32.560]   six S.
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.280]   I really love how thin they are just in general.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.760]   So I took it out of its case for like a two day period.
[00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.760]   I see what happened.
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:38.760]   Yeah.
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.760]   I took it out to Ron and of course drop it off the table.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.340]   I know a great guy in El Cerrito that can replace that screen in 20 minutes for
[00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:46.340]   80 bucks.
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:49.400]   I get around to it as I'm in a priority, but like it's, it's just, it still works great.
[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.800]   You know, I love it.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:51.800]   Let's take a break.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.680]   It's so funny when you see people like playing with super crack screens.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.160]   You're like, why don't you take care of that?
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.720]   I'm like, my son, my, both my kids have always have crack screens.
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.920]   My son will use it with a chunk of glass missing.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:07.000]   You can actually see the circuit course, like the Terminator after he got shot in the face.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.880]   It's like, I see, I see a cut yourself.
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:10.880]   I do.
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.880]   That's exactly what I say.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:12.880]   Get a screen fix.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:13.880]   I mean, don't you just you do it.
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:14.880]   You've got connections.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.860]   I told him to go down here to the guy in El Cerrito.
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:23.100]   Yeah, I love I fix it, but sometimes I can't wait 24 hours.
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:24.100]   We're going to take a break.
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:27.360]   Natalie Morris is here from CNBC, Natalie Morris dot com.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.760]   So nice to see you again.
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.760]   Thank you for being here.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.760]   You're welcome.
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:31.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.660]   I corrected you earlier on that force touch.
[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:34.660]   I felt bad.
[00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:35.660]   What did I say?
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:36.660]   Something wrong?
[00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:38.460]   No, I was like, that's not the right way.
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:39.460]   You can.
[00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:41.460]   Oh, and then I felt like a little.
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:42.460]   Oh, that's all right.
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:44.460]   I kind of got me excited.
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:46.720]   I also hear Alex Wilhelm.
[00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.920]   Hey, hey, pretty excited to be sitting next to you.
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.520]   I'm actually I always love doing that again.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:52.520]   All right.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:53.880]   Did you have short hair last time here?
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.680]   I just shave it off every couple weeks.
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.320]   Yeah, I'm going bald.
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.520]   I used to look like that.
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:35:59.880]   So you're looking good still.
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:00.880]   I've grown it out.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.680]   Yeah, yeah, looking good still.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:06.160]   For I understand the rest of that sentence is for a man of your age.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.160]   I did.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.160]   Don't put words on my mouth.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.160]   It's a complex salt.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:10.160]   A complex salt.
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:13.640]   I've been complimented.
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:15.820]   And of course, my old buddy, Patrick Norton.
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:16.820]   Great to have you.
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:17.820]   You did some.
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:18.820]   It was fun.
[00:36:18.820 --> 00:36:19.820]   We'll get you back to the news screen savers again.
[00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:20.820]   I'm already booked.
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.580]   That show is so much fun because it reminds me of the old show in the sense that it was
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:25.060]   a variety show.
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:28.580]   So we had a band yesterday.
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:35.220]   We sang Happy Birthday legally for the first time since 1927.
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:38.260]   We disassembled the BBA robot, took it apart.
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:39.780]   I'm with so much fun.
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:41.380]   Glad my son didn't see that.
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:42.380]   He would have been.
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:43.580]   He's getting one for his birthday.
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:48.400]   They seem-- it's really interesting how they are personified.
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:51.760]   Those are the little rolling robots that are the Star Wars.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.760]   You feel like that's a real person.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:56.680]   He's looking around.
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:58.320]   It's very interesting to see what happens.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:04.080]   I found out about the Star Wars day and ended up chasing with the boys, chasing into
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:11.920]   a target in Richmond, which is always an adventure, and finding the last two Millennium
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:15.160]   Falcon quad conquerors.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.720]   Score.
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:17.720]   Where's Richmond?
[00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:18.720]   Richmond.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.720]   It's like for changing hands.
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.400]   Richmond, Richmond, the city you drove through on the way up.
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.960]   Well, actually, it depends on whether-- if you drive the Richmond San Rafael Bridge.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.720]   Yeah, I just go where in the Bay Area we talk about it.
[00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:29.720]   Where all the refineries are.
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:30.720]   Yeah, the San Frond Refinery.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.720]   Sounds lovely, actually.
[00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:32.720]   It's all moved there right away.
[00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:33.720]   Periodically, they actually--
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:40.240]   They have a siren, not kidding, that will go off-- surprisingly a lot, like at least a
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.880]   couple of times a year that you're supposed to take cover.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:44.880]   I kid you not.
[00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:46.160]   In case the refinery goes--
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.600]   No, because there's been a fire and the air is poisonous.
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:53.880]   First of all, it's not quite that often, but I will say I had been working out of the
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:57.120]   Hack Warehouse, the Hack Five Warehouse in Richmond for a week.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.120]   Wow.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.120]   Wow.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:02.840]   It is very, very close to the Chevron Refinery, but I've been there for a week when-- I was
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.960]   in the middle of doing the This Week in Computer Harbor podcast.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:05.960]   The siren go off?
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:12.280]   No, but he comes in, drops a phone in between me and the Netcam and says, "Refinery's on
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.280]   fire.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.280]   Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go."
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.520]   And it's a picture of what looks like this orange flame.
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:22.040]   Well, it turned out to have been they screwed up, but they released a bunch of steam, and
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:25.720]   then it was-- and then they were burning benzene on one of the eternal flames.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.480]   You were not selling Richmond very well right now.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.480]   No, I'm not.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.680]   But it's not really a pamphlet or brochure that I want.
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:33.520]   You know, in most of Richmond, you probably don't want to live in, but there's some very
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:34.520]   nice parts of Richmond.
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:35.520]   Richmond's actually pretty nice.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:39.200]   And it's also like I can take my-- like, you know, the boys find it fascinating because
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:44.400]   there's railroad trains running through the streets, which, you know, small children love
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.400]   that.
[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:48.000]   If somebody's working on their pirate ship over at the boatyard, there's just a lot of
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.000]  --
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   Excuse me, pirate ship?
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   Pirate ship.
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   I'm totally sold.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   I mean--
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   There's a lot of--
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   That's all I need in my life.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.920]   There's a lot of old military stuff that's been abandoned but it's not occupied, so there's
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:01.000]   a lot of interesting action going on there.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:03.840]   And I'm sure that's where Daren is probably, right?
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:04.840]   One of those warehouses in there.
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:05.840]   Maybe.
[00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:06.840]   Or is it a secret location?
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:07.840]   It's a secret location.
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.320]   Don't know where it is.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.320]   Somewhere in Richmond.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.320]   Never heard of it.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:12.320]   You want to knock on doors?
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.320]   Go right ahead.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.320]   Good luck.
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:15.320]   It's the room for Virginia, though.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.320]   It's not in Virginia.
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.320]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.280]   Well, we went out to New York to stop by the Squarespace offices.
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:25.680]   These guys are-- I love it because they're so committed to making your website look beautiful
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:26.680]   and work great.
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:27.840]   And that's the two things they do.
[00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:28.840]   They host.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.240]   It's best hosting ever.
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.240]   Never goes down super reliable.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.320]   We try all the time to crash Squarespace sites.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.800]   You just can't do it.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.680]   But they also are really committed to aesthetics.
[00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:41.160]   They want your website to look great.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:45.600]   And not really to look great, but to reflect your personal style.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.600]   And that's great.
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.760]   Minus, you were complimenting mine at the top of the show.
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.320]   Mine is a Squarespace at Page.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.320]   Oh, nice.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.320]   That beautiful site, AdleyMores.com.
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.560]   Hey, let's try to bring it down.
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:56.560]   Everybody-- no, seriously.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.560]   I'm serious.
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:40:01.760]   Everybody go to natalimores.com right now.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.840]   And that means thousands of people will hit that site.
[00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.720]   They hit reload over and over again.
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:06.720]   And you can't.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:07.720]   Don't give it a lesser.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:08.720]   That's not very nice.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:09.720]   No, you can't.
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:10.720]   It's Squarespace.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:11.720]   This is the beauty of it.
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:12.720]   No.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:13.720]   I use Squarespace.
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.720]   I'm a customer.
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:15.720]   So you know.
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:16.720]   We're all customers.
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:17.720]   Wow.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.720]   They're a popular brand for reasons.
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.720]   They are a popular brand.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.720]   It starts at $8 a month when you sign up for a year.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.240]   I almost hate to say the price because that kind of implies it's cheap.
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:24.240]   It's not.
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.240]   It's amazing.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:29.480]   Beautiful templates, a very robust, reliable platform.
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.520]   All the designs are mobile responsive.
[00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:36.160]   So that means, in fact, if you go to natalimores.com as we try to break it down, you can resize
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.560]   the page.
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:41.240]   And you can see it's going to look great on any size screen from a small smartphone
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.240]   to a-- yeah.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.760]   Yeah, it's really nice on mobile.
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.800]   And that's a Squarespace template that I use.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.800]   Isn't that nice?
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.120]   That's a smartphone size.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.120]   And that's a giant size.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.120]   And that's the deal.
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:55.520]   That's what every site needs to do these days because you can never be sure what size
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:58.000]   screen your visitors are going to come in on.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.240]   Oh, more than half for visitors now coming on a small screen.
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.240]   I'm not surprised at all.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.920]   Also, what's great about Squarespace, if I can just add into this lad, there are tools
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:08.720]   to make your site and build it out are great if you're not a hardcore developer.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:09.720]   Are you?
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.200]   And so it's very easy to use.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.760]   And even I could figure it out, which is impressive.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.120]   I love that picture of you, Natalie.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:16.120]   Did Clayton take that?
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.120]   That's gorgeous.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.120]   He did.
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:23.520]   He's a very good photographer, but it has to do with the quality of the model, I believe.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.360]   Oh, thank you for saying that.
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:26.360]   Yes, really nice.
[00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.360]   It's really nice.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.360]   It's beautiful.
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.160]   And look at there, the bottom powered by Squarespace.
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:32.160]   So here's the deal.

[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.800]   customers.

[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.640]   And that's the other thing I love Squarespace.
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.880]   You don't have to, you can try it.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.880]   Most of our advertisers do that.
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:48.880]   I love that.
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:49.880]   That means they're confident in their product.
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:53.280]   You just go there, see that get started button, you click that, they will not ask you
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:55.040]   for a credit card.
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.320]   You could just set up a site.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.520]   You got two weeks to try it.
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.760]   You can even import content from your old place to see what it looks like.
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.920]   I got to tell you, Squarespace is the best.
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:05.360]   Use the promo code TWIT.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.080]   You get 10% off.
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.600]   And of course, show your support for this weekend tech.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:13.400]   Squarespace, build it beautiful.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.160]   Is that their timeline or is that kind of a Leo creation?
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.160]   No, that's their timeline.
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.160]   Okay, build it beautiful.
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.160]   Build it beautiful.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.160]   I like that.
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.160]   Isn't that good?
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:23.160]   Good photo, man.
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:24.160]   A little nation.
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:25.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:26.160]   I'm going to do that again.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.320]   You see a lot of other website builders and stuff.
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:29.880]   It looks cookie cutter.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:30.880]   It looks kind of clunky.
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:34.400]   It looks frankly like it came from 2004.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:38.480]   I think they should emphasize how gorgeous that stuff looks.
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:41.080]   We did talk a little bit about Oculus.
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.480]   The Oculus event was this week.
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:46.000]   We did a TWIT Live special covering the keynote.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   Big news.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   The takeaways.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   I'll give you the takeaways.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.800]   First of all, the Oculus Rift or as they call it Rift itself won't be available until
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.800]   next year.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.800]   People don't say an exact date or a price.
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.480]   Q1 is all I say.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.480]   Little disappointing.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:01.880]   They also have hand controllers.
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:06.640]   The people we had on the show, the experts in VR said that really that's a very big part
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:07.640]   of it.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:11.040]   Until you have a hand controller, you're just ahead in space.
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.320]   The ability to manipulate objects becomes very important.
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:17.120]   Unfortunately, those won't be available until Q2.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.720]   They also, as I think I heard, there it is.
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:20.720]   That's the touch.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:21.720]   Yeah.
[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:24.760]   A little bit of haptics, but that's not about you knowing what the surface feels like.
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:27.920]   It's really just about you being able to manipulate.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.280]   They talked about a demo.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.120]   Have you ever done this?
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:36.360]   There's a demo that Oculus does where there's two people in the virtual world.
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:40.520]   You can play catch or you can cooperate.
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:46.040]   We had a couple of really, we had, I can't remember, their names.
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.040]   Who do we have on the event?
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:50.040]   It was Bob and Jeff.
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.720]   Jeff Grum from Venturebeat.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:53.720]   I love Jeff.
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:54.720]   Yeah, Jeff's great.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:55.720]   He does gaming.
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:01.960]   And from the road to VR, I want to say Bob, can't be hung.
[00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.720]   But that comes to mind.
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:04.720]   Wow.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:08.800]   I don't know any personal details about him, but for some reason that's what I think his
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:09.800]   name is out.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:10.800]   You couldn't take it.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:14.560]   What I love, they're going back to the second to the image we had of the handkerchiefs.
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:15.560]   And Lang.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:16.560]   Lang, thank you Ben.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.560]   Sorry.
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:18.560]   Okay.
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:22.800]   The guy wearing the headset with the little handhold thing is did look shockingly nerdy.
[00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:25.520]   And I'm curious if there's going to be any sort of perception problems around use of
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:29.760]   this technology, especially in the wake of the Google Glass, not melt on per se, but
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:30.760]   just failure.
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:31.760]   Well, not just glass.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:32.760]   Remember that thing called the segue?
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:37.640]   I was going to change the world except that you looked like a dork riding one.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:41.200]   There is something to be said for looking less dorky when you wear stuff like that.
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:46.360]   I mean, first of all, if you're alone in your room, if you're alone in your room playing
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.880]   games, you probably already look dorky.
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:52.200]   If you're in a virtual, if you are in a VR environment, everybody's wearing a headset,
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.280]   nobody really knows how dorky you look.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:57.280]   You're thinking of the Palmer, a lucky Newsweek cover.
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.840]   Oh, the guy jumping.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:03.040]   No, but I mean, like if you look at the HoloLens, everybody looks like a dork when you wear
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.040]   it.
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.040]   I think HoloLens is quite a try.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.920]   The Microsoft AR helmet, I think looks pretty cool.
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:11.680]   I'm with you because I, and I, for a long time thought that AR was much more interesting
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:16.120]   than VR, but I am, I'm now Ben and Jeff were saying when you experienced like this thing
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:20.760]   where you're in a world with somebody else there, or, you know, it is, it actually can
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.520]   change.
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:24.520]   It's amazing.
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.480]   And I have to say now having, I got the gear VR, the galaxy thing.
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:30.120]   I've looked at a lot of demos.
[00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:31.520]   I'm a little bit more sold on this.
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:35.360]   It is immersive and it's not just immersive for gaming, although it's, that's a big part
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:36.360]   of it.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.120]   It, I fact for me, not a big part at all.
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:43.720]   It's immersive for like, go on a time square, time square or going to Paris or, or, or,
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:48.480]   I would love to have a VR camera in the studio and you could come, you could watch the show,
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:49.480]   but you could look around.
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.360]   See, we choose what you're looking at now.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.920]   We show, you know, we show whoever's talking, but wouldn't it be great if you could look
[00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:57.440]   back and forth and see what your reaction is to what it is?
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:02.160]   People, but you'll still, I mean, having watched, you know, a large internet, some of
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:05.840]   the content created by a large international media company, like to some degree, yes, you
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:10.120]   will be able to choose, but in most cases they will still control the narrative by giving
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:14.000]   you certain things to choose and by using audio cues and in an attempt to create a story
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   that is more compelling.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.400]   There's a, on the gear VR there's, have you played with this Natalie and all the virtual
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.400]   reality headsets?
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.400]   A Microsoft version.
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:26.680]   Yeah, see, I'm very interested in that, but that's very different because you're not
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:27.680]   sealed in.
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:32.240]   And for a long time I thought that was better because who wants to be isolated in this box
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.640]   and that's one of the reasons having two people is kind of interesting.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:36.080]   But there's a Cirque du Soleil.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:44.000]   If you can get, if you can borrow or beg or steal a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 or an S6 and
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.200]   this visor, you put the phone in it, there's a Cirque du Soleil demo and you're sitting
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:50.400]   in the middle of a performance.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:54.040]   And their performers all around you and they were smart when they filmed it because the
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:56.320]   performers are interacting with the camera.
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:59.080]   So it looks like if I look over here, there's somebody interacting with me.
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:03.200]   I'll look over there and you really, and you can look over here and there's a person back
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:06.400]   and they're all doing different, you know, Cirque style stuff and it's fun.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.400]   It's really interesting.
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.240]   And that's what I'm excited about more than just taking will be currently billed in terms
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.040]   of content and thrown into a visor.
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:15.560]   I'm curious what we can do that's new and different in terms of content, interactions,
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:20.120]   and experiences because if we can do more Cirque du Soleil, I would like to in my life
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:22.760]   because Cirqueana is in Vegas and I'm not.
[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:23.760]   Right.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:24.760]   So well, that's a perfect demo.
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:25.760]   Here's the toy box.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:29.120]   Then I have a question about cognition though and I don't know if any of us can really answer
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:33.760]   this but you know, we notice things now because of our peripheral vision.
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:39.880]   So when you're trying to focus on one thing, there is no concept of peripheral, like this
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:43.400]   stuff, you don't notice this out of your peripheral vision, right?
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:47.120]   You have to then take your attention off of what you're looking at and turn to look at
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:48.120]   it.
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:54.160]   Yeah, in a lot of cases, when you look at like Dolby has some pretty extensive VR audio
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:58.920]   stuff that they're working on and their point is like, you know, audio cues are critical
[00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:02.480]   for storytelling in a VR environment because you just said it, how do you get people to
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:03.480]   turn your head?
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:06.760]   We can do an arrow that's really clumsy or you can have something happen off and on stage
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:10.840]   right and then your head turns to stage right and you know, the goblin comes in or something.
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:12.040]   Do you guys remember the video game?
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:14.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:18.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:19.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:22.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:27.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:28.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:29.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:32.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:43.040]   I remember the video game.
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:44.040]   I remember the video game.

[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:36.040]   Oh no compared to the future we're describing here.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.040]   We have different headsets and sensors and all that.
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:40.040]   And the experience you could do when you control it on your own.
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:43.040]   It'll make Avatar look relatively old school and child.
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:47.040]   Curious do you guys look back at Avatar like it's a classic?
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:49.040]   You do.
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:50.040]   No.
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:51.040]   Not me.
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:52.040]   (laughs)
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:53.040]   That's bad tricks.
[00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:54.040]   Alright, that's bad tricks.
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:55.040]   It's abstaining.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:57.040]   Well I just, it was, there was a lot of attention on it.
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:58.040]   And Hugo too.
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:00.040]   Remember the 3D movie that Scorsese made?
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:05.040]   I still haven't seen the 3D version of Hugo but I think Hugo is a massive love letter to cinema.
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:06.040]   It is.
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:07.040]   His grandchildren.
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:08.040]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:09.040]   It's a nice piece of work.
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:10.040]   Okay, good.
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:11.040]   So that one is a classic.
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:13.040]   But it's funny because it's not classic because of 3D or the technology.
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:14.040]   No.
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:15.040]   It's the movie.
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:17.040]   I want to see the Martian.
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.040]   You've seen it yet?
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:19.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:20.040]   That's gonna, should I say, okay so here's a question.
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:21.040]   Read the book first.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:22.040]   Read the book first.
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:23.040]   Oh, of course.
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:25.040]   I've read it many times.
[00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:27.040]   No, I read it once.
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:28.040]   But no, yes.
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:29.040]   I have a strong recommendation.
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:34.040]   Although Andy Enoco saw it and he says it's better than the book.
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:35.040]   No.
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:36.040]   Don't, don't, don't.
[00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:37.040]   I just got so excited.
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:38.040]   I know me too.
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:39.040]   I trust him.
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:41.040]   And he said, you know what, it's even better.
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:43.040]   It's not, you're not going to be disappointed.
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:46.040]   But the question, should I see that in 3D or 2D?
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:47.040]   Ooh.
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:49.040]   Depends on the 3D theater and depends on what they shot it in.
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:50.040]   Okay.
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:51.040]   It's old.
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:52.040]   Shot in 3D.
[00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:53.040]   Real D.
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:54.040]   Real D theater here.
[00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:56.040]   It was shot in 3D.
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:57:00.040]   I read one review that said not a lot of special effects, you know, just 3D.
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:02.040]   Well, he's just stuck on Mars.
[00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:04.040]   There's not a lot of explosions going off.
[00:57:04.040 --> 00:57:05.040]   Oh, yes, there are.
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:06.040]   Oh, did you read the book?
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:08.040]   Well, but I don't want to tell them.
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:10.040]   Yeah, there's an explosion or two.
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:11.040]   All right.
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:13.040]   Actually, there's no spoilers on Twitter.
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:15.040]   It was shot in IMAX 3D.
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:16.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:17.040]   Oh, IMAX.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.040]   Hold on.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:19.040]   Oh, I want to see it in IMAX.
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:21.040]   See, I would see it in IMAX.
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:23.040]   And if you see it in IMAX, you have to see it in 3D, right?
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:25.040]   You can't see it in IMAX 2D.
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:26.040]   Hmm.
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:30.040]   You got 24% on what tomatoes.
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:34.040]   Sometimes I don't trust rotten tomatoes when it's Star Wars or something like this, because
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:38.040]   you know that the geeks who use rotten tomatoes are going to just rank it up.
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:42.040]   But you don't look at the critics and rotten tomatoes, not the end user.
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:44.040]   Although it's half and half.
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:45.040]   Oh, the middle is each other.
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:47.040]   Oh, total score is 50/50.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:52.040]   So you can look at the critics score as well as the, in fact, that's a good question.
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:54.040]   Are you looking at it right now, Natalie?
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:55.040]   What's the critics score?
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:56.040]   I am.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.040]   Let's see.
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:01.120]   It's average count, review count, freshman.
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:02.120]   Where does it say that?
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:03.120]   On the critics versus.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:04.120]   I don't know.
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:05.120]   Aren't we nerds?
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:10.600]   I just see the 94%.
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:11.600]   All critics.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:13.040]   All critics, top critics.
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:14.040]   I don't know.
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:16.040]   That's it.
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:17.040]   All critics are top critics.
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:19.040]   Either one of those should be, it shouldn't shift much between those two.
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:20.040]   No funny.
[00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:21.040]   No top critics.
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:23.040]   Oh, you know why?
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:25.240]   Because it's not public yet.
[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:26.240]   So it hasn't come out.
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:27.240]   It comes out Friday.
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:30.280]   No, well then it could do anything between now and then.
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:32.280]   Are we going to go?
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:33.280]   Do we think?
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:34.280]   Are we?
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:35.280]   Let's all go.
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:36.280]   You want to go?
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:37.280]   I'll go with you.
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:38.280]   I'll go.
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:39.280]   I'll go.
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:40.280]   I'll bring the tequila.
[00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:41.280]   Would you read the Dr. Pepper?
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:42.280]   No.
[00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:43.280]   I'm just saying I'm really excited about it because-
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:44.280]   Okay, can I just say do not drink tequila and go to a 3D IMAX movie?
[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:45.280]   Oh, that would be bad.
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:47.520]   No, I don't think that's a good way to stay on the drive.
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:50.880]   Although if you do, those popcorn buckets can be used for many things.
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:52.880]   Those would say bring me a bucket.
[00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:55.800]   Oh, God, that's gross.
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:57.920]   Just one more wafer thin mint, Mr. LePort.
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:59.720]   Patrick, you didn't shave today.
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:00.720]   No.
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:01.720]   I didn't.
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:02.720]   Would you like to shave right now?
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:03.720]   I will go shave right now.
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:05.120]   I brought you some berries.
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:06.920]   Oh, I'll definitely go shave right now.
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:08.720]   I'll show you today brought to you, but you don't have to shave.
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:09.720]   No, I'll shave right now.
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:10.720]   You really want to?
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:11.720]   Yeah, why not?
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:14.440]   I've shaved on camera before with the Harry's because the Harry's is so smooth you never
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:15.440]   have.
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:16.440]   There's no risk.
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:17.440]   You don't have to worry about cutting yourself.
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:18.440]   There is a danger of me cutting myself just-
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:19.440]   Not with Harry's.
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:20.440]   You've never seen me shave, have you?
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:21.440]   You're up here.
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:22.440]   Right here on Twitter.
[00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:24.440]   He has to have some hair all over the-
[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:26.440]   That's why I thought.
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:27.440]   That was scary.
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:30.040]   Harry's is a great place to go to get your razor blade.
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:31.040]   Shaving's not fun.
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:34.440]   Nobody looks forward to shaving, but I tell you, when you have a great blade that's not
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:41.280]   scraping you, it's sharp, it's precise, and a wonderful, delicious smelling cream.
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:42.280]   I like the cream.
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:43.280]   They also have the shaved gel.
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:45.520]   You get your choice.
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:46.520]   It's a lot better.
[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:47.520]   It's amazing.
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:48.520]   It's amazing.
[00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:49.520]   Isn't that nice?
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:52.200]   You can get that engraved with your name if you want.
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:53.200]   This is the Winst.
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:54.200]   That's my husband.
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:55.200]   Did you?
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:57.200]   For Father's Day?
[00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:58.200]   I don't remember what.
[00:59:58.200 --> 00:59:59.200]   Did he like it?
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:00.200]   Did he like it?
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.200]   Yeah, it's a cute, the stand.
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.200]   Yeah, it's good.
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.200]   They have a classic handle.
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.200]   That's the Truman.
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:05.200]   That's $15.
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.200]   The metal handle is the Winston.
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.640]   I have that, and that's $25 I think.
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:11.000]   But we're going to tell you I can get it for even less.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.520]   The best thing about Harry's is that they make the blades themselves.
[01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:17.080]   They actually bought the factory in Germany where they make the blades.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:21.320]   So they design them for performance, for precision, and they ship direct to you.
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.680]   So you get a great price.
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:28.880]   About half the price of those $4 Gillette Fusion blades in the grocery store.
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:31.720]   The ones that are locked up because they're so expensive.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:35.040]   Harry's guarantees your satisfaction in every kit.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.600]   You get a razor with a handle.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.600]   It feels great.
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.600]   Doesn't that smell good?
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.600]   You get three razor blades.
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.480]   You're using the foaming shaved gel there, which I think is a lot.
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.640]   That's $15 for all of that.
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:51.160]   We're going to give you five bucks off when you use the offer code TWIT5 at checkout.
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:55.520]   Let's take a look at what you might have missed.
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:57.560]   We had a big week this week.
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:58.560]   Huge week.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:00:59.560]   Huge week.
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:00.560]   You weren't even here.
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:01.560]   I'm just agreeing with you.
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:02.560]   Huge week.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:03.560]   Huge week.
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:04.560]   Take a look.
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:05.560]   Previously on TWIT.
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:06.560]   Before you buy.
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:09.060]   Hey, it's Mike Elgin here.
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:12.240]   I'm just going to be reviewing DD8 by Sphero.
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.440]   You've heard a lot about it.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:14.440]   And what's my recommendation?
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:15.440]   What are you kidding?
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:17.740]   This is definitely a buy.
[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:19.400]   The new screen sabers.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.400]   This is what color.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.400]   What color would you say that is?
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.880]   Well, I'm a little color blind, but I'm going to say rose gold.
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:25.880]   We've got swatches here.
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:26.880]   Can we match it up?
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:27.880]   All right, let's do it.
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:28.880]   Um, yeah.
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.840]   It's not pink.
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:32.080]   This week in Google.
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:36.960]   French data regulator says, the list somebody in France, Google, you have to delete it not
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.440]   just on google.fr.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.120]   You have to delete it everywhere.
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.640]   This is exactly what I've been screaming about.
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:43.640]   What's wrong with this decision?
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:44.640]   Yeah.
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:48.920]   And if France can do it, so can China and so can Putin and and.
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.920]   Stay away from our area people.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:51.920]   TWIT.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.440]   Broadcasting from the capital of the free world.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.360]   Petaluma, California.
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:02:01.600]   Why would anyone want to take the cute little BB and then just dismantle the poor sucker?
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:02.960]   Well, clearly they're monsters.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:03.960]   They're evil.
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.960]   They're evil.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:10.400]   Coming up this week, Google is holding a big announcement on Tuesday, September 29th
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.960]   in San Francisco, we're expecting Google to unveil the Android 6.0 Marshmallow Nexus
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:20.680]   5X and Nexus 6P smartphones and possibly two Chromecast branded products.
[01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:25.800]   Tuesday evening, Tesla is expected to announce details about its model X car, the Tesla factory
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:26.800]   in Fremont, California.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:27.800]   What?
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:31.000]   And on Wednesday, September 30th, Amazon's line of fire tablet ships.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.240]   And on Thursday, October 1st, LG is expected to unveil a phone called the V10, which is
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:40.440]   supposed to have a small ticker like display next to the phone's front facing camera.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.200]   As it's coming up this week, back to you, Leo.
[01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:49.120]   A couple of things that reminded me of, we ordered so the $50 tablets, the Amazon tablets,
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.120]   I thought this was a joke.
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.400]   They sold them in six packs.
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.640]   Oh, no, that's true.
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:58.000]   We bought three six packs, the 18 people in the studio wanted that tablet.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.080]   So those are all becoming in a couple of weeks, I think.
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:02.080]   Eighteen.
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.720]   We're going to have a 18 unboxing.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:09.280]   So new phones from the Google Tuesday.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:10.280]   We think we don't know.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:12.560]   I mean, this is all rumor, but Tuesday Google is having an announcement.
[01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:16.000]   We think it'll be the announcement of the new Nexus's, next side.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   They'll be the 5X, which is a from LG.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.160]   I don't know how big it's going to be.
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.160]   Is it 5.0?
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.920]   I think it's like 552.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.120]   5.2 right around there.
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.120]   Yeah.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.120]   5.7 here.
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.440]   No, that's this 6P.
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.440]   That's the big one.
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:30.440]   Oh.
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.440]   Biggin.
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.440]   So that's from a long way.
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:37.800]   Yeah, that's an interesting choice, because they've never done a phone for somebody big
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:38.800]   like that.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:41.480]   Well, they've never, as far as I know, sold phones in the US, right?
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:44.000]   You could get them, but you had to go to a Chinese site to get them.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:45.720]   Alibaba or whatever else you play.
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:46.880]   Yeah, Alibaba, yeah.
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:49.680]   I'm excited because we were just talking about this.
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:56.520]   Battery life is really, I think, the weak point on Android phones.
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:59.440]   The last Android phone I had that would last a day was the OnePlus One.
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:00.840]   I haven't had one since.
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.040]   That was a 1080p screen.
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.480]   That's one of the reasons.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:08.040]   But this is going to have a 3,450 million battery in the 5.7.
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.920]   That's as big as I've ever seen in a phone.
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:14.200]   So if it doesn't have good battery life, there's no hope.
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:17.480]   It will come with marshmallow.
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:18.960]   Every phone should come with a marshmallow.
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:21.920]   Well, it is funny because we know so little about marshmallow.
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:22.920]   We don't.
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:23.920]   They haven't really said much.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:29.760]   It's going to have that new thing where if you're, what do they call it?
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:33.760]   If you're looking at something, you get Google now by tapping, like you're on a website,
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:37.680]   you tap something, a Google now cart will slide up or you're on a site to buy something
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:38.680]   in.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.560]   I can't remember the name of that.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:41.560]   Tap to something.
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:45.120]   Would you like to buy this to somewhere we get money and somebody who are currently?
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.120]   Yeah, probably.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.200]   Type-C charger.
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:50.040]   I think that's the wave of the future.
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:53.360]   I'm very, I'm actually a little disappointed that Apple didn't pull the plug.
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:56.440]   You know they'll do it next week on the Type-C, the next year, next week.
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:58.560]   Is that what the new MacBook uses?
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:04:59.560]   Okay.
[01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:00.560]   I like that.
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:03.520]   And the Google Pixel and the OnePlus 2 uses it.
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:04.960]   And it has some real advantages.
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:06.240]   We'll see how Google implements it.
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:13.240]   On the OnePlus 2, it's just a USB port, a USB 2.0 port with a Type-C plug.
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:18.160]   But the way Apple and the Pixel implement it, it's a bidirectional so you can charge a
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:22.560]   phone from your laptop as well as charge your laptop.
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:23.720]   And it's got fast data.
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:25.000]   It's got Thunderbolt speed data.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.840]   There's a lot of things on the USB Type-C if it's USB 3.1 that'll be very interesting.
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:31.080]   I hope Google implements that.
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:32.280]   That would be nice.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:37.240]   It's going to be a big phone but 5.7 inches, not 6 like the old Google Nexus 6.
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:41.920]   At least, again, all rumors but at this point the rumors are pretty.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:42.920]   Yeah.
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:44.360]   I mean we're seeing slide decks.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:45.360]   Right.
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:50.280]   That's one of the things that came out this morning is decks that I guess were for, yeah,
[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:55.160]   Android police had them where the training decks for some of the phone vendors.
[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:58.960]   There seems to be less enthusiasm among the four of us about these phones compared to
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:01.600]   our 45 minute epic on $1,000.
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:02.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:03.600]   Yeah.
[01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:05.000]   I'm a big, I love Android.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.560]   I really think Android is amazing.
[01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:09.480]   I'll give you an example of the difference between Apple and Android.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:16.320]   Apple made a program that they put on the Google Play store called Move to iOS.
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.320]   And Google goes, "Yeah, fine."
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:18.320]   They put it on the store.
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:19.320]   They didn't block it.
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.320]   Move to iOS.
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:24.160]   There's no way that Google could do the same to Apple because Apple--
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.160]   Oh gosh, no.
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:29.560]   No, Apple store rules specifically forbid mentioning other operating systems.
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:30.560]   Are you fun for them to do that?
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:31.560]   You know they enforce that too.
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:32.560]   That's a good thing for us.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:33.560]   They go down the letters.
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:35.480]   Oh man, that's awesome.
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:38.920]   So that's kind of in a way, a nutshell if you wanted to, if you're talking to a friend
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:44.440]   about the difference between iOS and Android right there, Apple is a walled garden.
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:46.000]   It's a beautiful walled garden.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.480]   There's lots of flowers.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.640]   Binches, yubs, bass.
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:50.640]   But it's walled.
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:51.800]   Ooh, look at that boy.
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:53.160]   There's a lot of one star reviews.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.960]   Do not install and yet, unless you want a lobotomy.
[01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:57.800]   Oh, you know why.
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:01.520]   These are Android fanboys given it to Apple.
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:02.520]   Seriously?
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:03.520]   That's why.
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:04.520]   It's not a bad program.
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.520]   Although--
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:07.440]   Google should submit an app just so they can get into the--
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:08.440]   Right.
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:09.440]   Just so Apple will have to put it on their page.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:10.440]   We've got turned down.
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:13.600]   I mean, if they want a free PR win and a great media cycle, yeah.
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:15.480]   But I mean, it requires some work.
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:20.520]   So besides Type C, which I think increasingly is going to be the default for smartphones,
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:24.760]   and I'm sure Apple will do it next generation on the iPhone 7.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.240]   Also, fingerprint reader on this.
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:27.400]   And I think that's so important.
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.200]   At this point, I feel like you have to--
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:30.640]   Fingerprint reader on the back.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.400]   Yeah, that might help that.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:35.960]   I mean, LG also puts their-- I mean, I love the LG G4, but they--
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:39.800]   It takes a lot of getting used to the button being on the back like that.
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.120]   I do think though, a fingerprint reader.
[01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:42.120]   You know what?
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:46.320]   What phone is it that puts the fingerprint reader on the on/off switch?
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:49.480]   Are the Sony Xperia, the new Xperia?
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:50.480]   That makes sense.
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:54.360]   Because you're pushing the on/off switch, and it reads your fingerprint when you do it.
[01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:56.440]   That kind of makes sense.
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:57.440]   But the back will say--
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:00.320]   Kind of amazing technology to be able to do it in such a small place.
[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:01.320]   Yeah.
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:02.320]   And you're right.
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:03.320]   I guess it's just reading a few ridges.
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:06.880]   Well, it's also like, you know, you just have to drag your finger, or you'd have to have
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:09.080]   this huge percentage of your fingerprint to make it work.
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:12.880]   And the fact is, is once you've programmed your finger in there, you know, it doesn't--
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:14.800]   You don't have to focus on it, which is so awesome.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:15.800]   Right.
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:20.280]   You should mention Type C is also capable of up to 100 watts, which means fast charging
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:23.480]   could be really fast with a Type C connector.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:27.660]   It's going to be hard to stuff that kind of wattage into a battery without terminally
[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:31.400]   destroying its recharge life in a matter of cycles.
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:33.560]   And they ought to put supercapacitors in these things.
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.320]   They could charge them in seconds.
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:36.320]   It'd be nice.
[01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:39.040]   It only has three-minute battery life, but you just charge it again.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.040]   In seconds.
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.600]   Anyway, we'll find out more.
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:50.320]   We are going to cover that event live starting 9 AM Pacific, noon Eastern, 1600 UTC on Twitch.
[01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:51.880]   I'll be there.
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:56.920]   Actually, I think I'll be alone because Mike Elgood's going to the event.
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.600]   Jason Hals on vacation.
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:08:59.600]   You know who's going to join me?
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:00.600]   I'm excited.
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:01.600]   Gina Trapani.
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:02.600]   Nice.
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:03.600]   He'll be joining us.
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:08.320]   Live coverage starting at 9 AM on Tuesday of the Google event.
[01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:12.600]   So rumored, there'll be a new Chromecast.
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:13.600]   That would be awesome.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.800]   Do you love the Chromecast?
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:19.360]   I'm just curious to see what they come up with.
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:20.960]   It's a nice piece of hardware for the money.
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.200]   It does its job.
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.440]   I just want to see where they take it.
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:26.440]   What do you want to do?
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:27.440]   What do you think, Tim?
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:28.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:29.440]   Go for it.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:30.440]   Sorry.
[01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:31.440]   That's just it.
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:33.200]   I can't see any particular reason to upgrade the current one.
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:34.200]   Do you want...
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.200]   Okay, faster would be nice.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.360]   4K would be nice.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:41.160]   This is a joke app, but we should submit this to the Apple Store.
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.160]   Stick with Android.
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:43.160]   Click.
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.520]   Look at me, ratings announced.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:48.920]   9,645 5-star ratings.
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.560]   Click here to stick with Android.
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.560]   What does it do?
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:53.560]   Nothing.
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:54.560]   I love it.
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.280]   You're on Android already.
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:57.280]   I'm sorry.
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.240]   I didn't mean to distract.
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:00.240]   So Chromecast.
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:01.240]   You're right.
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:05.360]   The key to Chromecast is apps, not the hardware.
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.880]   It will probably have AC.
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:07.880]   802.11 AC, right?
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:09.840]   That will be faster.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.120]   Support for 4K would be nice.
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:14.120]   It would have to be HDMI 2.0.
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:16.120]   I don't know.
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:20.640]   It would have to be HDMI 2.0 to support 4K.
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.640]   I would...
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:25.200]   Maybe more effective Wi-Fi, better support for 4K.
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:28.360]   Because Netflix does 4K, right?
[01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:29.360]   Kind of.
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:30.360]   Well, there is some...
[01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:33.840]   If you can find 4K and you have enough 4K, right?
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:35.120]   It doesn't hic up in the process.
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:37.720]   Those like 8 people who actually enjoy that right now.
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:38.720]   12.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:39.720]   15.
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:40.720]   Okay.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:41.720]   And you've got a need a 4K screen of course.
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:42.720]   Oh, it's a 4.
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:43.720]   Yeah.
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:47.120]   The rumor is it's going to look like a hockey puck.
[01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:50.560]   Well, they already did sort of a Google TV hockey puck.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:52.240]   Oh, the Q.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:54.960]   I forgot about that.
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:56.400]   That was the thing that they killed.
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:59.560]   No, no, no, no, not the round one that looked like a softball.
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:00.560]   The Q, right?
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:01.560]   No.
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:02.560]   There's a hockey puck?
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:03.560]   Google TV?
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.560]   It should be up at the Play Store.
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:11.580]   Don't you love it when, you know, Google moved everything to this dark corner of the
[01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:12.580]   Play Store?
[01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:13.580]   I know.
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:17.120]   So here's leaked images of the new Chromecast, which makes it look like I don't know something
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.120]   really bad.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.120]   That's not the right track of it all.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:20.120]   Natalie, do you...
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:22.240]   Well, but the point, and the funny thing is I don't even know why they're colors because
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.880]   really the way it works, you put it in behind your TV.
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.880]   You're not supposed to see it.
[01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:26.880]   You don't ever see it.
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:27.880]   That's why I said small.
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:28.880]   Or you put it in your...
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:29.880]   Do you use Chromecast?
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:30.880]   What do you...
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:33.120]   What do you use at the lake?
[01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.120]   Never watch a TV.
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:39.440]   Oh, I'm afraid to answer this question because we sound so spoiled.
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.400]   So at the lake.
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.400]   But I have...
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:43.400]   Well, we have everything.
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:44.400]   We have them.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:46.400]   So do I.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.400]   No, you have to.
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:48.400]   It's your job.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:49.400]   Yeah.
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:51.520]   Do not apologize for being a wealthy 1% or not.
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:52.520]   Do not.
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:53.760]   Actually, stop, stop, stop.
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:58.120]   Because a lot of people who work in technology, like I have six different streaming devices.
[01:11:58.120 --> 01:11:59.120]   I know.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:01.760]   It's your job.
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:02.760]   The new Apple TV?
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:03.960]   We have all of it.
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:05.680]   And we just got a new TiVo as well.
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:07.680]   We got the brand new TiVo, which is super awesome.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.080]   Isn't it the best ever?
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:10.080]   It's the best.
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.080]   The Romeo Pro.
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:12.080]   Is that what you got?
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:13.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:14.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.080]   Yeah.
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.080]   That's it.
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:17.080]   The Nexus player.
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:18.080]   I see what you...
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.080]   I know what you're talking about.
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:20.080]   I also...
[01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.080]   We also have Chromecast.
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.080]   And we have a Roku and we have Apple TV as well.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.080]   Which one do you use more?
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:24.640]   Or what is even the thought process?
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.320]   This is the Roku a lot.
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.320]   Yeah.
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:31.320]   The apps on Roku are really good and it makes it easy to get exactly where you want
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:32.320]   to.
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:33.560]   You know, where's my kids?
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:38.280]   They really want to watch Netflix or they're now really into Star Wars Rebels.
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:42.040]   And that's on the Disney XD app on either iTunes or Roku.
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:44.400]   So yeah, it just depends.
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.800]   You think for kids, Roku is the right, the best choice.
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:49.560]   My son really can...
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:51.320]   You know, he just turned five.
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:56.160]   And so my daughter's three and my son is five and he can navigate that remote really
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.160]   well.
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:58.160]   Wow.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:12:59.160]   That's easiest for him.
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:01.160]   Just a few years before you're going to be shouting, "Hey, can you get a new one?"
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.160]   Can you get in here and...
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:03.160]   Like, like Ozzy.
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:04.160]   Right.
[01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:05.160]   But...
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.160]   But...
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:09.480]   I think a bigger problem is like, you know, if you already have a bunch of content in
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:12.800]   iTunes or if you already have a bunch of content on the Play Store, if you already have a
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:17.080]   bunch of content on Amazon Prime, for that's for us, that's the bigger problem.
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:19.360]   Even figuring out where the hell it is.
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:22.720]   Well, that's just interesting about the Apple TV is the idea that it's going to be able
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:25.200]   to search all the apps you have loaded on your site.
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:27.720]   But Apple TV won't ever have Amazon.
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:28.720]   No, it won't.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:33.400]   It's Amazon Prime when they released and I haven't looked at the new.
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:34.400]   The new Fire TV is coming out.
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:35.400]   We're going to take a look at it.
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:39.400]   But it was so funny when they released the Fire TV where you could, you know, search
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:40.400]   for something.
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:45.040]   It would search paid entries in the Amazon store before it would find things that were
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:49.600]   free on Amazon Prime because they just hadn't finished programming other things into it yet.
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:50.600]   That's really frustrating.
[01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:51.600]   That was irritating.
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:54.240]   Then you buy something and you realize that could have gotten that for free.
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:55.240]   Yeah.
[01:13:55.240 --> 01:13:56.240]   That's really interesting.
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:00.320]   That would be interesting to see if our kids can use Siri on the remote, on the new Apple
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:06.840]   TV because my kids, they try to use the Amazon Echo a lot and they just still have like baby
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:07.840]   voices.
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:12.440]   So they'll say, "Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:15.680]   My son always wants to hear this specific song by the flock of seagulls.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:17.160]   It's called Wishing."
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:22.000]   And he goes, "Oh, Alexa, play Wishing by the flock of seagulls."
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.840]   And she just says, "I understand."
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:24.840]   I'm sorry.
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:25.840]   Little one.
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:27.840]   I have no idea what you just said.
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:29.080]   Well, I feel old.
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:32.640]   If your child is listening to flock of seagulls, I feel really old.
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:34.640]   No, we just try and give them the kind of...
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:35.640]   You're good parents.
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:36.640]   That's what I think.
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:37.640]   Yeah.
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:38.640]   You're a good academic musical background.
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:39.640]   Yeah.
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:40.640]   Excellent parents.
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:41.640]   Next, they're going to be listening to Tangerine Dream.
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:42.640]   No.
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:43.640]   So...
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:47.680]   Well, my husband last year was so over frozen because it was everywhere that he sat my daughter
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:52.080]   down and he was like, "You're going to have to learn a little band called The Beatles."
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:55.800]   And so she was so tiny and she would go over when she was barely two years old.
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:58.280]   She would push the little button on our speakers.
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:14:59.280]   Is this a Beatles?
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:04.360]   She would be like, "I just love the Beatles."
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:07.960]   You know, you can ask Alexa to explode if you've done that yet.
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:08.960]   No.
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:09.960]   Don't tell miles of that.
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:13.760]   You know what's funny is that Alexa can search the web.
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:14.760]   Yeah.
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:18.200]   So when we first got it, we said, "Alexa, who is Clayton Morris?"
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:19.200]   And it knows who he is.
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:20.200]   Yeah.
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.200]   He can be a big figure.
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:23.480]   But then the kid said, "Who is Natalie Morris?"
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:24.480]   And it does not know.
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.480]   Because I'm nobody.
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:28.080]   My kids were really upset about it.
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:31.280]   Like that's when she doesn't know mommy.
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:35.880]   Yeah, I really love the idea of talking to stuff.
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:41.160]   The thing I'm most excited about the Apple TV will see if it works is you can say, "What
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:42.160]   did he say?"
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:43.160]   Right.
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.160]   And we'll come back.
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.160]   We're going six.
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:46.160]   What is it?
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:47.160]   Ten seconds.
[01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:49.160]   And we'll replay the last ten seconds.
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:50.160]   That I need.
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:51.160]   That's so bad.
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:52.160]   Are you going tough, Luke?
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:54.160]   Why don't you just use subtitles?
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:55.400]   Well, that's what it does.
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:56.760]   It actually turns on as...
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.080]   I don't want to watch subtitles the whole time.
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:15:59.880]   But if you say, "What did he say?"
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:05.280]   It rewinds, turns on the subtitles for ten seconds, and then you can watch it and read
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:07.280]   it and then it continues on as if nothing happened.
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:08.280]   I mean...
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:09.280]   And then it turns the subtitles off?
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:10.280]   Yes.
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:11.280]   That's kind of cool.
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:12.280]   That's awesome.
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:13.280]   Yeah.
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.280]   Oh, definitely.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:15.920]   Tell me you young people with perfect ears haven't done that from time to time.
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:17.920]   I mean, that for game of time.
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:18.920]   Like you young people.
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:19.920]   Yes, all the time.
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:20.920]   Yeah.
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:22.360]   Well, I mean, I live in a tiny little craftsman.
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:26.600]   So if the kids are asleep, we can't really listen to anything in a normal volume.
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:30.120]   So I've been watching stuff for the last two years with subtitles, and I don't enjoy
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:33.240]   it nearly as much as watching it with the actual volume up.
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:37.200]   Somebody said, "If you say buffalo seven times, something happens."
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:41.280]   Isn't that the longest sentence that actually is English correct using one word?
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.280]   What?
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:43.280]   Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:44.280]   Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo.
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:45.760]   Is there seven different meanings of the word buffalo?
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:47.080]   I think that sounds right.
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:48.560]   Chadram, can you help us out?
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:49.720]   Someone explain this.
[01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:50.720]   No.
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:51.720]   That is obscure.
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:52.720]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:54.280]   It's on Wikipedia, I think.
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:55.640]   Well, that must be true.
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:57.080]   No, well, the internet's always accurate.
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:16:58.080]   And it knows that.
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:16:59.080]   It's starting wrong.
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:01.440]   I'm going to paste buffalo in seven times.
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:05.240]   Five, six, seven, and see what happens.
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:06.240]   Yes.
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:10.320]   Bison engaged in a contest of dominance.
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:12.760]   That's what it means.
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:15.440]   Because bison is a buffalo.
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:16.440]   I don't know.
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:19.320]   Yeah, it's a grammatically correct sentence.
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:22.720]   It's an example of homonyms and homophones.
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:25.200]   Teach this to your kids.
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:30.200]   The city of Buffalo, the noun buffalo, the verb buffalo.
[01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:31.560]   So you'd have to know what each is.
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:33.600]   It's a buffalo from Buffalo.
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:34.600]   Buffalo buffalo.
[01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:35.600]   Buffalo buffalo.
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:36.600]   Can you shuffle off to buffalo?
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:41.600]   That was just saying the word too much.
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:42.600]   Who thought this up?
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:44.320]   Like, you sat down and was like, "I know, I got it, guys."
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:47.200]   We're going to use buffalo in a sentence with it.
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:50.560]   Because they must have had a lot of time on their hands to think this up.
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:52.480]   Like, who wrote this article?
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:55.720]   The Wikipedia page is longer than the Bible.
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:58.320]   Okay, I'm sorry.
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:17:59.320]   I'm getting distracted.
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:03.480]   Who should have something that's going on?
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.160]   This week in grammar.
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.680]   Yeah.
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:08.680]   It's all about the punctuation.
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:11.080]   Or the curve.
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.080]   All right.
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:17.160]   What happens to say beetle juice three times?
[01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:19.160]   I don't know.
[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:22.360]   Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo.
[01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:24.480]   Or Bloody Mary.
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:26.600]   What happens then?
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:30.280]   If you say Bloody Mary in the dark, she appears.
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:31.920]   She just say it once?
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:34.760]   No, you have to say it in the mirror three times.
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:35.760]   I think I don't know.
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:36.760]   You guys know the urban legend.
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:37.760]   No, you know.
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:38.760]   No, no, no.
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:39.760]   This is the revelation.
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:40.760]   Okay, turn the lights down.
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:43.000]   Natalie Morris is going to tell us some ghost stories, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.080]   It's quite a flashlight.
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:46.680]   The highlight of the show.
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:47.680]   Go ahead, Natalie.
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:48.680]   Heck no.
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:49.680]   That was your moment.
[01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:50.680]   I think she's thinking.
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:51.680]   I hope you're alone in my editing.
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:52.680]   Oh, my God.
[01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:53.680]   It's in the house.
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:54.680]   It's coming from inside the house.
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:55.680]   So me, I'm sorry.
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:57.680]   We should have said that.
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:58.680]   The children are inside the house.
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:15.680]   Somebody in the chair says, if you say Donald Trump three times, he gets elected president.
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:17.680]   Oh gosh, no one said.
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:20.680]   Don't you want to know it's going to happen?
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:21.680]   Don't you?
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:26.480]   No, no, I'm just zoomed in behind me like some of us here.
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:27.480]   We're creepy.
[01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:28.840]   We're creepy that way.
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:32.880]   My sister has never forgiven me for locking her in the bathroom and saying Bloody Mary,
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:34.480]   she swears she saw something.
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:39.520]   Oh, it's a real thing.
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:40.520]   I wonder.
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:41.680]   I'm not even going to Google it.
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:44.520]   Actually, she's scared.
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:46.520]   Is it Clayton like really into ghosts?
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.520]   Or is it you two?
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:52.520]   No, it's really into the.
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:55.640]   Yeah, we're both in, you know, very into like.
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:57.520]   Does he believe, do you believe in ghosts?
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:58.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:02.720]   So you think that actually Bloody Mary could show up?
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:05.320]   I don't really believe in nefarious ghosts anymore.
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:08.200]   Oh, so only the task for the friendly ghost?
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:12.200]   No, I believe in the afterlife and sort of like.
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.200]   Well, that's not.
[01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:14.200]   Right.
[01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:18.520]   And I believe that, and I believe certain spirits sort of get stuck in certain places.
[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:21.120]   But Clayton like goes ghost hunting stuff, right?
[01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:25.520]   He's actually going for some reason, Siri just turned on.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.520]   I didn't.
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:27.520]   Bloody Mary!
[01:20:27.520 --> 01:20:29.520]   Do you have an answer?
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:32.800]   Yes, I'm here.
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:35.000]   He's going ghost hunting with the ghost hunters.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   Somewhere.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000]   Stay Eastern stuff.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.440]   Will it be on TV or is he just going like going with him?
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:44.760]   I know it will be on TV and it'll be on Fox and Friends.
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:45.760]   Oh my God.
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:46.760]   Bloody Mary is hovering over you.
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:48.560]   Don't look now over your right shoulder.
[01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:49.560]   It's Bloody Mary.
[01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:50.560]   No, wait a minute.
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:52.560]   That's the good kind with celery.
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:57.880]   I actually, these things like they really do sort of creep under my skin.
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:20:58.880]   Okay.
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:20:59.880]   Okay.
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:00.880]   We'll move on.
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:03.920]   In fact, you know the best way to get the scary flavor out of your head is to have a
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:07.320]   nice fresh taste in your mouth.
[01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:08.800]   Something like fresh books maybe.
[01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:12.360]   You know, there's nothing like having build your clients in an easy and simple manner
[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:14.560]   that just cleanses the palate.
[01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:17.440]   That was the worst segue I've ever heard on track.
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.160]   That was literally all the way around longer.
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:20.160]   We can do worse.
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:21.680]   I thought it was the best.
[01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:24.760]   Fresh books is a great, simple cloud accounting solution.
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:25.760]   It is.
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:29.600]   If you're a freelancer as many of us have been, yes, and I have been.
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:34.160]   In fact, I discovered fresh books when I was going to Canada every month, billing Rogers
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:35.880]   and Canadian dollars.
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:40.120]   I was doing it in Microsoft Word and then I had to send them expenses.
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:41.200]   It was so painful.
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:42.680]   I went six months.
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:45.720]   This is not, I'm not making this up without billing them.
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:47.440]   I bet their accounting department loved you.
[01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:51.440]   Then I sent them one bill for all six months and they were furious.
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:53.440]   They said, you know, we don't even have to pay this.
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:57.800]   No, but they were not happy.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:02.040]   The point is you don't get paid until you bill and it's in your interest to send out
[01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:03.720]   a bill, but nobody likes to do that.
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:06.320]   That's why fresh books is the best thing ever.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:07.320]   I love fresh books.
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:09.200]   I pay for it full freight out of pocket.
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.400]   It has changed my life as a freelancer.
[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:12.400]   Yeah.
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:13.400]   No, it's not nice.
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:14.400]   It's awesome.
[01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:15.400]   No, salary is nice.
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:16.680]   Fresh books is awesome.
[01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:19.880]   Never had that problem again because I started using, actually, as Jambore McCarthy told me
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:22.480]   about it, they're from Toronto and I started using it.
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:23.480]   It's so easy.
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:26.560]   You create a good looking professional invoice.
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:27.560]   You'll email it.
[01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:30.880]   They do have the ability to mail them a US mail to or stamp it and all that stuff, but
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:31.880]   I was just email it.
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:35.480]   The nice thing about the email invoice is there's a pay me button on it.
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:37.160]   It makes it very easy for your clients to pay.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:42.080]   Turns out, who knew clients don't look forward to paying bills anymore than you look forward
[01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:43.080]   to sending bills.
[01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:44.400]   It's a pain for everybody.
[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:47.560]   So making it easy means you're going to get paid faster.
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:53.080]   In fact, on average, fresh books customers get paid five days faster.
[01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:56.040]   You'll also be much easier for keeping track of your expenses.
[01:22:56.040 --> 01:22:57.560]   You can actually use their app on the phone.
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:01.480]   Take pictures of expenses, get them right into the invoice.
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:03.200]   Time and hours, do you bill for hours?
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:05.640]   They do that too, right in the app.
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:11.200]   If you need to track it easy to invoice it, once you do this, you will say, why didn't
[01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:13.160]   I listen to Liam Patrick before this?
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.880]   Because we've been talking about this a long time.
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:16.600]   Five million people are using fresh books.
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:17.720]   You should be one of them.
[01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:19.880]   Go to freshbooks.com/twit.
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:25.720]   Leo's invoicing stories make him seem responsible compared to my last go around as a freelancer.
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:26.720]   I can really know what you mean.
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:30.480]   It's like, but you don't get paid so it's so self-destructive, not the invoice.
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:31.680]   But it's so horrible.
[01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:32.880]   You don't want to do it.
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:35.160]   I don't do my expenses until I turn off my corporate credit card.
[01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:38.120]   And then I wait another month and then I finally do them all in one big shot and everyone gets
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:39.120]   so mad about it.
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:41.680]   All right, Alex, we're getting you on freshbooks.
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:42.680]   Freshbooks.com/twit.
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:44.040]   30 days free.
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:46.720]   Do mention this week in tech when they ask you, how did you hear?
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:49.160]   You know that still dings your credit.
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:50.160]   What?
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:52.400]   Using your corporate card is still like--
[01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:55.400]   What accounts accruse to your credit?
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:56.880]   If you have your name on it.
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:58.120]   What you do, of course.
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:23:59.120]   Yeah.
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:01.000]   I don't even think of that.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000]   You should not do that.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.160]   I better start paying my bills.
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:05.160]   Wow.
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:11.440]   You know, Natalie and Clayton have late been doing some financial advising things like
[01:24:11.440 --> 01:24:13.040]   videos and stuff.
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:15.240]   Is that a new business or what are you doing?
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:21.180]   Yeah, so I started just on my own personal site, NatalieMoris.com, a project that I'm
[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:23.360]   calling Chief Home Officer.
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:29.320]   Because after I left CNET and went freelance, I sort of became obsessed with investing and
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:32.200]   running our home kind of like a business.
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:37.400]   I figured if I don't have a regular paycheck, I'm just going to run my house and do the
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:39.440]   best I can with the investments I have now.
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:40.680]   And I really love it, actually.
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:44.720]   I just have studied personal finance for the last couple of years.
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:49.600]   And noticed that there's a need for other people to really learn how to understand what's
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:50.960]   going on with their finances.
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:54.800]   So many of us just sort of have the passwords and pay the bills and don't understand what's
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:57.480]   going on in our investments.
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:01.480]   So I want to help empower other people to have at least one person in their household
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:07.480]   who's the Chief Home Officer who's not afraid of this or really wants to learn and just
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:11.960]   has a good open attitude about finances because when you understand it, you're in control.
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:12.960]   This is actually great.
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:16.960]   If you go to NatalieMoris.com and click the blog link, you've got to make it easier to
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:19.840]   find Natalie because there's really good stuff in here.
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:24.040]   I have a contest up on 99 Designs right now for a better designer.
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:25.040]   Another sponsor.
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:26.040]   Oh, are they really?
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.040]   Yeah, of course.
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:28.600]   I didn't know that.
[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:34.320]   And I'm not happy with, you know, I like the homepage, but the other templates.
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:37.640]   And I don't have a very hard to see eye for this kind of thing.
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:41.920]   But yeah, so I'd like to sort of brand it a little bit more.
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:44.360]   And I really love writing.
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:46.840]   So I'm enjoying it a lot.
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:50.720]   And I just would really like to make this something that people, because Chief Home Officer
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:55.600]   is a marketing term that marketers use to target the person in the household who makes
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:56.600]   financial decisions.
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:58.480]   Maybe at the house at home.
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:25:59.480]   Right.
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:03.960]   So I figured, you know, it doesn't have to be a woman, but it has to be someone who makes
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:04.960]   the decisions.
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:08.360]   So I just sort of started with like finance 101.
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:10.440]   And you know, my dad is a small business owner.
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:13.800]   So I've always been forced to study finance.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:15.040]   And I like it.
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:18.840]   I'm really sort of comfortable with it.
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:21.600]   And so I thought I would just share what I know with other.
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:24.080]   I am so terrible with money.
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:29.960]   So my advice is to marry somebody that's good with money, which I did.
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:31.480]   But you can't always do that.
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:33.240]   So you might have to learn how to be good with money.
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:37.320]   This is, this is, this is how much should you compensate a stay at home parent?
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.400]   Why women make better investors?
[01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:41.580]   I apologize because I already broke one of the rules.
[01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:45.880]   One thing you should never say about money, they can afford it.
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:46.960]   And you already did that.
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:48.800]   I think to you, they can afford it.
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.880]   I don't know if you said it said it didn't.
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:51.880]   So many words.
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:54.480]   A whole lot of question marks into that sentence.
[01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:55.480]   What that is.
[01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:58.680]   It is Natalie says, how the hell do you know what someone else can afford?
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:26:59.680]   You're right.
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:00.720]   You know what I say all the time?
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:03.800]   Never judge anybody else's marriage because you can't look inside there.
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.640]   You're not, you don't go home with them at night.
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:06.840]   You cannot judge anybody else.
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:08.960]   And it's the same thing.
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:14.320]   People have lives that you don't know anything about no matter how well you know them.
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:15.320]   Right.
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:17.560]   You know, keep your eyes on your own paper or spreadsheet.
[01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:19.120]   I like it.
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:21.160]   I like it.
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:23.680]   It's really an ATALI Morris MORR.
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:24.680]   I ask.
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:25.680]   Thank you.
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:26.680]   I've just started it.
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:28.120]   I don't have any sponsors or anything.
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:31.200]   I'm just, you know, it's a passion project of mine.
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:36.240]   And it's really hard for me because I've, you know, I've worked for the networks for
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:40.440]   so long that I've allowed the networks to be the person who promotes a new brand or,
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:42.160]   you know, I start a project for someone else.
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:45.960]   This is the first time I'm actually doing something just for myself because I want to.
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:46.960]   Good.
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:52.760]   So I'm really learning how to market myself and be the brand myself and it's kind of
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:57.200]   terrifying but also kind of exciting to make this something that I love so much.
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:58.200]   I love it.
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:27:59.200]   So thanks for asking me about it.
[01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:00.200]   Yeah.
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:01.200]   And congratulations.
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:02.920]   And you know, this is how stuff begins.
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.600]   You do something because you care about it.
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:08.000]   It's so much of a better way to do something than because you want to make a living.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.280]   I want to make money at it.
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:11.040]   Do something that you, because I really care.
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:13.240]   I want to do something about this because I love it.
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:14.880]   That's the best way to do it.
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:15.880]   Yeah.
[01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:18.680]   So if you're good with website design.
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:19.680]   99 designs.
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:20.680]   Go there.
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:21.680]   Let me.
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:22.680]   Yeah.
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:23.680]   That's read quick doing.
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:24.680]   Read kids doing great.
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:26.240]   It's a new iOS new update.
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:27.680]   I saw you did an iOS 9 version.
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:28.680]   Yeah.
[01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:29.680]   For iOS 9.
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:30.680]   Yeah.
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:31.680]   It just came out and yeah.
[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:32.680]   Doing really well.
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:35.320]   In fact, I used it to prepare for the show today.
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:36.320]   Cool.
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:42.360]   I'll show you one other thing on iOS 9 and the new iPhone that I think is the other
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:45.280]   reason I'm moving at least for now.
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:46.280]   I don't know if you can see this.
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:47.280]   So bright.
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:48.280]   Let me turn down the screen a little bit here.
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:49.280]   Oops.
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:51.160]   I've just paid the page of gibberish.
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:52.160]   I did.
[01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:54.280]   And there's a reason why.
[01:28:54.280 --> 01:29:00.840]   Because if you force touch the keyboard, you now have a cursor.
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:02.960]   And oh, I really want that.
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:08.720]   You know, for so long we had to use this silly magnifying glass and it never worked and
[01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:10.400]   then like this.
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:12.320]   And now all you do is you have to use.
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:15.320]   I've got to use the little screen on the iPad, the new iPad.
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:16.320]   Yeah.
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:18.400]   I mean, by itself, that's a reasonable event, right?
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:19.400]   I have to be a.
[01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:21.400]   Now look, and I see Natalie's doing it.
[01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:22.400]   Touch the keyboard.
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:23.400]   So you got to take some.
[01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:24.400]   Yeah, you got to take some text.
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:26.080]   I'm doing this in the notes app.
[01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:27.080]   That's really cool.
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:28.680]   Like legitimately, we use that eight times a day.
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:31.920]   On the iPad, it's a two finger touch because they don't have a worse touch.
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:32.920]   But I know.
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:33.920]   Yeah.
[01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:34.920]   Yeah.
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:37.760]   Yeah, Jason Snell taught me that yesterday I went what?
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:41.040]   TLDR, we like iOS 9.
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:43.080]   So I'm going to hold out in the microphone and drop it.
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:44.080]   No, what?
[01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:45.600]   I'm going to drop my iPhone.
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:48.920]   If you tried out the whole waterproof iPhone success thing.
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:50.720]   No, I'm not going to do that.
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:53.440]   Somebody said somebody decided it must be waterproof.
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:54.440]   That's so dumb.
[01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:59.840]   Boy, genius report decided to put it in water for like 50 minutes.
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:03.440]   I think they normally do this where they put it in water for like 30 minutes and they're
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:04.760]   like, holy crap, it's still working.
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:06.320]   So they put it in for 15 minutes longer.
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:07.640]   And then we're like, holy crap, it's still working.
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:08.640]   They're surprised.
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:09.640]   Actually, it's Z dude.
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:11.240]   I apologize Z dude.
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:12.240]   Who is Z dude?
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:14.040]   Z dude is on Z dude.
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:15.040]   I am Z dude.
[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:16.040]   Okay.
[01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:18.840]   So I remember liquid pill.
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:19.840]   Remember that company?
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:20.840]   Yeah.
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:25.080]   I liquid pill the iPhone put it in a glass of water fried immediately.
[01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:28.920]   I brought it to the guy in Emeryville who does the screen repair.
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:30.320]   There it is.
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:33.200]   And he said, I've never seen such a fried iPhone in my life.
[01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:35.520]   He said, even your SIM card is scorched.
[01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:37.960]   You dropped a glass of water.
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:41.280]   Yeah, that's the earlier part where I've stupidly dropped the glass of water down.
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:46.240]   We have portals on the ground where all the electronics go right into the portal.
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:47.240]   John didn't fire me.
[01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:48.960]   Yes, you didn't electrocute yourself.
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:52.920]   It would have been the greatest segment ever, but it would have been my last.
[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:56.440]   Anyway, why would you do this to an iPhone?
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:31:01.840]   Apparently the Z dude has decided that the iPhone is secretly, yeah, don't look, that
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:04.760]   the Z dude has decided it's secretly waterproof that Apple.
[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:06.160]   I think it's just a sealed case.
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:11.000]   Because if you look at the I fix it tear down, it looks like a slightly tighter match between
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000]   this.
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:15.840]   Well, it can be effectively waterproof if the design is sealed well enough.
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:21.400]   But what happens though is there's basically a giant joint where the case and the screen
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:22.760]   meet all the way around it.
[01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:28.600]   And if you flex your phone over time, which is a problem with the iPhone 6, it'll leak
[01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:30.600]   at the screen joint, which is what happened to mine.
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:32.640]   Eventually, this is going to leak.
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:34.960]   This is a zero sum game.
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:36.560]   There's no way you should be playing this game.
[01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:37.560]   How long do you want to do that?
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:41.840]   The environmentalist in me is, I mean, come on, these are natural resources.
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:42.840]   We're just going to.
[01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:43.840]   I agree with you.
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:44.840]   I when they do will it blend?
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:45.840]   Oh, it's a painful.
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:46.840]   It hurts me.
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:48.400]   It's like don't waste a phone.
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:49.600]   You're right.
[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:52.360]   Some child in China made that.
[01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:55.400]   Oh, man, don't destroy it.
[01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:57.640]   Did you see that?
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:59.240]   You see what Erin's talking says.
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:01.600]   These materials are pulled out of our planet.
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:02.600]   I agree.
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.040]   And they're not to be glass of water.
[01:32:04.040 --> 01:32:05.680]   They're not going to be replaced exactly.
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:09.560]   Do you see what Erin Sorkin said about Tim Cook on?
[01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:10.560]   Was it the night show?
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:11.560]   I think it was.
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:12.560]   Let me see.
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:13.560]   I'll find it for you.
[01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:20.200]   Erin Sorkin, of course, the author of the social network, the Zuckerberg movie, and
[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:25.200]   he's just finished a movie which is coming out soon called Jobs.
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:32.920]   Yeah, you remember that Tim Cook said a while ago, he thought that all of these movies about
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:34.640]   jobs were opportunistic.
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:35.680]   He said I hate seeing that.
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:39.560]   He hadn't seen the movie yet.
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:47.080]   So Erin Sorkin is actually during a press junket said, hey, if you've got a factory
[01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:50.680]   full of children in China assembling phones for 17 cents an hour, you've got a lot of
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:52.880]   nerve calling me opportunistic.
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:58.360]   Oh, that's a pretty big burn burn.
[01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:01.160]   He says nobody did this movie to get rich.
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:02.160]   Really?
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.080]   People don't do stuff for free.
[01:33:04.080 --> 01:33:06.480]   Can I apologize again for my jobs comment earlier?
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.480]   I came out really wrong.
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:08.480]   No, no, no, it was funny.
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:09.480]   We were just teething.
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:10.480]   We all love Steve.
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:11.480]   Okay, good.
[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:13.480]   That's what I was going for.
[01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:15.040]   So it's good publicity.
[01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:16.840]   No, there's no such thing as bad publicity.
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:22.120]   Sorkin, apparently, it feels bad and is apologized for being a little harsh.
[01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:28.400]   And in fact, I don't think that they are paying children to make iPhones.
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:30.840]   I think that that's not true.
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:34.360]   So data but nets outside the Foxconn facilities to catch people that were feeling so loud.
[01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:35.640]   People get depressed when they work hard.
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:36.640]   It's natural.
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:41.480]   People get depressed when they do the same thing over and over for 12 to 18 hour shifts
[01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:43.400]   and get escorted to a dorm and send all their money.
[01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:48.480]   I think Apple has done everything they can to make manufacturers humane as it can be.
[01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:49.960]   People still flock to those jobs.
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:54.720]   I think the real problem is goes deeper and farther than that with suppliers who may,
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:59.120]   in fact, be using children to make things like the little vibrator in the Haptic Engine.
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:03.680]   But everybody, by the way, everybody is buying from the same suppliers.
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:05.760]   We're all complicit because we buy these things.
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:09.640]   So don't put them in a blender because that's just cruel to the phone.
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:11.440]   Think of the children.
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:12.440]   I don't know.
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:16.920]   I mean, I finished that book, Conscious Capitalism by the founder of Whole Foods.
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:20.560]   And you, as a business owner, can make decisions.
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:21.560]   I agree.
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:26.160]   Like just because everyone else is doing it doesn't mean that, you know, I don't know
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:28.480]   if we can make the argument they've done everything they can.
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:30.880]   I think they try really hard.
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:34.120]   And I think they probably could do more.
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:38.880]   I think they probably will as manufacturing goes.
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:40.440]   Like I think it's getting better.
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:43.680]   I think we can agree on that.
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:47.720]   But I don't know when you can actually say they've done everything, you know.
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:51.360]   There's always another layer to be in a conscious capitalist.
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:54.000]   I never hear someone talking about Samsung doing this only Apple.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.240]   I'm always kind of curious why when we talk about smartphone manufacturing and the ethical
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:00.280]   problems that it has, we only talk about how.
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:06.480]   Everything on this table was made by the same, basically the same factories in China, including
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:07.480]   the Derm.
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:12.440]   I mean, that's just, and really it's, you know, not that Coca-Cola.
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:15.840]   That was made by children in Mexico.
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:21.520]   But the, it's really important because we talk about technology a lot.
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:26.020]   It probably looks like, in fact, it may even be the case that we're kind of encouraging
[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:28.300]   people to over-consume this stuff.
[01:35:28.300 --> 01:35:29.300]   So I think you're right, Natalie.
[01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:31.540]   I think it's something we should be very aware of.
[01:35:31.540 --> 01:35:35.980]   And we have a responsibility to remind people, you know, if you don't need a new phone, Patrick,
[01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:37.700]   it's okay not to buy a new one.
[01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:38.700]   Yeah.
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:42.980]   I don't particularly need to be encouraged on that because I cheap.
[01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:43.980]   Cheaping is helpful.
[01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:46.780]   Well, it's also, I mean, you know, there's people who upgrade their computers every
[01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:51.020]   year because, you know, upgrading their computer allows to complete their job faster, which
[01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:54.300]   allows them to earn more money, which allows them to, you know, potentially retire and
[01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:57.140]   or pay for any of a large number of things.
[01:35:57.140 --> 01:35:59.660]   And then there's people who upgrade their computers every six months because a new widget
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:00.660]   came out.
[01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:02.220]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:36:02.220 --> 01:36:05.020]   It's a big, messy, complicated subject, as Natalie was saying.
[01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:09.060]   And it doesn't get any simpler when you basically realize almost every public company has a
[01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:13.300]   gun in its held to its head by Wall Street to make as much money as possible every quarter.
[01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:14.300]   Right.
[01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:15.300]   Which is-
[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:16.300]   We're pigs.
[01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:17.300]   We're Americans.
[01:36:17.300 --> 01:36:18.300]   We're pigs about every come on.
[01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:20.300]   So it gave us that right.
[01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:25.900]   Yes. And maybe at this stage, if we're talking about our own personal consumption, at the
[01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:30.700]   very least, we can be conscious about what we do as we hand it down.
[01:36:30.700 --> 01:36:33.900]   You know, that's a small place to start.
[01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:35.540]   I don't throw these phones out.
[01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:38.300]   I give them to people.
[01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:39.540]   Have I ever given you a phone?
[01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:40.540]   No.
[01:36:40.540 --> 01:36:41.540]   No one's-
[01:36:41.540 --> 01:36:44.540]   You're about to go answer me.
[01:36:44.540 --> 01:36:46.580]   Here, have a phone.
[01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:48.380]   You've got dozens.
[01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:57.060]   Google, actually YouTube sent out new terms of services to YouTube publishers saying,
[01:36:57.060 --> 01:36:58.740]   "You better sign this.
[01:36:58.740 --> 01:37:03.140]   If you don't agree to the new terms, this email went out to all YouTube content owners."
[01:37:03.140 --> 01:37:08.180]   By October 22nd, quote, "Your videos will no longer be available for public display
[01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:10.180]   or monetization in the United States."
[01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:12.420]   That's a bit of a strong arm.
[01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:13.420]   What?
[01:37:13.420 --> 01:37:14.420]   Yeah.
[01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:15.620]   Did you get that, Natalie?
[01:37:15.620 --> 01:37:16.620]   Did you get that email?
[01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:17.620]   I know.
[01:37:17.620 --> 01:37:19.060]   I don't really have a chance.
[01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:20.060]   You don't do it.
[01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:21.060]   Probably.
[01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:24.700]   I would guess it's people who have monetization turned on, right?
[01:37:24.700 --> 01:37:26.900]   It wouldn't be just very, just puts up a groin shot.
[01:37:26.900 --> 01:37:27.900]   Give me a minute.
[01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:29.660]   See, if you've got the email.
[01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:31.700]   Well, I do too.
[01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:33.260]   But I don't get the emails.
[01:37:33.260 --> 01:37:34.260]   I think Glenn does.
[01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:37.020]   Glenn, have we gotten emails like that?
[01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:38.380]   Have you gotten emails like that?
[01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:44.620]   So the reason, according to Recode is a new subscription service is on the way.
[01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:46.620]   They were aiming for a midsummer launch.
[01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:48.540]   We missed that date.
[01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:54.340]   But YouTube intends to bundle two different services into one offering, according to Recode.
[01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:57.220]   They're going to update the music service, YouTube Music Key.
[01:37:57.220 --> 01:38:01.340]   That's where you pay a fee and they can watch commercial-free music, which is actually
[01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:03.460]   a great idea because that's how my kids watch music.
[01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:07.580]   It's for, I think, the 12 to 18 set by the biggest music platform in the world.
[01:38:07.580 --> 01:38:08.780]   But they don't pay for anything.
[01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:09.780]   So I think they're probably just going.
[01:38:09.780 --> 01:38:10.780]   Well, they're 12.
[01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:11.780]   They're having money.
[01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:12.780]   Right.
[01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:15.060]   That's actually not true.
[01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:18.620]   Actually, a lot of the-- there have been teenagers actually spent a spectacular amount
[01:38:18.620 --> 01:38:19.620]   of money.
[01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:21.100]   The discretionary-- they don't have mortgages to pay.
[01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:24.740]   In many cases, they don't have car bills to pay, car insurance, health insurance.
[01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:30.620]   So the discretionary income tends to be vastly out of pace with what you would-- their annual
[01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:31.620]   earnings.
[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:32.620]   They just have a lot of money to spend.
[01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:33.620]   Which is the most low of the sense?
[01:38:33.620 --> 01:38:34.620]   It's almost like you have kids.
[01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:35.620]   Young getting rates, but saving up.
[01:38:35.620 --> 01:38:36.620]   Well, it was one of the--
[01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:37.620]   One of the--
[01:38:37.620 --> 01:38:41.780]   I saw a panel several years ago, and this venture capital has basically had a bunch
[01:38:41.780 --> 01:38:45.020]   of teenagers he brought on to explain what they do with their phones and where they spend
[01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:46.020]   their money.
[01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:47.020]   Yeah.
[01:38:47.020 --> 01:38:50.020]   And it was also one of those-- it was about 30 minutes after somebody just said, like,
[01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:53.100]   you know, a lot of you are in there realizing that your ex's strategy is to be bought by
[01:38:53.100 --> 01:38:54.620]   Google or another large company.
[01:38:54.620 --> 01:38:59.100]   And all these, like, literally, if you counted, like, you know, duck, duck goose, every goose
[01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:00.460]   sank down into their seats.
[01:39:00.460 --> 01:39:04.580]   Because, like, oh my God, they know what my business plan is for my obscure startup
[01:39:04.580 --> 01:39:07.380]   that has a subset of a product feature.
[01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:10.620]   And then it was amazing to watch the greed on a lot of the other faces when they realized
[01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:14.740]   like, we really should be going for 14-year-olds because 14-year-olds piss away money a lot
[01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:16.700]   better than 40-year-olds do.
[01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:17.900]   I really got this all wrong.
[01:39:17.900 --> 01:39:19.940]   I had it completely inverted in my head.
[01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:24.940]   Well, it's not that simple, but in terms of certain areas, they spend a lot of money.
[01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:31.500]   So would you pay-- here's the question-- $10 a month to get YouTube music without ads and
[01:39:31.500 --> 01:39:33.540]   all YouTube videos without ads.
[01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:34.860]   Just turn off the ads on YouTube.
[01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:37.340]   I already did that with an ad blocker.
[01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:38.340]   For free!
[01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:39.340]   For free!
[01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:40.340]   Also, I'm a paid Spotify.
[01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:43.740]   You know, I'm a Spotify fan and advocate, and I don't think I'm going to change just
[01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:44.740]   to go use more YouTube.
[01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:48.380]   Honestly, I don't see a real compelling reason to jump ship somewhere.
[01:39:48.380 --> 01:39:53.940]   You know, I do an ad blocker, too, and that's why I started using Google Contributor, which
[01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:55.820]   is a very interesting idea.
[01:39:55.820 --> 01:39:59.020]   Google, who, of course, puts most of the ads on websites--
[01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:01.420]   On the internet.
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:08.020]   They-- yeah, with their Google Ad Sense platform, they offer a thing where you can pay up to
[01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:11.380]   $10 a month, which I pay.
[01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:14.100]   Not to see Google Ads.
[01:40:14.100 --> 01:40:17.620]   They replace the ads when you go to the site with just an empty block or you can have different
[01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:18.620]   color.
[01:40:18.620 --> 01:40:22.740]   And then they take the money and they give it to-- in proportion to the sites that people
[01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:23.740]   visit.
[01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:25.940]   I built a company called Contenture way back.
[01:40:25.940 --> 01:40:26.940]   To do this?
[01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:27.940]   Yeah, and we totally failed.
[01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:28.940]   Wow.
[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:29.940]   Well, you weren't Google.
[01:40:29.940 --> 01:40:30.940]   No, no, no, no.
[01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:31.940]   They have a little more money in.
[01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:32.940]   It also, because they run the biggest ad network.
[01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:33.940]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:34.940]   No, no, this is killer.
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:37.440]   And I think they're responding to this whole ad blocker thing and saying, "If you want to be
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:40.180]   an ethical ad blocker, why not kick in $10?"
[01:40:40.180 --> 01:40:41.180]   Well, not for guilty.
[01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:43.020]   Well, you can do two bucks.
[01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:44.980]   There we go.
[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:47.980]   I feel guilty because I use an ad blocker all the time.
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:49.500]   And I am an ad supported free media.
[01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:53.300]   Yeah, I own block tech runs, actually, because I felt bad at stealing my own ads on my site.
[01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:54.300]   Right.
[01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:55.300]   Yeah, I don't use ad blockers.
[01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:58.060]   I mean, I blocked Flash because Flash started having so many problems.
[01:40:58.060 --> 01:41:01.340]   But I leave ad going because I believe in supporting ad supported media.
[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:02.340]   Yeah.
[01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:04.700]   Well, that's the-- I completely understand why people block.
[01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:05.700]   The sites are giant.
[01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:06.700]   They don't work.
[01:41:06.700 --> 01:41:07.700]   There's bugs.
[01:41:07.700 --> 01:41:08.700]   There's malware.
[01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:11.620]   I understand why as a consumer you go, "I'm not going to put up with that and I don't
[01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:12.620]   have to."
[01:41:12.620 --> 01:41:13.620]   Yeah, it's so easy.
[01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:14.620]   I had an idea.
[01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:15.620]   Sorry, I interrupted you.
[01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:16.620]   No, you didn't.
[01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:17.620]   All I said was, "Yeah, me too."
[01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:18.620]   Yeah.
[01:41:18.620 --> 01:41:20.020]   That's all I got.
[01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:21.100]   Yeah.
[01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:27.820]   There is a tech war, though, going between advertisers and these ad blockers.
[01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:31.340]   I think that they've started to figure out how to put pre-roll ads on video.
[01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:33.460]   So I don't think it's going to work against YouTube for very much longer.
[01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:34.460]   It's going to be the same battle we've had forever.
[01:41:34.460 --> 01:41:36.260]   They're going to do something that we're going to block it.
[01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:37.260]   Yes, it's going up and up.
[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:41.100]   I mean, there was a big controversy in tech this last week about an app called Peace.
[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:47.420]   That was one of the first iOS 9 tools to remove ads from your mobile device.
[01:41:47.420 --> 01:41:50.940]   The guy shot to top the App Store, made a lot of money, and then he actually took it
[01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:51.940]   off the App Store.
[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:56.300]   I believe Apple's actually refunding all the money because he didn't feel, again, at
[01:41:56.300 --> 01:41:58.340]   your point, ethically okay with that.
[01:41:58.340 --> 01:42:02.980]   It was an interesting moment of what's fair and how can you disassemble someone else's
[01:42:02.980 --> 01:42:06.020]   work and still be inside the realm of good taste.
[01:42:06.020 --> 01:42:11.780]   You're talking about, of course, Marco Armit, who was one of the guys, the first programmer,
[01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:15.300]   Tumbler, he wrote InstaPaper, which a lot of you have used, sold that.
[01:42:15.300 --> 01:42:18.980]   He's written Overcast, which is an excellent podcast app.
[01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:20.380]   He didn't make peace.
[01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:22.260]   It was number one.
[01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:24.700]   He could have made a lot of money.
[01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:27.780]   Apple does not have a history of refunding people's money, but apparently they thought
[01:42:27.780 --> 01:42:30.940]   this was a big enough deal that they did.
[01:42:30.940 --> 01:42:35.700]   That's what began this whole ad block lips conversation was Apple announcing that iOS
[01:42:35.700 --> 01:42:37.780]   9 was going to allow ad blockers.
[01:42:37.780 --> 01:42:39.420]   You still have to download it.
[01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:41.220]   They were going to allow ad blockers.
[01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:45.340]   But what maybe is more important to point out is they only block ads in Safari, mobile
[01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:46.340]   Safari.
[01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:50.300]   There's plenty of ads in every app, including Apple's own iAds.
[01:42:50.300 --> 01:42:52.300]   It's not like you don't have ads.
[01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:53.460]   You just have Apple's ads.
[01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:57.500]   What I've noticed is that mobile ads are consistently worse than desktop ads because
[01:42:57.500 --> 01:43:01.100]   they're more invasive and intrusive and just make the experience of using your phone pretty
[01:43:01.100 --> 01:43:02.100]   bad.
[01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:03.100]   Apple Play thought from a you-
[01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:04.100]   Of course, they're representing users.
[01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:10.140]   I think it's probably Renee Richie who told me that you've got to understand that Safari
[01:43:10.140 --> 01:43:11.620]   team is the Safari team.
[01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:14.300]   They want to give people the best Safari experience possible.
[01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:18.340]   There are other people at Apple and other companies that sell ads.
[01:43:18.340 --> 01:43:21.100]   It's not like it's a monolith.
[01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:24.340]   I think it's reasonable to say, "Hey, we want to give people the best possible experience
[01:43:24.340 --> 01:43:26.180]   on Safari."
[01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:31.060]   I think that's what Apple did, but I don't think the fat lady has sucked.
[01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:34.500]   Can you imagine the Apple cafeteria with the iAd guys, Renee's the Safari team and they're
[01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:35.740]   kind of just glaring each other down?
[01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:36.900]   They throw food at each other.
[01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:38.540]   Yeah, no, I would say that.
[01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:39.540]   Sure.
[01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:40.540]   That's what YouTube's considering.
[01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:46.220]   $10 a month, no ads in your videos.
[01:43:46.220 --> 01:43:49.460]   This is the text that according to Recode, now some people in chat are saying, "I think
[01:43:49.460 --> 01:43:50.540]   at that."
[01:43:50.540 --> 01:43:53.980]   For years, YouTube fans have been telling us this is what the email they sent out.
[01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:56.820]   They want more and more choice when watching their favorite content, more ways to support
[01:43:56.820 --> 01:44:03.420]   their favorite creators and above all, the option to watch their favorite videos uninterrupted.
[01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:06.780]   To give fans more choice, we're going to be launching a new ads-free version of YouTube.
[01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:09.820]   This is a big shift for YouTube.
[01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:11.780]   Available to fans for a monthly fee.
[01:44:11.780 --> 01:44:15.140]   This service will create a new source of revenue over time that supplements your advertising
[01:44:15.140 --> 01:44:16.140]   revenue.
[01:44:16.140 --> 01:44:18.980]   Frankly, if everybody did this, you would be making a lot more money, I think.
[01:44:18.980 --> 01:44:22.100]   I don't think most people get much money from YouTube at all.
[01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:23.740]   Most people get almost no money from YouTube.
[01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:29.620]   You have to have a staggering amount of volume to make a lot of money.
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:35.780]   We had Natalie Don and Jack Conte from Pomplamoose perform on the new screensavers yesterday.
[01:44:35.780 --> 01:44:37.100]   Jack, of course, started Patreon.
[01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:39.260]   I asked him, "Why'd you start Patreon?"
[01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:44.380]   He said, "Because we had 15 million views on YouTube and made a few bucks."
[01:44:44.380 --> 01:44:46.900]   You made 300 bucks for that.
[01:44:46.900 --> 01:44:51.500]   He spent like six or seven thousand dollars building a spaceship in a barn for a video
[01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:52.500]   shoot.
[01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:54.260]   The millions of views got a check for $300.
[01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:57.580]   He realized he was $6,700 in the whole.
[01:44:57.580 --> 01:45:00.540]   Asked his audience who thought it was amazing.
[01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:04.340]   He basically said, "I want to keep doing videos, but I don't have this money."
[01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:10.100]   They helped pay off the money he had spent creating it.
[01:45:10.100 --> 01:45:14.540]   That is the origin story of Patreon, which obviously I'm a huge fan of Patreon because
[01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:17.020]   they're the primary way we support tech thing.
[01:45:17.020 --> 01:45:19.540]   Our audience supports tech thing.
[01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:22.460]   It's fascinating because Jack scratched an itch.
[01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:24.260]   Pomplamoose is one of the best bands ever.
[01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:26.020]   They deserve to make lots of money.
[01:45:26.020 --> 01:45:27.020]   They weren't.
[01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:28.780]   He's doing great with Patreon.
[01:45:28.780 --> 01:45:32.580]   He's done a great thing for the internet community and for creators like you.
[01:45:32.580 --> 01:45:34.460]   Tech thing is on Patreon.
[01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:35.460]   Yes.
[01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:36.460]   Go support them.
[01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:37.460]   Thank you.
[01:45:37.460 --> 01:45:40.500]   I think we may be moving, at least with this YouTube thing, into the world where people
[01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:47.420]   kind of accept the idea or contributor that we want content, we don't want these ads,
[01:45:47.420 --> 01:45:49.980]   we might have to give fork over money.
[01:45:49.980 --> 01:45:54.180]   If people did this in great numbers on YouTube, $10 a month, it would be, I think, a lot more
[01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:56.220]   revenue for YouTube creators.
[01:45:56.220 --> 01:45:58.460]   I would bet, because how much YouTube keeps.
[01:45:58.460 --> 01:46:01.460]   One thing I don't think people understand until they do a lot of videos is how hard it
[01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:02.460]   is.
[01:46:02.460 --> 01:46:04.020]   They may presume that, "Oh, it's just video.
[01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:06.220]   You throw a couple cameras down, take some shots, whatever."
[01:46:06.220 --> 01:46:08.060]   I've been watching television my entire life.
[01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:09.060]   How hard can it be?
[01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:10.060]   All about it.
[01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:14.060]   When you come actually here to the Brickhouse or RStudio TechCrunch, and you look at the amount
[01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:17.260]   of work that goes into even making really simple videos because they're just hard to do.
[01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:21.660]   I think you people better understand why kicking in some dollars would be great because the
[01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:24.940]   costs associated with video are just more tired than written word by a factor of like
[01:46:24.940 --> 01:46:25.940]   25.
[01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:29.820]   But we should point out YouTube is strong on many people because as this email goes on,
[01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:32.500]   you have to agree to the new terms that allow this.
[01:46:32.500 --> 01:46:37.740]   If you haven't signed by October 22nd, your videos will no longer be available, that outcome
[01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:41.460]   would be a loss for YouTube, a loss for the thriving presence you've built on the platform
[01:46:41.460 --> 01:46:43.460]   and above all the loss for your fans.
[01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:45.740]   Well, I mean, you better do it.
[01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:48.300]   This is not the first time YouTube sent out very strongly-
[01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:49.300]   Well, it's not.
[01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:50.300]   ... emails.
[01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:56.340]   And YouTube knows for a fact that the vast majority of YouTube's major video channels
[01:46:56.340 --> 01:46:59.220]   cannot migrate that audience anywhere else.
[01:46:59.220 --> 01:47:02.940]   YouTube's audience tends to stay put and that is a problem for creators because that
[01:47:02.940 --> 01:47:05.060]   means they have to stay put.
[01:47:05.060 --> 01:47:06.060]   It's been a problem.
[01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:09.860]   It's been a battle between the creators trying to figure out ways to have revenue commensurate
[01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:14.220]   with the size of their audiences, which are not necessarily represented by the ad sales
[01:47:14.220 --> 01:47:16.660]   that come through YouTube's ad sales team.
[01:47:16.660 --> 01:47:18.380]   So they go through outside ad sales team.
[01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:24.420]   They go to aggregators and third-party content groups who sell ads into them.
[01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:27.580]   And the big one was product placement in ads.
[01:47:27.580 --> 01:47:34.540]   And Google did the nuclear option a few months ago where they said you can't do a full screen
[01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:40.540]   for a product unless you have an agreement with us or it comes through our ad department
[01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:42.860]   and we get our 50% cut period.
[01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:47.500]   YouTube is desperate for a revenue stream and they are going to get it.
[01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:48.500]   Some one way or another.
[01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:49.500]   I hope you're by crook.
[01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:52.100]   But I mean, when YouTube was purchased by Google for what was it?
[01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:56.300]   $1.65 billion back in the day, they were scaling so fast they were losing more money
[01:47:56.300 --> 01:47:58.580]   consistently because their audience was exploding.
[01:47:58.580 --> 01:47:59.580]   Right.
[01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:01.420]   And so they kind of had to find Google as a safe harbor.
[01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:04.100]   But that doesn't mean Google immediately turned it into a very profitable property.
[01:48:04.100 --> 01:48:05.100]   I don't think they break out.
[01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:08.140]   It's KPIs or other metrics and it's earnings.
[01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:09.140]   I don't know.
[01:48:09.140 --> 01:48:10.140]   I don't think-
[01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:14.500]   I think about it's potential to gain an audience though because as we've just talked about,
[01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:15.980]   their audience skews young.
[01:48:15.980 --> 01:48:18.980]   The young kids watching music videos that will have to-
[01:48:18.980 --> 01:48:21.260]   Partly because kids watch over and over, right?
[01:48:21.260 --> 01:48:24.620]   I bet your kids, they watch the same video hundreds of times.
[01:48:24.620 --> 01:48:26.620]   They don't watch much YouTube in the way I use it.
[01:48:26.620 --> 01:48:28.140]   It's very piecemeal.
[01:48:28.140 --> 01:48:29.700]   Like, how do I do this thing?
[01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:30.700]   Or how do I, you know-
[01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:31.700]   You watch this once.
[01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:36.260]   You draw this thing or whatever tends to be a lot- I watch a lot of gardening videos.
[01:48:36.260 --> 01:48:37.260]   Wow.
[01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:38.620]   I had to prune this thing.
[01:48:38.620 --> 01:48:39.620]   YouTube's awesome.
[01:48:39.620 --> 01:48:41.940]   You can find a video on anything.
[01:48:41.940 --> 01:48:42.940]   Yeah.
[01:48:42.940 --> 01:48:44.220]   I mean, it's amazing.
[01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:46.740]   I have $10 but my kids don't.
[01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:51.340]   So is the generation that really loves to watch YouTube on repeat going to be able to
[01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:55.140]   convince their parents that- is that the right- you know, is that a profitable-
[01:48:55.140 --> 01:48:57.740]   Well, they'll still be able to access it.
[01:48:57.740 --> 01:49:02.180]   But I think the idea is they're looking at the success of Patreon or they're just looking
[01:49:02.180 --> 01:49:05.180]   for like, hey, you know, we need all oars in the water.
[01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:07.180]   Let's see how many people we can convince.
[01:49:07.180 --> 01:49:10.920]   You know, and your children, by the time they're 14 or 15, their children may dream of the
[01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:15.700]   day they have, you know, a job, you know, or a part-time job so they can pop that $10
[01:49:15.700 --> 01:49:20.460]   a month or probably $24 a month by then, you know, so they can have their YouTube experience
[01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:21.460]   without ads.
[01:49:21.460 --> 01:49:22.620]   As kids, we saved up for what?
[01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:24.380]   A car, a stereo.
[01:49:24.380 --> 01:49:28.660]   Kids will have different, you know, priorities as they're growing up.
[01:49:28.660 --> 01:49:31.180]   Your kids will be saving up for their YouTube fees.
[01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:35.460]   Well, we should keep in mind that YouTube is doing more work with streaming content and
[01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:38.620]   Twitch, which Amazon bot has had long had a feature on YouTube.
[01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:39.620]   Why?
[01:49:39.620 --> 01:49:40.620]   Subscribe.
[01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:41.620]   Exactly.
[01:49:41.620 --> 01:49:43.340]   So I'm curious if there's a connection between the two different product lines and how YouTube
[01:49:43.340 --> 01:49:45.620]   is expanding, how to purchase video.
[01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:46.620]   Probably.
[01:49:46.620 --> 01:49:47.620]   And it makes that better for a-
[01:49:47.620 --> 01:49:49.660]   What are you going to do if you're a YouTube content creator?
[01:49:49.660 --> 01:49:51.660]   You're not going to Vimeo or Yahoo.
[01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:52.660]   You just stand here.
[01:49:52.660 --> 01:49:53.660]   It's going to make it work.
[01:49:53.660 --> 01:49:54.660]   Yeah.
[01:49:54.660 --> 01:49:58.320]   I mean, people try, people continue to try, but I don't think anybody's ever leveraged
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:49:59.660]   double-digit, you know.
[01:49:59.660 --> 01:50:03.260]   You know, how the only threat really is is Facebook.
[01:50:03.260 --> 01:50:06.860]   And they haven't created a platform yet, but if they decided to go all in on this, couldn't
[01:50:06.860 --> 01:50:07.860]   they?
[01:50:07.860 --> 01:50:08.860]   I mean, they've got the audience.
[01:50:08.860 --> 01:50:11.460]   That's the key is you got to go somewhere where the audience is.
[01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:13.500]   Well, it's, but like the audience is part of it.
[01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:15.900]   And Facebook's audience is huge in a lot of ways.
[01:50:15.900 --> 01:50:17.380]   The audience is part of it.
[01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:19.740]   People being comfortable watching video on Facebook is part of it.
[01:50:19.740 --> 01:50:23.340]   And then there being an actual revenue stream is part of it.
[01:50:23.340 --> 01:50:27.340]   One of the reasons I wanted to get an iPhone is because I wanted to use Facebook mentions
[01:50:27.340 --> 01:50:30.380]   so I can do live streaming.
[01:50:30.380 --> 01:50:36.540]   If you are a verified user on Facebook, have you played with this at all, anybody?
[01:50:36.540 --> 01:50:38.260]   I just got verified last week.
[01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:39.260]   I haven't had a chance to.
[01:50:39.260 --> 01:50:40.260]   So I can.
[01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:43.820]   It's got a special app and you can, I could do it right now.
[01:50:43.820 --> 01:50:45.340]   You can do it ahead of time.
[01:50:45.340 --> 01:50:49.540]   You probably should do it ahead of time.
[01:50:49.540 --> 01:50:58.500]   So live video on Facebook, describe my live video behind the scenes at Twitter.
[01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:02.780]   It makes me wonder why I spent a million dollars building this studio.
[01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:04.780]   I was a studio.
[01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:06.980]   All you do is an iPhone.
[01:51:06.980 --> 01:51:09.860]   When, I mean, they didn't have that back then.
[01:51:09.860 --> 01:51:11.860]   Because you have to kill them.
[01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:14.540]   Two, one broadcast failed.
[01:51:14.540 --> 01:51:15.540]   Something went wrong.
[01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:16.540]   Well, thank you very much.
[01:51:16.540 --> 01:51:17.540]   Good night, everybody.
[01:51:17.540 --> 01:51:18.540]   It's cool.
[01:51:18.540 --> 01:51:20.420]   And that's why I built the studio.
[01:51:20.420 --> 01:51:22.420]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:51:22.420 --> 01:51:25.580]   Some final words and some numbers that will surprise you.
[01:51:25.580 --> 01:51:27.380]   Coming up just a little bit.
[01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:30.660]   Citrix, go to meeting our sponsor for this portion of this week in Tech.
[01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:36.380]   My recommendation, stop traveling, stop spending a lot of money, stop bugging your clients
[01:51:36.380 --> 01:51:40.780]   by making them take you to lunch or making them go to lunch with you.
[01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:44.220]   Meet your clients and your coworkers online with go to meeting.
[01:51:44.220 --> 01:51:45.220]   You'll save time.
[01:51:45.220 --> 01:51:46.220]   You'll save money.
[01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:47.220]   And you know what?
[01:51:47.220 --> 01:51:48.220]   Your clients will prefer it.
[01:51:48.220 --> 01:51:49.700]   And what's great is it is a smarter way to meet.
[01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:51.100]   It started with screen sharing.
[01:51:51.100 --> 01:51:55.220]   So you could fire up that PowerPoint presentation and show it to them while they're on the conference
[01:51:55.220 --> 01:51:56.220]   call.
[01:51:56.220 --> 01:51:58.460]   It's gotten so much better over the years.
[01:51:58.460 --> 01:52:03.100]   Now you can meet from any computer, any tablet, your smartphone.
[01:52:03.100 --> 01:52:06.580]   You can use the HD webcam on most devices.
[01:52:06.580 --> 01:52:08.180]   And now you're seeing them.
[01:52:08.180 --> 01:52:09.780]   They're seeing you.
[01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:11.980]   It's like you're in the same room.
[01:52:11.980 --> 01:52:13.380]   There's nothing like it.
[01:52:13.380 --> 01:52:15.620]   Go to meeting.
[01:52:15.620 --> 01:52:19.820]   You want to use a platform that's mature, that's been time tested and that's improved
[01:52:19.820 --> 01:52:20.820]   over the years.
[01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:25.540]   And these guys are always putting the energy into making go to meeting work better.

[01:52:39.140 --> 01:52:42.980]   Citrix Go to meeting is the product for online meetings.

[01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:50.420]   Okay.
[01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:51.420]   Quick quiz.
[01:52:51.420 --> 01:52:52.420]   Pop quiz.
[01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:58.700]   Charks or selfies.
[01:52:58.700 --> 01:52:59.700]   Sharks or selfies.
[01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:00.700]   Yeah, we'll go with that.
[01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:03.140]   Sharks selfie is very dangerous, but it's not just shark selfies.
[01:53:03.140 --> 01:53:08.220]   Apparently people like to take selfies in stupid situations.
[01:53:08.220 --> 01:53:19.300]   I became aware of this last week when a tourist at the Taj Mahal started taking pictures of
[01:53:19.300 --> 01:53:20.300]   himself.
[01:53:20.300 --> 01:53:21.780]   The whole tourist is selfie.
[01:53:21.780 --> 01:53:24.500]   Fell down the stairs, killed himself.
[01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:32.020]   Turns out shark attacks have been far less dangerous to travelers in 2015 than selfies.
[01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:33.060]   The medley is doomed.
[01:53:33.060 --> 01:53:36.620]   There have been eight confirmed shark related deaths this year.
[01:53:36.620 --> 01:53:41.500]   There have been, wait a minute, I think we just got number 16.
[01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:43.220]   Selfie deaths.
[01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:45.220]   People stand in front of trains.
[01:53:45.220 --> 01:53:47.220]   They reach out over bridges.
[01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:49.300]   They do so many stupid things.
[01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:55.140]   It's gotten so bad that in the European Union, they've proposed the criminalization of selfies
[01:53:55.140 --> 01:53:56.140]   on landmarks.
[01:53:56.140 --> 01:53:57.140]   Oh my.
[01:53:57.140 --> 01:53:58.820]   Look at this.
[01:53:58.820 --> 01:54:02.940]   I can't believe this is true, but this is from Conde Nast, traveler, must be.
[01:54:02.940 --> 01:54:10.500]   From the Russian Ministry of Interior, from a Russian safe selfie campaign leaflet, things
[01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:13.660]   not to do when you're taking a selfie.
[01:54:13.660 --> 01:54:15.380]   Don't get on the train line.
[01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:18.740]   Don't try to do it in an outboard motorboat on the back of the boat.
[01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:21.100]   Do not do it with wild animals.
[01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:24.180]   Do not do it while holding a gun.
[01:54:24.180 --> 01:54:29.420]   Do not do it while trying to climb on your roof and holding an antenna.
[01:54:29.420 --> 01:54:32.380]   Well, they missed the most important rule of selfies, which is just don't.
[01:54:32.380 --> 01:54:33.380]   Don't.
[01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:39.380]   Oh, but have I mentioned that selfie they now in the iPhone 6, you were obsessed with
[01:54:39.380 --> 01:54:40.380]   the phone though.
[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:41.380]   Like the eight-year-old.
[01:54:41.380 --> 01:54:42.380]   Interruption to the show.
[01:54:42.380 --> 01:54:43.380]   You're like, "We're gonna do it."
[01:54:43.380 --> 01:54:44.580]   You're gonna talk about Natalie, right?
[01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:45.580]   Yeah.
[01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:49.100]   When you really press the camera, it gives you an option to selfie.
[01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:50.100]   Selfie.
[01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:51.100]   Selfie flash.
[01:54:51.100 --> 01:54:52.100]   Yeah.
[01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:53.100]   Selfie flash.
[01:54:53.100 --> 01:54:54.100]   It's ready for you.
[01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:55.300]   So watch, I want to take a selfie.
[01:54:55.300 --> 01:54:57.140]   The screen triples in brightness.
[01:54:57.140 --> 01:54:59.380]   It's such an egomaniac phone.
[01:54:59.380 --> 01:55:02.140]   So that I get a better selfie because the picture lights up.
[01:55:02.140 --> 01:55:03.900]   Actually, I still look like crap.
[01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:07.940]   So you're having taken pictures of myself like, you know, when the child falls asleep
[01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:09.660]   in me and it's dark and I want to get a picture.
[01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:10.660]   You don't want a flash.
[01:55:10.660 --> 01:55:11.660]   Yeah.
[01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:14.220]   It'll actually, you know, a flash would be better than this sort of dark.
[01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:15.220]   Well, that's right.
[01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:16.220]   You don't see anything.
[01:55:16.220 --> 01:55:17.220]   Yeah.
[01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:18.220]   It's not quite a flash because it's the screen.
[01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:19.220]   It's not a flash.
[01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:21.100]   But it's still better than nothing.
[01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:23.380]   There's a fair number of knits in that little tiny screen.
[01:55:23.380 --> 01:55:24.380]   I don't know.
[01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:26.460]   I mean, I've lived at the Jersey Shore.
[01:55:26.460 --> 01:55:28.060]   I've worked at ski resorts in Colorado.
[01:55:28.060 --> 01:55:29.260]   You've seen it all.
[01:55:29.260 --> 01:55:32.020]   Well, I haven't seen it all, but it's amazing.
[01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:36.540]   And well, you know, I used to commute through the, to get to the old rivers and three offices.
[01:55:36.540 --> 01:55:39.620]   I had to commute through the baseball traffic for the Giants games.
[01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:43.020]   And you see people doing stuff like, yeah, you know, they're trying to get them, their
[01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:44.780]   friends and the Willie May statue.
[01:55:44.780 --> 01:55:48.220]   They're standing in the middle of the frickin' avenue.
[01:55:48.220 --> 01:55:49.700]   The light turns green.
[01:55:49.700 --> 01:55:54.060]   Like the MTA police are just staring at them like, are you kidding me?
[01:55:54.060 --> 01:55:55.700]   Evolution by natural selection, right?
[01:55:55.700 --> 01:55:59.460]   I mean, at some point in time people just make bad choices and you can't save them.
[01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:00.700]   Last story that we'll wrap it up.
[01:56:00.700 --> 01:56:01.700]   It's been so much fun.
[01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:03.100]   Natalie Morris, love having you on.
[01:56:03.100 --> 01:56:05.980]   NatalieMores.com thrilled about the new project.
[01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:11.340]   Everybody should click the blog link and look at some point for a new website.
[01:56:11.340 --> 01:56:12.980]   Thanks to 1990 designs.
[01:56:12.980 --> 01:56:13.980]   Yeah.
[01:56:13.980 --> 01:56:14.980]   Please give my love to Clayton.
[01:56:14.980 --> 01:56:15.980]   I will do.
[01:56:15.980 --> 01:56:18.380]   Tell him it's okay to have a pink phone.
[01:56:18.380 --> 01:56:19.380]   It really is.
[01:56:19.380 --> 01:56:23.020]   Alex Wilhelm from TechCrunch always a pleasure.
[01:56:23.020 --> 01:56:24.940]   You've gone through all the tequila in the studio.
[01:56:24.940 --> 01:56:26.380]   So you're now down to vodka.
[01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:27.820]   This is a ice water with no ice.
[01:56:27.820 --> 01:56:30.540]   Because we've been here under these lights for about three years.
[01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:31.540]   Yeah.
[01:56:31.540 --> 01:56:33.020]   If I look a little shiny, it's hot.
[01:56:33.020 --> 01:56:34.580]   It's hot.
[01:56:34.580 --> 01:56:39.780]   And of course, my great buddy and longtime partner, Patrick, I can't remember your last
[01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:42.220]   name, Norton from Tech Name.
[01:56:42.220 --> 01:56:44.140]   Just teasing.
[01:56:44.140 --> 01:56:47.180]   Tech thing T-E-K-T-H-I-N-G.com.
[01:56:47.180 --> 01:56:48.180]   What do you think?
[01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:49.340]   Patrick, you're really in the car.
[01:56:49.340 --> 01:56:50.340]   The Volkswagen thing.
[01:56:50.340 --> 01:56:51.340]   Yeah.
[01:56:51.340 --> 01:56:52.340]   Okay.
[01:56:52.340 --> 01:56:54.340]   First of all, don't call it dieselgate because I'm just tired of everything being gated.
[01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:55.340]   I don't call it diesel.
[01:56:55.340 --> 01:56:56.540]   How about diesel polusa?
[01:56:56.540 --> 01:56:57.540]   Okay.
[01:56:57.540 --> 01:56:58.540]   How about diesel gazzy?
[01:56:58.540 --> 01:57:00.540]   Dieselgazzy is good.
[01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:01.540]   Yeah.
[01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:02.540]   Dieselgazzy.
[01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:03.980]   It was named the episode too.
[01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:05.260]   It's really messy.
[01:57:05.260 --> 01:57:06.260]   It's okay.
[01:57:06.260 --> 01:57:07.540]   So I own two diesel trucks.
[01:57:07.540 --> 01:57:08.900]   I think diesel is awesome.
[01:57:08.900 --> 01:57:10.180]   I love biodiesel.
[01:57:10.180 --> 01:57:14.900]   Volkswagen has just created more trouble for diesel manufacturers in the United States
[01:57:14.900 --> 01:57:15.900]   than anything has in it.
[01:57:15.900 --> 01:57:18.820]   I think what it's trying to do is get you to buy some diesel.
[01:57:18.820 --> 01:57:20.140]   Well, what's frustrating, right?
[01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:22.060]   Because it turns out it's clean diesel.
[01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:23.060]   Well, okay.
[01:57:23.060 --> 01:57:29.060]   So first of all, it looks like there are rumors that there are early thoughts that apparently
[01:57:29.060 --> 01:57:30.900]   BMW is doing the same thing.
[01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:33.740]   You know what, car makers have done this for years, haven't they?
[01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:35.340]   And it depends.
[01:57:35.340 --> 01:57:39.420]   So car makers have always gained like the mile per gallon.
[01:57:39.420 --> 01:57:40.620]   PC makers have done it.
[01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:41.820]   Remember, you're a benchmarker.
[01:57:41.820 --> 01:57:46.820]   I was once offered a half million dollars for a beta copy of these if Davis benchmarks.
[01:57:46.820 --> 01:57:47.820]   Yes.
[01:57:47.820 --> 01:57:48.820]   Because then they could build it into the BIOS.
[01:57:48.820 --> 01:57:50.620]   It would look and see, oh, we're running the benchmark.
[01:57:50.620 --> 01:57:51.620]   Yeah.
[01:57:51.620 --> 01:57:52.620]   Or overclock.
[01:57:52.620 --> 01:57:56.340]   Even if they didn't even if they didn't tweak it at the BIOS level, they could still optimize
[01:57:56.340 --> 01:58:00.860]   the machine to maximize its performance on the benchmarks, you know, how much memory.
[01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:02.940]   Companies have a long history of trying to cheat.
[01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:03.940]   Yes.
[01:58:03.940 --> 01:58:08.900]   So for the operating regulators, this is putting 40 times more sulfur dioxide into the air.
[01:58:08.900 --> 01:58:09.900]   Okay.
[01:58:09.900 --> 01:58:10.900]   So then it's legal.
[01:58:10.900 --> 01:58:15.300]   One of there's a magazine, there's a magazine I subscribed to that is for Cummins, diesels,
[01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:16.300]   owners.
[01:58:16.300 --> 01:58:18.660]   And one of the regular contributors of that magazine worked for the EPA in the 70s.
[01:58:18.660 --> 01:58:20.100]   And he has an interesting perspective.
[01:58:20.100 --> 01:58:23.900]   He said, look, our mission in the 70s was accomplished about a decade ago in terms of
[01:58:23.900 --> 01:58:28.100]   air cleanliness, in terms of reducing pollution, in terms of cleaning a lot of stuff up.
[01:58:28.100 --> 01:58:30.860]   Like, you know, most of the a lot of people watching the show aren't old enough to have
[01:58:30.860 --> 01:58:33.100]   seen videos of the Kaihara River on fire.
[01:58:33.100 --> 01:58:36.700]   You know, when it was on fire, you know, things are not right.
[01:58:36.700 --> 01:58:37.700]   Right.
[01:58:37.700 --> 01:58:40.100]   So, you know, or the guys, I got stuck down in Baja once with a bunch of guys that were
[01:58:40.100 --> 01:58:43.780]   really upset about the EPA and they should be able to roll coal and burn smoke and have
[01:58:43.780 --> 01:58:45.340]   whatever modifications they want to the vehicle.
[01:58:45.340 --> 01:58:47.100]   I'm like, dude, you grew up in LA.
[01:58:47.100 --> 01:58:51.540]   I've lived in parts of New Jersey where locals did not drink the water because of the paint
[01:58:51.540 --> 01:58:54.700]   plant and the benzene processing plant, right?
[01:58:54.700 --> 01:58:56.940]   But I never could see the air.
[01:58:56.940 --> 01:58:59.780]   And in LA, you can still see the air on the bad days.
[01:58:59.780 --> 01:59:00.780]   You know what I mean?
[01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:02.780]   But nearly as bad as it was in the '70s.
[01:59:02.780 --> 01:59:03.780]   Exactly.
[01:59:03.780 --> 01:59:04.780]   And you know why?
[01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:05.780]   Because of emissions rules.
[01:59:05.780 --> 01:59:09.180]   So, you know, if you like the fact that you're getting like 300 horsepower of a two-liter
[01:59:09.180 --> 01:59:13.260]   engine, thank the EPA because the EPA laws mandated a whole bunch of stuff that forced
[01:59:13.260 --> 01:59:18.340]   engine manufacturers or automotive manufacturers to get better at what they do.
[01:59:18.340 --> 01:59:23.380]   All of that aside, Volkswagen basically, yeah, they put in an algorithm that looked
[01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:30.420]   for a combination of settings that indicated the vehicle was being tested for smog and
[01:59:30.420 --> 01:59:33.020]   then put on all of the smog correction.
[01:59:33.020 --> 01:59:36.820]   This is very critical for Volkswagen because Volkswagen said they could eat, they could
[01:59:36.820 --> 01:59:40.420]   meet smog emissions with their 2.0 liter engine with the TD IDZL.
[01:59:40.420 --> 01:59:41.980]   Clean out so-called clean diesel.
[01:59:41.980 --> 01:59:46.780]   Yeah, without having additional, it's pretty freaking clean even at 40 times the emissions.
[01:59:46.780 --> 01:59:47.780]   Is there really?
[01:59:47.780 --> 01:59:48.780]   Yeah.
[01:59:48.780 --> 01:59:49.780]   I mean, yeah.
[01:59:49.780 --> 01:59:50.780]   It's better than your Cummins.
[01:59:50.780 --> 01:59:51.780]   Yeah.
[01:59:51.780 --> 01:59:52.780]   But I also burned biodiesel in my cousins.
[01:59:52.780 --> 01:59:53.780]   So, my Cummins.
[01:59:53.780 --> 01:59:54.780]   And my biodiesel is made--
[01:59:54.780 --> 01:59:55.780]   So, can see you coming.
[01:59:55.780 --> 01:59:56.780]   Your Cummins.
[01:59:56.780 --> 01:59:57.780]   No, no.
[01:59:57.780 --> 01:59:58.780]   Careful.
[01:59:58.780 --> 02:00:00.660]   No smoke coming from my Cummins.
[02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:01.660]   Really?
[02:00:01.660 --> 02:00:03.140]   I find belching black smoke.
[02:00:03.140 --> 02:00:04.140]   No.
[02:00:04.140 --> 02:00:07.620]   People who belt black smoke from their diesels are people who like to burn money.
[02:00:07.620 --> 02:00:09.180]   I am not a person that burns money.
[02:00:09.180 --> 02:00:13.660]   That is burning money and wasting power and it may make you think your masculine organisms
[02:00:13.660 --> 02:00:14.660]   are larger and more functional.
[02:00:14.660 --> 02:00:17.340]   So, you can tune a diesel in some way so it doesn't puff smoke?
[02:00:17.340 --> 02:00:18.340]   Yes.
[02:00:18.340 --> 02:00:21.100]   You just have to have enough oxygen coming into the engine to burn the amount of fuel
[02:00:21.100 --> 02:00:22.100]   you have.
[02:00:22.100 --> 02:00:24.860]   Like most of the stuff where people are rolling coal, it's for effect.
[02:00:24.860 --> 02:00:25.860]   Right.
[02:00:25.860 --> 02:00:26.860]   Right.
[02:00:26.860 --> 02:00:27.860]   But the thing with--
[02:00:27.860 --> 02:00:29.500]   So, it's called rolling coal.
[02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:30.500]   That's what people call it.
[02:00:30.500 --> 02:00:32.740]   Like South or something?
[02:00:32.740 --> 02:00:34.380]   No, it's from New Jersey.
[02:00:34.380 --> 02:00:35.380]   It's very similar.
[02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:36.380]   The trucks.
[02:00:36.380 --> 02:00:37.380]   Yeah.
[02:00:37.380 --> 02:00:38.380]   With the bike.
[02:00:38.380 --> 02:00:39.380]   Yeah.
[02:00:39.380 --> 02:00:40.380]   That's called rolling coal.
[02:00:40.380 --> 02:00:41.380]   Because it looks like--
[02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:42.380]   It's like a--
[02:00:42.380 --> 02:00:44.380]   I'm in Virginia, coal money.
[02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:45.380]   Yeah.
[02:00:45.380 --> 02:00:51.940]   But, you know, so I amped up about this because what Volkswagen did is they just tuned-- they
[02:00:51.940 --> 02:00:57.500]   just give the EPA an excuse to be really, really, really agro about emissions with all
[02:00:57.500 --> 02:00:58.500]   the manufacturers.
[02:00:58.500 --> 02:01:01.420]   The EPA has basically said they're going to start spot checking automobiles.
[02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:05.100]   So there are going to be federal examinations of automobiles around the United States.
[02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:08.020]   Is this going to be like they're going to pull me over and they're going to do exhaust
[02:01:08.020 --> 02:01:09.020]   tests on me?
[02:01:09.020 --> 02:01:12.860]   Or is this going to be like we are going to go to dealerships and randomly inspect untested
[02:01:12.860 --> 02:01:13.860]   autos?
[02:01:13.860 --> 02:01:15.820]   I do not need to be stopped by the EPA.
[02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:18.660]   Traffic is complicated enough in the Bay Area as it is.
[02:01:18.660 --> 02:01:22.180]   It is going to-- the BBA has a witch hunt, you know, and to a certain degree, the California
[02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:25.740]   Resource Board already has a witch hunt on diesel because they believe that the particulate
[02:01:25.740 --> 02:01:29.140]   matter from diesel offsets any of the other diesel benefits and particularly matter can
[02:01:29.140 --> 02:01:34.260]   be tied to cancer, not unlike breathing in gasoline fumes and everything else.
[02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:38.700]   So there's a lot of things stacked against diesel in the United States to begin with.
[02:01:38.700 --> 02:01:43.340]   And now Volkswagen has-- Volkswagen's also screwed itself because the vast number of
[02:01:43.340 --> 02:01:47.380]   people who bought TDI vehicles were like, I want something more exciting than a Prius.
[02:01:47.380 --> 02:01:48.380]   I want something that's more interesting.
[02:01:48.380 --> 02:01:49.380]   And that's something that's more fun than trying.
[02:01:49.380 --> 02:01:50.380]   That's probably why they did this, right?
[02:01:50.380 --> 02:01:52.780]   To make it more responsive, better fuel mileage.
[02:01:52.780 --> 02:01:53.780]   Yeah.
[02:01:53.780 --> 02:02:00.900]   But it turns out is that Volkswagen was not meeting the emissions or we don't know-- nobody's
[02:02:00.900 --> 02:02:02.540]   done any thorough testing on this.
[02:02:02.540 --> 02:02:03.780]   So they-- we don't--
[02:02:03.780 --> 02:02:06.420]   Hardly because of the DMCA preventing anybody from the whole--
[02:02:06.420 --> 02:02:08.900]   Yeah, that's a whole other-- that's a whole other--
[02:02:08.900 --> 02:02:10.180]   That's about two hour conversation.
[02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:13.220]   Yeah, that's the entire-- it's like four hour triangulation.
[02:02:13.220 --> 02:02:15.900]   Well, for a year, they denied they were doing anything.
[02:02:15.900 --> 02:02:18.220]   They finally said, yeah, we were doing it.
[02:02:18.220 --> 02:02:24.300]   So what happens is-- and the thing that also has been really pissed off is GM knowingly
[02:02:24.300 --> 02:02:29.020]   in acts-- you basically refuse to acknowledge a problem with ignition switches.
[02:02:29.020 --> 02:02:30.860]   It's tied to the deaths of 120 people, right?
[02:02:30.860 --> 02:02:35.340]   So $900 million check and walks in a year when they made like $3 billion.
[02:02:35.340 --> 02:02:41.060]   The upside, the high side of the potential fines based on the-- what is it, like $34,000
[02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:43.740]   per vehicle is $18 billion for Volkswagen.
[02:02:43.740 --> 02:02:48.340]   Is Volkswagen going to pay $18 billion for a half million car violations?
[02:02:48.340 --> 02:02:51.380]   No, what's going to happen is they're either going to retrofit them, which if they're lucky
[02:02:51.380 --> 02:02:54.340]   they can do in software, which may not be possible, or they're going to have to do a
[02:02:54.340 --> 02:02:55.340]   year-year system to--
[02:02:55.340 --> 02:02:58.060]   It's not just in the US they've been doing it all over the world.
[02:02:58.060 --> 02:03:00.180]   There are 11 million cars.
[02:03:00.180 --> 02:03:04.260]   It's not-- it costs could be as much as $41 billion.
[02:03:04.260 --> 02:03:05.260]   But that's like--
[02:03:05.260 --> 02:03:06.260]   Just to retrofit.
[02:03:06.260 --> 02:03:07.260]   I'm not talking to fine.
[02:03:07.260 --> 02:03:10.460]   Well, and that's-- but that's just-- we don't know what they can retrofit.
[02:03:10.460 --> 02:03:11.460]   They don't know what they can retrofit.
[02:03:11.460 --> 02:03:15.300]   Are they going to have to retrofit a year-year system to make it-- combine-- nobody knows,
[02:03:15.300 --> 02:03:16.300]   but it's a mess.
[02:03:16.300 --> 02:03:19.460]   And it's going to-- it's going to-- the EPA is going to be looking at a lot of stuff right
[02:03:19.460 --> 02:03:20.460]   now as a result of this.
[02:03:20.460 --> 02:03:21.460]   It is a mess.
[02:03:21.460 --> 02:03:26.260]   They had nearly 200 billion euros in revenue in 2013, and they sold about 10 million cars
[02:03:26.260 --> 02:03:27.260]   a year, according to the Stooda.
[02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:30.940]   So I mean, even if they got the full fine, it wouldn't kill them, but I mean, I can't
[02:03:30.940 --> 02:03:32.780]   imagine anyone writing a check of that scale.
[02:03:32.780 --> 02:03:33.780]   It's already cost them a little bit.
[02:03:33.780 --> 02:03:34.780]   They're CEO who--
[02:03:34.780 --> 02:03:35.780]   It's yeah, the CEO's out.
[02:03:35.780 --> 02:03:36.780]   Apologist, I quit.
[02:03:36.780 --> 02:03:41.300]   Yeah, the CEO has been basically-- has fallen on his sword.
[02:03:41.300 --> 02:03:42.300]   We don't know.
[02:03:42.300 --> 02:03:44.860]   They cannot sell diesel cars in the United States.
[02:03:44.860 --> 02:03:48.980]   They've stopped selling diesel cars in the United States until they have a fix for this.
[02:03:48.980 --> 02:03:53.660]   And I have to imagine other diesel cars from other manufacturers are in trouble as well.
[02:03:53.660 --> 02:03:58.180]   The problem is, is most of the other manufacturers were using, like, you know, Blue Tech or whatever,
[02:03:58.180 --> 02:04:00.300]   Yuri-based technology or a-- yeah.
[02:04:00.300 --> 02:04:03.460]   There's lots of ways to eliminate the emissions that are the issue.
[02:04:03.460 --> 02:04:07.100]   Volkswagen said they were doing it without the addition of like a Yuri-a-sub system or
[02:04:07.100 --> 02:04:10.940]   something like that, or what it actually referred to as cat squeezings or cat piss.
[02:04:10.940 --> 02:04:15.700]   So they-- it wasn't a question of them turning off emissions and rolling coal.
[02:04:15.700 --> 02:04:18.260]   They didn't even have the capability to do a cleaner.
[02:04:18.260 --> 02:04:24.740]   No, they basically-- no, they were-- it basically turned everything on for emissions when it
[02:04:24.740 --> 02:04:26.540]   thought it was being smog tested.
[02:04:26.540 --> 02:04:28.740]   And if it wasn't being smog tested, it sort of--
[02:04:28.740 --> 02:04:30.620]   And they could have used a cleaner engine.
[02:04:30.620 --> 02:04:31.620]   They didn't.
[02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:33.460]   Well, yeah, but they felt-- yeah, they could have used it.
[02:04:33.460 --> 02:04:36.500]   And the other thing is nobody-- what I don't know is why they did that.
[02:04:36.500 --> 02:04:37.500]   Do they gain 10% horsepower?
[02:04:37.500 --> 02:04:38.500]   Right.
[02:04:38.500 --> 02:04:39.500]   Are they gain 5% horsepower?
[02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:41.420]   Are they gain 30% horsepower?
[02:04:41.420 --> 02:04:43.140]   It's a really curious question.
[02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:46.060]   What was the net gain for the damage they caused overall the world?
[02:04:46.060 --> 02:04:47.820]   Well, they sold 11 million diesel cars with it.
[02:04:47.820 --> 02:04:51.580]   Might not have sold at all because people have such a bad impression of diesel.
[02:04:51.580 --> 02:04:52.820]   Well, they would have-- they would have sold--
[02:04:52.820 --> 02:04:54.340]   Well, the thing is-- trucks is one thing.
[02:04:54.340 --> 02:04:55.540]   You're going to sell diesel trucks.
[02:04:55.540 --> 02:04:58.100]   Diesel-- I mean, basically, Ultimobile killed diesel in the US.
[02:04:58.100 --> 02:05:00.020]   I mean, diesel was much cheaper in Europe.
[02:05:00.020 --> 02:05:01.020]   And you know, fuel just--
[02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:02.020]   If you were to--
[02:05:02.020 --> 02:05:03.180]   Fastly cheaper compared to gasoline in Europe.
[02:05:03.180 --> 02:05:05.820]   And that's part of the reason why diesel is so popular in Europe.
[02:05:05.820 --> 02:05:12.740]   And then when the fuel crisis hit in the '70s, Ultimobile retrofitted a bunch of--
[02:05:12.740 --> 02:05:16.420]   basically, it amounted to-- they retrofitted a gasoline engine design
[02:05:16.420 --> 02:05:17.740]   to work as a diesel.
[02:05:17.740 --> 02:05:18.740]   And it was a horrible mess.
[02:05:18.740 --> 02:05:19.740]   It was a nightmare.
[02:05:19.740 --> 02:05:24.180]   And that single car did more damage to diesel automobiles than anything else
[02:05:24.180 --> 02:05:26.380]   in the United States.
[02:05:26.380 --> 02:05:26.900]   I don't know.
[02:05:26.900 --> 02:05:27.900]   Anyhow, I'm a gearhead.
[02:05:27.900 --> 02:05:28.420]   Sorry.
[02:05:28.420 --> 02:05:29.420]   It doesn't show at all.
[02:05:29.420 --> 02:05:31.020]   Well, what's the bottom line?
[02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:32.380]   Obviously, Volkswagen did wrong.
[02:05:32.380 --> 02:05:34.220]   It's going to hurt diesel as a--
[02:05:34.220 --> 02:05:39.140]   There's a certain percentage of Volkswagen's customers will never come back.
[02:05:39.140 --> 02:05:40.940]   They will sell their cars to the first opportunity.
[02:05:40.940 --> 02:05:43.180]   They will never come back because their trust has been violated.
[02:05:43.180 --> 02:05:44.700]   I thought I had a green vehicle.
[02:05:44.700 --> 02:05:47.340]   I thought I was as cool as the guy with the Prius or the Tesla.
[02:05:47.340 --> 02:05:48.340]   Right.
[02:05:48.340 --> 02:05:49.820]   And they lied to me.
[02:05:49.820 --> 02:05:51.460]   And I'm never going to get back.
[02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:53.780]   I have a Volkswagen.
[02:05:53.780 --> 02:05:54.300]   I drive it.
[02:05:54.300 --> 02:05:55.740]   But you don't have a diesel, I bet you have a gas.
[02:05:55.740 --> 02:05:57.900]   No, I wanted one, but I couldn't find the one.
[02:05:57.900 --> 02:05:59.900]   I drive an Audi, but it's a gas Audi.
[02:05:59.900 --> 02:06:03.860]   But I have to admit, I feel like maybe I'm not going to have an Audi next time.
[02:06:03.860 --> 02:06:04.860]   It's got a cos of the brand.
[02:06:04.860 --> 02:06:05.860]   It's got a cos of the brand.
[02:06:05.860 --> 02:06:06.860]   Because I think it hurts the brand.
[02:06:06.860 --> 02:06:07.860]   Yeah.
[02:06:07.860 --> 02:06:08.860]   I think it doesn't--
[02:06:08.860 --> 02:06:09.860]   You know what their slogan is?
[02:06:09.860 --> 02:06:10.860]   Truth in engineering.
[02:06:10.860 --> 02:06:11.860]   Oops.
[02:06:11.860 --> 02:06:12.860]   Maybe not.
[02:06:12.860 --> 02:06:14.580]   The satire is dead.
[02:06:14.580 --> 02:06:15.580]   Maybe not.
[02:06:15.580 --> 02:06:17.780]   Beautiful image is a Pluto.
[02:06:17.780 --> 02:06:18.980]   Just kind of mention it.
[02:06:18.980 --> 02:06:21.420]   God, I love New Horizons.
[02:06:21.420 --> 02:06:22.420]   And the moon tonight.
[02:06:22.420 --> 02:06:24.900]   Oh, yeah, we have the red moon tonight.
[02:06:24.900 --> 02:06:28.660]   Everybody must get-- actually, you know, here in the California, it's going to be awesome.
[02:06:28.660 --> 02:06:32.020]   You'll get to get the full eclipse, Natalie, because you're on the east coast.
[02:06:32.020 --> 02:06:33.540]   You won't get the full eclipse.
[02:06:33.540 --> 02:06:37.460]   But the moon rise and the sun rise are a sunsetter identical times.
[02:06:37.460 --> 02:06:40.020]   And the eclipse is going on during the moon rise.
[02:06:40.020 --> 02:06:45.180]   So we're going to get an amazing-- expect a lot of Instagram shots of a blood red moon
[02:06:45.180 --> 02:06:47.740]   hovering above the horizon during an eclipse.
[02:06:47.740 --> 02:06:48.900]   And of course, it's a super moon.
[02:06:48.900 --> 02:06:50.660]   It's the closest the moon gets.
[02:06:50.660 --> 02:06:51.660]   It's at its perigee.
[02:06:51.660 --> 02:06:52.660]   It's at its perigee.
[02:06:52.660 --> 02:06:56.900]   And it won't be, by the way, there won't be a total eclipse of the moon at perigee again
[02:06:56.900 --> 02:06:58.180]   until 2033.
[02:06:58.180 --> 02:06:59.860]   So kids--
[02:06:59.860 --> 02:07:02.660]   What time is the sunrise, moon, and sunset?
[02:07:02.660 --> 02:07:05.660]   Should I show you a website that everybody should know about?
[02:07:05.660 --> 02:07:06.940]   Ask Siri.
[02:07:06.940 --> 02:07:07.700]   Ask Siri.
[02:07:07.700 --> 02:07:08.340]   She'll go.
[02:07:08.340 --> 02:07:10.020]   I don't know.
[02:07:10.020 --> 02:07:11.140]   It's--
[02:07:11.140 --> 02:07:12.660]   Photographers are femorous.
[02:07:12.660 --> 02:07:15.780]   I love the fact that someone just came up and handed me the entire chart.
[02:07:15.780 --> 02:07:16.700]   That's John.
[02:07:16.700 --> 02:07:18.180]   He's a beautiful--
[02:07:18.180 --> 02:07:19.660]   He's a little confident over there.
[02:07:19.660 --> 02:07:22.180]   He's just-- he knows what you want before you want it.
[02:07:22.180 --> 02:07:28.100]   Partial at 6.07 PM, total at 7.11 PM for the eclipse, and total 8.23 PM, and partial
[02:07:28.100 --> 02:07:29.620]   at 9.27 PM.
[02:07:29.620 --> 02:07:31.340]   Chris Markwork Pass is along to me.
[02:07:31.340 --> 02:07:36.020]   If you go to photoifemorous.com, you can see this.
[02:07:36.020 --> 02:07:43.380]   And they have fairly pricey apps for iOS and Android, but they also have a web-based
[02:07:43.380 --> 02:07:46.220]   ephemeris programmer.
[02:07:46.220 --> 02:07:47.220]   So you can go--
[02:07:47.220 --> 02:07:48.220]   What is ephemeris?
[02:07:48.220 --> 02:07:50.300]   Ephemeris is like the tide charts and stuff like that.
[02:07:50.300 --> 02:07:52.980]   It's the sunrise, sunset.
[02:07:52.980 --> 02:07:54.740]   So you're searching for the magic hour.
[02:07:54.740 --> 02:07:55.740]   This is the time we have to add.
[02:07:55.740 --> 02:07:58.860]   Well, more than that what you want is not only when it's going to happen, but what the
[02:07:58.860 --> 02:08:05.420]   path will be where you are so that you can position yourself to get it just right.
[02:08:05.420 --> 02:08:06.780]   So you enter in your address here.
[02:08:06.780 --> 02:08:10.340]   I'll put our address 140 Keller, Street, Petaluma.
[02:08:10.340 --> 02:08:12.700]   Wait, where do you do that?
[02:08:12.700 --> 02:08:13.700]   Photoifemorous.com.
[02:08:13.700 --> 02:08:14.700]   This is a little--
[02:08:14.700 --> 02:08:15.700]   Oh, three deaths.
[02:08:15.700 --> 02:08:16.700]   Have that.
[02:08:16.700 --> 02:08:17.700]   Yeah.
[02:08:17.700 --> 02:08:19.180]   And so here's where we are.
[02:08:19.180 --> 02:08:22.580]   The path of-- I don't understand how to read this, but I will figure this out before
[02:08:22.580 --> 02:08:26.780]   tonight because what you want to do is position yourself so the moon is somewhere interesting
[02:08:26.780 --> 02:08:31.500]   because it can be close to the horizon between buildings or at the top of a road.
[02:08:31.500 --> 02:08:32.740]   Oh, set up a camera ahead of time.
[02:08:32.740 --> 02:08:34.740]   Set up a camera ahead of time.
[02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:35.740]   Okay.
[02:08:35.740 --> 02:08:40.740]   So the-- and you can see exactly what time to do that and you can see the path so that
[02:08:40.740 --> 02:08:42.220]   you can know.
[02:08:42.220 --> 02:08:44.980]   Just a completely left field too.
[02:08:44.980 --> 02:08:45.980]   That's cool.
[02:08:45.980 --> 02:08:46.980]   Isn't that cool?
[02:08:46.980 --> 02:08:47.980]   I'm excited.
[02:08:47.980 --> 02:08:48.980]   Photoifemorous.com.
[02:08:48.980 --> 02:08:49.980]   Thanks.
[02:08:49.980 --> 02:08:51.780]   Hey, Natalie, thank you for being here.
[02:08:51.780 --> 02:08:52.780]   Hey yourself.
[02:08:52.780 --> 02:08:53.780]   Come back again.
[02:08:53.780 --> 02:08:54.780]   Yeah.
[02:08:54.780 --> 02:08:55.780]   Anytime.
[02:08:55.780 --> 02:08:57.780]   Oh, and I just-- I always love it when you're on the show.
[02:08:57.780 --> 02:08:59.980]   So I don't-- it's been so long.
[02:08:59.980 --> 02:09:01.180]   Come back and we'll get Clayton onto--
[02:09:01.180 --> 02:09:02.180]   You do flatter.
[02:09:02.180 --> 02:09:03.180]   Thank you, sir.
[02:09:03.180 --> 02:09:06.180]   And a few years, Miles and Avo be on the show.
[02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:07.180]   They will.
[02:09:07.180 --> 02:09:14.340]   And I'll be going, I remember your mama when she was first pregnant with you.
[02:09:14.340 --> 02:09:15.340]   Now look at you.
[02:09:15.340 --> 02:09:18.020]   I was in studio even.
[02:09:18.020 --> 02:09:19.020]   You were?
[02:09:19.020 --> 02:09:20.020]   You brought your mom.
[02:09:20.020 --> 02:09:21.020]   Was so much fun.
[02:09:21.020 --> 02:09:22.220]   I'm a baby bump.
[02:09:22.220 --> 02:09:23.220]   And your baby bump.
[02:09:23.220 --> 02:09:25.020]   Nice to see you.
[02:09:25.020 --> 02:09:26.020]   Always a pleasure.
[02:09:26.020 --> 02:09:27.020]   Come back soon.
[02:09:27.020 --> 02:09:33.300]   And don't forget Natalie's blog and great stuff at NatalieMoris.com.
[02:09:33.300 --> 02:09:34.300]   And you got to get it.
[02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:35.300]   Yeah, it's got to stand out.
[02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:37.300]   We got to find a way to--
[02:09:37.300 --> 02:09:38.460]   I'll find a good designer.
[02:09:38.460 --> 02:09:39.460]   Yeah, I'm working on it.
[02:09:39.460 --> 02:09:40.460]   We're working on it.
[02:09:40.460 --> 02:09:44.740]   Alex, well, how many things you want to plug besides your regular appearance on TechCrunch?
[02:09:44.740 --> 02:09:46.220]   I want to plug your crew, actually.
[02:09:46.220 --> 02:09:49.300]   I think working with you guys is always really good and your team is great.
[02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:50.300]   They take good care of you.
[02:09:50.300 --> 02:09:51.300]   They really do.
[02:09:51.300 --> 02:09:52.300]   They keep the tequila.
[02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:53.300]   You're horrible.
[02:09:53.300 --> 02:09:54.300]   But I mean, your staff.
[02:09:54.300 --> 02:09:56.940]   I have been coasting on their backs for so long.
[02:09:56.940 --> 02:09:57.940]   I just really appreciate it.
[02:09:57.940 --> 02:09:59.860]   Some day I'm going to pay them.
[02:09:59.860 --> 02:10:00.860]   Then--
[02:10:00.860 --> 02:10:01.860]   That's a bit much.
[02:10:01.860 --> 02:10:02.860]   But I will say that they're--
[02:10:02.860 --> 02:10:03.860]   $0.18 and now.
[02:10:03.860 --> 02:10:04.860]   $0.17.
[02:10:04.860 --> 02:10:05.860]   $0.17.
[02:10:05.860 --> 02:10:06.860]   No, I pay better than Apple.
[02:10:06.860 --> 02:10:07.860]   Oh, yeah.
[02:10:07.860 --> 02:10:08.860]   Yeah.
[02:10:08.860 --> 02:10:09.860]   I jumped the expenditure.
[02:10:09.860 --> 02:10:10.860]   Thank you.
[02:10:10.860 --> 02:10:11.860]   You're right.
[02:10:11.860 --> 02:10:12.860]   I don't give them enough credit.
[02:10:12.860 --> 02:10:13.860]   A really great crew.
[02:10:13.860 --> 02:10:15.020]   And in fact, Brian Burnett is filling in.
[02:10:15.020 --> 02:10:18.540]   Jason Howell is our normal technical director and producer is on vacation.
[02:10:18.540 --> 02:10:19.540]   Bless him.
[02:10:19.540 --> 02:10:20.540]   Thank you, Brian.
[02:10:20.540 --> 02:10:21.540]   He was a little under the weather.
[02:10:21.540 --> 02:10:24.260]   And we were worried that I would have to run the board myself.
[02:10:24.260 --> 02:10:26.100]   So I appreciate you coming in.
[02:10:26.100 --> 02:10:27.100]   My pleasure.
[02:10:27.100 --> 02:10:29.100]   It's always fun to work with you.
[02:10:29.100 --> 02:10:31.100]   And of course, Patrick Norton.
[02:10:31.100 --> 02:10:32.780]   Techthing.com.
[02:10:32.780 --> 02:10:37.500]   Just any time the Richmond fire alarm goes off, you'll know.
[02:10:37.500 --> 02:10:38.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:39.500]   I hope something's gone wrong.
[02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:41.500]   I'll get it right next time.
[02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:42.500]   Techthing.com.
[02:10:42.500 --> 02:10:44.260]   We do it to it every Sunday afternoon.
[02:10:44.260 --> 02:10:45.260]   I love doing it.
[02:10:45.260 --> 02:10:46.260]   I hope you love seeing it.
[02:10:46.260 --> 02:10:48.300]   3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:10:48.300 --> 02:10:49.780]   2200 UTC.
[02:10:49.780 --> 02:10:51.300]   You can watch live.
[02:10:51.300 --> 02:10:57.580]   And then all the really great naked dancing and stuff doesn't get it out.
[02:10:57.580 --> 02:10:59.700]   Or Patrick shaving himself on the--
[02:10:59.700 --> 02:11:00.700]   Yeah, the bloodbath.
[02:11:00.700 --> 02:11:02.900]   The bloodbath that we had earlier.
[02:11:02.900 --> 02:11:07.460]   But if you can't watch live on demand, audio and video of the show is always available
[02:11:07.460 --> 02:11:10.020]   after the fact that our website, twit.tv.
[02:11:10.020 --> 02:11:15.940]   And of course, wherever finer podcasts are aggregated, including iTunes and everywhere
[02:11:15.940 --> 02:11:16.940]   else.
[02:11:16.940 --> 02:11:17.940]   Great studio audience today.
[02:11:17.940 --> 02:11:18.940]   It's nice to have you all here.
[02:11:18.940 --> 02:11:23.500]   If you would like to be in the studio audience, just email tickets at twit.tv.
[02:11:23.500 --> 02:11:25.220]   And we'll make sure we put a seat out for you.
[02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:26.220]   Do they cost anything?
[02:11:26.220 --> 02:11:27.220]   Absolutely.
[02:11:27.220 --> 02:11:28.220]   You know, I never say this.
[02:11:28.220 --> 02:11:29.220]   Of course not.
[02:11:29.220 --> 02:11:30.220]   It's free.
[02:11:30.220 --> 02:11:31.220]   Just, you know.
[02:11:31.220 --> 02:11:32.220]   Yeah.
[02:11:32.220 --> 02:11:33.700]   And we'll even-- if you're of age, we'll even offer you tequila.
[02:11:33.700 --> 02:11:34.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:36.900]   I can't wait until I'm 21, that guess.
[02:11:36.900 --> 02:11:40.260]   So now I'm in trouble.
[02:11:40.260 --> 02:11:41.260]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[02:11:41.260 --> 02:11:42.260]   We'll see you next time.
