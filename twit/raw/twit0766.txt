[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.120]   Yep, whoops. This is what happens since I last was on Leo everything changes. He's at youtube.com/Renee Richie
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.840]   He's left imore to start his own YouTube venture. How's it going? You're about week three or four in?
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.400]   Yeah, I mean it's going pretty well
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.360]   It I have no way to judge because I worked for a big media company for 10 years
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.920]   So this is all just new and exciting to me
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.360]   But people seem happy and I'm happy so I'm gonna take that as a as a victory. That's the most important thing
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.840]   And those of us who are independent
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.880]   Media folk just wish you the best of luck
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:52.680]   I really appreciate it. Good. Good luck best of timings. You didn't your timing is not awesome
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.120]   But maybe it is it's funny because some podcasts initially said
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.500]   Your ship had gone down and then but I think that some
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.780]   Podcasts and YouTube are going up a lot
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:10.560]   There's 40 videos and I think YouTube's probably going up a lot. That's oh doctor. Oh and JJ stone
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.440]   From my qmz. Oh, you looking pretty today. They they call me. Oh dr. Hamilton
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.040]   As a twin fan
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:28.200]   That's all the way care remember yeah for somebody who hates the show use actually I don't
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.040]   Put that in the Apple
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:37.880]   Even this is all of your hate to at oh doctor. That's Georgia down
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.200]   I love Georgia down I design - videos.com and George is doing something very generous today
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.280]   You're giving out your email address, which is
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.880]   Incredible risky. Why?
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:56.440]   Well if in case people need to just reach out some people are stuck in they need to kind of reach out
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.560]   That's what I do for living and I think that during times like this it'd be nice and since Renee is wearing his orange hoodie wait I have
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.280]   Orange hoodies, so we will be matching orange hoodies here beautiful
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.640]   My address up like last time
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.600]   The licensed
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.600]   marriage and family therapist and
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.100]   Right am I right? I I do couples counseling, but mostly I deal with things
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:30.000]   Are you else are you what it's in Canada? So the license I'm a licensed psychotherapist licensed psychotherapist. That's it's metric psychology
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.200]   It's metric. It's a little bit there
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.640]   So it's okay, and yeah, I think that's really nice Georgia at West Mount therapy nor
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:44.000]   Georgia West Mount therapy calm. Okay, and so if you're feeling a little rugged if things are tough
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   I know I have a close friend
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.680]   Who's you know really bad to kill her husband right now?
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.940]   So and of course it's true. Yeah, it's so hard. It's a name rhyme with me. So
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.920]   So I am through yes, it is yes, it happens to me my wife as a matter of fact
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.720]   so yeah, it's really good to
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.880]   Reach out and and get some help and there are lots of ways to do that
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.440]   But I think it's wonderful George is a really wonderful person and a very talented therapist
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.440]   So it's nice to have that West Mount therapy
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.640]   We're surrounded by Canadians uncle Leo. Oh my god. It's true
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.320]   Look at that mask. That is a great
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.640]   Is that a Canadian mask are you filtering out the Canadian? Oh?
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:34.560]   What look first of all I'm trying to keep y'all safe because Canada's numbers are down. So I prepared myself for this episode
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.320]   I want to spray
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.720]   Sanitate most of my comments and statements. Let me take this off the audio listeners to get mad
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.240]   Yeah, you sound a little muffled
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.960]   Important audio is Instagram if somebody wants to pull up my Instagram
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.680]   I have a video with like half of my mask because I I'm an owner of like 23 masks
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.920]   Are you making them yourself?
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.360]   I mean, I'm not making them
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.440]   But I'm I'm getting them in these streets and good about the individuals that need them because I have some friends
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.960]   Issues and things like that and they can't hold an eye. Can I can I show you what I'm doing?
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.840]   I went out and I got a sewing machine
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.640]   Lisa did a little video of me at my sewing machine. I'll play it for you
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.400]   All right, so Leo has decided to start sewing
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.600]   Because he's going to make why is her voice better?
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.240]   Healthcare workers and people that need one
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:29.920]   We sound like
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:36.880]   Here because he doesn't know how to sew my mom's teaching me via Skype. This is gonna be a
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.520]   That is awesome
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.000]   Leo the bobbin the bobbin Leo
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.560]   Designing it yeah, but that's coming later
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.560]   I
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:08:00.000]   Something's going on there, but anyway you get the idea. I got it. I bought a sewing machine
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:06.160]   Now I am not making masks, but I think that one is very attractive. Did you get a friend to make that one? Oh, and or
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.440]   That's a nice look at that one. I actually ordered like a crap ton of them from
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:15.280]   Hawaii from a guy on edc because Hawaii's covid numbers are down
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.880]   I also buy things sourced in the proper areas
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.680]   When I'm buying things online. I look at where they come from
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.800]   Just because it doesn't make sense if you're buying stuff from a hot spot and a person making them
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:34.880]   Well, you can wash them. Here's a one here's a one mask master tick-tock everybody. Oh, there you go
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:44.400]   Wow
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.800]   You got a few of those
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:53.200]   Yeah, I know if you stay ready you ain't got to get ready uncle Leo if you stay ready you ain't got to get ready
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.960]   Using underwear and they just flip them around and so they use their underwear as making masks
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.720]   Seriously
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.720]   Clean the key phrase there was
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:09.360]   You clean them flip them around
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:16.080]   Uh, and then I saw this picture by the way. I have been following you on instagram. Is that you?
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.640]   That tazai holy cow thundercat as a young man, huh?
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:24.720]   That's grade 11th grade. Wow. You were uh, you were kind of ripped
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.120]   I was that's when I was wrestling. I wasn't like that was before I got hurt
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.280]   I got hurt my senior year and I had deteriorated this my back and I blew up like a whale
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.760]   And it was all downhill from there. Guess what?
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:41.600]   I still like chips and snacks and the gym still isn't my friend. That's okay. That's okay. We're all happy now
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:46.320]   I'm getting a lot of waitants in the I just realized for the first time like you always see ninjas on tv
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:51.920]   And you realize they can't dress like that because everybody would know they're in ninja and now finally they can dress like me again
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:57.680]   And we won't know that they're ninja. I actually think it's gonna be challenging because I think we're all gonna start wearing masks
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.160]   I wouldn't be surprised if we at least for the next year
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.800]   A lot of people wear masks for one thing. It's gonna break face recognition
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.800]   That's gonna be a hidden benefit
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:11.520]   Right there. There's a lot of my phone doesn't know who I am anymore. Yeah
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.360]   Not a bad thing. Don't they just think they'll do like they'll do i and gate analysis
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.600]   They'll just they'll use this part of the face geometry and figure out something because all they need is a triangle
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.120]   And we took away one point so they'll just figure out like oh your ear lobes now
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.200]   It's eyes and ear lobes and we're fine. Don't give me an idea. Your lobes are that diverse
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:33.280]   Look, I saw that I saw that toilet ID thing and apparently everything about humans are diverse
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.320]   Oh, that's just horrible. That's just horrible
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.360]   You see that we need for toilet
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:44.240]   Yes, I did. Uh, I've been trying to avoid this story for the last week
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.960]   This is even we're talking about it now
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:53.360]   Yeah, I guess I can't avoid it any longer. So it's a toilet that recognizes you from the wrong side
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.440]   Yes
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:03.440]   For medical purposes for medical purposes. Yeah, I've had apparently it also uh, I don't know ways and it analyzes
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.000]   your poop
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.160]   It'll it'll do stream analysis on urine and it will it will a lot has a neural network
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:13.440]   By doctor new meaning for stream analysis that I had not
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:20.880]   Anticipated on this show. Okay, and it's it's got a neural network trained by doctors to identify potential problems in in feces
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.200]   It's actually it's a Stanford thing. It's a great idea and in case this toilet
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:31.040]   It's not a patent. Yeah, it's not available yet. Why is it a terrible idea? Georgia
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.640]   Because we already have enough
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:41.120]   Biometrics that we're giving away to companies. Do we really need this last bit of privacy to all so don't know right?
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.360]   Georgia, that's the whole thing is that people don't report properly and this is going to do the reporting for you
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.160]   Could you imagine?
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.880]   Yes, the episode is inside the car. It's one of those. Yes. I oil it. Yeah
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:58.960]   We now have a CSI Las Vegas, New York or or uh, Miami, which one would it have it's got to be Miami, right?
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:04.240]   It probably Miami. No, I'm in I'm a caruso. I remember at CES this year
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.920]   There was a pod that you would get into and it would do all sorts of biometric stuff
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.960]   I think I didn't get in because I think you had to take off your clothes
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:18.480]   But I but which is of course as you know, I'm not adverse to but I at the time I thought maybe not a good idea
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:24.080]   and um it would do everything like blood pressure. I think it I think it did
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:30.320]   Fecal monitoring what did all sorts of stuff. This is if you think about it, Georgia, that's a great diagnostic
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:35.920]   It's an important diagnostic that I've been interested in being just
[00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.560]   It's gonna be misused. I don't know. I think like you can't
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.120]   Go to the cloud. This is a fun actually. This is a fundamental
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.880]   debate
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:51.840]   and uh if you're ever on twig Georgia you'll get in this with with uh jeff and stacy because
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:58.720]   There on the one jeff's point of view is look you don't ban the technology you regulate the use of the data
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.600]   You can't just say well, we're not going to have voice assistance. We're not going to have poop recognition
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:06.000]   Because it might be misused
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.880]   You have because those are so valuable. It's like saying well, let's not have the internet that might be misused
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:16.960]   But what would we do today? Oh, I want to stuck at home without the internet. So I think the idea is not banned the technology
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.960]   but but regulate the
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.640]   The status smog that comes off of it. I was watching Jordan's video on it
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.760]   And they said that like she said that even before these neural networks
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.400]   It was an artist. I forget if it was the one of all the droopy clock paintings and i'm blanking on dale
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.560]   Salvador dale dale yeah dale had identified 45 different
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:40.480]   Patterns for human bums for recognition already and and he said they were even unique amongst twins
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.640]   So apparently humanity has been investigating this
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:49.360]   Believe Salvador dale was an expert in bum finger printing. Well, there's that company that does the thing
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.080]   There's there's the company where you send in
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:57.120]   They send you a box you poop in the tube you send it back box back to them overnight
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.520]   And they tell you if you have cancer or something like that
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:04.320]   So they they check your fecal matter something like that and it's absolutely very popular with older people
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:09.680]   It's insanely popular that people use that service as a screening process my doctor
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:14.720]   They'll tmi here, but i'll do it anyway because it's important as you get when you get past a certain age
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:21.680]   You have to worry about especially men you have to worry about prostate cancer and there is there's a psa test
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.920]   Actually, this isn't prostate cancer. This is for
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.800]   colorectal cancer
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.800]   uh, there's a test
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.440]   uh
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:35.120]   That involves sending a little bit of poop into your doctor and I do that every year my doctor sends me
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.560]   It's called fit
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.360]   And then he sends me a fit kit and I send it in and there's yeah, you're right
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:43.360]   There's a commercial company doing this, but if your doctor is good that this is part of the screening
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.560]   I was thinking of prostate they do a psa screening that's a blood test
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:53.840]   So this is these are very valuable tools in in diagnosing this these cancers or this these problems early
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:59.440]   I don't think there's anything wrong with that now, but i'll let's get off of poop
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:03.920]   Unless you have a final word if you have a final word
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:09.200]   I'm good. I'm gonna let it. I'm gonna let it go. It's important
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.720]   important
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.480]   Well now that I want whatever that is you're wearing that looks like
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.360]   You could see nerve tux arm trooper
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:21.120]   See I have that mask too. I don't play around and waste valuable breasts with that
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:25.600]   That's my in case of emergency brake mask. I use that's a biohazard mask
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:31.200]   I have a full face shield mask too, but I don't wear those unless I actually have to are we supposed to research?
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.480]   Bubbles that go with it
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.600]   Really? Yeah, set up if need be where did you get that?
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.480]   Um
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.480]   So we ordered them
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:49.120]   Right before it kind of hit because it their painters masks and this one I believe is n99
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.680]   I think in 98. Can you breathe easily?
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:56.960]   You can breathe in it it breathes right through the filter, but you can't even smell cooking and it'll last for a month
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.720]   um
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:03.120]   in like not if you're like using some sort of like, you know fumes like your
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.280]   Spray painting or something than it won't but it'll it'll last for a month
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:13.520]   So we keep that all set up and yes, I'm I'm with you. Oh doctor in case of things get really bad
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.040]   You know, you have to go to the hospital. We we hook up
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:21.200]   We hook up that we got it on amazon beforehand, but you can usually get it a hardware store
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.000]   There's painters masks or construction masks
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.840]   We were talking about this the last time I was on I'm back on we were
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:33.360]   I remember uncle here we're talking about this and I told you I have the full respirator mask and people were laughing at me and I look at everybody
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.360]   Yeah, boy
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.560]   It's true. Yeah
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.960]   It's just you want to be safe. You want to be careful. You want to be safe
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.760]   I think it's enough to wear it. Not enough, but it's
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.560]   sufficient to wear a cloth mask
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.280]   It's better to wear cloth mask
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:52.560]   I
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:58.320]   It depends on what you're doing, right? It depends on where you're going and what you're doing and you might as well be safe
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.400]   Would you shave your beard off all in if you had to to get a better seal?
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:07.360]   My beard is my beard. Last time you saw it was blue and it was huge. Yeah, I took
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:12.240]   you down in case of um in case of emergency I got it to shave it down real quick as easy
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.720]   But I did take my beard all the way off for the most part
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.600]   And as george has said like if you
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.000]   Let's say you got hurt and you had to go to the hospital
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.440]   That's what I would wear to go to the hospital
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.160]   I wear these around town going to grocery store so like that
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.520]   But if I had to go to the hospital for something or someone was going down I'd wear that
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.120]   and feel safer about my situation than just
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.600]   These paper masks like I have as everywhere. I just this one was going on
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.960]   That's like is that's a surgical mask. Those are very good though apparently
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:42.560]   Leo if you go to instagram slash rene richy, you can see what I look like outside
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.960]   I don't it's not for the squeamish
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.200]   Are you in trash bags? I hope you're in trash bags
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:52.080]   No, I should though. Oh no, I should actually get an encounter suit like the voralon's war in babylon 5
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.280]   I think that's my next this is good. That's a good outfit. Yeah
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.200]   attractive
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.600]   I feel like cobra commander one like we're all we're all like like ninja like
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.120]   Drones and now out there. Do you think we're overreacting?
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:10.080]   The best part of wearing the mask though is that everyone else also stays away from you. Yeah, right
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.680]   My husband had to go to a hospital and he wore the full
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:18.240]   Full suit mask with the goggles, but everyone else also stayed away from him
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:22.960]   He was kind of looked like a stormtrooper sometimes I feel like maybe we're overreacting
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.680]   So let me tell you about what we're reacting
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.640]   underreacting if if if from the beginning
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:34.560]   A regular thin mask or anything to cover your mouth isn't going to stop you from catching the virus
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:38.560]   But what it does do is minimize is your spray out. So if they would have said from the beginning
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.880]   Hey, everybody just cover your face would have been better
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.960]   We would have cut down on people giving it to other people you're still not gonna stop it
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.760]   But wearing something like this also cuts down on your viral load
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.440]   You know sometimes your kid comes home
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:54.160]   They got the flu or the cold and they're dying inside and then you get it and you're like, it's not that bad
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:58.480]   Because you got a secondary wind of it that was that was watered down in a sense
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.960]   So this helps you water that down. It's not overkill. This is something that we should have been doing from the get-go
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.320]   It's not that big inconvenience when you're out in the streets to wear this
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.480]   The problem I have is that if you're black
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.760]   People are cops are filing people in the stores and not letting them go into stores
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.920]   Is that ridiculous because you can't wear a mask because you're that's so ridiculous
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.920]   Because i'm black it's just the extra thing i have to worry about
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:22.160]   So that's my only issue with it, but otherwise. Oh, I also had someone
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.120]   racially accost me
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.160]   last week
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:32.400]   And he would have never said he was behind us because he was a mask and and glasses and a hoodie
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.320]   Like he was just using the end word
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.720]   I know my heart if you could if I could have saw his face
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:41.840]   He would have never spoke to me like that. So you know the good and bad about wearing masks xk
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.320]   cd
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:50.160]   On the matter. Yeah homemade mask, huh? You think they help? I've read so many conflicting things
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.560]   uh, well
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.000]   What I was doing before was carrying around a big sign that said quote
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.960]   There's a pandemic so please give me space because I don't want to get sick or make anyone else sick
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.760]   Problem was I had to write small
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:09.760]   To so small to fit so people kept walking closer to read it. Oops. Yeah, the mask gets it across better
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.760]   True
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.400]   It's true
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:18.560]   They were also saying that when you're outside if people are exercising like at a high level like if they're biking or or running or jogging
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.720]   The area of dispersal for them is much bigger. So you have to give them even more space and
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.480]   So the more you could do to protect yourself protect your fellow humans
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.320]   It's just it's it's it's polite, but it's also in the best interest of us surviving
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:35.600]   So I want to get back to this issue of do you ban the technology or do you regulate?
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.040]   The side effects and this is tied in also to covet because
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.720]   uh one of the things that we're going to need to do when the
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.840]   uh quarantine ends is
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:51.520]   Unless we want to go back into quarantine again and again and again is keep track of any
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.000]   emergent cases and
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.600]   Everybody they've been in contact with quarantine them that's containment versus quarantine you contain
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:03.840]   The potentially infected people so that the rest of us can go about our business
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.920]   That's going to take and in china. They're doing it, but they're doing it in an evasive way
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:14.000]   They're forcing people to create it and create too. They're putting apps on phones at this week apple and google announced
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.040]   They're going to do a privacy forward voluntary
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:28.880]   Version so this is a coronavirus tracking system that will be available mid months next month on ios and android
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:35.520]   It's kind of an interesting idea. In fact, this probably this document from apple and google is the
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:41.760]   Best way to describe it you have on your phone something called bluetooth l-e all modern phones have it
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:49.840]   It's not the bluetooth you used to pair to headphones, but a lightweight low energy version of it that does the pairing automatically behind the scenes
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:54.640]   So bluetooth l-e is on you are given each day a unique identifier
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:22:00.720]   And whenever you come near somebody else's bluetooth l-e phone you beacon out
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:09.440]   Your unique daily identifier to them not associated with your personality. It's not there's no person identifiable information exchanged
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:14.880]   So here's the example allis and bob meet each other for the first time and have a 10-minute conversation
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.840]   then
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:23.440]   During that in the background their phones are exchanging their identifier beacons this daily
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:29.680]   Actually, there's two there's the personal identifier that's daily and then there's a 15-minute beacon generated every 15 minutes
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:35.520]   And that's so you can i guess so you can know what time they met a few days later bob
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.080]   Is diagnosed positively for covid
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:44.480]   He voluntarily all this is voluntary you have to have the app you have to voluntarily say i'm going to do this
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:46.720]   enters the test result
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:51.680]   In the app by the way the app's not from google or from apple they are publishing an api that
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.200]   Health authorities can use so you'll feel a little bit better about it, right?
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:02.800]   You won't come from google or apple with bob's consent notice again more consent his phone uploads the last 14 days of keys
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.280]   of people he's run into
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.760]   Of people he's run into and then they can be notified
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.720]   to go into quarantine themselves
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.040]   this seems like
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:19.680]   A good plan with some potential flaws the biggest flaw is it's voluntary
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:23.520]   Georgia is this doesn't bother you right?
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:29.120]   It does bother me. Yeah, no, it bothers me. It bothers me one is that well
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:34.640]   Okay, so one is that if it's voluntary then it's not going to work because the people one is we're lazy
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.840]   We're not going to volunteer information if you're planning to go to party
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:42.800]   You're not going to want to tell people so people are still going to do what they do because we're
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.440]   You know inept by nature
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:52.240]   The second thing is that it's just one more slip away from our own feelings of privacy once we're comfortable with governments tracking us
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:58.720]   We will be more comfortable with governments tracking us and they're not going to give back information afterwards. So it's that kind of comfort level
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:04.640]   Um, the third part to this is that it's kind of too late, right? It's everywhere already
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.400]   They should if they had enacted this in December or even January
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:14.640]   They could have really done a really great job with people quarantine isolation, you know
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:18.720]   Being able to get we missed that we missed the initial opportunity to contain
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:25.200]   Now all we're doing is giving up our information for truly nothing maybe the second wave perhaps
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.240]   Well, that's the idea. So Georgia the theory is if we all
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:33.200]   Shelter in place as willy the whole world is doing right now at some point the virus
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:38.960]   Activity will will go down you can't it doesn't live independently of humans
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:44.560]   So if nobody has it in let's say this small area it does live independently of humans though, right?
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:50.880]   Like it can be kept in animals, right? We think maybe that's all right. It could be it could be it could be it doesn't
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:58.720]   Yeah, the cat can't give it to you, but let's say you ate a pangolin for breakfast. Yeah, maybe then so but presuming that
[00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.680]   Okay, it's mostly
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.680]   It goes away. Okay
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.040]   But what happens is people come and go
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:12.160]   So we could say, you know, there's very there's either no or very few cases in Sonoma county
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:17.600]   Everybody you can go outside, but what we need to do is keep an eye out if somebody gets sick
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.960]   We immediately need to trace all their contacts and quarantine them so that we don't all have to be quarantined
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.280]   It's for down the road
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.840]   The problem with that is that people aren't getting tested
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:33.840]   So they will they will they will matter. There's not yes. This is all presuming that testing becomes widespread and
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.880]   Right. We're giving away our privacy for a system that
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:41.200]   We're not giving away your privacy. It's no personally identifiable information
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:45.040]   It makes people comfortable with being personally tracked
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:50.080]   What happens during any sort of issue where we feel really scared and fearful?
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:54.400]   The government kind of goes for this power grab it happens. It happens in all kind of
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.960]   authoritarian governments. It's just never happened
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:01.280]   Never it did and do they ever give it back after?
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.080]   Yes
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:09.760]   Me your concern is that this will just be a slippery slope the government will then use this
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:14.720]   It makes people comfortable with being tracked and people will give it away and think that this is good and then after
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:20.400]   You know, we'll be more comfortable with the next little step that goes into the next way and it doesn't really help
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:26.080]   Prevent us from being sick like if people aren't being tested then what does this even matter?
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.480]   And they're not none of people are being tested
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:34.560]   And that's the first thing that they should be dealing with if they really wanted to stop the spread everyone would get tested. Oh and JJ Stone
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:40.400]   I commend you on kulia with your spirit of trusting things first of four of us
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:47.440]   Tell them that they're not collecting any data and they're not somebody could flip a switch and do anything that they want to do and there's bad apples
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:51.360]   And do things all the time so when you say that with such impunity it makes me giggle
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:56.640]   So I understand that you have a hopeful heart and you think that things are gonna be helpful the way they are but they're not secondly
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.080]   so
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.600]   people right now
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.000]   Granted if testing is available and they're getting tests
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.800]   But if somebody has a symptom and they just have a cold and they're just oh quarantine yourself
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:12.480]   Next thing no quarantine yourself and that number could get routed off really quick without somebody even getting checked on and you say
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:17.200]   If tests are available, but they're not and so the system again as she said is too late
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.040]   So what is it something to do just something to put more tracking things on my phone?
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:25.200]   I already got to worry about tick-tock and my daughter I hear shaking and dancing every three seconds
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.560]   But now you want me to put low LTE and tell me that it's no big deal
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:34.560]   There's no reason for this because it's not going to help us and and unless they're going to come around and round people up in patty wag is to say
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:38.800]   Oh, well, we just got a hit that you saw Susie on Tuesday and she might be sick
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:42.560]   And now you got to get quarantine. Oh leave your house because you got six kids. Come on. What else?
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.880]   We're gonna put you in the truck when everybody else who might be sick
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:48.480]   I don't know what this is gonna do and it's too late. I'm glad they're kombai together
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.560]   But what's it gonna do for me?
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.040]   Side effect. Oh, yeah, no, there's a side effect of this too
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.080]   What do you think there's a there's a side effect of this too?
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:00.800]   And that is you know some people for security and privacy reasons don't like to leave bluetooth leon
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.160]   I mean the companies want us to it makes our lives easier. It makes your air pods work
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.840]   Makes your apple pencil work makes it you know, it makes a lot of things just work
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:12.000]   But we've seen before the companies, you know, everything not that we go to stores anymore
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.240]   But when we did they would use bluetooth beacons to try to see where we're going within shopping malls
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:18.800]   They would try to use them just to maintain, you know proxy
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:25.200]   Proxy beacons for us and this to george's point it does get people used to broadcasting bluetooth le
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:30.720]   Is designed to continuously pulse outwards so that it can it can tell identify that there's something there
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.920]   And then negotiate a handshake if it needs to to establish a connection
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:37.840]   But we're just going out there pinging. It's like all of us are hot and all of us are on all of a sudden
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.160]   And I do think that this is a noble endeavor
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.320]   I think this is something that is meant to do good
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.320]   But it's always it's always those things which is how it starts
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:50.320]   And I'm not saying don't do this. Obviously some societies have had a lot of like korea again
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.880]   It's crushing it by doing things like this
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:59.120]   But that we should definitely have these conversations and we should be well aware of what it costs us to get this
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:05.840]   And we should always always put in hard limitations for when they have to come back and beg us to turn it back on again
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:10.880]   Is korea what what what kind of leadership is korea under they're democratic?
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.360]   Okay, they're a little corrupt
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.280]   They've had some problems. I mean who isn't these days, right?
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:19.920]   Who isn't yeah, and it's also a lot smaller too. So it's them doing it is like asking
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.720]   California to do it, right
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:28.720]   But they were prepared like they they believed the corona virus was coming they had the first person who got in got a test for it
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.600]   Like they saw this coming and they were ready day one with an entire plan to handle it
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:40.480]   Right away. Yeah, they did mass testing quarantine isolation. They took care of it
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.680]   I agree. They're not having parties on the beach. No, I agree
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.240]   Georgia
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.800]   We would need to this would none of this would work unless you had
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:50.240]   Widespread widely available testing and that's not a situation
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:56.000]   It seemed disingenuous that they're like, oh, this is really important. This is gonna protect us from this is what they can do
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   For down the road. What is the alternative?
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:03.520]   The alternative is set up ramp up testing so that everyone gets tested. We have drive-through testing
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.520]   Sites where you can now again, it should be to everyone right now
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:13.360]   It's just to if you show any symptoms or you've had contact with someone else you drive through they do a little nose swab
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:20.880]   They find out right away and you know whether you know, how safe you need to be what about your family and then we can track it from there
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:26.320]   Now we need to ramp up the amount of people that are being done. I think that we're trying to get to 10,000 a day
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:31.040]   So presuming that we get so presuming that we get testing working now. Dr
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:35.520]   Mom says there's another form of containment it's all called circle containment where you don't need to know
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:40.720]   Proximity you just this is a little more draconian. You just say okay. This guy's got it
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.640]   Within a 50 mile radius you all gonna stay home
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:48.000]   But it's better than having everybody stay home. See the issue is
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.400]   Do you want to do this what we're doing right now for another year until there's a vaccine
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.520]   Yes, I don't think we
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:02.320]   Because we're gonna do we have to I don't think that we have a choice though. Well, this isn't going to go on for another year
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.680]   It's not
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.680]   At some point
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.680]   They have
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:13.600]   Like we may have still like systems in place that are going to be restricted and they've already just
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:18.560]   Pervatian period is so long is the problem. It's not like you don't get you don't get sick very quickly
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.640]   It takes up to it was a two weeks
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:25.760]   And even before you get that signal like the someone sends you that token back saying oh
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.200]   I now have the corona and your phone goes. Oh, you met someone as a corona
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:34.400]   It was two weeks ago who have you had like I can just see this thing lighting up like the end of war games
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.880]   In the movie where just everything
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:41.040]   Or for the game pandemic the game
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:48.160]   Yeah, we're all gonna get it like odds are most of us are gonna get this it's about flattening the curve so that
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:53.440]   All of our medical professionals the hospitals are not overrun with people getting it all at the same time
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.640]   So you want to get it over a longer period of time
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.560]   So and then in a year we're going to be able to go out. What's going to happen before?
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:04.400]   What's going to happen? Oh, and if if this containment goes on
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:10.960]   For a year so as it's been stated repeatedly and I stated again for the record my love for Georgia is
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:16.240]   And an elite high and her and as our other guest competitors another Canadian
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:16.960]   I will
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:21.760]   Exume you two from this conversation for one second because you guys live in a real country
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:25.280]   Where people take care of you here it is the hunger
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:30.160]   Okay, yeah, we have $12 for six months people have lost their jobs
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.200]   We're going to be losing their homes people's credit is going to be going through the floor
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.800]   And if you think that you could contain this country for a minimum
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:42.240]   Of at least three more months like this without them burning down the gates and storming everything and setting around the fire
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.720]   You're insane people are going to be breaking into people's homes
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:50.240]   They're not going to be able to live or afford to do anything on a plumber's gonna run out because we have a corrupt system that
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.240]   Won't just take care of people. So I
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:59.120]   Good luck. That's a very dystopian point of view you have but it's a factual point of view people right now
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.720]   are
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:06.960]   Struggling i friends in New York that literally are trying to move back home with their parents because they don't know what they're going to do
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:13.840]   And their credit is going to be destroyed because they can't afford that crazy apartment with their three roommates and the rent
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:19.280]   Because i recognize i absolutely understand what you're saying there is a horror
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:26.000]   Showcoming uh economically, but wouldn't it be even a worse horror show if everybody just said i'll screw it
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   Let's uh, let's all go out
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.240]   Well again, we have mass graves now too, right?
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.040]   I guess it's only a horror show for people my age and older
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:35.600]   And not not only that
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.080]   People are dying all up and down the spectrum
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:42.000]   Obviously people with underlying conditions and older people are higher on their spectrum
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.480]   But again when a met we are a service country. We don't make anything anymore
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:50.480]   So if you tell me that restaurants and bars and shops are closed
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:56.960]   People cannot make a living and so they and unemployment isn't going to pay for the lifestyle that most working americans live
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:00.960]   So what happens after three or four months when people's reserves?
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:06.880]   Their spending their lights get cut off. They have children have food. I mean i'm just saying i've watched every zombie movie possible
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:13.920]   This is like a slow-roll zombie movie, but sure enough if things don't change people are going to start burning things down
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:22.800]   What should happen? But what happens what happens if instead of having a trillion dollar bailout for large businesses and companies?
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:28.320]   We actually took care of the people and they were given bailouts so that they could stay home
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:34.800]   Safely and then after we figure out a vaccine that works and does not turn us actually into the zombie apocalypse
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.200]   Then we can deal with this after like
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.840]   Andrew yang must be laughing right now
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:43.440]   You're saying we need a universal basic income for the next 12 months
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   I do
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.640]   In Canada and i'm not saying again
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:51.280]   Like I know that we have very differing
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:56.080]   You know systems right now, but it took like you get your money in three days
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:01.040]   Everyone gets taken care of we stay home. We don't have to worry about people robbing stealing
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.440]   starving to death because
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:09.200]   You are all taken care of so then we don't have to worry about the amount of money that we would have to throw into the infrastructure
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:15.120]   The amount of people that are dying the doctors the people that are getting sick the people that can't work
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:20.800]   That works out. Yeah, there's another alternative by the way. Why you pay taxes in the first place
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.800]   There's another alternative by the way, if you're not
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:27.520]   Are you gonna say extinction? No china china seems to have solved this
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:33.760]   By being an authoritarian nation and saying no too bad about your privacy concerns. You will do this
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:37.200]   We also don't know what they are reporting is likely
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.200]   Believe
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.200]   Doors
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:45.360]   I believe it they come drop you off food like they they do anything you want to I mean again
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.200]   Believe it or not believe it
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:51.840]   You got to take some of that with a grain of salt because they are dictatorship what you let off with they could do what they want
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.800]   They run their own media
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:57.360]   It's just like russia for the longest time people like russia doesn't have anything because if you're on the media russia
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.640]   And you say something they don't want you to say you're dead. It's not like you get fired
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.720]   They just kill you replace with another blam bar
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:09.360]   You think it's so you think it's as bad in china now as it is in the rest of the world the Soviet Union had no serial killers until the Soviet Union fell
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:12.480]   And then we found out they had a huge amount of cereal. It was very common. Yeah
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:16.720]   Oh, yeah, I mean look I you know these are all
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:23.840]   fantasy scenarios we don't really know what's gonna happen really fantasy scenarios are they like there's countries that are already doing this there's
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:27.120]   Countries that do it better than Canada's doing it too. I'm not saying go with Canada
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.320]   I just happen to be here
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:36.160]   So I know firsthand how this one's working freezing rents and mortgages and car payments and things like that like we
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:40.640]   By the time it seems like we react to everything here is too late
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:45.760]   So we already have things that that cascade and go down in a snowball effect. So
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.480]   Will we burn down the gates?
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.640]   Probably not because we're going to have stop gaps
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:54.240]   But those stop gaps are going to come late and so many people are going to suffer because of it
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.600]   So they're talking about
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:37:00.880]   You should point out that the last time China had a revolution they rolled tanks in Tiananmen Square
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.880]   And they killed an awful lot of people
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:06.000]   I just feel bad that America spends so much money and doesn't get a lot of like
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.680]   It actually hurts when you spend so much money and then you don't get like as much stuff
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:15.520]   As anyone who spends much less money. Yes, buddy. We get freedom. We get freedom
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:23.440]   You get to say you have freedom. We got freedom fries. Belgium has freedom. We have like 276 states
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.960]   247. I'm going back to the google apple thing
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.960]   So, okay
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:33.520]   There are issues with it moxie marlin spike actually weighed in with a uh tweet stream
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:38.240]   Moxie, of course the creator of the open whisper systems the signal protocol
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:42.800]   He's a security researcher and his first take was let's look at this from a
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:46.400]   Security point of view. He described in his tweets how it works
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:49.200]   and um
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.920]   He says i'll i'll kind of go through some of his points
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.440]   uh
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:59.520]   Published keys are 16 bytes one for each day
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:03.600]   If a moderate number of smartphone users are infected in any given week
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:08.160]   That's hundreds of megabytes for all phones to download that seems untenable
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:14.240]   Uh, it seems like some kind of personally identifiable information would have to be confined
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:18.240]   With what the device framework gives you admittedly the device framework is anonymous
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:22.320]   But how are you going to figure out where to go to say quarantine yourself?
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:28.400]   He says keys published by a device have to be turned in turn published to all devices
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:34.560]   That's a major denial of service vector because if anyone can anonymously blast keys they can create a situation
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:40.000]   Where there's gigabytes of data for all devices in the world to retrieve and compute in other words
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.720]   He'd take every cell phone offline for a significant period of time
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:48.320]   Not to mention the prank aspect to be able to light up everybody
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:54.400]   You've been near as devices with you've been exposed to covid without them knowing you're the culprit
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.560]   You just say you've tested positive, right?
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.560]   Aside from this
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:04.880]   The apis are novel in terms of what becomes possible from the app layer. I'm not super optimistic about opt-in contact tracing
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:10.560]   Becoming a major factor, but I do anticipate someone will end up using this for some other interesting thing
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:13.360]   Uh, his subtext is ad tech
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.280]   We'll probably use this because it's a clever idea. So are the tech companies
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:23.600]   I mean they're trying to do the best they can this is google and apple trying to do the right thing
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:28.960]   And I it's all they can do they're a software company. They have to their own response can be software. Well, I mean
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:32.960]   Tim cook has donated what 20 million masks. I mean
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:37.840]   They've they've started designing and building their own face protection for hospital workers
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:42.640]   They're doing what they can and lights a that's not massive mass on the market. Yeah
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.480]   It's beautifully designed. It's very easy to fold flat. There's lots of it
[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:51.520]   Now I want to talk about the the other apocalyptic theory where corporations take over because governments have abdicated their
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:57.840]   Responsibility to citizens and we'll end up being like the the tv show millennium or continuum or all of the or like what's happening in
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:03.920]   So oddly where the mafia is giving food to keep us because the government isn't if I look at all the scenarios you've laid out
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:08.000]   So oh and says he's don't revolution. Okay
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.440]   Georgia says oh forget it
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:16.080]   Because it's a privacy invasion and we're having there's no way to test anyway
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:19.280]   Renee says move to Canada. Oh, sorry. You can't
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:25.440]   It looks like the apple google thing seems like admittedly there's flaws, but isn't this
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:31.280]   The only reasonable it's a good tool. It's better than nothing better than your guy scenario
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:34.560]   No, it's literally sign phoned what you just said is sign phoned
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:40.960]   It's a story about nothing because it doesn't matter because it's opt in and we don't have the testing for it
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:44.640]   So it's cool and it sounds great cookies too. You go ahead and make it
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:50.320]   Thanks for coming together and doing something great. I appreciate it. Check back with the money months and let you
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:53.280]   I will thumbs up. I was waiting for the double thumbs up
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:57.840]   Good job. You guys you guys
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:01.280]   You guys are good. Hang on for a sec. We're gonna take a little break
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.760]   Uh, Georgia Dow
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:07.520]   Is causing great anxiety. Thank god. You could email her
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:13.280]   Or go to her anxiety - videos calm and download some very relaxing
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:19.840]   And informative videos to calm your nerves. Do you do you do anything for quarantine specifically?
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:27.120]   I do Skype sessions. So I we do phone and Skype sessions and most of my people do it that way, which is nice
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:28.800]   It's actually in some ways
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.800]   Confering because you don't have to leave so yeah
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:37.440]   Uh, oh and JJ stone. Oh doctor. We call him. He's not a doctor, but he plays one on tv
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.840]   I'm just here to eat up uncle eels hopes
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:45.200]   A little bit a little bit of kind of hope glad he's got a job
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.160]   More good your work
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.160]   Go ahead and appreciate that
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:53.040]   You eat the hopes and dreams
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:57.360]   He started off with with Hamilton and now he's going on that was the appetizer
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:03.280]   Am I gonna be like in the dumps at the end of this show? You're gonna have no anything uplifting to say. Oh and yes
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.480]   Oh, I definitely uplifted something you're not in the show it uplifting all the time
[00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:12.000]   I'm here for reality uncle. Yeah, reality is what you bring and you live in the bubble zone
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   You're semi protected up in your in your cows and grass fed part of california
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.800]   I ought to get a shotgun at least
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:24.320]   I'm in New Jersey, bro. I'm in the fire pits. Okay. New York is raining down upon me every day
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:29.920]   I'd check the stats bro. So I got time for hopes and dreams. I got reality out here. Okay, I got this
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:34.000]   What do you think your life barbecue sauce on hopes and dreams leo?
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   Campable barbecue sauce on hopes and dreams
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.080]   And uh and rene richy who is like me an optimist
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:45.520]   Yes, I don't believe that cynicism is intelligently. Oh, I don't believe negativity is honesty
[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.640]   I believe that we can uplift ourselves and at least we'll dice my life
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.240]   I'm not too little good orange
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:59.600]   This is nintendo in honor of uh fun and games
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:00.640]   Let's take a little break
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:04.320]   You know, i'm so mad because my son has the nintendo switch and I can't play animal crossing
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:08.720]   He won't let me have it. He says oh no you got to play that game all day every day
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.440]   You got to monitor your village and your people and all that stuff
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:16.400]   You can't lick it and goes oh infected you can have you can't have my switch. I'll never get it back
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.760]   He says no
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:22.160]   But I want to buy them right now. So no I know but I have one but it's michaels
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.320]   Now he's like a cap mine
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:28.000]   I don't know how to do whatever. I bought it. I had it was for me and I bought it and I bought
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.480]   Breaking wind and all that stuff for whatever it is follow the zelda wind or whatever
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:36.480]   Breaking wind that's a diff. I think that's the wrong kind of game. They're calling
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:40.400]   What's the zelda zelda the wind maker call of the
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:43.600]   Call of the wind
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:49.440]   Call of the wind that's no better. It's the same. It's what I just said the wind calls me. I hear it
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:52.000]   Uh, thanks. Thanks here. Yeah
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.240]   Breath of the wild breath of the wild breath of the wild that's the same
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:44:02.320]   It's in the story. Oh, there's peppermint cinnamon and breath of the wild breaking wind is a different thing
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:05.840]   It's a different type of game. That's breaking that's breaking bad. Georgia. You're thinking of breaking bad
[00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.480]   Let's get into paying these bills uncle leo. Thank you
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:15.120]   I want to talk about a way to make your air cleaner and better the molecule molecules an amazing device
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.000]   We have mall over the place and how at home and here in the studio
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:25.200]   Because molecule does something really interesting now. I I know there are people who are saying in other places
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:32.240]   Oh, no, no, no, but they aren't testing the pico capabilities the photo electrical chemical oxidation
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:35.120]   Because it's oh we can't it's too expensive
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:40.960]   Let me tell you if you go to molecules website and read the white papers a really interesting test from the berkeley
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:45.280]   Labs and the government labs department of energy run labs at the
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:52.240]   Lawrence liver more labs at berkeley. They tested the molecule and they tested their pico claims pico
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:59.920]   Uses breakthrough science to break down viruses and pollutants things like volatile organic chemicals on a molecular level
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.080]   It traps them and destroys them
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:06.160]   With ultraviolet light. It's really incredible
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:12.240]   It actually makes your air better because it destroys indoor air pollutants at a molecular level
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:16.560]   The universe they've have tests and you'll see these white papers on their website from the university
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:22.480]   administered a particle calibration lab and intertech and nationally recognized lab and now the new one from the
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:27.680]   Berkeley labs particles as long as zero as small as 0.1 microns
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:34.560]   100 nanometers were removed by the molecule air in the air mini during the 25 minute test duration
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:40.560]   The particle capture of larger particles dropped from about 3,500 to 600 less than 25 minutes
[00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:45.920]   The science speaks the molecule works, but it's more than just a science. It's my own personal
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:51.920]   Experience. I know that's anecdotal, but I'll tell you I know when the molecule's been turned off or unplugged
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:57.520]   Uh, Lisa does too. She wakes up. She's I got a headache check the molecule. Oh, Michael unplugged it
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:05.760]   Molecules technology been tested by science tested by real people and it's given allergy and asthma sufferers around the country and all new experiences
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:12.080]   A bad time for allergies right now in petaluma. It's awful, but thanks to the molecule we sleep better
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:16.880]   Molecule provides air purification for the whole home across a range of products
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:21.680]   Whether it's the molecule air for large rooms the molecule air mini for smaller rooms
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:28.400]   You could choose the unit that's best for your space or put together a bundle that provides air purification for your entire area
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:31.920]   And if you are in a sealed office, this is a must-have
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:39.200]   A must-have 10 percent off your first order right now. Go to molecule.com mole k u le
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:45.200]   Dot com the offer code is twit 10 for 10 off molecule.com
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:54.640]   Twit 10 it really works. It's really a remarkable technology. It's not a HEPA filter. It's better molecule dot com offer code is twit
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:57.360]   10
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.520]   O and jj stone
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.640]   mr. Oh, dr
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:08.640]   I've known you for a long time. I've always seen you as an honest a deep powerful man
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:11.760]   Mostly powerful
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:14.960]   Would you he's muted your are you there?
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:18.160]   Is it me it was us
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:24.000]   Are you as you yeah? Oh, yeah, there you hear me. There's the okay. There's the powerful mute man
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.520]   Would you use zoom for your next video conference? What zoom?
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.160]   I
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:34.640]   Down with you
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:36.800]   I've never used it. I won't use it
[00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:43.280]   I just spoke to my daughter about it and the trash that a child explained to me how trash it is
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:47.600]   I definitely won't be using it for school and her first
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:54.160]   Plug raising inches back. We're doing video now. I have three episodes in the can you guys could check it out
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.640]   But I actually checked on my child because I'm a horrible parent
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:59.440]   And she gets pretty much a's and b so I don't I rask her about school or care
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:03.360]   But I said the other day on the show I said so what's this zoom thing like she's like
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:10.160]   Well, we're in the classroom with the other kids and kids have dogs going on in the background or siblings running around crazy
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.720]   And then it takes over when the teachers trying to talk to us
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:16.720]   So I can't ever understand or hear what the teachers saying and I'm like why don't they hit mute?
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:18.960]   She's like I hit mute when the teacher speaking
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:22.240]   But other kids don't know how to use computers and they don't know to do that
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:25.920]   So the teachers talking then you can't hear the teacher teachers talking to you care to teacher
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   And I'm like that's ridiculous
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.280]   Well, you're not alone the New York City schools ban zoom a google ban zoom of course
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.600]   They have a competing product called google meet yeah
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:39.280]   SpaceX and nasa won't use them because it's insecure
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:47.680]   George you do you zoom for your psychotherapy? You skype you said I don't I try to use face time
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:52.880]   Or we do skype or we do phone calls and and skype I would rather do face time than not
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:58.080]   Interestingly enough though, um the order of psychology in kabek is using zoom
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:02.880]   So I'm like when when I'm being audited, which is happening yay a lot of fun
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:05.680]   Um, they're gonna be doing it through zoom and i'm like
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:09.440]   I'm gonna be having a chat with them at the end of the audit so that i'm done
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:15.840]   And i want to worry about annoying them how this is really an unsafe system to be able to use to talk to all the different therapists
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:22.240]   Um, so yeah kind of interesting i'd rather not but there's there's not many options for things that work really well
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:26.080]   zoom is really easy to use and so I think because of that
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:33.600]   It takes over because there's not a competing product that is as simple to be able to you just send a link you go in and you're there
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:38.080]   I think it's possible to use zoom you got to teach people to move for instance
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:42.480]   Uh, you got to set up the settings so the people's can't zoom bomb
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:47.200]   Admittedly zoom had problems. I was encouraged because this week alex stamos
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:52.480]   Who uh, I consider to be a top notch security guy. He was security yahoo
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:57.360]   Left when he found out the yahoo been hacked, but the boss didn't tell him
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:03.040]   He was security at facebook left seems like he's here. He's present a lot of
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:06.320]   Car wrecks he left when they found out about kamber janilitica
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:08.800]   But I think he's really widely considered to be really good
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:13.520]   He goes to hell and then leaves when he when they won't let him yeah because he wants to make it safe
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:17.920]   He says I got a phone call from eric uon zooms founder and ceo
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:25.040]   This was last week after zoom, you know zoom went from 20 million daily active users in december to 200 million in march
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:31.760]   And so insane. They were a business product and they were optimized for ease of use. They weren't optimized for security
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:36.560]   I would argue that they were they were optimized for growth hacking and not optimized for security or privacy
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:39.440]   Yeah, they wanted to be as easily adopted as possible as fast as possible
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:43.520]   You and I on mac break weekly some months ago talked about the really nasty
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:47.360]   flaw that zoom introduced on mac and tush is because
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:53.200]   When zoom was installed on mac it opened up a web browser created a web browser with an open port
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:58.000]   Uh, the idea was it makes it easy the next time you're in a zoom meeting even if you uninstall it
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.520]   You just click a link and zoom will download and run so it was about ease of use or maybe growth hacking
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:09.280]   But they didn't they were told about it. They didn't remove it apple actually had a send out a push out of patch to fix it
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:11.760]   So that's nasty
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:16.400]   They're in the end encryption. They're like, oh, we're into end encrypted inside zoom, but that's that's not end to end
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:18.400]   That's too fast. It's a little folks
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:23.280]   Yeah, we can see what you but that but but in there to phone the right but not the left in the nay
[00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:28.640]   It's in the nature of video conferencing because you can have any end encrypted as your call comes into the zoom server
[00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:34.720]   From everybody but at some point the zoom server is mixing the call. It can't do that an encrypted conversation
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:37.840]   Yeah, well, you just don't want you just don't want a person in the middle attack between you and zoom
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:40.000]   Like you don't want someone sitting out in your balcony. I agree
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.480]   You know recording what you're saying actually the ultimate irony
[00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:48.480]   Because senator richard bloomin salt the democratic senator who is supporting the urnit act
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:54.640]   Which of course is the backdoor to getting rid of all encryption in the united states has dinged zoom
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:58.160]   For saying they don't have an end encryption
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:03.520]   Damn, you know, but he doesn't understand this stuff. He just literally like most politicians. They don't understand technology
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:09.760]   They want political I did a zoom chat this week like I told you before on mac break weekly that I will not use facebook
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:14.160]   I will not use zoom but because of the times we're living in if my family or someone else
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.640]   We have to use zoom. Yeah, I'll do it
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:19.680]   And so there was a charity stream this week to raise money for covid-19
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:22.640]   It was a bunch of educational youtubers playing jackbox
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:27.120]   And they used zoom and because I want to help with this I I use zoom for it
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:28.000]   I'm not gonna
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.480]   I'm not gonna go out of my way to use it. I'm not gonna ever start one
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:35.600]   But I'm not gonna be I don't think I have the luxury of being principled and refusing to use these technologies
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:38.160]   I'm encouraged because because uh stamos
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:41.760]   said he's gonna come on as a consultant he he
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:47.520]   He said you want to ask him if I be interested in helping zoom build up its security privacy and safety
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:50.000]   And I readily agree agreed
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.320]   So I think stamos understands how important zoom is right now
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:56.000]   And
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:01.200]   I get the sense that he gets the sense from you on that you want is committed to this now watch carefully
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:03.520]   Stamos will be the canary in the coal mine
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:06.240]   Because just like a yahoo and facebook
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.960]   If you see a post from samos saying i'm out of here
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.600]   Now we know
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:13.840]   Well, it's just what's the what's the DNA of the company?
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:17.680]   What's the culture of the company like an apple and i'm only saying apple because that's the company
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:20.080]   I know the I know the best but the other companies might do this too
[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:25.360]   They have a concept called private by design and the privacy group and the security group
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:28.880]   There's a couple groups that have like almost unlimited power the performance team
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:31.440]   Which can take your code away and say it's wasting battery?
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:34.160]   Security team can take your code away and say there's an exploit
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:39.520]   The privacy team has to approve every stage of design and you can't like get to the end and say oh
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:41.520]   We're going to go back and retrofit privacy
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:46.480]   You every stage of of go forward on the project has to be private and a company like zoom isn't used to it
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:51.360]   They were just go to market go to market go to market and it's really hard like if you're an engineer it's so far
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.920]   Oh, I've got a check for oh, I've got an audit. I've got a mate
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:56.640]   I like it it puts so much more barrier to delivery
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:03.040]   But it's imperative to at least have like i'm not saying everyone has to run like apple like there are all different models
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:09.760]   But you can't have like vectors for easy attack on your users just because you're negligent in auditing your code from the start
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:14.480]   I'm gonna give them the benefit. I remember that the company is an american company
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:18.720]   They're in silicon valley, but all the all the coders are in china the three chinese companies
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:22.480]   At one point zoom routed all the traffic to china, but that seems to have been there
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:25.520]   I'm gonna give them the benefit of that because we do need something that's easy to use
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:30.800]   We've little psa we've talked about jitzy before I use jitzy. It's an open source product
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:36.000]   Uh, it was trivially easy for me to put jitzy on my debbie and server at my house
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.480]   in fact, I
[00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:40.800]   It's twit.tame. I created a server
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:45.040]   Uh, it's htbs it uses let's encrypt that's all built into jitzy
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:52.400]   Only I can start a meeting don't all run over there because I was worried about killing my server, but it makes it very easy plus
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:55:00.400]   You don't need to install any software. I can send a web address twit.tame/family. Let's say to my family and say click this
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.960]   And you're in and that's all you need to do
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:08.720]   So that is as easy to use as zoom it doesn't have all the features you can't change your desktop background or your
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:14.160]   Well, you know the background behind you. You can't blur your cam. Oh, actually you can blur your camera. Don't
[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:15.760]   Um
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.760]   So there is an alternative
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:21.760]   A good luck trying to get people to use it because I don't think they dropped a ball too
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.040]   Like it's interesting like slack
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:24.960]   There were so many products that were close to slack
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:28.960]   But slack really filled a niche in the market in a way that made people want to use it
[00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:34.160]   And they were like google had eight different versions of zoom and microsoft had skype and t
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:38.080]   Yeah, they were so many products on the market and zoom just ate their lunch
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:42.720]   Yeah, I don't understand why now skype has just announced that they are going to
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:45.440]   respond to this a little bit. They're going to have a
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:51.200]   No install version of skype that you can use you don't have to have a skype account
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:57.280]   Uh, it'll be a link based off of option for free video calls and skype is microsoft
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:00.480]   I don't know if you could say privacy by design
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:02.480]   but
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:05.840]   They've gotten better. They fixed some of the things that uh, but they were famous
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:09.360]   They were famous for saying that they're not going to encrypt and that's why they didn't get hip
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:11.200]   A clearance like facetime did for a while
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:14.160]   So you have to like it depends on what you care about and what you don't care about
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:17.920]   There is I believe a hip a version of zoom by the way that you can get for yeah
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:20.480]   Could you do me a favor uncle leo yeah
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:24.080]   Cyber pro and a chat made a good point go ahead and make a
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:32.480]   Fancy zoom video. I only needed to be three minutes long and I need to be the top five things you should do with zoom
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:37.040]   I believe I would do it myself, but I believe a silver fox like yourself is more trustworthy
[00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:40.000]   More appealing on the eye. So if you go ahead and put that out
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   I'll make sure to lea sends it to her little school friends and teachers. You'll be a viral sensational. I think we already make sure you get that done this
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:50.720]   We're already did it. No, I think we did send me the clip. All right. Just cut it out. Some I said it to me did
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.160]   Carson, maybe you know we we had the I said I won't do it. I'm gonna let the other hosts do it
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:58.480]   But Jason and mica
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:03.280]   Um, yeah, we have a video that we had all the hosts in ant got together
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:10.480]   Suggested all of their tips for for secure conferencing and mica made a video
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:13.200]   Where is that karstin? Where can we like this video?
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:18.320]   Can I just say that's like one of the cutest videos I've seen where he's putting all his screen screens behind him
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:24.480]   And he's put on a shirt and he's telling you to dress right? I was cracking on saw because I'm like if you don't take that blurry
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:28.000]   With the microphone and the microphones disappeared
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:35.360]   Oh, it's not not be cute mica is not happy adorbs. Yeah, I would I don't know
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:38.640]   You know it it isn't exactly what you're looking for which I think would be a good thing to do
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:45.120]   Which is the five things that you should do to get very direct to the point conference work a lot of people have done that I mean
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:53.600]   Tech crunch john konstein did one. There's an ours technica article. Do I have to read it? Yeah, it's not the same. It's more technically
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:59.920]   Um, the verse that a phenomenal one about just how to make yourself look good on videos
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:04.720]   Um, I'm blanking on her name. It's our video producer who did it and she's just amazing at this stuff
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:07.840]   And it's like don't you know tilt your camera down do this don't put your camera there
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:14.160]   It's like two minutes long very popish and everyone should watch it so that you look better than your your friends and and career
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:19.120]   Yeah, we we tweeted it. Let me go. That's what really is important. This is our big problem
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:25.440]   Make sure you look that we tweeted it, but I don't know if tweeting really is a very good way to get something out like that
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:31.360]   Maybe we'll put it on the on the front page. I'm scrolling back through a twit dot twitter.com slash twit
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:38.640]   Which is confusing by itself. I don't know. There's a lot of we're doing a lot of stuff with the uh, what's that?
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:41.280]   You guys are killing it with content right now. You got it
[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:45.520]   Ama is every other day. We're doing a lot of stuff because we because we got nothing else to do
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:48.080]   The ama is terrific
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:51.520]   I'm really doing you did one. It was yours last year this week. I forgot
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:56.640]   Uh mine was last week last week. Um, yeah with mary joe. It turned out really well
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:59:01.360]   This week is uh, naco andy yeah, andy did it with jeff javis. Jason howl hosted
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:04.720]   Yeah, we're trying to do it. Uh ask me and i was with a rose and
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:09.440]   That's right. Nobody asked me in jorid. Oh, mary joe. No, we'll get you guys
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:17.040]   Oh, man, oh, i forgot, i forgot. I forgot. Uh, we do those live on um friday's at 1130 amp pacific
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:20.000]   But you can get them on uh, where do we put it? I don't know where we put it
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.480]   They kept trying to get us to fight those chat rooms wanted us to fight about mac and windows and paul and I just hugged it out
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:27.360]   It's on our youtube channel twit youtube dot com slash twit
[00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:32.000]   You can get a fight. That's how you get the views. I know that's true. I know
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.440]   No one wants to see that's why we might have come out like holcogad and randy savage
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:38.800]   We might have done that a little bit. I think we're putting out too much content
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:43.520]   I can't no such thing. I know I can't even follow it. There's so much content coming up
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:48.320]   But i'm busy making masks i'm busy sewing you're making content leo you can't be
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:51.040]   Enjoying and making it so
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:54.720]   You're keeping people safe so that they can watch the content. That's right
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:57.760]   Consensus zoom to zoom or not to zoom
[00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:05.280]   Georgia, I don't think there's many choices right now. So I would say zoom if you have to zoom if you have to oh in
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.960]   zoom but use protection
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:14.080]   I think we have a show title
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.720]   Renee zoom or not to zoom
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:19.520]   It's not my first choice, but i'll use it if it's what the community needs
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.600]   Yeah, and I think it is right now
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:27.600]   I do. Here's another thing apple's doing to help us during this crisis. They are
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:33.120]   Asking health care providers labs other businesses to submit
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:37.600]   The locations of their testing facilities after they vet it
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:44.480]   They are putting it on apple maps so you will be able to go to apple maps and find a covid 19 testing site
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:49.840]   That's useful. Yeah, is it all that stuff is good more. Yeah
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:53.200]   I mean that's what map also made all the
[01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:57.600]   They also made the today at apple stuff online which I was really hoping that they would do
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:00.080]   You never know, but they go
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:05.680]   The apple stores were redesigned in this way to be very touchy feely community, which is the opposite of what we can do now
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:09.840]   No touching no feeling. Yeah, but if people aren't aware today at apple
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:14.400]   They have amazing courses like the prototyping course that today at apple is very similar to the one they ran at
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.160]   WDC a few years ago
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:20.160]   And they have like for for coding for design for photography for you could
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:23.040]   I'm not saying you could learn a new career, but you could get your foot in the door
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:25.360]   I mean if you're just sitting at home and you don't have anything else to do
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:29.120]   It's all free and it's all like it's really really well done
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:33.760]   So of course because they've closed all the apple stores these events are not happening at apple
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:38.880]   But they've put them all online at apple.com slash today's or at least some
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:45.680]   See look at those crowds. You can't have that now. Yeah, it's sad, but I mean this is this is where these are great events
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:49.360]   They're really wonderful. Yeah, and they have them for kids. They have them for creatives
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:53.360]   But at least they've got it's because they're calling it today at apple at home
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:58.240]   And what's full fun is these creators are doing it like everybody else
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:01.520]   They're doing it from their homes. It's kind of wild to see
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.080]   Jimmy Fallon doing his show from home
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:08.720]   To see creators, you know, here's harry it from apple region street in london
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.280]   How to drive playful portraits?
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:13.760]   My favorite thing about seeing
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:19.520]   Famous and rich people do stuff at home. Yeah is how to trash their setups are and i know i
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:26.640]   Good you look you can teach them so much you and the science fiction people have the oldest houses
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:31.520]   Oh, it's it's embarrassing. I'm looking at LeBron James on his cell phone
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:33.520]   I'm like, who's what what iphone is that?
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:37.120]   Is that your grandmother's iphone LeBron turn a light on in your mcmansion?
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.600]   Okay, because the lighting is trash LeBron, all right?
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:44.800]   Jimmy Fallon looks like he's recording in his daughter's closet. Okay, it's trash
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:48.400]   I kind of what do you think they must be doing that on purpose? Surely
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:55.440]   NBC could send you know, there's ways to do it send technicians out set it up wipe it all down
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:58.320]   Here's here's the thing. Oh no, they can't they don't care
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:01.280]   They're gonna plug into cameras to plug into software to load a little
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:03.280]   Do you think those guys to do it? No?
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.720]   Yeah, well they would say even niele's review for the macbook air
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:11.280]   He has Becca on on zoom telling him all right put the camera off a scoosh too much zoom in
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:15.920]   No, no just one thing back. Okay. Okay. You're centered now stay there and he's like trying to do the whole video
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.040]   It's so fun producing him through it makes me feel so good about myself every time I watch a trash production
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:26.720]   Saturday live last night. I appreciate all the people that make their shows good because
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:32.240]   Looking at without they're great for talent. Look at the sound they're not great for the lighting
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:35.720]   So hopefully they'll appreciate everyone that's them looking
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:41.840]   Appreciate your gaffers your grips your technical directors your your your camera operators
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:46.160]   You're well, they still have the joke writers. They just not in the same room with them
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:50.160]   Uh, I mean that's that's the weird thing to watch something like uh
[01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:56.400]   John Oliver for instance do the same exact jokes the fun the materials exactly the same just as funny
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.800]   but there's no one laughing so it just kind of
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.160]   Lands there it's yeah, it's it shows you
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.800]   But he said he's used to that because he's a british comedian and nobody ever reacts to stand up between in England anyway
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:14.240]   Saturday Night Live did its entire show remotely last night. I didn't see it. I only saw a little bit of it
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:21.120]   Uh apparently they need better mics somebody told me there were actually people using their iPhone headsets
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:25.440]   George you imagine this one George is wearing her iPhone headset, but she's not using it
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:31.680]   Well, I don't do it for the the there we go audio in no, but yeah, just for hearing just for hearing
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:35.600]   But I was yeah the scritch scritch sound which we long ago
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:38.400]   banned
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:43.200]   As the microphone on that headphone hits the collar and goes for the beard worse
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:49.760]   Oh, yeah, dalrymple many a many a microphone that disappeared into dalrymple's beard. Yeah
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:53.360]   Jordy Jordy's here
[01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:57.200]   Actually, jorities cyclops Jordy's reading us uh stories
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:03.840]   Reading rainbows. Oh, he is reading stories. That is amazing. Isn't that sweet? That's one of the better things on the internet this week
[01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:06.560]   That made me feel like I was five years old. I was like man
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:09.600]   Take a look. It's in a book a reading rainbow
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:14.800]   It's it's pretty funny
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:16.080]   um
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:19.040]   I in a way. I really like it. I like seeing
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:25.360]   Well, one dana carvie once said the only thing being rich and famous does gives you a bigger bedroom to watch tv on
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:27.280]   in
[01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:30.560]   It's it and you really get this when you see these people's houses. They're
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:34.800]   They're just like us. They're just living in the same world. You know, maybe it's a little bit
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:41.120]   Yeah, I understand when they say you know what just stay home from there, you know 17 rooms and you know, they're
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:44.080]   Yeah, I lost my husband
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:47.040]   I'm in three departments
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:51.680]   The swimming pool situation my friends got his little big mansion and he's got a problem because this pool
[01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:54.880]   He can't get the stuff to keep his pool clean. He can't come out to clean it
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:59.680]   So his pool looks like a swamp thing right now. So I laugh at making you diseases. That's great
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:03.520]   That is literally a first world problem
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.640]   I can't get the chlorine from my lovey
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:09.040]   I

[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.240]   20 million of them, which is really cool
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.480]   um

[01:10:54.800 --> 01:11:02.080]   I don't have a casper mattress, but I did just replenish my whole bed. It's a nice pillow. Yeah, and let me tell you something good
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:06.000]   Let me tell you something I I got I got I got last week
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.200]   I just got rid of the pillows last week because you know stressful times or whatnot
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:15.520]   And I said to myself what are the little luxuries I could do for myself and uh, I went and got three of these pillows
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:21.360]   I got the two originals and I got the foam and I am sleeping like a baby. What is your favorite? What do you like?
[01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:26.160]   I love the um, I also got the king size. These things are cute. That's my favorite
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:31.120]   Man, I'm up to here. It's practically a body pillow. I sleep out of the king size every night
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:35.520]   Now don't put it under my head. I put it on my side. It props me up. I have a bunch of them
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:38.400]   Here's here's the way i'm living on kaleo
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:42.000]   I got the foam underneath my head then I got a king behind my back
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.400]   And I got a king the hole. Yes, so one day when I find a lovely lady to replace the holding cast
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:51.120]   I'm secure from back inside to side and this is an amazing pillow
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:54.160]   I mean not for nothing besides the fact you can get 10% on the match
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:57.680]   I'm up great the match is one day, but just get yourself a pillows. Let's get you some of them taste
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.680]   A Casper joy in love. What do you do? It's true actually that's it
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:05.520]   Did you just happen to have that lion around ready to go?
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:16.400]   He's amazing. He's always ready. He's always ready. If you stay ready, you ain't got to be ready. Yeah, that's right
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:19.200]   My dog has a Casper bed
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:22.320]   You know, I have little doggy beds. You do doggy beds
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:25.760]   And when I realized is when you send the Casper mattress back
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:30.240]   They try to donate it, but they can't you know, they're to a homeless shelter or some
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:35.840]   Benefit charity in your area, but if they can't then they've got these mattresses and they can't resella mattress
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:39.680]   So that's what they do with them. They make doggy beds out of them. The doggies don't care
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:45.600]   The doggies don't care. Maybe I'll get my dog one try get myself one and act like I like a splurge on something you know
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:47.600]   I mean get my dog kind of talk to you have
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:52.800]   Do you let me guess always it's a it's a little little tiny yappy dog
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:57.040]   Uh, I only own pit bulls her name is my lage
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:00.880]   The vicious vicious no pits are not
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:12.000]   No, no best thing about people is people are intimidated and afraid of them
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.760]   That's right even if the dog is a sweetest dog to roll
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:16.480]   So if you're scared get a dog is meant for a good a pit bull
[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:21.200]   So people won't come by either you though cross the street you want six feet of clearance get yourself a pit
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:25.360]   Well, they'll walk down the street people will grow men will cross the street when you come down
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:32.000]   But isn't that something nice also is that almost all the shelters are empty right now people have been you know
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.800]   Thinking that they have more time to spend at home get an animal. Hopefully they don't return them after all of this
[01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:39.360]   But most of the shelters are empty. So yeah
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:43.600]   The animal shelters unfortunately the human shelters are not
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:49.040]   No, yeah, but the but the animal shelters are and that is kind of nice. That's it. Yeah
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:53.440]   So this is uh, they call them the velvet hippos. Did you know that
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:58.480]   Well, you know, I thought you were gonna say if they're aliens out there watching and they want to adopt some humans
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:03.360]   They should they don't call them velvet hippos and this is a reddit thread devoted
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:06.720]   It's uh slash r slash the velvet hippos
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:10.000]   Side note again velvet hippos. We're about to steal that name
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.720]   My daughter has uh started a soap empire in her quarantine and she's making hippos
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:19.600]   This one's an oat hippo, but she does have i will buy her her soap
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:24.640]   Oh my god, but we will we will we will definitely do that. Um, I've been
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:28.720]   If anybody's listening my daughter's been making me make a website
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:32.640]   All this stuff for her. So anybody wants to cover rescue me
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:35.920]   From my job
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:37.920]   What's that?
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:42.240]   It's leah.com. It's hi gene queen with a h i h i
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:47.680]   Gene queen, but leah l-i-a-h.com will get you there
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:50.640]   It's launching next week because her soaps are setting right now
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:54.720]   And it's just been a lot of work for me for her saying she wanted to do something
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:15:00.240]   It's killing me inside so but she's not as a great website
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:05.920]   She's not playing video games and she wanted to make soap with her friend and so the
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:10.240]   She bought all this soap and she's making soap and she's really self-centered when you have a dad
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:16.480]   How does she how does she make the soap does she does she does she how how how?
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:19.920]   How deep down the chain does she go to make the soap?
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:24.400]   So she started doing uh melting pore soap as a testing system
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:30.640]   For herself and those soaps didn't come out that great, but they smell delicious. They don't look for your melting existing soap
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:36.080]   So they come in blocks as base soap and then you have to form things in them and sense
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:42.640]   And colors and things like that. Yeah, we use goat milk soap and we use aloe soap and we she also got charcoal
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:47.680]   So she wants to make soap for men so then i use if she does it i use charcoal soap
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:51.120]   It's the best soap ever. It's the best soap ever
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:56.880]   She we just got the charcoal soap in we're waiting for the manly scents so she can make what's the address?
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:58.800]   What's the address?
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:00.800]   Just go to leah.com lei
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:07.760]   Yah.com it's the company name is high gene queen, but is hygiene spelled fine. How old is she?
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:10.080]   She's 12
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:12.400]   She's got her own soap business amazing
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:16.480]   All right, we got the logo done. You can put your email in we'll email you
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:23.760]   Set no we're waiting for them to set first for we start but next week they're gonna be up for sale because I guess I got work to do
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:26.160]   I've got to get labels now and i've got
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:30.320]   It's like you're working for a
[01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:34.880]   That's yeah, I'm I'm really ready for the charcoal soap so get those done. Yes. Yes
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:39.280]   Are you a charcoal soap with a cinado or you have a stinky husband?
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:45.440]   It's just good when you're doing my husband does a lot of stuff with like the car and dealing with things
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:48.880]   And so it's nice after to have a good soap to be able to do a good clean
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:50.960]   So the charcoal soap is amazing
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:55.680]   There's certain things that just charcoal and the first people that buy stuff are going to get these little exfoliating bags
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:58.480]   Because apparently it's good to have an exfoliating back
[01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:04.720]   Again, you put the soap in the bag if anybody wants to just come and get me added as quarantine and save me
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:07.360]   Or just take a kid and make soap with her just
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:09.760]   Okay, it's a lot
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:13.120]   She can call me soap with her. I want to make soap. I'm into the crowd
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:14.800]   I want to make soap
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:18.080]   Again, I'm just happy and proud of her so you buy it and bulk complaints
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:20.080]   So you don't you're not starting with lie
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:26.400]   And and rendered animal fat and cooking it up like the pilgrims used to do you snorkew
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:28.640]   We're using we're using bases
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:32.560]   Before we get one day, which she grows up and she wants to do chemicals and things like that
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:37.200]   We're trying to do more natural stuff. Yeah, um also because it's safer for her to do on her own
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:40.640]   Look at this. So you go on to amazon and you can buy for 20 bucks
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:44.880]   A five pound clear glycerin melt and pour soap base
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:48.160]   And so you start with that and then you would melt that down
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:52.800]   Yeah, and you flavor it you add colors set it in the hippo shape
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:58.960]   Yes, like this one has oats in it and this one made me angry because if you could see I don't know if it'll focus on there
[01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:02.960]   Yeah, there's so many oats in here. I'm like what is too many? I like spoolie. That's too many
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:07.280]   That's her first one. I was like what she's got to chop those oats up. You don't want whole oats
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:12.000]   She's gonna grind she learned her lesson, but I keep it on my desk because it smells
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.840]   Delicious like I can smell it around my desk all the time. It just it does smell so good
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:19.360]   So she did a good job on that part, but it's a learning process, but so it's coming soon
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:21.680]   So whatever thank you, but again, anybody wants to save me
[01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:27.040]   Please come and save me back to the stores. Have you ever done this? It feels like Georgia might have made soap
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:34.080]   I actually have glycerin. I have a glycerin block that I have died and glycerin block incense
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:39.840]   I have not yet done it. So maybe I'll have to ask you a time. I want to do it
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:45.040]   Now I don't want to steal from I don't want to apparently this is considered
[01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:48.880]   An essential product because Amazon will get it to me on the on Wednesday
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:58.400]   So where's I can't get a I can't get a Logitech camera till next year, but I can get a five pound block of glycerin melt
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:06.000]   Right away. I got so much soap from my house right now like she was making stars and it's got salt and sugar and crested on it and
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:10.640]   hearts and it's just so much like so much ready to wash my hands for you because
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:15.120]   Sugar is good for you because it's a it's a it's a it's fully it's fully yes
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:21.040]   Again my youtube right now my youtube is soap videos is annoying me
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:26.880]   You gotta get her her own account on youtube is what you gotta do
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.960]   She does never want to put her in a private browser
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:34.560]   To look at or she comes assist down with me and we look at them and I don't think to go on her device now
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:39.360]   YouTube thinks you're a soap browsing in cognito. Yeah, they think you're a soap top
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:42.080]   All youtube shows them is soap videos
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:48.960]   It's it's again. It's it's great. So again. She's not just playing minecraft because that's all she's doing right now is
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:55.040]   Face timing and minecraft. We spend less time together now in quarantine than we did pre quarantine
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:59.360]   Well, your mistake was thinking that it was optional previously
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:02.080]   It's exactly what the kids prefer
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:04.560]   Exactly. So what do you melt it in?
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:07.280]   Do you have a cauldron?
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:12.080]   It's a she uses a double pop boiler or sometimes you can just use a glass thing and put it in a microwave
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:14.880]   Like if you want to buy some at home if you got a glass bowl
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:17.680]   You can just do it in microwave and whip it up with sticks. Do not use spoons
[01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:24.960]   Use a little like chopsticks or a little skewer sticks because I spent this little room in this spoon. I buy a charcoal
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:27.040]   soap
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:30.400]   That is 15 dollars a bar. It's ridiculous
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:34.560]   Ours is only going to be 795. I'll call that about to save you 50 on your soap experience
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:36.960]   But it's no, no, it was now you're doubling it for Leo
[01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:40.800]   Yeah, really we got a consultant on this just the Leo price
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:47.040]   It's uh, it's I mean, it's the only soap I'll use because it's a really uh, it's a good deodorant soap
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:52.240]   And it does really it is black which is weird. Yeah, well if you buy if you buy it from there
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:54.320]   It doesn't have anything in it is just soap
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:59.040]   It doesn't have any scent or any kind of like stuffing it to make it so i'm gonna get i'm gonna get her
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:01.760]   Oh, I see what you're saying. No, this is soap
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:05.920]   Yeah, yeah, it's like, you know, I can't remember the name
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:09.280]   All right, so we know now already what Owen is doing in quarantine
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:15.120]   It's if you had if you had done 20 questions if you had said guess
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:18.160]   It's the last thing I would have guessed that you're making soap
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:22.880]   Yeah, that i'm pretty sure that that would have been the last thing i wouldn't even have been on the list
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:24.960]   Artisan old biscotti
[01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:30.320]   Artisan old biscotti or everyone's making a mother dough. My mother. I have a sourdough
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.320]   I have one but I started it before
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:36.880]   the uh covid thing but it's uh it's still there and I feed it every day and
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:40.960]   Uh find lots of things to do because my mom just gave me a rye bread
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:47.200]   Heard my sister are baking together over over uh, FaceTime. Rye is i'm benefiting. Rye is an excellent sourdough
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:49.040]   flour starter
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:52.560]   All right. What do you do in georgia to stay sane during this crazy time?
[01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:58.720]   So so we're playing half-life alics, which is a new game. Yes, right
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:02.400]   So amazing, right so amazing
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:08.080]   Really amazing game if you have one game you're gonna get on vr
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:09.120]   of the
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:09.360]   um
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:16.560]   The controllers that are like hands-free so you can actually grab like you grab things and then like you can actually crush things in your hand by squeezing
[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:24.800]   Really hard. Um, it's amazing. My kids though start to like try to like force grab things to come towards them when they're not playing
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:30.480]   It's it's really beautiful because it's kind of yeah, it's like the force you could pull things to you
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:33.520]   And you get used to it now you try to do it all the time
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:37.120]   That's the sign you've been playing it too much. It doesn't work out as well
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:41.120]   It's baby yoda reach baby yoda reach
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:48.160]   It's it is just really great. It's a great game. Uh, we're watching the castlevania
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:51.920]   My kids are all into castlevania. They play all the games. We're watching the miniseries
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:54.480]   We're very good. We're really good
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:56.960]   Really good. So we're watching that as well
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:01.040]   And uh just trying to keep busy with that but a lot of a lot of fun vr
[01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:03.200]   How many kids do you have two?
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:06.080]   Two two boys and now that rene can't babysit them
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:09.040]   They're all yours
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:13.200]   Yeah, we get we get along really well like we get along really well
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:18.240]   So it's a lot of fun. We get to like we play board games like i'm like a 12-year-old girl
[01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:23.840]   Like really so I like sparkles and board games and let's do art and make stuff and we have a lot of
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:27.280]   It can't hard though. Sometimes you just go. I wish I had some time to myself
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:30.160]   They don't leave us alone. That's true
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:33.920]   But when they they get to play three hours of video games if they do their homework during the day
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:37.120]   So they're doing their video games for like three hours
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:42.080]   So and at at nine o'clock ten o'clock. We are like, okay our time. We're gonna watch madmen
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:44.880]   Yeah, michael is michael's
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:50.080]   Loving half-life Alex. It's another one. I can't pry out of his hands. He's playing it on the vibe
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:56.080]   It's steam right. I think you can get it on steam. Yeah steam and uh, it's it's vr only which is interesting
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:24:00.720]   Say again, is their property. I think it's what they've been building
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:06.400]   Yeah, it's actually a good point steam started pretty much with valve with half life
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:09.360]   And uh, and so they've owned this all along half life
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:12.480]   It's like elon musk. They're putting everything together to make a virtual world for us
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:14.880]   I was so glad to see that they have the face suckers
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:16.720]   and
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:20.000]   It's even they're even better in this than they were in the original half-life
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:25.600]   I mean, it's scary and the crowbar is scary. It's really scary. Yeah, because you're in it
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:32.720]   You that's the weird thing with vr is that you really do believe that you're there even though you know you're not
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:36.640]   Is that it's it's so much scarier than watching
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:42.240]   Somewhat like a movie because you're immersed around it. So it's it's quite scary
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:46.720]   But they do a great job with it. You really get to interact with every piece of the world
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:51.600]   You can pick up things you're like i'm like grabbing like this stick and i'm like i'll take this as a weapon and then i'm like
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:55.200]   What about this plant pot and then i'm like, oh no, i'm gonna take the entire
[01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:59.840]   Like, you know, siding to the house. I'm trying to drag it through the beginning of the house
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:04.160]   And then I figure out that that's only the the opening it's not even
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:09.680]   We're getting of the game and then um, I saw I watched the the there's one worth
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:12.960]   I'll just mention jeff and then I went I don't know if i'm gonna be able to play
[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:17.520]   Because that was really scary. So some of you know who jeff is
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:20.080]   That's how i was gonna ask as a special request
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:24.320]   If you don't want to live stream it if you could just call me on FaceTime put the phone in the corner
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:30.000]   So I just watch you play through those certain boards i the joy in my heart you would do so much for my mental stress
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.240]   Just to watch you
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:33.760]   Jumping
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:37.200]   It's great though. I scream really loud and then i very
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:40.080]   Tense with the way you get the way you scream
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:41.440]   Yeah
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:46.320]   Yeah, you're tip to like very because you're looking around corners. You don't want to get jump scares
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:52.000]   Yeah, no, and they do a great job of luring you in yeah, and then
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:59.040]   You know, it's gonna happen anyways. So like I just saw one robot. I ran behind something and hid and it was just
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:01.520]   It wasn't
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:05.040]   A robot just a robot. Oh, well, that's enough fear
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:09.440]   Renee, what are you doing to keep sane in this difficult time? Oh?
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:14.400]   Oh, well, as you know leo, I had the bright idea of putting my job right before all this covid stuff. I just started
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:20.080]   I'm busy. Yeah morning till night setting up everything for youtube. I didn't like I didn't have a website
[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:23.840]   I didn't I didn't have my own product. Everything was owned by future nine more
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:31.280]   So I had to redo rebuild everything and i've been actually been going through a lot of Alex lindsey stuff that he's been recommending over the years
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.920]   Yes, and setting like i'm setting up a streaming thing. I just set up a
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:39.360]   A camera overhead. I have a camera that i'm setting up behind me. I should be able to switch eventually
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:44.400]   And it's it's it's a little panicky because I wish I'd done more preparation in advance
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:49.840]   But it's also a lot of fun. It's like i'm a hobbyist videographer who's also trying to start a video channel
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:54.000]   So I I can't screw around too much, but it's a huge learning curve
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:54.960]   But it's immense
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:58.800]   I was watching a bunch of videos on lighting like so now I have a light up here and I have a
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:05.200]   A kick light there and I have background lights and I have fills and it's it's just a whole thing. It's fun, isn't it?
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:08.400]   But it's honestly it's not that different from your life before
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:13.680]   You just can't go out but I like if I didn't do something before there's like a huge
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:16.080]   I had we had this at my old company
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:18.720]   I used to work on product marketing and we had a team of developers
[01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:24.400]   And we tried to poach this developer from a famous company said i'm one of a thousand people if something goes wrong
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:28.160]   Nobody notices i'll be one of five people your team every screw up
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:29.760]   I do will be like on me
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:32.000]   Yeah, and like now literally everything is on me
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:36.880]   Yeah, yeah, we know that feeling and the building back up must be really stressful right rene
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:42.640]   Like you're starting it for yourself and you have to build your channel back up from like zero
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:45.760]   Yeah, yeah, thanks

[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:03.760]   Renee that's how i've been spending my time. I wake up. I do that then when I get tired I go to sleep
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:06.400]   You're you're among friends. We've all made that transition
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:13.520]   I'm from tech tv to podcasting. Oh and jj stone was on the good fresh prince of bel air and now he's got to sit there and
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:15.440]   It'd be blue
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:21.920]   Uh, no, Alex went from iLm to making his iLm for years. I mean, yeah, I thought a small outfit and georgia dao
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:24.400]   Is doing exactly what she's always done
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:32.480]   Yes, keeping me saying love her. Yes. Yes, you guess juke can can you go over and wave it her through the window because she's in mojorie?
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:37.200]   She's across the river for me anytime you see a picture I post of the river
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:39.760]   She like she didn't want to be on the same island with me. I don't blame
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:46.480]   So she the the other island. I can sort of wave to her across the island and she could pretend not to see me. That's how that works. Ah, I get it
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:49.680]   Um
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:52.080]   We've we've kind of gone through some of that here
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:57.360]   Uh, in fact this week was a little bit of a challenge because a lot of our hosts are working from home
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:02.960]   I'll tell you what made a little montage. This is what our shows have looked like this week on twit
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:08.000]   It's been very dark here at twit
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.800]   Onto it if you were watching the last room right now mica is a potato
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:17.840]   Mica has gone super sand
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:23.200]   Hands-on wellness if you're not feeling well yet. You don't feel the need to visit an er
[01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:30.240]   You can still visit a doctor virtually these two apps allow you to speak to a medical professional from the comfort of your home
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.960]   via video chat on your mobile device
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:37.120]   Security now the world now has a new term
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:42.160]   Zoom bombing and it's become a sub industry of its own
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:47.840]   Hands-on mac a lot of the things i'm going to talk about on hands-on mac will involve use
[01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:52.720]   Of the terminal and if you're a developer, but if you're just somebody likes to geek out
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:58.240]   Getting into the command line and the terminal on mac and tush is a really great idea
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:04.240]   Hands-on android if you're stuck at home like I am and something tells me you might be
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:09.440]   Then you finally have some spare time to I don't know read a book or watch a movie or something
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:12.640]   I've got a bunch of completely free options for android
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:17.840]   Mac break weekly apple has designed its own flat pack
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:25.040]   Mask for health care workers face shields and he says we can manufacture these at a million of them a week
[01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:29.600]   And it is by the way, I want to point out the thinnest face shield apple has ever made
[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:32.640]   Stay home and watch to it
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:36.000]   Yeah, mica discovered how to use
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.800]   What's it called snap cam?
[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:44.880]   I think that's the program and then he told everybody how to use snap cam and now our zoom meetings
[01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:47.520]   Are just a nightmare
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:50.560]   Just a nightmare everybody looks but he's so delightful

[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:38.880]   So, uh, we are talking on mac break weekly about this strange
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:43.920]   Uh thing that apple and amazon did together
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:51.040]   Uh apple for some reason, you know, there's only three companies that get this privilege said, you know what amazon?
[01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:53.040]   You sell stuff
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:57.200]   Uh on uh your own app and we won't take a 30 cut
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:02.320]   And the only two other two companies that get this privilege are altease one
[01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:05.520]   And uh canal plu and those are both
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:08.720]   streaming um tv companies, right?
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:13.600]   Uh, so this is unheard of it ben tomsen had a great article in stratecary
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:19.840]   Kind of debating all the different possibilities. We never really came up with why apple
[01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:24.000]   Uh did this but ben's final conclusion. I think is interesting. He says
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.360]   One thing you should consider is the impact of
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:30.080]   shelter in place
[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:36.080]   He says the corona virus will not so much foment drastic changes as it will accelerate trends that were already happening
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:38.720]   Changes that might have taken 10 to 15 years
[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:42.000]   May now happen in far less time
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.840]   And he says it seems possible cord cutting will be a leading
[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:47.920]   Example
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:49.920]   I know I know our audience
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:55.280]   Our big cord cutters as you might expect with a podcast for one thing that you know their audiences obviously are
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:00.320]   much more um media literate, but I also think because our audience is geeks
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:05.520]   They're able to search out the best ways to do this. Do you think when we come out of this?
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:12.400]   Uh, it's it's over for movie theaters. It's over for cable companies. It's all about over the top
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:15.040]   streaming video
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:17.200]   Oh, and you're think so no you don't think so
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:20.400]   I don't think so. I think that people are going to be when we're done
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:22.640]   I think people are going to be so stuck of being secluded
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:26.720]   I think that a lot of people will appreciate and I think it might change the way that we use certain
[01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:31.360]   We do things differently in some ways. I think that more people will do things remotely than going out to it
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:34.080]   But I think that people are still going to enjoy the movie theater experience
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:39.520]   Um, and I think that people still enjoy getting together. So in certain ways
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:41.440]   We might do it from home
[01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:46.960]   But I think that you know the first thing people are going to want to do when this is all dropped and we can leave our home safely
[01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:52.800]   People are going to be storming the movie theaters and you know going back to their favorite bars
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:55.280]   Not all of them, but the good ones
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:58.480]   Nobody wants to be here
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:04.800]   First and foremost second ball. I'm frothing at the mouth to get back into a movie theater and sneak my candy
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:09.600]   Because I don't want to spend nine dollars on that candy and why something want to die again excreant and tell people to shut up
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:12.720]   Well, I'm trying to why this though. There may be a amc
[01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:15.360]   Maybe out of business by the time you come out of quarantine
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:17.040]   What if there are no leaders?
[01:35:17.040 --> 01:35:21.520]   Disney open theaters. So exactly somebody's going to open up movie theaters going to glia
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:25.280]   This is america. We will build we will come back and let me tell you something else
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:29.680]   The other thing about it is you better not keep everything on streaming. Okay, because I told you a long time ago
[01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:32.560]   There's a very not bright guy who learned how to steal a copy stuff
[01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:35.360]   Okay, you better get these movies back in the theater so you can get some of this money
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:40.480]   Ain't nobody streaming trolls right now. They're trying to figure out how they can hack troll or have somebody stream on the back
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:44.880]   Against they can watch it trolls the $20 rental you didn't you didn't rent it for leah
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:50.400]   First of all, I've ruined my child's life by the fact that we had so much money now
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:51.680]   She doesn't need to have him
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:56.480]   We watch we watch adult content like not adult content. Oh my god. I got this reframing
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:59.840]   I know you see a watch tv for grownups not for kids
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:02.480]   TV for grownups. Yeah, yeah
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:05.920]   So she is against she's about real life stuff like we watched
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:14.800]   Just mercy and she loves real life true story type movies now like she likes, you know dark water and intellectual things and injustice
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:19.440]   So whenever I try to say hey, let's go watch onward and she's like, I'm not watching that and so I got to watch
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:22.160]   Signed the head talk by myself
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:24.640]   It's just hard because she won't watch any kid movie
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:31.120]   I don't think people are going back to theaters. I think there'll be a little bit of residual
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:32.880]   um
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:35.040]   pst ptsd from this
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:38.960]   I think they're also going to discover that they're completely happy
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:43.120]   Watching the content that they can stream instead of spending all that money
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:48.960]   Isn't it like the cd market where like for a while the cd business was printing and ship and trucking
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:51.760]   That was the majority of the cd business and then you know
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:55.680]   There was an extinction level event with napster and with all those sharing services
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:00.000]   And the model had to evolve when we went to itunes and now we have spotify and apple music physical
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000]   And the video companies have fought so hard
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:07.920]   And they they don't want to go into the future like they like imagine if music worked like video
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.720]   Like you had to have Warner Warner music account you had to have an amc account of a sony music account
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:14.480]   You too is big enough got to subscribe to that
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:20.800]   It's a nightmare and video is still a nightmare because they want to they don't want to be like music and they're fighting it and the theaters are fighting it
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:24.560]   But this could be the extinction level event that we've talked about not in a bad way
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:28.400]   But in terms of getting the dinosaurs out of the boardrooms and letting young smart
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:32.880]   You know people take over that can see a model where there's like a pool of revenue
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:36.960]   And you go to movie theater as part of the pool if you go to if you rent you want to pay a hundred bucks
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:41.120]   Because that's what tickets cost to get advanced access or or in real time access
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:42.880]   They'll be all of these options
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:49.040]   And I think that's sort of the evolution where this model has to be that it can't they won't be able to extract single copy
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:52.800]   Value from anything anymore the same way cd's can't do that anymore
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:55.760]   And they'll have and now streams are making more money again
[01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:59.280]   And I think there's a model where video could make a lot more money if they just sort of
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:01.840]   Lesson their grip a little bit
[01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:05.760]   They're not making star wars open tonight the movie theater money
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:06.160]   Renee
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:09.440]   I just filed you on twitter because I didn't do it before and i'm a horrible person for it
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:14.400]   I gave you a compliment about wearing an orange shirt and how lovely you look and then you come in here with your nonsense
[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:16.400]   Actually, it makes a lot of sense. I don't like the fact
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:21.360]   What you said it's been a lot of sense and you're messing up my dreams and hopes. Okay, so i'm gonna snack on your dreams
[01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:24.320]   Next thing you say out your mouth. I'm disagreeing with
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:28.320]   Following me immediately. That's how exactly i'm upset
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:36.320]   Subscribe just to unsubscribe subscribe subscribe that's right so here's another party if you don't hire somebody here's another point of concern over the last two years
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:43.280]   People under 25 are the are the least likely to go to movies. Yeah, how's that possible?
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:47.600]   Because they have neffices well you think they'd be going to see the maracle movies
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:50.000]   There's nothing about people that take their kids to movies
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.680]   That's including
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:52.880]   Definitely going to be
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:55.840]   Less people seeing movies because you can still get them at home
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:39:00.560]   But that doesn't mean the entire business is going to be dead like people are now opening up drive-throughs again
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:04.640]   Which I think is awesome because that's a cool experience. I just need the girls in the roller
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:07.440]   We're going back to the 50s because because Cuomo
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:13.120]   Cuomo says we're going to open up drive-in movie theaters in new year's movie theater and chill Leo
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:16.720]   This generation needs to be and chill part. So that's why they're trying to angle for driving
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:21.920]   We don't need as many movie theaters, but that doesn't mean that the entire business is dead
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:23.920]   It's just changing it's evolving
[01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:28.320]   Going to come back right like parking lots movie theaters. We're going to be needing room to put all these cars again
[01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:34.240]   It's such a weird weird cars. I just bought two homes and three hummers gas is a dollar
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:36.400]   89 and I am balling out of control
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:39.760]   I'm about to get an 18 wheeler and go coast to coast to east west of you logo
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:40.880]   Come here making this up
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:42.000]   Whatever it shows up
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000]   Pouring gas out the back of the truck, right?
[01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.160]   Look, let me tell you something. I'm giving out free gas on Thursdays come see
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:50.720]   That's how cheap gas
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:53.520]   Yes
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:57.840]   So ben's contention is that amazon and apple are uniting
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:00.480]   in the face of competition
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:06.720]   Now accelerated from streaming companies like netflix and disney plus dizzy plus through the roof during this right
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:09.280]   Netflix through the roof
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:12.560]   Well, it's such a weird so I bet I think ben is like a legit genius
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:16.400]   But it's such a weird thing because amazon service is not as good like
[01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:19.200]   You're not going to compete with
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:21.280]   It's such a weird service like the the apps are trash
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:25.360]   You you if you go to you press play and it says oh you need a different subscription to play the thing
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.600]   We're showing you that makes it look like you can play it
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:33.200]   We have some originals, but it's mixed together with we just jumble it together with a bunch of movies from the 70s with no rhyme or reason
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:38.720]   Like it's a bad service and you think that they're competitive strategy would be to make good service because they're the
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:42.880]   Which is companies on earth and apple, you know, they're just starting off
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:46.880]   They have zero catalog content. They're making some good shows some not so good shows
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:51.280]   But that that doesn't seem like a very good competitive strategy to me if it is one
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:54.320]   I feel like this is more about avoiding a regulation
[01:40:54.320 --> 01:41:00.160]   In fact what ben says is apple and amazon are at the historic disadvantage of companies with other businesses
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:02.960]   He says netflix is going to win this because it is
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:05.920]   Oh, they do that's all they do and so
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:07.760]   I'm excited
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:11.200]   These services become commodities like we saw this was botify
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:15.200]   Spotify only that's why they're trying to diversify they're buying podcast networks and
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:20.240]   Ad networks and all these things because the service becomes a commodity you make razor thin margins
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:24.560]   And we saw that with smartphones like the companies that only made smartphones palm and blackberry
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:28.080]   They they just couldn't compete anything that went wrong destroyed them
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:36.080]   Meanwhile samslung had appliance money and apple had mac money and google had search money and apple and google can give away content
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:38.240]   at you know as a strategy as just like a
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:44.960]   A gift to get you to buy their devices and use their services and netflix is accruing a lot of market share
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:47.920]   But a lot of debt at the same time so I don't know
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:50.960]   I mean it's great that they're making a lot of originals
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:53.120]   But unless they have some sort of other business
[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:59.440]   I don't know how they'll be able to weather downturns in their market their theory is a loss of value in their theory is we spend now
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:04.320]   To lock you in because we're gonna make such great exclusive. That's the important part
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:09.120]   Content this is a problem spotify at two which is you stop watching Netflix
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:14.560]   Yeah, disney plus came out and apple plus came out and there and there's and there they won't go on the tv app
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:18.320]   And most of the time now i'm in the tv app because it shows me what's next and it's super easy to go
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:22.080]   I see that they're not in there. I don't even see them anymore. Yeah, you're in the apple bubble
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:26.560]   I'm not listening to you. I got free apple stuff. I've watched one episode of any show that they've done
[01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:31.360]   I don't know anybody's why I have and I regret it. It's crap. Let me let me finish
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:39.040]   One person in my circle recommend me a show that comes and you wrote apple or i have Disney plus in there great for them
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:43.760]   We're here for them coming together so they can be in fifth place because their content is generally trash
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:48.480]   They can put our commercial. They can what I got my off phone 11 math pro 256 1500
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:52.320]   I got a free year. I watched one episode of nothing. He had nobody recommend me another
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:55.680]   So you up there again and that apple bubble talk about this ship. Nope
[01:42:55.680 --> 01:43:01.040]   Tran is there any apple tv and i'm watching cbs all access and i'm watching
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:05.360]   Apple tv plus is there any apple tv plus anybody would recommend
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:08.320]   Show this servant was good. I liked the sir
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:12.800]   It had a lot of promise and in the last episode it's like oh come on
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:14.880]   So
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:19.120]   That let me down. I agree. I liked it. That was a shamaland production
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:24.400]   I am happy that i think franchise content though like a lot of a lot of companies are just putting out franchise content
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:27.520]   And it's nice that someone's experimenting with new new stories
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:36.400]   That's what nephlix does. Oh, I do is watching Netflix does it like Netflix we watch quite a lot and but a lot of it is existing properties
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:40.080]   Oh a lot, but a lot of it is new stuff too their own stuff
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:42.400]   They have a lot of new stuff is good. It's a wrap
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:48.000]   I don't know. That was an apple and an old video game shows, but i'm not gonna get into this war
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:51.680]   You'll lose
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:58.880]   The japsy people like for all mankind. One day at a time was fantastic. I regret that they canceled it one day at a time
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:04.400]   Yeah on Netflix. It was fantastic. Oh, that was the updated one day at a time. Yeah, the new one
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:10.560]   I never watched it. I should run these minority shows. You watch the CBS grandpa stuff. I can't trust your opinions. He's a grandpa guy
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:18.720]   Yeah, what do you watch? Oh, and what's your show besides sonic the hedgehog? Oh the best show on nephlix right now is you
[01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:22.160]   Uh season two that's supposed to be very good. Yeah, it's a
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:24.800]   Good
[01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:28.080]   It's not as good as season one tiger king. You watching the tiger king. Oh
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:31.360]   Man carol basket
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:34.560]   It's all you have to say. It's all you have to say
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:37.360]   Carol bass
[01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:42.480]   I only walked away a tick-tock. The oh's are missing out just came out with season. Those are good. I never watched
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:47.120]   I've heard good things. I have never watched this so Lisa and I sat down because we heard such good things about season three
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:55.040]   So we sat down. It's very good. It's amazing. Yeah, it's very good. You know what the best show I've seen this oh quarantine go ahead
[01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:57.360]   platform
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:44:58.160]   on
[01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:04.000]   Netflix it is an adaptation of a europe movie. So it's a voice dub, but I don't watch voice dubs
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.920]   It's the best voice dub ever
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:11.840]   People are on different levels food starts off at the top full rank you get a minute to eat by the time you get done. Oh my god
[01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:14.800]   That's disgusting. Okay, wait, stay it again. What's it called?
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:19.680]   Is it a reality show? No, no, it's a it's a one-off movie. It's hour and a half
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:27.280]   It basically I hear amazing things about this area and it's and it's worse form. So you're there's I'll just say there's 10 levels
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:29.280]   There's more than 10, but I'll just say 10 because I want to get the story away
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:32.080]   There's 10 levels every month you start off on a different level
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:34.880]   So if you're in level one and you got to eat all the good food
[01:45:34.880 --> 01:45:38.560]   And then the next month you were level 10 and you were left with no food when you get back up
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:41.920]   I love what you do do you eat sparingly knowing that people at the bottom
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:48.400]   Don't get any or do you still gourd because you want to hold month without food and this whole thing is just it's a mind trip
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:52.080]   It is great 82 percent on rotten tomatoes
[01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:56.880]   So the other thing I just the other thing that's been bothering me about Netflix lately is they keep raising prices and constraining service
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:45:58.240]   Like I've got to pay more for the HD
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:02.080]   I gotta pay more for different televisions and in an age of Disney plus and all the other services
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:04.480]   Just having flat rates and they don't think you know
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:07.760]   They're pretty generous with how many screens and stuff you can watch
[01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:10.960]   I think I got three Netflix price hikes in the in the course of a year
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:17.760]   And then I have to look at it like if I unsubscribe from HD then I can only watch it on one time like one 480p screen
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:22.800]   Is anybody stupid enough? It must be a Canada thing my price has been 1299 for last year and a half
[01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:26.640]   You get the goods because you're getting the full deal you're getting the full meal deal
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:30.160]   And I got this thing on 47 screens right now
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:32.320]   I legit probably had this thing on 40 screens
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:36.880]   So I don't really know what's going on up there in Canada, but down here in America. We share and it cared out here
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:41.600]   Okay, there's a five council here. They're probably just not releasing a lot of people going into those accounts
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:43.680]   Okay, just so just so we're clear
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:46.560]   I don't even know you're logging to watch this american Netflix you're talking about
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:51.680]   My Netflix doesn't even I don't even pay my Netflix my Netflix is my friend's Netflix because I pay for hulu
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:54.640]   So he gets my hulu and then say that was my question is just dumb
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:57.600]   I got a little stuff enough to pay for anybody pay for
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:59.040]   We don't get it here
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:01.200]   But I pay for a great with the bell version
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:06.160]   So the do you pay for oh you don't get it that's so we got two Canadians they can't so this is not for you guys
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:07.920]   This is for you Owen
[01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:08.880]   devs
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:10.080]   devs
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:12.800]   I have it on record. I'm waiting till it's done. I'm just gonna build
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:15.360]   Last episode the season ender is thursday
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:22.400]   Then I'll blow right through it on friday. What no well watch them all now so you can watch thursday live because it's gonna be
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:29.840]   Amay, I think I don't know what's gonna happen, but it's wild. This is a very good only thing I do live is twit.tv
[01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:31.920]   Otherwise my life is
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:33.920]   Okay, all right
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:37.840]   In the in the past of the future hulu is usually complete wasteland for me
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:42.560]   But that show is it's an FX show so you don't even need hulu you could record FX
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:42.960]   I guess well
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:45.760]   They're sending all the edgy Disney content to hulu now because they keep
[01:47:45.760 --> 01:47:50.960]   requisitioning these shows and then chickening out of airing them and so they send them to hulu where they're not to have what is
[01:47:51.680 --> 01:47:54.400]   Disney content. What is that any any?
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:48:00.320]   Apparently almost everything I think like most of the original shows ended up not being on Disney plus they pushed them to hulu instead
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:05.200]   And now that's right lizzie McGuire lizzie McGuire was too edgy for Disney so that she wants to go to hulu now
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:10.320]   That's why i'm not gonna pay i'm not gonna pay for Disney plus what's my free year runs out and that's
[01:48:10.320 --> 01:48:14.880]   Season two is finished cloak and cloak and dagger is on hulu
[01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:16.720]   Yeah
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:18.720]   Runaways on hulu and
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:22.400]   The gifted is on hulu also those raw Disney properties
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:27.600]   They're marvel stuff, but they are a little bit more graphic and racy so they put them on
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:34.640]   I liked what was that the other guys the bad guys the the marvel the heroes who were like turned out
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:40.960]   That's amazon though real true amazon. That was good. That's amazon. Yeah, the boys the boys. That's great
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:42.960]   It's season two is coming out sooner than that. That was good
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:44.080]   That was good
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:47.200]   Micah must have known all the nice things you were saying about him because he showed up in
[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:52.960]   I saw him tweet me. Maybe i grabbed a smile and grin at and stuff. He says he likes devs too. Okay
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:56.400]   Uh, let's take a little tiny break. We got more tech news
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:58.000]   Uh
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:59.200]   In just a bit

[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:32.160]   They'll i'll never forget the last trip i made before quarantine
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:38.800]   I flew to st. Louis early in march to see worldwide technologies advanced technology center and I am so glad
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:45.280]   I did what an amazing place that is this is so they started building this 10
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:50.640]   Years ago. It's now grown. It was in one building that's two then three then four it grow has been growing like crazy
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:56.560]   Originally designed so that worldwide techs engineers could do, uh, you know build
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:49:59.520]   Proose of concept and pilots for their customers, you know
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:04.320]   They're they sell enterprise technology to some of the best biggest companies in the world
[01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:10.640]   And so they were using the atc as like kind of a sandbox show customers what it's going to look like that kind of thing
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:16.800]   Over the years they added half a billion worth of enterprise technology
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:21.680]   I mean every everybody's in there in fact. I was just drooling. We're walking down the raxon

[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:25.760]   Because it's a service. You don't have to go to st. Louis
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:27.360]   It's virtual
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:33.280]   You can you can use a dedicated lab space within the advanced technology center perform your own programmatic testing
[01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:41.200]   Using this amazing half billion dollar ecosystem the ww t's already built 24 7 from anywhere in the world
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:48.080]   v ww t's engineers use this technology every day effect when we toured the lab I met a number of people who are twit fans

[01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:12.800]   They're building custom integrations to help their customers and man when when ww t puts it together they put it together right from beginning to
[01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:14.880]   And this

[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:29.520]   of this week in tech go on over there and check it out ww t.com/twit
[01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:32.720]   Twit
[01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:36.480]   Interesting to see which companies are thriving
[01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:42.320]   in this ecosystem and which you know this new covid 19 world we're living in
[01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:49.120]   Of course, uh, you mentioned it. Oh and us has become a service economy and those are the companies that are struggling
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:51.360]   restaurants and
[01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:53.360]   Travel and all of that
[01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:58.880]   But uh, there are companies that will come out of this stronger and better than ever don't you think
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:03.040]   Sure, I don't know who's going to pay for their services, but
[01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:06.400]   Stronger and better
[01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:08.800]   Yeah, who do you think google will come out stronger and better?
[01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:16.560]   What google is forever google is forever. Yes, richy was talking about how like I assume in my future
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:20.640]   I will be one day wearing google socks and amazon underwear and
[01:54:20.640 --> 01:54:23.680]   You know, I mean like a factor right like yeah
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:25.680]   Like that's what that's how I
[01:54:25.680 --> 01:54:32.240]   Legitly assume how the future will go google no matter what is not going anywhere information is king their king of information
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:37.600]   And it seems to me that any company that has enough resources like apple has what 200 billion or more in the bank
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:43.120]   To weather this storm will come out on the other side into it into a competitive environment where they're
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:46.960]   You know, they're the survivors. It's gonna be the startups though, right?
[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:50.480]   Like the new companies that are finding a foothold because out of every one of these sessions
[01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:54.000]   There's been a whole new series of companies that we well I think some people imagined them
[01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:58.880]   I certainly didn't they just sprung up and announced some of that they took advantage of the new situation
[01:54:58.880 --> 01:55:01.680]   They didn't like zoom cowered down. They went to yeah, yeah
[01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:04.640]   They call it disaster tunity
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:10.080]   Every like the dot-com boom in the previous recession there were people who took massive not advantage in a bad way
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:15.040]   But they can match them advantage of the opportunities to present it themselves and built entirely new businesses air B&B
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:17.600]   What do you think they'll survive? They're really struggling, right?
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:24.080]   Airbnb and we work. Oh my goodness people keep trying to pet our thing about we working now people
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:29.520]   We're gonna have to work from home and they're gonna work in office in office space. Yeah, they're gonna be working from home office space
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:31.920]   Yeah, and they're in the rented we were
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:34.720]   These that's still do even if you
[01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:38.000]   Take like real be air B&B will be fine
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:42.000]   But the people who bought like 18 different condos who will be rent out of the a hotel chain
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.480]   I mean
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:47.520]   People that are gonna be returning toilet paper in a couple of weeks
[01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:52.800]   Right, yeah, and then they can't return because there's no return policy now, please
[01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:57.920]   So you're stuck with that TP and that is an answer on your credit card because you made a boo boo
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:01.440]   I feel nothing for those people on Airbnb that they did
[01:56:01.440 --> 01:56:04.640]   I give a massive sympathy. I read that
[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:09.760]   Oh, man, it's it's gotta you know what I should laugh about that
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:15.600]   But it it's got to destroy your mindset because at some point you think I'll get one two properties three
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:19.280]   But when you start getting 10 12 like the one guy had 18. I'm like dude
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:22.560]   Okay, at this point you're a hotel. You should just open a hotel
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:27.120]   That's what you're gonna do if you've got if you've leveraged that much money to do what you're doing
[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:33.680]   Then you deserve what has happened to you right now because you over leveraged yourself and you were anything that has no foundation
[01:56:33.680 --> 01:56:35.600]   Yes
[01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:38.960]   Yeah, and something you don't control the foundation. I caught up with you. Yeah, yeah
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:43.280]   Well, that's the thing right is people take a look and think that you know the model of this
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:47.440]   This is gonna stay the same. No one expected us to go through a pandemic
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:49.520]   The last time was like what a hundred years ago?
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:51.040]   No one expected it
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:56.640]   So they thought about it and this is what sometimes happens and those that can evolve will and those that can't
[01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:00.880]   Will you know let you know in normal democracy will take care of it and
[01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:03.600]   Some of it's like those
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:05.680]   Some of it is you chose a business
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:09.760]   That happens to do well in the work-at-home environment
[01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:17.280]   And you know zoom is a good example google google meet they say they've got two million new users every single day
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:25.520]   Two billion minutes of video calls in march daily usage is 25 times higher than it was in january
[01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:30.800]   And it's weird that facebook doesn't have a property for this like you think that they would have like their own complete
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:34.560]   They they would have had years ago their own complete zoom. Well messenger is
[01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:38.160]   I saw messenger stats to messengers going
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:44.320]   Yeah, and what's happened? What's that? What's that? Yeah, it's good. She had to like but it's not a zoomer thing
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:46.320]   Yeah
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:51.840]   Facebook's also offering free portals to uh some home care residents
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:54.960]   Uh in the at britain under the nhs
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:58.240]   Yeah, good for good for them
[01:57:58.240 --> 01:58:01.120]   Oh
[01:58:01.120 --> 01:58:06.400]   I went back. Okay. I'm ashamed to admit this. I'm ashamed of it
[01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:08.400]   I went back on facebook and instagram
[01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:11.440]   Just for now
[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:16.160]   Do you know what I actually I was so angry at that uncle leo because for four minutes
[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:21.840]   You made me look at my facebook because i'm like this is a leo friend request to me. I know you wouldn't come back here
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:24.800]   I can't say no
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:28.880]   Yes, it was really funny people were asking me questions like
[01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:35.760]   Okay, if this is the real leo scott harry had asked me this what did I shout every time on internet tonight?
[01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:38.160]   This is 20 years ago. I said I don't know what the hell you shouted
[01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:39.680]   I
[01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:44.480]   Lately accepted it just on the off chance that it was you and I didn't want to be disrespectful because I literally look at a
[01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:46.880]   Form and it's like that's not him. Don't get your hopes up
[01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:53.360]   I'm gonna I'm not gonna I don't know I should post something but mostly so I can keep track of family and friends who are only there
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:58.320]   To make sure they're doing all right as soon as we come out of quarantine. I'm gone. I'm out of there
[01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:02.560]   Okay, good. It's horrible. Everyone should like what can we yeah facebook's the devil
[01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:07.360]   Can we please like it reminded me a natural death it reminded me when I got on it
[01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:09.600]   bad it is
[01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:13.600]   And just just before we get off the top and just speaking of companies doing well
[01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:18.480]   Yes, Amazon and the guy who was complaining about people buying non-essential stuff
[01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:24.400]   Um, he ranted about dildos and that's what got him national coverage because you know people shouldn't be buying dildos
[01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:28.720]   Which again in quarantine, I think that actually might be a necessity. I don't think there's anything wrong with that
[01:59:28.720 --> 01:59:32.160]   I'm not gonna say I don't think anyone wants to rent this business in the quarantine
[01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:34.480]   Dildos no no
[01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:36.000]   I that's what i'm saying. I said it for you
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:37.760]   I think that might actually be an necessity thing
[01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:39.680]   But I do think amazon is
[01:59:39.680 --> 01:59:45.520]   Complicit and corrupt and putting people's lives in jeopardy by letting people buy things that are non-essential items
[01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:53.840]   And having people working those factories ship stuff out and deliver things the postal system is getting destroyed right now with people getting sick
[01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:56.240]   And they're not having enough money to flow through it
[01:59:56.240 --> 02:00:01.040]   So amazon is always doing what amazon does and they say they care but they don't care
[02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:07.200]   But wait, you know amazon amazon has made 100,000 new jobs. They've hired 80,000 of those
[02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:12.640]   Those are people who are they put 80,000 more people in the line of danger who need a job to survive
[02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:15.840]   And these essential people are working on the front lines the kid up here
[02:00:15.840 --> 02:00:19.760]   I actually think you're safer working in amazon than you're doing at the grocery store
[02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:21.680]   I think ask amazon employees
[02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:26.240]   There's article in here that we can read about where amazon employees do not agree with you uncle lio people that are working in the warehouse
[02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:31.040]   Do not feel safe amazon is a reporting when people get the coronavirus and after they get the coronavirus
[02:00:31.040 --> 02:00:34.080]   They're not cleaning up the the warehouse is properly afterwards
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:36.320]   That's not me talking those are people that are in the way
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:40.400]   This is a wired article nine amazon workers who say they're terrified
[02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:44.720]   They're terrified for their health and that of their families working at amazon
[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:50.400]   So i'm not giving them kudos for hiring and putting more people at risk in the line of duty again
[02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:54.400]   We need these people but where we need them if we were only delivering and doing essential things
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:59.200]   Well look amazon has enough money to do everything they can to protect those workers
[02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:02.080]   But they do not and if they know that's untouchable
[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:06.400]   How much they really care about their people because they could afford to do it. No, right
[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:12.080]   I have to say the only evidence I have to the contrary is one of our and who knows maybe it's a
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:16.400]   Bot account, but in our twit uh forums the twit.com community forums
[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:19.840]   One of our listeners who's a regular in the forum said yeah
[02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:21.120]   I lost my job or ano work
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:26.800]   So I I signed up and worked with amazon and he was talking about all the things that they did and I thought I was very impressed
[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:30.160]   It sounded like they were doing everything they could to protect these guys
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:31.760]   So
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:34.880]   Maybe it depends on the warehouse you're in I or yeah
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:40.480]   Or maybe because he's new he doesn't know better about it yet because when you first go on things seem rosy
[02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:44.400]   And when they tell you things since like when you go in a first date, she doesn't tell you that she's crazy
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:50.400]   To the third or fourth. Okay, you gotta gotta kind of figure it out the first couple everybody's coming up rosus again
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:56.960]   I just think that they should be doing more because they have the power to do more and they don't and it's
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:01:59.120]   just showing what the
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:03.200]   Moral compass of the company is I understand their companies capitalism
[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:04.560]   They had to do what they have to do
[02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:11.040]   But I feel for the people that are working on the front lines the kids at the grocery store or adults at the grocery store
[02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:14.320]   Um, oh they are at least they have shields and stuff up now
[02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:19.440]   And they work like that. Yeah, and and they're on the lower end a lot of them don't have the best health insurance
[02:02:19.440 --> 02:02:23.440]   So if they do happen to get sick, there's just so much to this that just
[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:25.120]   Is so much
[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:31.040]   Here's what raw he said. I'm actually working in his amazon warehouse at the moment with our business clothes and the extra time
[02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:34.320]   I noticed amazon were advertising. I always wanted to see how warehouses work
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:39.440]   And if they are as bad as the news suggested so I applied for a temporary part-time job
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:43.680]   We have there are a lot of things in place for covid. We keep two meters apart everywhere
[02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:49.280]   Lots of cleaning of handles doors tables, etc. In the canteen cleaning the scanner and the arm computer
[02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:51.360]   That's the thing they wear as they pick
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:57.360]   Only one person per table in the canteen shift times are staggered to stop everyone arriving at the same time
[02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:03.680]   when I uh sign in this morning to my scanner i was asked some questions from amazon about if these measures are being obeyed
[02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:06.000]   and uh
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.880]   So he I mean this guy said it's it sounds pretty good
[02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:13.360]   Like that's uh, i can't i can't i can't go masks
[02:03:13.360 --> 02:03:18.000]   He says gloves and masks are handed out on entry rather than being just available
[02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:23.520]   Temperature is taken on arrival more and more take markings on the floor everywhere indicating proper spacing
[02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:26.880]   And hopefully they're doing those things and they're doing them more often
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:32.400]   But as as of today he just put an update in today everyone must now wear a face mask as of today
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:34.720]   I can't ignore the fact that
[02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:38.880]   Thousands of people are protesting and walking out from their jobs and complaining about it
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:44.320]   This sounds great and I hope that this is accurate and that it spreads like wildfire across their company and organization
[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:51.120]   Well, yeah, but but that they're only started to wear the face mask today makes me take back a little bit
[02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:55.600]   The good on amazon like they knew about this for a really long time. No doubt this is public pressure
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:04:00.800]   But if you're keeping well wait a minute if you're keeping two meters away, I don't know how important a face mask is
[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:04.240]   I'm sorry. You've already discussed this and you don't agree with the face mask masking
[02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:10.160]   Everyone is particulates and they stay in the air and they're in the air for depending on the proximity
[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:14.480]   One to 20 minutes to particulates and still be there. That's why we discussed earlier on kaleo
[02:04:14.480 --> 02:04:16.800]   Any cover is better than no cover because it
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:22.160]   Lessons your viral load that you can get out and it is useful so they should be doing it
[02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:25.280]   That's why it's finally being mandated. So don't minimize that on the layout
[02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:32.720]   Can't judge judy code just order jespezos to do a shift in every amazon warehouse and then they'll be forced to do the best protections on earth
[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:38.400]   Amazon's a part of the anti-amazade response to the word article as they've made 150 changes
[02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:44.560]   Including distributing face masks instituting social distancing protocol all the things that ras said
[02:04:44.560 --> 02:04:47.680]   They're also checking for temperature when people arrive
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:53.680]   Obviously, that's not enough because of asymptomatic people they raised wages for hourly workers
[02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:56.480]   Um, I you know, I don't know
[02:04:56.480 --> 02:04:57.840]   That sounds great
[02:04:57.840 --> 02:04:58.800]   That sounds great
[02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:05.120]   But I guess it took an article and people to complain and have their lives at risk for weeks on end before they actually did something about it
[02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:07.680]   So great appreciate you double thumbs up
[02:05:08.320 --> 02:05:10.320]   Yeah
[02:05:10.320 --> 02:05:14.720]   Where would you shop it's everyone kind of would you not shop at amazon because of this?
[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:19.760]   Uh, that's so horrible. I'm a bad person. I still shop at amazon. I do love it
[02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:25.360]   So I'm stuff it's horrible and they treat their people badly. So where are you gonna get your five pounds of glycerin soap?
[02:05:25.360 --> 02:05:29.600]   I I actually get my glisten from brambleberry.com. Thank you very much
[02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:32.240]   Do you think brambleberry has better warehouse policies?
[02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:36.240]   It has a well that one it took me two weeks to get this soap
[02:05:36.240 --> 02:05:40.560]   So I assume that it's better because they said they're working at half staff and things are going to take a little bit longer
[02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:46.160]   Also, when amazon pushed you back three weeks on my products and i'm paying for prime somebody owes me a hundred 29 dollars
[02:05:46.160 --> 02:05:50.720]   Because i pay for next day two day not three full week full week. So okay, that's second
[02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:54.320]   Last
[02:05:54.320 --> 02:05:59.280]   Amazon is not particularly workers and I want my money back on amazon prime
[02:05:59.840 --> 02:06:05.440]   I am an american citizen and of course i'm a hypocrite to still shop so on amazon. What do you think i am?
[02:06:05.440 --> 02:06:10.880]   I expect them to do better than me because vassos has a billion dollars
[02:06:10.880 --> 02:06:14.800]   I ain't got two dollars on kaleo so I will do what I need to do to survive
[02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:19.440]   And I will chastise them for not doing what they need to do for others to survive because this is american
[02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:22.400]   well says a billion dollars jack dorsey
[02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:28.560]   Uh twitter ceo founder of square. He is donating one billion dollars
[02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:31.600]   of his square stock
[02:06:31.600 --> 02:06:38.240]   Uh to covet 19 relief and other charities is putting a billion dollars towards his smart start small fund
[02:06:38.240 --> 02:06:42.160]   Uh, and then he says after this is over
[02:06:42.160 --> 02:06:44.960]   Uh, the rest of the money will um
[02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:49.840]   Will operate uh to girls health will go to girls health and education
[02:06:49.840 --> 02:06:56.720]   And he said all the flows of funds are tracked in a google spreadsheet, which everybody can see
[02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:01.040]   That's interesting. Can I can I tell you something again uncle?
[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:03.920]   I'm gonna rent move we gotta get a warmer story two second rent about it
[02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:06.400]   Let me tell you something for jeff basos
[02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:09.920]   wanted to give 10 billion dollars to like uh the
[02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:16.320]   Environment and all this kind of stuff this man didn't have to build a website. He had had to get a whole team together
[02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:19.920]   It's the google's gonna spread sheet so you could actually go and look at it
[02:07:19.920 --> 02:07:24.080]   I don't want to hear from one for landthropist one go do gooder. I don't want you know what?
[02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:26.640]   We should cure cancer tomorrow. I don't need a foundation
[02:07:26.720 --> 02:07:30.880]   I don't need 45 people all I need is a spreadsheet and some money donated
[02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:34.320]   We could get this thing done because that is how you do something
[02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:39.840]   That's how you show people that you're serious about it and that you mean what you say and you're putting your money where your mother's
[02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:42.800]   I love that man. I don't love everything that he's done to say I'm
[02:07:42.800 --> 02:07:45.280]   He's gets a lot of respect for that
[02:07:45.280 --> 02:07:48.800]   It's straight up. It's 28 percent of his uh of his fortune
[02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:54.400]   So it's it's more than a quarter of his fortune. I'm not giving up point 2 percent of my fortune right now
[02:07:55.040 --> 02:08:00.320]   So it's all invested in soap stock. I'm giving it up to the stock market, but not to charities
[02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:03.200]   $100,000 to america's food fund
[02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:06.000]   Uh, which is a go fund to me
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:11.600]   Uh 2.1 million dollars to the mayor's fund in la helping domestic violence victims in la
[02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:15.280]   Uh as a result of the covid 19 safer at home order
[02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:18.640]   Wow, you know, I didn't even really think about that, but yeah if you're stuck
[02:08:18.640 --> 02:08:23.040]   Quarantining with an abuser. That's a nightmare
[02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:25.440]   Yeah, so
[02:08:25.440 --> 02:08:28.080]   Well done. This is america's food fund. This is actually uh
[02:08:28.080 --> 02:08:33.200]   This is the thing that loreen pal jobs and leonardo decaprio put together
[02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:39.440]   Uh, which is actually a great fundraiser. They have raised 13.8 million dollars
[02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:42.320]   To funding people who are hungry
[02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:46.000]   Uh money goes to a variety of organizations
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.560]   Uh hosea and race organization
[02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:51.120]   Uh the world central kitchen
[02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:53.920]   Shefts for america. This is a this is
[02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:58.000]   If you're thinking about how can I help out? I think this might be a really good way
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:01.040]   to help out because did you see the pictures of
[02:09:01.040 --> 02:09:07.120]   The cars 10 000 people in san antonia at the food bank waiting in their cars
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:17.280]   To get a couple of bags of groceries. It was just heartbreaking. It was just heartbreaking. So that's uh go fund me.com slash america's food fund
[02:09:17.280 --> 02:09:20.080]   um, and a
[02:09:21.280 --> 02:09:23.920]   You can also we're we're running on our mac
[02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:31.120]   Um, it's folding at home where you can help use your computer power to be able to help find a cure for covid 19
[02:09:31.120 --> 02:09:34.560]   Give some money instead
[02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:39.760]   I don't really if you're gonna do some supporting why don't you go all the way and get health care
[02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:43.280]   Everyone so you don't have to worry about people being fed, but
[02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:45.760]   This is america. We're not gonna do that journey
[02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:47.120]   Canadianness on scythe
[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:53.200]   You you sell like a socialist when you say that yeah, and and bill gase has the coronavirus covered
[02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:55.360]   Okay bill gase has all the computer power he needs
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:09:59.760]   To come up with a solution for us and save america. Okay bill's on it
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:04.160]   Um, okay. Here's a scary one
[02:10:04.160 --> 02:10:07.120]   Travel x was hacked on new years eve
[02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:09.200]   I remember this hack
[02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:13.440]   Travel x if you've ever gone to the airport on the way to an international destination
[02:10:13.760 --> 02:10:16.720]   You stop at travel x and at great expense by
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:22.400]   Okay on our last trip where we were this is our probably a last trip for a long time
[02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:24.160]   We went we're going to israel
[02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:27.440]   And so lisa went to travel x to guy by israeli shekels
[02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:33.360]   And uh gave them money and got it back. I even have a picture of her holding up to what I thought were shekels
[02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:38.400]   Then we tried to spend them in israel like I said these are swiss francs. What are you what are you doing?
[02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:44.320]   But it has a happy ending because it was about $200 more worth of swiss francs than we paid for so
[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:47.520]   But nevertheless, I don't I don't think that was related to the hack
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:50.000]   They paid hackers
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.920]   285 bitcoin
[02:10:51.920 --> 02:10:56.080]   To get access back to their system after a ransomware attack. That's about 2.3
[02:10:56.080 --> 02:10:59.360]   Million dollars in today's bitcoin
[02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:03.200]   That is ridiculous. That is well crazy
[02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:06.320]   I'm in the wrong business
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:07.280]   Yeah
[02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:14.800]   Actually just a word of warning everybody listening is probably sophisticated enough not to fall for any of these but there are massive numbers of ransomware
[02:11:14.800 --> 02:11:17.440]   COVID related ransomware and others
[02:11:17.440 --> 02:11:24.000]   Efficient attacks phishing attacks be very careful and now that people are working from home. I think they say oh here's an opportunity to get those
[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:27.680]   naive people who were protected by the it department
[02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:30.800]   They're on their own. Yeah, right and
[02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:37.040]   Someone if there's a facebook link saying give me your name of your your mom's maiden name and other information the road
[02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:39.760]   That you don't answer them. No, please don't
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:46.000]   Taiwan by the way like the Canadian government has now banned zoom
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:49.840]   So I'm wondering if zoom can recover from this
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:53.680]   Well, they just had me like
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:56.080]   I want it they're not so much bans as they are
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:12:00.880]   Recognition that they're not secure software. They solve for something something's probably be taken off the list
[02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:06.880]   Germany don't use zoom the United States Senate don't do don't use zoom
[02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:11.680]   And I hope you saw Saturday night lives zoom meeting
[02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:15.280]   I played a little bit of it before the show
[02:12:15.280 --> 02:12:17.760]   I'm not going to play it on the show because Carson will yell at me again
[02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:23.360]   But uh, but the funniest part is when one of the less sophisticated users of zoom
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:27.120]   Takes the laptop into the bathroom because she has to be in the moderate
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:28.480]   That was based on a real thing right?
[02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:31.040]   I got a big story last week if someone was taking it into the
[02:12:31.040 --> 02:12:33.760]   That was like two weeks ago. That's the one thing that
[02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:36.480]   See certain things like that didn't even use me because that happened in real world
[02:12:36.480 --> 02:12:41.360]   The woman was on zoom. She was taking her laptop whether not even realizing that she was on video
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:44.880]   And she sits down and all of her teammates there's like eight of them
[02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:46.480]   No one says anything to her
[02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:50.880]   They all just start giggling and the one person still trying to talk and then finally she realizes
[02:12:50.880 --> 02:12:56.160]   That everyone can see her on the toilet and she freaks out runs. It's just loud. Oh, that's horrible
[02:12:56.160 --> 02:13:02.640]   To die for it was so amusing. So it was it was hilarious though. That they did steal that from real life rich. He's right
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:05.360]   Is this being caused by five g towers?
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:09.680]   Yes, no, please don't leo you people know
[02:13:09.680 --> 02:13:11.200]   People believe
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:17.920]   There's like this weird and maybe georgia notes three, but there's this weird oppositional personality disorder where people feel like everything
[02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:22.800]   The world is moving so fast if they just make up a conspiracy at least they can control the conspiracy
[02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:29.760]   Some semblance of yeah, like maybe that they won't they won't believe in climate change or or um vaccines
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:33.600]   But if you tell them that coronavirus is caused by 5g and they can vaccinate against it
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:39.440]   Maybe then they'll do it. There's an arson and sabotage against cell towers in england in the netherlands
[02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:45.680]   Uh in countries without 5g they've been blaming it on 5g. Where did that come from?
[02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:52.080]   Okay, was it like would you harlsin tweet someone else famous would he harlsin tweet it
[02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:55.760]   He was one of the first people and there was another celebrity you tweeted it. Oh, please
[02:13:55.760 --> 02:13:59.360]   Okay. Yeah, let me let me talk about this thing is
[02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:03.680]   Okay, go ahead. Go ahead. Okay. So, um
[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:07.200]   Black people believe this with all their heart
[02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:11.840]   I'm just gonna put it as a general blanket statement because I have family members friends
[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:15.280]   DMing me ban videos every five seconds, okay
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:18.240]   So first of all if the video says ban on it
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:22.480]   I'm not clicking it because of his band how am I watching how did you watch it? You moron?
[02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:24.880]   Second of all is it
[02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:30.000]   It tells you in the title that is full nagal. Okay, second of all, okay
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:36.480]   5g isn't even real they put 5g on phones before 5g was even available and 5g if you want to say okay
[02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:38.160]   Let me give you some good conspiracies out there
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:39.840]   Okay, and you want to say a bat
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:41.840]   Transformed to the virus and
[02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:44.960]   Upson ate something in the market and then they spread great
[02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:51.280]   You want to say a guy in a school built a virus that he wanted to contain but it got uncontaining that but you're today
[02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:53.440]   They lost it and you want to blame it on the man and they're trying to get it
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:57.040]   Cool if you want to blame it on the government saying that they just want to get rid of people
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:15:02.400]   Collecting social security it is targeted at older people to get them off so we can have a better health care system
[02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:05.840]   So not wearing out cool if you want to say bill gates wants to get another
[02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:09.440]   $1 billion by putting a chip in me not the chip but the vaccine
[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:17.440]   Cool, but what I will not stand for listen to can don't or understand is how you're telling me that the radiation that you sit on the phone and scroll
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:22.320]   Through in your body all day every day the microwave that you cook your food on because you don't cook no more
[02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:25.840]   You're worried about that giving you a virus. No, it might give you a headache
[02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:33.840]   It might give you a cancer over 25 years, but it's definitely not giving you flu like symptoms coast to coast passing from person to person
[02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:37.360]   It is not 5g because guess what somebody in mil walkie
[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:39.680]   Montana
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:42.800]   Oklahoma they don't have 5g yet, but the virus is spreading there
[02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:49.600]   So if you don't shut up about this 5g stop burning down these towers on my staff you in the face repeatedly don't email me
[02:15:49.600 --> 02:15:52.560]   Don't mess it. Don't send me no bad
[02:15:52.560 --> 02:15:54.560]   It's not really bad. Sorry
[02:15:54.560 --> 02:15:58.560]   Cory doctor had a great threat on this to friend that posts about everybody
[02:15:58.560 --> 02:16:02.240]   It's a story doctor was saying like every every time there's a new technology comes out
[02:16:02.240 --> 02:16:06.720]   They get these reports saying it's giving me headaches and they're like we have not even turned them on yet
[02:16:06.720 --> 02:16:12.160]   Yeah, and then and with the towers are there and people forget about them the stuff all goes like it's it's human nature
[02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:17.200]   To expect the worst and to find reasons for for things and to have mass hysteria
[02:16:18.080 --> 02:16:22.400]   We've been using all these signals for a long time. We're just packaging data through them better now
[02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:27.360]   That's like the only change is like is what we're actually sending over these waves and it's
[02:16:27.360 --> 02:16:32.800]   Yeah, it's it's really strange that people will believe the most outlandish things, but not science
[02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:38.000]   Here's the car to me from uh michael remieras. They lost las vegas review journal
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:42.720]   Uh woody harrelson tweeted that 5g may have caused the coronavirus pandemic
[02:16:42.720 --> 02:16:46.960]   That's the woman says her husband says obviously it causes brain damage
[02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:49.840]   [Laughter]
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:53.760]   Go ahead. We're so much more primed right now though for
[02:16:53.760 --> 02:16:57.920]   These type of conspiracy theories because we're at home
[02:16:57.920 --> 02:17:04.240]   What is everyone doing? They're surfing on the media for stuff and this pandemic is such a
[02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:12.080]   Massive thing that people don't understand. It's really scary and when we're scared our brains do not we don't get smarter. Yeah, we get
[02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:19.280]   We're not as intelligent. We're like, you know and it's much easier for someone to say this is the reason for it whenever
[02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:21.920]   It's like when there was a kind of klismic event people were like no
[02:17:21.920 --> 02:17:28.800]   We have to throw people into volcanoes that will make this better and the volcano won't be so angry at us that we can understand
[02:17:28.800 --> 02:17:33.040]   It's something that's concrete so people look to what has changed
[02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:41.120]   What can I do and 5g I can control a little tiny virus that is spread through people that almost everyone's gonna get is really
[02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:47.680]   Frightening I can't control that so in a way it's soothing to think that it's 5g and we just have to like
[02:17:47.680 --> 02:17:56.800]   A bunch of towers and be safe again a year ago the New York times warned that rt the russian government funded television network
[02:17:56.800 --> 02:18:03.920]   Was airing a report that 5g might kill you that this may this may be more disinformation from russia
[02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:11.040]   And besides that georgia. You appreciate this some of these people that are complaining about this
[02:18:11.120 --> 02:18:14.480]   I'm saying to myself. Okay, so you're sitting in your house for the last two weeks
[02:18:14.480 --> 02:18:19.040]   You're drinking beer and vaccas. You're not drinking water at all during the day
[02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:23.520]   You're eating sugary snacks and candy foods and your pop belly and bread and donuts
[02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:27.760]   And then you know while sagging over vitamin dino fresh air plant xbox video games your phones
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:31.920]   Blue to your face all day. You're saying you don't feel good because it's because of 5g
[02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:37.040]   No, because you haven't drank in any water. You haven't got up over your fat button walk around the block and you haven't looked up at the sun
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:40.240]   Okay, you need to see the sun they didn't say don't go outside look up
[02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:42.640]   They said don't go hang out of somebody else's house
[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:47.440]   So again, if you don't shut up about this 5g causing this virus. I would have lose my mind
[02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:52.000]   All right, let's take a little break. We're getting long here, but I just having so much fun with you guys

[02:19:55.420 --> 02:20:01.580]   Internet of things devices your neighbors got the super Wi-Fi booster Wi-Fi is broken

[02:20:48.860 --> 02:20:56.700]   Doing whatever it is I do using Eero and I tell you it just is so robust and I love the Eero app
[02:20:56.700 --> 02:20:59.020]   Actually, I don't have a here, but
[02:20:59.420 --> 02:21:03.500]   Oh, yeah, I love the Eero app. I do have it here because I can always see what's going on
[02:21:03.500 --> 02:21:07.100]   I can pause michaels Wi-Fi at nine or ten so he goes to bed
[02:21:07.100 --> 02:21:13.580]   It there's no more Netflix buffering in the master bedroom. No more kids complaining their Xbox isn't working. No more
[02:21:13.580 --> 02:21:19.740]   Worrying your net your security cameras offline. I have everything on the Eero including by the way

[02:21:25.500 --> 02:21:29.980]   My iot devices I have I don't know. Let me see how many devices I have quite a few
[02:21:29.980 --> 02:21:33.900]   Right now in my Eero. I think three or four dozen
[02:21:33.900 --> 02:21:39.020]   And I also I like it so much. I got it for my mom and I can even maintain her network from here
[02:21:39.020 --> 02:21:41.500]   I could switch over to mom's network. She's in Rhode Island
[02:21:41.500 --> 02:21:45.500]   If she complains about something going wrong, you see I've extended Eero throughout the house
[02:21:45.500 --> 02:21:49.820]   We got the gateway in the office. We got the hallway the guest hallway the bedroom the gym
[02:21:49.820 --> 02:21:54.700]   Eero is everywhere. I could see michaels devices. I could see the entertainment devices
[02:21:55.020 --> 02:21:59.340]   I could see the activity. I get my download speeds. I could see security too
[02:21:59.340 --> 02:22:02.860]   How many scans how many problems how many issues we've had?
[02:22:02.860 --> 02:22:05.900]   This is really a great tool
[02:22:05.900 --> 02:22:11.740]   Eero couldn't be more powerful more useful and it gets better all the time because

[02:23:41.100 --> 02:23:43.820]   They're linked somehow inextricably
[02:23:43.980 --> 02:23:47.900]   Uh, I know a lot of people who had in fact mark succoning is one of our fans
[02:23:47.900 --> 02:23:52.620]   He's we call my doc mark is he's an eye doctor in upper New York state had a uh, sader
[02:23:52.620 --> 02:23:56.700]   Passover dinner with 50 people in a zoom
[02:23:56.700 --> 02:24:03.420]   Scott wilkinson did the same thing and he said the only problem is we couldn't all sing because there's some moments
[02:24:03.420 --> 02:24:05.740]   As you're going through the hagata where you sing
[02:24:05.740 --> 02:24:09.820]   He said we'd had to take turn singing because obviously zoom is not good at trying to sync up and sing
[02:24:10.300 --> 02:24:16.460]   But this was the zoom. This is this will be remembered long as the zoom pass over, right? Yeah
[02:24:16.460 --> 02:24:21.980]   It's quite a quite a thing. This is such an important event in the Jewish year
[02:24:21.980 --> 02:24:28.300]   Uh, it is it is kind of the equivalent of Thanksgiving really it's where families and friends get together
[02:24:28.300 --> 02:24:34.220]   They share a meal they talk about you know, they relive the history of the exodus from egypt
[02:24:34.220 --> 02:24:38.940]   It is the most commonly celebrated holiday among uh, Jewish people
[02:24:39.660 --> 02:24:41.660]   And so I think that's a
[02:24:41.660 --> 02:24:43.820]   It's a big deal, but I think
[02:24:43.820 --> 02:24:45.980]   Yeah, you know, did you dr. Momma?
[02:24:45.980 --> 02:24:51.340]   It was your uh, sader a zoom sader dr. Momma nore chat room is famous for her
[02:24:51.340 --> 02:24:53.900]   massive feasts
[02:24:53.900 --> 02:24:57.420]   For said they were a ton on twitter too everyone was posting them last night. Yeah
[02:24:57.420 --> 02:25:01.180]   Yeah, it made me super sad because we usually go to our our friends
[02:25:01.180 --> 02:25:05.100]   Uh passover at lea it was very upset. We didn't get the mossable soup this year
[02:25:05.100 --> 02:25:07.100]   I'm making lots of balls tonight
[02:25:07.100 --> 02:25:11.820]   We were gonna make latkes. We couldn't wait for the latkes. Yeah, you couldn't get potatoes zoom
[02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:14.060]   Unfortunately does not do a good latka
[02:25:14.060 --> 02:25:20.460]   But yeah, it's hard. I mean these are these are the times when you and yet at the same time again
[02:25:20.460 --> 02:25:24.140]   There's something different it's different, but I don't know if it's
[02:25:24.140 --> 02:25:26.780]   I mean, it's also
[02:25:26.780 --> 02:25:28.940]   I think you know, I see more of my mom
[02:25:28.940 --> 02:25:34.540]   Now that I have ever had because I'm always goodness for the internet. Can you imagine doing this in the new yinernage?
[02:25:35.580 --> 02:25:40.220]   It would have been horrible. It was horrible for that went through the the Spanish flu
[02:25:40.220 --> 02:25:44.140]   Yeah, it's a horrible thing to have to be across, but I think it makes us appreciate people
[02:25:44.140 --> 02:25:46.460]   We've been so spoiled
[02:25:46.460 --> 02:25:51.420]   That it makes us appreciate what we have it makes me appreciate being able to buy eggs
[02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:56.780]   Or being able to see people and how much I miss them. No kidding. So hopefully we keep that part
[02:25:56.780 --> 02:26:00.460]   We have so next we have two two doors down from us
[02:26:00.460 --> 02:26:03.020]   uh, the peterson's egg farm
[02:26:03.580 --> 02:26:05.580]   And uh, they have
[02:26:05.580 --> 02:26:08.780]   Rain free range hens and actually they're perfect for easter
[02:26:08.780 --> 02:26:13.500]   You don't have to die them because they're red brown green white they're every color of the rainbow
[02:26:13.500 --> 02:26:16.700]   But they were completely sold out because everybody
[02:26:16.700 --> 02:26:23.420]   You know has discovered you don't have to go to the store to get eggs in fact and and the nice thing is this is a good social distancing thing
[02:26:23.420 --> 02:26:27.580]   It's so it's this is one of the reasons I love pedaloma. It's still very much
[02:26:28.300 --> 02:26:33.740]   Old school farm country. You just drive up their driveway. There's a barn with a fridge in it
[02:26:33.740 --> 02:26:38.060]   You open the fridge you take your eggs you leave your money. You don't see anybody in you go
[02:26:38.060 --> 02:26:43.820]   And it's the best it's the best age you've ever had in your life. These chickens are happy happy chickens
[02:26:43.820 --> 02:26:46.220]   also
[02:26:46.220 --> 02:26:48.220]   The thing about taking things for granted
[02:26:48.220 --> 02:26:50.300]   Um again something that lea reminded me of
[02:26:50.300 --> 02:26:54.860]   We were talking about zoom and all that kind of stuff and she just just saying how she felt bad
[02:26:55.420 --> 02:26:59.660]   That some of these kids are going to be left behind and i look what do you talk about?
[02:26:59.660 --> 02:27:04.140]   She's like some of my friends don't have internet and some of my friends don't have
[02:27:04.140 --> 02:27:10.140]   The a laptop or they couldn't afford the ipads. So they're not going to school
[02:27:10.140 --> 02:27:14.060]   They went yeah, she said they're finally starting to get some of the kids
[02:27:14.060 --> 02:27:18.620]   I guess through a funding or whatever get kids laptops and then now that they've
[02:27:19.180 --> 02:27:25.340]   Comcast has things where they're giving people free internet at least a low cost internet and i it never dawned on me
[02:27:25.340 --> 02:27:28.380]   That kids are going home without internet
[02:27:28.380 --> 02:27:34.380]   It never dawned on me like i'm like they couldn't like and it's it's ignorant to say it was like they couldn't pay 30
[02:27:34.380 --> 02:27:40.780]   Dollars for the ipad now the 30 dollars is a cheap buy-in but you guys been 150 dollars to ensure it which you get the 150
[02:27:40.780 --> 02:27:43.820]   Dollars back, but some people probably couldn't afford that you know
[02:27:43.820 --> 02:27:47.980]   That's 180 dollars out of pocket to have this tablet which when you're in school
[02:27:48.380 --> 02:27:50.380]   It's not a direct necessity
[02:27:50.380 --> 02:27:54.620]   But now it is a necessity and so i was like, what do you mean kids are she's like?
[02:27:54.620 --> 02:27:57.660]   I know people that aren't doing anything because they don't have anything
[02:27:57.660 --> 02:28:02.380]   I I felt so bad because I was like I can't believe I even again. I would talk about you being in a bubble
[02:28:02.380 --> 02:28:07.820]   I'm down on the ground and it just never occurred to me that people in my general town community
[02:28:07.820 --> 02:28:13.180]   Which were okay here just wouldn't have those things we all for their children. We all got our own bubbles
[02:28:13.180 --> 02:28:15.900]   we all got our own bubbles and
[02:28:16.220 --> 02:28:22.300]   One third of students high school students in los angeles not logging in for classes. This is from the New York times where they say
[02:28:22.300 --> 02:28:26.380]   Uh attendance is about 50 percent right now in schools
[02:28:26.380 --> 02:28:31.900]   There are donning challenges. They write for rural communities like minford, oh, high where many students live in remote
[02:28:31.900 --> 02:28:37.740]   Wooded areas unserved by internet providers. What are you how are you going to get education that way?
[02:28:37.740 --> 02:28:42.620]   Yeah, and she even she brought up something to the what kids are doing. She doesn't do it because I
[02:28:43.180 --> 02:28:47.260]   Wake up sometimes at like seven seven o'clock six thirty. She's already doing her school work
[02:28:47.260 --> 02:28:51.020]   She's like some teachers put it in early. So I just get up early so I can get it done by noon
[02:28:51.020 --> 02:28:56.220]   But she said a lot of her friends the teachers don't bother you about it for two weeks
[02:28:56.220 --> 02:29:01.900]   So she's like some friends don't do work for the whole week and then sit there all day friday and do all the work in one day
[02:29:01.900 --> 02:29:04.620]   And i'm like, okay, so they're not getting
[02:29:04.620 --> 02:29:10.300]   Kids are not using kids are not used to this they don't know but but I meant there's no checks and balances for them not logging in
[02:29:10.300 --> 02:29:13.900]   I'm like there's no consequence. Are you not logging in to do your work that day?
[02:29:13.900 --> 02:29:17.740]   She's like no as long as they get it done. Dr. Moms says her high school
[02:29:17.740 --> 02:29:24.620]   Her sister is a high school physics teacher in san diego the board of education there said you're not allowed to flunk students this semester
[02:29:24.620 --> 02:29:29.660]   Uh rightly so because we don't know what hardships those kids are going through. Yeah
[02:29:29.660 --> 02:29:36.300]   Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm sorry. That's her daughter. Not her sister. Thank you. Dr. Moms. It's her daughter
[02:29:37.020 --> 02:29:41.500]   Um, I'm sorry to say, you know, this is going to be kind of a regular
[02:29:41.500 --> 02:29:44.860]   feature of life these days
[02:29:44.860 --> 02:29:48.220]   Uh, who who did the coronavirus get this week
[02:29:48.220 --> 02:29:54.300]   And i'm sad to say that john horton conway is the latest victim 82 years old
[02:29:54.300 --> 02:29:56.780]   A great mathematician
[02:29:56.780 --> 02:30:01.820]   You might know his name because of conway's game of life, which is the most
[02:30:01.820 --> 02:30:04.940]   interesting fascinating
[02:30:05.100 --> 02:30:07.900]   mathematical game programming game you can ever
[02:30:07.900 --> 02:30:09.900]   play
[02:30:09.900 --> 02:30:10.860]   uh
[02:30:10.860 --> 02:30:12.380]   Conway
[02:30:12.380 --> 02:30:15.420]   Was just uh, you know an amazing fellow
[02:30:15.420 --> 02:30:23.180]   Beloved by his students by his friends. He provided puzzles to martin gardener in the scientific american for decade
[02:30:23.180 --> 02:30:26.140]   That's where the game of life first appeared
[02:30:26.140 --> 02:30:28.060]   Um
[02:30:28.060 --> 02:30:29.580]   Dead at 81
[02:30:29.580 --> 02:30:32.300]   Thanks to covid john horton conway
[02:30:33.180 --> 02:30:35.660]   Sorry to have to report that to you
[02:30:35.660 --> 02:30:38.460]   Um
[02:30:38.460 --> 02:30:41.260]   Mac rumors is down just a little public service announcement
[02:30:41.260 --> 02:30:47.660]   Mac rumors has put a list together of all the streaming services offering free content and extended trials
[02:30:47.660 --> 02:30:51.740]   So they put this out on a friday go to macrummers.com
[02:30:51.740 --> 02:30:54.220]   And you can see all the deals
[02:30:54.220 --> 02:31:00.300]   For instance, maybe you didn't want to pay for apple tv. They're offering many of their shows for free right now
[02:31:00.380 --> 02:31:05.980]   Dickinson is good too. Dickinson. Yeah, that's the one i've got to watch because that's everybody says it's unexpected
[02:31:05.980 --> 02:31:10.300]   Those for all mankind for all mankind. It's a little bit like um the jennifer aniston show where it starts off
[02:31:10.300 --> 02:31:16.220]   But then it finishes real hard good. I'm about halfway through it and I I kind of lost interest because it was getting a little soapy
[02:31:16.220 --> 02:31:20.460]   But I was finished but then it finishes hard. Okay. I will because I did like it a lot initially
[02:31:20.460 --> 02:31:25.820]   By the way, some of the greatest tv shows ever made are available for free including
[02:31:25.820 --> 02:31:28.220]   True blood the wire
[02:31:28.220 --> 02:31:32.300]   The sopranos silicon valley and the funniest show ever made vip
[02:31:32.300 --> 02:31:38.940]   HBO is offering that uh for free detective pikachu also ryan rental is amazing in that really
[02:31:38.940 --> 02:31:44.220]   Yeah, he is so good sonic not so much but pik zecha pichu
[02:31:44.220 --> 02:31:47.980]   All right, maybe i'll watch it. It was cute. It was cute a lot
[02:31:47.980 --> 02:31:52.220]   So some some offense taken but you know
[02:31:52.220 --> 02:31:56.940]   I'm already dedicated my life. I liked sonic. It was okay. It was okay
[02:31:57.420 --> 02:32:01.980]   You like sonic a lot. Oh, and the no if sonic kind of voice like ryan redhols, it would have been better
[02:32:01.980 --> 02:32:09.980]   The the difference is is one what you grew up with two. I grew up playing sonic hedgehog like I have my little
[02:32:09.980 --> 02:32:13.260]   I love the idea of the genesis
[02:32:13.260 --> 02:32:20.460]   Sonic about the company is that that's the world's smallest sake of genesis
[02:32:20.460 --> 02:32:23.820]   Where'd you get that and sonic about to come back into my I got it from amazon
[02:32:26.620 --> 02:32:29.340]   Somebody died to send you that oh man
[02:32:29.340 --> 02:32:32.620]   I love my genesis
[02:32:32.620 --> 02:32:41.660]   It's about nostalgia for me
[02:32:41.660 --> 02:32:44.860]   Let's be honest the games are better than the movie
[02:32:44.860 --> 02:32:52.620]   Not with my heart. Okay again. It's it's a bias not fully understands the bias, but it's it's what happens when you see it
[02:32:52.620 --> 02:32:55.420]   It's just how it is
[02:32:55.500 --> 02:32:57.500]   69 99
[02:32:57.500 --> 02:33:00.140]   It's right as well be free money's will be free
[02:33:00.140 --> 02:33:06.780]   Does it come with games on it? It has to because otherwise oh yes preloaded. Oh it has 81 games on it all day
[02:33:06.780 --> 02:33:12.220]   Say

[02:33:17.020 --> 02:33:20.620]   It's a underscribed game. Nobody ever played it, but me but vector man is great
[02:33:20.620 --> 02:33:24.700]   Do they be Jurassic park and the x-men games that are all fire on a justice
[02:33:25.100 --> 02:33:27.100]   Oh
[02:33:27.100 --> 02:33:32.140]   I got to go because I got stuff to do I heard the license thing was hard for like it's for non-first party games
[02:33:32.140 --> 02:33:38.220]   Uh, then nevermind. I'll stay you know what I would actually pay 69 94 94 is the dream cast
[02:33:38.220 --> 02:33:42.780]   They're there is there a little yeah dream cast available. They have to you can make a dream cast
[02:33:42.780 --> 02:33:45.340]   I'll say oh yeah raspberry pie it up. Leo. He's
[02:33:45.340 --> 02:33:50.860]   A raspberry pie for I got chunk of a you can go make yourself one geese on the do on a weekend
[02:33:52.540 --> 02:33:56.060]   Because I love every game system in the world on a raspberry pie. Yeah, it's true
[02:33:56.060 --> 02:33:59.180]   Can you do what your master you can
[02:33:59.180 --> 02:34:02.940]   Uh, let's see what else uh quibi if you watched quibi
[02:34:02.940 --> 02:34:07.500]   Quibi's like a tv to me instead. I don't believe it's a real thing
[02:34:07.500 --> 02:34:12.060]   The international price thing is not the international pricing is not great. Oh
[02:34:12.060 --> 02:34:18.620]   No, no, quibi is quibi is a short form only video content
[02:34:18.620 --> 02:34:23.900]   They raised more than a billion dollars hollywood creators jeffrey katsenberg former hp ceo meg
[02:34:23.900 --> 02:34:25.420]   Whitman and partners
[02:34:25.420 --> 02:34:27.980]   Uh, and they spent a lot of money. They got labron james
[02:34:27.980 --> 02:34:33.020]   They got chrissey tegan doing a judge judy thing john legend shows up as a witness
[02:34:33.020 --> 02:34:36.700]   They've got uh, my favorite is a weird
[02:34:36.700 --> 02:34:42.540]   They have a lot of reality shows. They've got punked his back, but not ashta kutcher. It's chance the rapper now doing that
[02:34:42.540 --> 02:34:45.180]   Uh, but the one kutcher the weirdest thing
[02:34:46.220 --> 02:34:53.020]   Is uh tightest bridges who is so good and uh, the unbreakable kimmy schmitt it's a reality show
[02:34:53.020 --> 02:34:56.860]   And uh, they what is it called they launch
[02:34:56.860 --> 02:35:00.060]   They so they take a meal
[02:35:00.060 --> 02:35:07.260]   And they blend it and they put it in cannons and they get two chefs dressed up in uh protective gear
[02:35:07.260 --> 02:35:09.900]   and they shoot them with the food cannons
[02:35:09.900 --> 02:35:12.540]   and
[02:35:12.540 --> 02:35:15.180]   Then the chefs have to taste the food
[02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:17.660]   and make it
[02:35:17.660 --> 02:35:19.660]   And all of this is in seven minutes
[02:35:19.660 --> 02:35:21.820]   And they win five thousand dollars if they get closest
[02:35:21.820 --> 02:35:25.740]   The thing that's weird about it means like it's not short form content
[02:35:25.740 --> 02:35:29.020]   It's because if they're like they seem to still think like hollywood to them
[02:35:29.020 --> 02:35:32.140]   It's like oh you can go vertical video that means it's new and fancy
[02:35:32.140 --> 02:35:36.780]   And we'll just instead of making a whole show we'll make a show and then cut it up where the commercial breaks would go
[02:35:36.780 --> 02:35:40.140]   Right. That's basically it but it's not like it's not it's not like it's like my
[02:35:41.020 --> 02:35:47.900]   I said before best like your grandfather is making tick-tock. It like it's every hollywood thing that's three years after the bad is over
[02:35:47.900 --> 02:35:48.620]   Yeah
[02:35:48.620 --> 02:35:54.140]   It is did to get 300,000 downloads when it launched this week three number three on the app store
[02:35:54.140 --> 02:35:58.060]   And here's the best thing if if you're playing fortnite
[02:35:58.060 --> 02:36:00.940]   You can watch punk
[02:36:00.940 --> 02:36:03.660]   in fortnite
[02:36:03.660 --> 02:36:05.660]   That's this is marketing obviously
[02:36:05.660 --> 02:36:07.660]   It'll be airing. I hate their marketing
[02:36:07.660 --> 02:36:11.820]   It'll be airing hourly at risky reels the drive-in theater in fortnite's island
[02:36:11.820 --> 02:36:16.380]   Now people got better things to do in fortnite than watch this trash kill you while you're watching it

[02:40:31.500 --> 02:40:34.220]   from reverend o doctor
[02:40:34.220 --> 02:40:36.700]   so leah
[02:40:36.860 --> 02:40:40.380]   A long time ago my father passed away leah was about like four or five
[02:40:40.380 --> 02:40:44.380]   And I thought to myself my dad passed away too young and I was missing out on things
[02:40:44.380 --> 02:40:46.700]   So every year
[02:40:46.700 --> 02:40:53.020]   Since then I made videos for leah in case I have it a pathway my health isn't the greatest so that she would have lessons to learn
[02:40:53.020 --> 02:40:59.180]   Friendship wedding dating all kinds of things and as she progresses in age and I teach her these things
[02:40:59.180 --> 02:41:06.540]   I delete those videos then I make new videos and leah with the covid thing going on has requested that I start teaching her things now
[02:41:07.340 --> 02:41:10.380]   Instead of having to wait in case you get hit by the bug
[02:41:10.380 --> 02:41:15.340]   So I can't think of it by the book. So um we're doing our podcast. We just did one about friendship
[02:41:15.340 --> 02:41:20.700]   Um, we did one where you talk about all the shows we watch and uh, we're gonna be doing more intricate things
[02:41:20.700 --> 02:41:27.020]   I'm teaching her how to cook my personal meals so that she could always have the flavor of the father's cooking
[02:41:27.020 --> 02:41:31.740]   But we're doing fun stuff over here in these streets and if anything you're doing where you're sitting at home
[02:41:31.740 --> 02:41:35.740]   I know some of you are frustrated with your spouse or your kids and they're driving you crazy
[02:41:35.900 --> 02:41:39.340]   But one thing that's great is time you can never get back time
[02:41:39.340 --> 02:41:42.620]   So enjoy the time that you are getting the extra time you have with your children
[02:41:42.620 --> 02:41:44.940]   You get to impress upon them
[02:41:44.940 --> 02:41:50.380]   What you want them to be when you grow up because normally you ship them off to school for eight hours and other kids get to influence them
[02:41:50.380 --> 02:41:53.500]   Take this extra time like it's the summer time and influence them
[02:41:53.500 --> 02:41:57.980]   And your family's traditions and your hopes and dreams for them and things that you want them to do
[02:41:57.980 --> 02:42:02.380]   And if anybody again would like to come by here and save me from having to do all this soap work
[02:42:02.780 --> 02:42:07.660]   I am available on Amazon Prime and I will be ready to go
[02:42:07.660 --> 02:42:15.580]   All right, oh that almost may be that almost may be crazy as much as Hamilton. Oh, well there we go
[02:42:15.580 --> 02:42:18.540]   Say bye to people. Thank you lea. Thank you

[02:42:21.660 --> 02:42:26.140]   If if I could be quarantined if I could pick anybody to be quarantined with besides my family
[02:42:26.140 --> 02:42:30.060]   This would be our house. It'd be this would be our house. Take care everybody
[02:42:31.100 --> 02:42:33.340]   Another twit is in the can he said it
