[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:56.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.560]   Welcome to this weekend tech.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.360]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.800]   And this is the week the prime number hit the fan,
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.080]   joining us to talk about it and all the tech news,
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.240]   johncdevorac.org/blog.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.160]   Hello, John.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.000]   Hey, what about them warriors, eh?
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.520]   Go Warriors.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.280]   That's right, they went on fun Thursday night.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.280]   That's the biggest upset in the history of the league.
[00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.280]   Against all odds, beating the dominant Dallas Mavericks
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.720]   and Mark Cuban at the same time.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.320]   Yeah, well, you know, Mark's a good guy.
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.360]   It was a grudge match, though.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.920]   I think Don Nelson claims a Cuban owes
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.240]   and millions of dollars from when he worked for the Mavs.
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.080]   Yeah, that seems to be the case.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.400]   Not a lot of love loss there.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.200]   So I think Don Nelson, the coach of the Warriors,
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.480]   is very happy about this win, for many reasons.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.000]   Somebody who is not celebrating right now,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.520]   because he's in Boston, Andy and not Co.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.720]   Oh, it's a lifelong celebration.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.560]   We're in Boston.
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.240]   See the freedom and democracy.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.640]   Come with the Red Sox who won the World Series once long,
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.840]   long, long.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.560]   That was that long ago.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.160]   They won recently.
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.480]   Didn't they win recently?
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.720]   Well, we still have your tax dollars, so we're happy.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.200]   That's all in that.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.080]   Thanks for the road.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.360]   And Brand new, joining us for the first-- actually, second.
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.000]   No, I guess the first time on Twitter.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.400]   Jackie Chang, she is the editor for-- and writer for ours,
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.800]   Technica, which is, as we've said several times now,
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.240]   become rapidly becoming my new technosource of choice.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.240]   Hey, guys.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.400]   Does the Mac blog there.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.040]   Hey, Jackie, thank you for joining us.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.360]   Yes, thank you.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.480]   You're not a complete stranger, because you were on Mac
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.400]   break weekly when we--
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.040]   Yes, that's right.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.880]   --life from some crowded bar in San Francisco.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.520]   Yeah, that was really crowded that time.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.640]   Hey, but you got through the crowd, and that's what counts.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.360]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.920]   I think crowded is probably the word
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.440]   that Kevin Rose is using these days to describe
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.320]   his experience at Dig.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.880]   Interesting story there.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.560]   Why don't you set us up, Jackie?
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.280]   How did it begin?
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.160]   What happened?
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.920]   We have an interview I recorded with Kevin yesterday.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.760]   So once you set it up, we'll go to Kevin.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.440]   Well, as I understand it, one of Dig's users posted--
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.920]   I guess made a submission with the AACS key,
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.280]   and they removed it because they had received a cease and desist.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.040]   And I guess--
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.920]   That's when the number hit the fan.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.480]   Yeah, I mean, to make a long story short,
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.680]   Dig users were not happy, and they thought it was censorship
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.200]   and this and that.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.280]   And so they just started submitting stories.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.400]   I asked Kevin Rose yesterday.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.320]   We tried to get him on the show, but he was not
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.120]   available for the show.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.520]   But I did ask him yesterday, and he recorded a little bit
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.960]   with us when he first knew he was in trouble.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.880]   Yeah, I knew the second we did the takedown.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.760]   I mean, it's just a series of numbers and letters.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.080]   Obviously, you could post this anywhere you want to in our comments
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.640]   or anywhere else.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.160]   But I think that this really just kind of struck a chord
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.200]   with people in that they really see Dig is this place where they
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.280]   can come that is this neutral kind of level playing field
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.120]   and that this was very much a gray area
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.640]   and that they didn't want to see us
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.720]   cow down to a larger corporation and wanted us to stand up
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.120]   for their freedom of speech.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.400]   But you've done takedowns before.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.280]   I mean, if you don't do the takedown, don't you open yourself
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.600]   up to losing the safe harbor?
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.640]   You know, I really don't know how--
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.640]   Did you guys just go to lawyers?
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.880]   What did you do?
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.040]   Well, anytime we get a notice from anyone,
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.920]   we sit down and we figure out where it's from
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.920]   and then contact our attorneys and sit down and discuss
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.080]   what we should do about the notice.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.600]   And this case wasn't clear right away what we should do.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.200]   I mean, obviously when you get a takedown notice from someone
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.400]   that is linking directly to a zip file of Photoshop,
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.800]   it's pretty straightforward.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.200]   You remove the link.
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.640]   But in this case, it was something
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.560]   that was just a series of numbers and letters.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.320]   And for us, we didn't know how to respond.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.160]   And of course, you talk to your attorneys,
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.560]   you take their advice and their advice
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.200]   was to remove it, to try and avoid a lawsuit.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.920]   You banned the poster, though.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.800]   Well, what we did is when a user--
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.520]   what was happening is that people were creating accounts
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.680]   and posting it over and over and over again.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.320]   And so, yeah, what we did is went in and banned the people
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.640]   that just kept posting it.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.160]   And a lot of the times it was a little bit of people
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.200]   being upset.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.920]   And so there would be profanity in the posts
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:52.320]   and just really lashing out at dig over the fact
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.480]   that we started removing this.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.280]   So of course, we're going to remove that stuff from the site.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.280]   But anyone that contacted us that said, hey, I want back in.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.240]   We just unban their accounts right away.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.880]   At what point did you start thinking maybe we should change
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.080]   our policy?
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.960]   Well, it was kind of a weird day for me
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.520]   because I've been kind of all over the place.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.240]   I was actually heading to the airport
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.560]   because I was flying down for a conference in LA
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.440]   why this was going on.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.680]   So I went to the airport.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.960]   I was talking-- I hopped on the internet
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.280]   while I was there for 20 minutes.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.800]   And then I was on a plane.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.720]   Then LA traffic took me like an hour
[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:36.120]   to get back to my hotel room.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.200]   So I got back online about 8.30 that night.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.000]   And then it was very clear to me.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.280]   I mean, I pulled up the home page at dig
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.280]   and I was just filled with stories.
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.600]   And I was just reading through all these comments.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.280]   And it was pretty clear that they were disappointed
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.320]   that we didn't stand up for them and go to bat for the community.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.880]   And so I was talking to Jay on the phone
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.520]   and we both said, hey, this is something
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.560]   where we should have the back of our community
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.040]   and go to bat for them and stand up for what we believe in.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.000]   So we decided to make that call.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.200]   I had this fantasy, this vision of you all in a room shouting,
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.000]   let's do this.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.280]   There was no dissent.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.960]   Everybody agreed this is a decision to do.
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.680]   Honestly, there was a lot of mixed feelings
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.160]   with internally here at day.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.760]   This is a risky thing to do.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.320]   Isn't it a risky thing to do?
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.960]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.680]   It is one of these things where,
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.360]   if we do get sued, this company has a lot more money than we do.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:47.560]   And they could damage us and they could put us out of business.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.000]   So you have to decide what's most important to you.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.040]   And for us, as you know, it's not like we're
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.880]   writing the content on the dig front page.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.720]   I mean, we live and breathe by our users and our community.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.600]   And if no one digs, no stories make it to the front page,
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:05.560]   and we die.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.720]   So we have to take them into consideration on every decision
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.760]   we make on the website.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.800]   I don't know if you talk this over with your lawyers,
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.120]   but once you make that decision, you actually
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.480]   are at a greater risk of losing your safe harbor protection.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.240]   I mean, that's another risk, which
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.920]   would make you a publisher in a different way
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.680]   than you are right now.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.240]   Did you talk about that at all?
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.240]   Yeah, I mean, we've had a bunch of different discussions
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.720]   with our lawyers about the different risks involved here.
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:43.760]   And we feel fairly confident in--
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.680]   I mean, I'm sure you've read the stuff on the EFF
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.640]   and other websites about how this is.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.240]   It's so out there now that this is kind of--
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.240]   I mean--
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.240]   There's nothing you could do.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.720]   Yeah, there's not much you can do to stop it.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.160]   Corey Dottoroa, when he got the takedown, took it down,
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.240]   but replaced it with the takedown letter, which
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.040]   included the number in the letter.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:06.640]   Right.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.280]   I thought that was--
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.120]   Which was brilliant.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.920]   That was a clever response.
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:11.120]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.480]   I mean, we're honestly Leo.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.160]   I mean, with any of these community sites,
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.160]   I mean, you run a very large community site yourself.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.160]   You learn.
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.880]   And we're learning about our community
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.920]   and how best to interact with a million users.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:31.200]   So this whole thing for us has just been quite the 48 hours.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.920]   What do you think the upshot of this is?
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.040]   I mean, you're still going to do take--
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.440]   respond a takedown notice, as I'm sure you have to.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:43.600]   Well, I mean, we're going to look at each individual notice
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.440]   as they come in.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.720]   But I mean, this isn't something that we receive all the time.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.200]   We do get notices from time to time.
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.760]   And for the most part, it's pretty straightforward.
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:59.680]   I mean, there's certain things that we will remove
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.960]   from the site of pornography.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.480]   There was a time here about a year ago
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.720]   when there was a large group of--
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.080]   it was a hate group, a racial hate group that
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.120]   came on the site and decided to dig nothing but racial hate
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:14.720]   stories.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.000]   And we weren't going to allow that on the site either.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.240]   So that was stuff that we pulled.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.000]   But I mean, the good news is that the dig community
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   is very good at leasing this on their own.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.200]   I mean, we received between 7,000 to 10,000
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.160]   new submitted stories per day.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:33.200]   And in the community, if and when these stories do start
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.400]   to surface that are against the terms of service,
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.320]   99% of the time they're buried.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.320]   No, I don't.
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.320]   I don't.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.000]   Which is nice, because that means that we can maintain
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.240]   a small group of employees here.
[00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.480]   And we don't have to have 100 people
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.440]   moderating and watching the site.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.000]   We want to continue to provide tools
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.240]   and give the community the power.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.000]   I'm trying to pull up this Michael Malone article on ABC.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.640]   And every time I do some some idiot starts to talk in here.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.080]   Did you read the article?
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.080]   No, I didn't.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.800]   Pretty critical.
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.920]   He said it was digging their own grave.
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.240]   He said-- I don't--
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.720]   I mean, I think he's full of it.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:18.280]   But he said he's quoting your blog post, which
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.240]   you put up on Tuesday night saying, at the end,
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.680]   if we lose, and what the hell, at least we die trying.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.120]   Now quoting Michael Malone.
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.600]   In other words, dig was willing to block porn
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.040]   and hate sites was perfectly willing to violate trade secrets
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.840]   if its users said so.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.240]   It was a breathtaking abrogation of responsibility
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.960]   by a person in a position of authority.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.760]   You must love being in a position of authority.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.560]   Oh, boy.
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.360]   If you sign up to be sheriff, he says,
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.040]   in a rewarded handsomely for doing so, your job,
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.360]   when the howling mob shows up outside the jails
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.880]   to defend the prisoner under attack,
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.200]   even if you despise him.
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.080]   Do you think you caved?
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.920]   Do the howling mob?
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.960]   Well, I mean, I think what really happened internally
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.840]   is everyone sat down and we realized
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:06.520]   that this isn't a clear, cut and dry case of someone violating
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.200]   and breaking a law.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.920]   I mean, we've seen this happen, Leo, before.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:17.280]   I remember the original DVD, "In Encryption" was broken.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.960]   And we saw it on t-shirts.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.840]   We saw it all over the place.
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:25.480]   And the community has a lot of great pushback
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:30.880]   in that this is a series of numbers and is it free speech?
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:35.520]   I mean, this is something where we believe
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.920]   in the rights to free speech, everything
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.960]   that is submitted to dig automatically falls
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.600]   under the creative commons and is public domain.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.200]   And we want to keep it that way.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.680]   And that's something that we should have seen earlier.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.000]   We didn't and we made a mistake and we corrected it.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.560]   Iowa Hawk said in response to the-- it's
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.840]   a series of numbers argument.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.440]   Well, so is Kevin Rose's home address.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.000]   And he posted it.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.920]   That must have been a nice feeling for you.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.960]   You didn't see that?
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.240]   I didn't see that.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:10.640]   But people can come hang out in my house if they want to.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.880]   You don't have to say that.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:17.520]   It's got to be difficult for you because on the one hand,
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.160]   I know what your personal opinion is.
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:19.680]   Everybody.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.960]   Oh, yeah, of course.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.520]   And I share it with you.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.760]   Well, I'm totally anti-DRM.
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.400]   And I'm not a huge fan of the DMCA.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.920]   So it's like-- and I've been that way.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.600]   And so have you for quite some time.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.120]   And yet, and I posted this in our forums.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.840]   If I'd got the same takedown notice,
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:39.920]   I would have had to respond.
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.160]   I mean, you can't--
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:42.600]   it's difficult.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.800]   You risk your site if you don't do it.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.440]   It is the law of the land, whether you like it or not.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:52.880]   So you made an interesting decision, a risky decision.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.120]   Are you comfortable with it now?
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:54.480]   Still?
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.040]   I am.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:55.920]   Absolutely.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.280]   Well, thank you for joining us.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.240]   I appreciate it.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.200]   Yeah, thanks for having me.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:00.840]   It's Kevin Rose.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.320]   It's a good work.
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.960]   It's recorded to come back and join us on Twitter
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.480]   when you get a little time.
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.200]   Definitely.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.400]   Recorded yesterday, Kevin Rose.
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.680]   And he is a reaction to the events of May 1st.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.440]   I want to correct one thing before we discuss this.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.960]   I talked today with Denise Howell, who
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.120]   does this week in law on the Twitter network
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.840]   as an actual lawyer.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.000]   And she tells me, in fact, it's not a takedown notice
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.600]   that they got.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.880]   They got a demand letter.
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.600]   And there's a significant difference.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:31.840]   This has nothing to do with the Safe Harbor DMCA clause.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:36.640]   This has everything to do with what they call copy protection
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.080]   circumvention.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.160]   And the demand letter merely says
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.680]   that you have content on your site that contains information
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.360]   about circumventing copy protection,
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.720]   and we ask you to take it down.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.160]   It's the first step.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.000]   It doesn't have the weight of a takedown notice.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.440]   And you can be ignored easily, although, of course,
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.960]   you risk a lawsuit if you do.
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:59.640]   So he doesn't risk their protection
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.880]   under the Safe Harbor clause of the DMCA.
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.360]   So John, you've been listening to all this.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.320]   You must have some reaction to it.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.200]   Actually--
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:09.680]   Yeah.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.600]   Oh, I'm getting it.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:10.960]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.880]   I learned myself.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.840]   Go ahead.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.840]   I do that, so he gives you more--
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.680]   Yeah, I sound like we're gravitas.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.680]   Anyway, yeah, I actually was on CNBC on Thursday.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.960]   I heard people thought you did a really good job, actually.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.600]   Yeah, I could have done a better job
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.680]   if they would give me more than 35 seconds.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.680]   But anyway, the point I was--
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.680]   there's a lawyer that was there, and I said,
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.680]   well, my question to him was, what can you do with this number?
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.680]   What's this number good for?
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.680]   Who cares?
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.680]   It's like a useless number.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.680]   And he says, well, I don't know.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.680]   I'm not technical enough to do that.
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:48.680]   He's bumbling away.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:49.680]   I said, well, you know, I'm pretty technical.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.680]   I don't know what to do with this thing.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.680]   It's like a useless number.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.680]   It's just a number.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.680]   And I mean, you would take somebody to design software.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:57.680]   Oh, you saw it.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.680]   The software's out there.
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.680]   And this--
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.680]   Well, you know, I got just a memo from somebody
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.680]   a few minutes ago, in fact, that described the mechanism
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.680]   to actually use this thing and how to do it.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.680]   It's a horrible--
[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:09.680]   It's a fun.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.680]   You'd be there for--
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.680]   What is your time worth?
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:13.680]   And you get a non--
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.680]   --to get a gigabyte file that you can't really do anything with.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.680]   So huge.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.680]   It's ridiculous.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.680]   So anyway, so it's a useless situation.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.680]   But anyway, so I called them on that.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.680]   And it was like, you know, it was--
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.680]   I think the whole thing is silly.
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.680]   And my comment was that if you had it's done nothing,
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.680]   this number would have just been a curiosity floating around.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.680]   But now you've alerted every hacker in the world
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.680]   that they have this code that they can implement.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.680]   And software will appear now.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.680]   I don't know whether it would have or not.
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.680]   I think it would have stayed underground.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.680]   It would have been used by a few people who don't mind, you know,
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.680]   generally speaking, if you want to watch a DVD on your laptop,
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:48.680]   you don't--
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.680]   I don't think you really care if it's HD or not.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.680]   It's not-- your screen's not that big.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.680]   If you're boing, boing, this number.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.680]   I mean, boing, boing.
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.680]   If you Google this number, this comes from Boing, boing.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.680]   It's something like 600,000 places now on the Internet.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.680]   And Corey Doctorow has pointed out on Boing, boing.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.680]   That more people have this number now than have HD DVD players.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.680]   Well, maybe this is how they should sell the players.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.680]   So-- but the whole thing is ridiculous.
[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.680]   And my point-- and I made this point over and over and over again--
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.680]   is that if these lawyers do not talk to public relations counsel,
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:24.680]   they do these crazy things.
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.680]   They send these things out to supposedly protect their client.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.680]   They get their clients in trouble.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.680]   They popularize things.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.680]   MP3, I think, would still be underground if it wasn't for all these lawsuits.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.680]   And the next thing you know, they throw-- they put a business out of it
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.680]   or an industry out of business because they make a big stink
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.680]   in a situation where they can't really do anything except shake, you know,
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.680]   your saber rattle.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:45.680]   Here's a good example.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:50.680]   This is one of our stories, which is, you know, they made a list of all the top ten counterfeit
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.680]   or pirate countries in the world.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.680]   And there's a whole bunch of them listed, you know, including Israel.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.680]   They don't mention Malaysia, which I think is the center of a lot of this,
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.680]   because they just assume these guys, these lawyers, these, you know, hot shots,
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:08.680]   they just assume go after some teenager, you know, at a college who's got a big record collection
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.680]   and he really doesn't listen to it because he hasn't got that many hours in the day.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.680]   But will they go into-- off the coast of Malaysia and bust some of those ships
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.680]   that are run by the triads?
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.680]   The real pirates.
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.680]   The gangsters?
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.680]   The real pirates, the guys who are real, real pirates.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.680]   They won't touch those guys because they don't want to get hurt.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.680]   So this whole thing just irks me to know when.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.680]   Patrick Norton is, I think, on the line with us.
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.680]   I haven't heard a peep out of him.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.680]   Can you talk to us, Patrick?
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.680]   No, he's just sitting there quietly.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.680]   As soon as Patrick gets his input device working, I sure like to hear from him
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:44.680]   because he's always been really kind of strongly against piracy of any kind.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.680]   But as you point out, John, it's just a number.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:54.680]   It doesn't have any utility until you go through all these hoops to make it do something.
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.680]   But what about Dig?
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:01.680]   I mean, Jackie, there's an article in your website, Ars Technica,
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:06.680]   in which the AACS, I don't know if he's a lawyer, but the people who make this--
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:11.680]   the licensing authority for AACS, this copy protection, was furious.
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:15.680]   He says this is an internet revolt.
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.680]   And he says a line is crossed when we start seeing keys being distributed
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.680]   and tools for circumvention.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:24.680]   You step outside the realm of protected fees, free speech then.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:30.680]   Yeah, I actually haven't followed quite that closely today.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.680]   But yeah, I've heard that they're just--
[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.680]   They're rattling their savers.
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.680]   They're saying, you know, I don't care about any internet revolts.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.680]   You know, this is still-- they're still backing it.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:50.680]   This is a quote from Michael Ayer as a chairman of the AACS LA.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:55.680]   "If the local neighborhood gang is throwing rocks at your house, some people might tell you--"
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.680]   There's an analogy.
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.680]   Some boys, boys, crazy boys.
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.680]   Stay cool, boys.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:06.680]   People might tell you, he says, not to call the police because they're just going to throw bigger rocks.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.680]   But the point--
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.680]   So he's really kind of patriot?
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:11.680]   I don't know.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.680]   God bless him.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.680]   He's protecting you, Leo, and me and everybody else.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.680]   Because they're rock throwing keys.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.680]   Acck's dollar should go towards helping-- oh, wait a minute, tax dollars are going out to help.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:25.680]   But now it does raise a point that this dig revolt is clearly a children's war, right?
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.680]   I mean, people aren't-- these aren't adults.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.680]   Yeah, I mean, it is a children's crusade.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.680]   When you see people-- I mean, good and gracious.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.680]   I saw a guy with a tattoo of the key over--
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.680]   That's just nuts.
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.680]   --on his heart.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.680]   And I'm like, okay, let's go out for a nice little walk in the park.
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.680]   Let's notice that the sun is still shining.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.680]   Let's see that democracy still rains over the United States of America
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:51.680]   and that this really isn't so bad that you need to have ink subcutaneously applied
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.680]   underneath the surface of your skin.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:58.680]   I imagine this guy 30 years later telling his grandkids, "Yeah, this is what in Grandpa's sh--"
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.680]   "Stuck it to the man.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.680]   Why are you living freedom today?"
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.680]   I'd like to hear him explain what it means.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:07.680]   But I do think there's a little bit of civil disobedience here, and I kind of like seeing that.
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.680]   I think for many of these kids it might be their first political act ever.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.680]   And it's a way of saying, I mean, what are they protesting against?
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.680]   Is it protesting against dig and banning people?
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.680]   Is it protesting against the AACS encryption?
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.680]   Or is it just protesting against DRM in general?
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:26.680]   I think it's plugging into a whole bunch of different things that are just free-floating
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.680]   in the atmosphere right now.
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.680]   One of them is corporations who want to take away your rights.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:35.680]   And when you talk about refusing to allow people to copy material for your own personal use
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.680]   that you've actually legally gone out and bought, that is taking away a basic right.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:44.680]   You're talking about the basic stupidity of these organizations who think that slamming the Internet
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.680]   with these cease and desist orders is actually going to work towards their own best interests.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.680]   I mean, if anything, every time one of these incidents happens, and I see the firestorm
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.680]   that these guys just didn't see coming, I really do feel a little bit of sympathy
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.680]   for the RIA and the NPAA and all these other four-letter organizations,
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.680]   not because I think they're idiots and they're dinosaurs, but because it's sort of like,
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.680]   you know, if the news came that the planet Earth is dying, we burned out the atmosphere,
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:12.680]   we're going to be, you know, this is a dead planet in 500 years, we need to get off.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.680]   We have technology that will take us to another planet, and it looks like it'll work,
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.680]   but we don't know for sure.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.680]   There are so many billions of people who would say, no, no, no, you must be wrong.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.680]   We're going to stick to this dying planet because you must be wrong.
[00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:23.680]   You must be wrong.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:27.680]   It terrifies us this idea of this new world that we're going to have to explore
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.680]   and figure out for ourselves, and that's exactly the situation that content providers are in
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:34.680]   when they think about a world in which there is no DRM.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:39.680]   It terrifies them to such an extent that it makes them do things that are just not in their best interests.
[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:43.680]   Do you think, John DeWark, we'll look back on May 1st, 2007 and say that was the beginning
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.680]   of the end for DRM?
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.680]   No.
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.680]   I think there'll be a lot more incidents that will be the beginning of the end.
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:50.680]   This is just a skirmish.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:56.680]   The funny thing, this group that's sitting here and doing this chatting on our show,
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:01.680]   we are actually all of us combined are serious content creators.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.680]   We're not like a bunch of commenters, even though there's content there, too.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:11.680]   I've been a content creator for a long time, and I have been in total disagreement with most of these boneheads
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:19.680]   because writers, for example, have essentially had their materials stolen since the invention of the Xerox machine.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.680]   It just happens all the time.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.680]   We've all adjusted to it.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.680]   You live with it.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:30.680]   Obviously, you live with somebody taking a whole book that you did and then reprinting it like he used to do in Southeast Asia.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:36.680]   That's, again, what I'm saying, these guys are more concerned about what's the equivalent of the Xerox machine.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.680]   You know, guys making one or two copies of something.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:45.680]   Then they are with the triads off the coast of Malaysia and a big ship with a stamping machine,
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.680]   making millions of dollars with the disks.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:52.680]   To be fair, the people in this country have access to email and fax machines in the legal system.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:57.680]   They don't have access to zodiac boats with M50s to go out hunting for triads.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:02.680]   I really do agree with your sentiment that they're swatting at flies and they should be going at elephants,
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.680]   but they're doing what they could easily do right here and right now.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.680]   They're doing their take in the easy way out.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.680]   They're taking the software to make it look like they're doing something.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:14.680]   That's why they're doing it because they're working with the United States government that's willing to help them
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.680]   because we have laws in this country to defend copyrights.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:21.680]   When you're talking about laws overseas, sometimes the governments, they just don't care.
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.680]   They're perfectly happy with all those counterfeiters going out there.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.680]   Obviously.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.680]   I'm not signing with them and saying that they're doing smart stuff.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:34.680]   I'm just saying that, you know, just because some guys steal in gasoline out of my truck out front,
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.680]   that doesn't mean I'm not going to put a lock on the door.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.680]   That doesn't mean I'm not going to put a camera out there to try to catch them,
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.680]   even though they're people who might be stealing me blind.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:44.680]   I didn't radio interview on...
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.680]   Well, wait, wait, wait, let's go back to this argument.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:51.680]   So you're saying that the people that are stealing you blind are less important than the guys stealing your gasoline?
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.680]   No, I'm not.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.680]   I'm saying that why do I have to pick one target?
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.680]   Why can't I quickly swat at the guy who's stealing my gasoline and also try to figure out the guy who's
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.680]   who's operating plants out of my backyard?
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.680]   All right.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:06.680]   When you're talking about taking on both, I'm saying that these guys don't care about those other guys off the coast of Malaysia.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.680]   I'm very certain that they do.
[00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:12.680]   Well, they... I don't even hear lip service about it.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.680]   What makes you think they do?
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.680]   I mean, what specifically have you heard?
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:22.680]   I've basically heard about them supporting anti-couder fitting measures in Taiwan and Korea.
[00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:23.680]   I should just share this with you.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.680]   I don't try to share these places.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.680]   Not very successfully.
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.680]   Right.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:33.680]   I did a radio interview the day it happened, and the reporter kept asking me this question.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.680]   Well, what do you suggest we replace this with?
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.680]   What do you suggest we replace this with?
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.680]   Are you saying John forget copy protection entirely?
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.680]   It doesn't work.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:44.680]   I mean, she didn't...
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:45.680]   No, I can't say this.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.680]   You can't have it.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.680]   It doesn't work.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.680]   This is an exam.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.680]   It doesn't work.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.680]   Find something else.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:55.680]   Find... you know, what are you putting all this content on?
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.680]   We said essentially computer disks, which are readable by computers.
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:03.680]   Once you do that, I mean, if you want to do something that works,
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:08.680]   you can find some proprietary media and a proprietary player that you sell that can't be read by a computer.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.680]   Well, that's kind of what they're trying to do with Vista.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.680]   Hey, I think I hear Patrick Norton in the background.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.680]   Trying to do this.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.680]   Is it still a computer?
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.680]   What are you supposed to do here?
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.680]   Patrick, are you there?
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:23.680]   Having, for some reason, the line input on my MacBook seems to have died.
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.680]   Well, I'm hearing you, so that's good.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:29.680]   That's because I've just switched to the internal microphone that I'm speaking very carefully.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.680]   Everybody's on a internal mic today.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.680]   That's fine, Jack.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.680]   I mean, I'm using a PC.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.680]   I don't have these issues.
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:40.680]   If you look at an IFPA report, the International Phonographique,
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.680]   whatever it is association, the sort of international version of the IFPA,
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:49.680]   they do a breakdown of pretty much all of the countries they're concerned about for piracy.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.680]   And there's similar things that exist.
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:53.680]   They're trying to fight it.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.680]   Oops, they are trying to fight it.
[00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:59.680]   Yeah, I mean, but they are trying to fight it, but what they... what they kind of do is they've got an international organization
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:03.680]   that looks at everything in the recording industry, and then the regional organization,
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:08.680]   like the RIAA, is responsible for sort of doing its thing in the United States.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:13.680]   The AACS is really interesting, because AACS's job, who's been issuing a lot of the CCNS,
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.680]   or whatever they're calling the official medical term for this,
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:20.680]   the demand letters, which is basically, we don't want to get involved in all the heavy legal lifting.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:21.680]   We're going to send you a letter.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.680]   Do you stop?
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.680]   We have a relationship with you.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.680]   Yeah, quit it, right?
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.680]   Stop it.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.680]   Hey, stop it.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:30.680]   And that's why we don't have to fire up the attack lawyers.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:36.680]   So what's going on here is AACS, they don't care about DVD sales directly.
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:41.680]   What they care about is protecting the reputation of AACS.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:45.680]   Nothing left to protect from a very real standpoint at this point.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:52.680]   You can purchase online software that'll do what people are... John's like, "It's 32 stages,
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:56.680]   and it's a wicked rip and pain in the tuckus to implement this key."
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.680]   I agree.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:01.680]   But you can actually already download somebody... people have already put together applications
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.680]   that allow you to back the information up.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:04.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:08.680]   Slice off any DVD, there's a couple others.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:10.680]   Of course, remember that the DCSS code, when it first came out,
[00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:14.680]   all it could do was give you a Game Boy resolution for a bit useless file,
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:18.680]   but now we have really great tools like Handbrake that just keeps evolving and evolving and evolving.
[00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.680]   I think that's what's happened here, is the motion picture in history said, "Shoot,
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:26.680]   we blew it with DVD, but we're going to create a new format, HD DVD in Blu-ray,
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.680]   and by God, we're going to make sure there's no way it can be cracked."
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:34.680]   Here it is, a month or two in, it's been cracked and it must be driving them crazy.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:38.680]   Well, the color friends, the rabbits will never burn under this one.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.680]   Yeah.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.680]   And thus went Australia.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:47.680]   But what's interesting, I mean, John, I get you, right?
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:51.680]   There's huge copyright, there's basically huge piracy operations in Russia,
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:57.680]   there's huge property operations in China and a number of other countries around the world.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.680]   And I think mostly what the MPAA is worried about is,
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.680]   this makes it that much easier for those guys to start stealing, right?
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.680]   If these tools become so commonly available on the web,
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:11.680]   and two, they don't want people, the more people get used to not paying for things,
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:15.680]   the harder it is for them to implement a long-term strategy that involves making money.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.680]   Actually, people do pay for those discs when you go to China,
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.680]   and only the thing is it's a dollar or two, so it doesn't look like the motion's in history.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.680]   Well, you know, I've never been convinced of that either.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:29.680]   And when Patrick makes the assertion that this just makes it easier for these guys to copy,
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.680]   that's nonsense, because most of these discs that you run into,
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.680]   if you go to South East Asia and wander around,
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.680]   these discs are coming out months before the movies themselves.
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:38.680]   Spider-Man's Police already have the...
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:42.680]   Of course, they already have the files from whoever the manufacturers are,
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:46.680]   or maybe even from Hollywood itself, that they have the original data files.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.680]   They don't need to use any of these kind of tricks to decode these movies.
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.680]   They've already got the original stuff right there,
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:55.680]   and it's already been cranked out before these movies even appear, so that's bull.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:56.680]   Okay, well...
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.680]   I stand correct.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.680]   I felt good about this.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:00.680]   In some ways, I felt good about this whole thing.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:03.680]   It felt like to me, the internet...
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:07.680]   Yeah, it's just a number, blah, blah, blah, but it kind of stood up to these guys and said,
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:11.680]   "Look, who has more power? We do, as consumers very rarely do you see consumers on this,
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:16.680]   stand up and say, 'We don't like it. We're not going to take it anymore.'"
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.680]   Yeah, but Leo, you're not...
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.680]   No, this is...
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:24.680]   I'm not buying this because this is maybe 5,000 core users...
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.680]   No, no, no more than that.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.680]   ...registered users out of the million...
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.680]   15,000.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:28.680]   15,000.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.680]   Whatever.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.680]   15,000.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.680]   That's how many digs the first story got.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.680]   So it's got 15,000, right?
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.680]   But the stuff that really nailed...
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:36.680]   Well, that's a lot of people.
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.680]   You know what?
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.680]   That's how there's one million registered users on Dig, Leo.
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.680]   Well, there's 15,000.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.680]   Well, also, I feel like...
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:52.680]   I feel like people would not have started all of this if Dig didn't, I guess, remove and ban the first article.
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.680]   So I thought...
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:59.680]   I kind of felt like it was a lot more revolt against what they thought was censorship on Dig.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:05.680]   Well, Kevin did make his reputation as the dark tipper and the broken.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.680]   So for Kevin Rose to say, "Oh, we better pull this down."
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.680]   The man says, "Shut up."
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.680]   But that's also part of the terms of agreement.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.680]   And it's something they've been doing for the two years Dig has been around.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:18.680]   I mean, this just went viral.
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:19.680]   It went viral.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.680]   But to me, that's exciting in some ways.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.680]   I feel like it's good.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.680]   But Leo, you're calling this a consumer revolt.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:26.680]   I mean, who's the consumer?
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:27.680]   This is a...
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.680]   I've consumed...
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.680]   What's the revolt against a number?
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:31.680]   Somebody posted.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.680]   Somebody pulled it down and sounded for the symbol.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.680]   It's a symbol.
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:35.680]   What's the consumer?
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.680]   What are we consuming?
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:37.680]   The whole point is it's a symbol.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:41.680]   And I do think there is a consumer revolt building against copy protection.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:46.680]   If nothing else, more and more people are learning how to crack it.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.680]   I think it's the same people.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:51.680]   I don't think there's that many people that are interested in copy...
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:53.680]   I mean, are interested in cracking...
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.680]   I'll be honest, I rip DVDs all the time.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:57.680]   There's no way I'm gonna rip an HD DVD.
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.680]   It's too big.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.680]   But what would it say?
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.680]   You're gonna get a little slower and more clearly for the audience.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.680]   It's all the time.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:04.680]   I think it's...
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.680]   Why?
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.680]   What do you rip them for?
[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:07.680]   Are they DVDs you owe?
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.680]   Yes.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.680]   Are you backing them up?
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.680]   No, I'm putting them on my laptop so I can take them on the laptop.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.680]   Or I'm putting them on the laptop.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.680]   Let's have a practical use.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.680]   But that's not...
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:16.680]   I think a lot of men do that.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.680]   Yeah, but there's something that I keep saying...
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.680]   I have to be careful when I say it in print because it's exactly the sort of phrase that
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.680]   can be really wildly misinterpreted.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:29.680]   And it's a great idea, but a lot of people are gonna have to die first before we can make this work.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:33.240]   And it's not a case of having your killer robots come out and kill everybody who isn't
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.920]   gonna be using this technology.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:39.320]   It's that there's a whole generation of people who will never get the idea of buying a DVD
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:44.680]   and transmogrifying it onto your cell phone, on your iPod, on your laptop, on your network
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:46.240]   device, all this sort of stuff.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.480]   But the generation that's coming after them, well they grew up with this idea.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:54.560]   Not only that, it's okay to rip DVDs and CDs, but it's okay not to even buy that stuff
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:55.560]   to begin with.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:59.560]   There's a huge, huge fundamental shift that's going on that people are just gonna...
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.560]   You're brought to...
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.160]   Andy, do you have any teenagers or any kids?
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.320]   I have nieces...
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:06.680]   Here's where you go.
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.560]   I got a video iPod for my god child.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.560]   What are you talking about?
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:17.000]   I got a video iPod for my niece last Christmas.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.360]   And I thought, well, I'm glad he just wrote this whole new book on converting stuff to
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:21.360]   your iPod.
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:23.800]   She knew how to convert movies from DVD.
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:25.760]   She knew where to find TV shows.
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.160]   She knew all type of stuff.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.160]   Download Handbrake.
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:31.600]   Put the disc in, you say, "Handbrake now says, 'Well, where do you want to put it?
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.080]   Your PSP, your Apple TV, or your iPod?'
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.000]   How many copies of Handbrake is sold?
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   Sold, it's free.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Zero, because they're free.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Well, I mean they're okay.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   How many of them distribute this?
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   We don't know, but I bet it's gonna be in this.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   I don't know.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   The last version of VLC...
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   I don't know.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   The last version of VLC...
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.440]   Because kids know how to do it doesn't mean that they've given up on it or they expect
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.440]   to get everything free.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:55.840]   My son, for example, if anybody knows how to do all this stuff, he's always buying stuff.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.840]   Well, I agree.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:57.840]   I'm not saying that...
[00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.560]   My older son is the same way.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.040]   That's the right to move.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:06.440]   That's the right point to make to the Motion Picture Association, the recording industry.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:09.440]   We're spending more on content than ever before.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.920]   No doubt about it.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:14.120]   And the killer is that we're spending money for content we don't have to buy.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:17.960]   Once again, if I bought the DVD, I've already bought the right to put it onto my iPod.
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.640]   And there's this artificial barrier standing between me and that of the stuff.
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:26.080]   I think the young generation already understands that, well, technological barriers between
[00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.840]   copy protection are really pretty much meaningless.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:32.240]   The generation that comes after that is going to be even more detached.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:38.960]   And I think that the idea of why buy a DVD or why buy a piece of media explicitly when
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:44.040]   you can simply download it illegally for free, that's the incredibly important connection
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:48.280]   that might be unraveling because of all these actions that are being taken by the media
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:49.280]   approach.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.280]   Go ahead Patrick.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.280]   You were going to say something.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.280]   Oh no.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:58.600]   I've talked to a fair number of teenagers because the audience of DLTV is a fair number of teens
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.600]   and college students.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:04.760]   And there's a shocking number of people who won't think twice about dropping a 150 month
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.960]   on a cell phone bill with ringtones, but don't buy CDs.
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:11.600]   I know a lot of adults, John, that don't buy CDs anymore.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.400]   And don't really think twice about it.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:17.960]   For a lot of people, it's less controversial than speeding.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.520]   They just do it.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:24.560]   And to be honest with you, I probably know more people out of high school and college
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.640]   that talk about it.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.720]   And obviously, okay, my audience is skewed because I know a lot of...
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.720]   They're geeks.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:30.720]   You know, hardcore techies.
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:35.320]   But the trainees is like, I've got cousins that are as low-eyed as you can get and still
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.000]   use a computer and are completely comfortable.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.080]   They run a bit torrent, they download stuff, they've been pulling MP3s for years and people
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:44.280]   don't think twice about it.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.280]   All right, I'm going to know.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.280]   I think it's a significant change.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.280]   I'm going to move on, but there's a lot more to be seen.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:52.360]   Okay, before let me make one more comment, which is the fact that Leo just mentioned
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:58.160]   that the content, the amount of money being spent on content is higher than ever before.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.840]   And in fact, it is.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.720]   It doesn't seem to jive with what you're saying unless what you're saying is that,
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.640]   I mean, I'm sure that somebody's looking at some bean counters looking at this and
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:07.640]   all that just proves that.
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.200]   It really would be making a lot of money.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.200]   We should be making more.
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:11.200]   This wasn't going on.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:16.360]   But the fact of the matter is, these guys aren't starving to death because everybody's
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.360]   stealing music.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.360]   It's just not the case.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.360]   Right.
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.360]   I don't think nobody's saying they're starving.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.800]   I'm just saying there's a lot of people that are comfortable with not paying for copyright
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:24.800]   material.
[00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.640]   Bottom line, copy, petitions got to go.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.240]   There's plenty of money still to be made.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.760]   There are a lot of people who still buy content, even though they know how to steal it.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.400]   I think that's what we're all saying.
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.680]   And I don't think we're breeding a nation of freeloaders.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.960]   I think maybe you're right, Patrick.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:43.240]   Maybe we need the word has to go forth that if you want content, eventually you've got
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.960]   to pay for it because people will stop.
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.920]   Just like the whole flat rate, $50 a year download, anything you want everywhere off
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:50.920]   of this sort of universe.
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:51.920]   Exactly.
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.560]   You're going to see new models.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:57.840]   And that's what has to happen is the Motion Picture Association has to give up on this
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:02.840]   whole notion of protecting our stuff and come up with some new models for crying out loud.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.240]   There are plenty of new models.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:05.240]   That's a great idea.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.760]   $50, all you can eat for anything.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:11.840]   And they got a new model now, which is take Spider-Man and put it on an IMAX theater here.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.840]   Go copy that.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:13.840]   Oh, that's true.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.000]   You can't get now on a bit torn already.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   Spider-Man 3.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.240]   Of course, does that cut sales?
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.120]   I don't think so.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.920]   The people who download that are the same enthusiasts are going to go see the movie five
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:23.920]   times anyway.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:24.920]   I don't know.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.320]   I've heard a lot of bad things about the newspaper.
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.720]   Maybe if it's a sucky movie, there's all bets are off.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:34.560]   Prepare the rat hole, but maybe that's to protect really bad movies.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.680]   You need copy protection so that people can't see it before they go.
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.680]   Hey, and that's why I'm going to stick to the video.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:46.000]   Another big story breaking in the Wall Street Journal today that perhaps Microsoft back
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:53.600]   in discussions with Yahoo to create an alliance, a single company, teamed up against Google.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.600]   You credit this at all, John?
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:58.520]   What do your sources say?
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.000]   You know, I'm not buying this.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.840]   It's the second time we've heard this.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.040]   Yeah, I know it keeps cropping up.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:08.320]   Who's somebody cutting a cat when they made the announcement?
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:14.200]   And a year ago, Microsoft and Yahoo explored the idea of combining to form a greater competitor
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.200]   to Google.
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.200]   The talks led nowhere.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.240]   The same situation is playing out again.
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:21.360]   Microsoft and Yahoo in recent months discussing a possible merger.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.680]   This is the Wall Street Journal.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:28.000]   The two companies are some kind of matchup that would be their respective strengths.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:34.760]   We just actually, if you go to PC Magazine.com, you'll find from Friday, you'll find the
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.960]   article that Lance Ewanoff wrote.
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.720]   And I wrote the rebuttal saying why this deal would never happen.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:42.640]   If the government would even let it happen, why it's a dumb idea?
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:48.000]   Because you have two companies that the corporate cultures don't match at all.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.240]   You have them both in the same businesses.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.800]   So you have mostly redundancy.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:56.440]   So what email system you're going to go with, the Yahoo or MSN or Hotmail?
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:00.240]   I mean, the whole thing is a five plus five equals six at best.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:03.440]   It's like an HP Compaq kind of a thing is what you're saying.
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:08.840]   And my real argument though is if there's a, by putting these two companies together,
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:13.120]   what do they expect some genius to emerge who can beat Google?
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:17.200]   If that genius is there and either one of those companies, why hasn't emerged already?
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.200]   Or she?
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:23.920]   Sorry, I'm just trying to envision this sort of copycat mentality at Microsoft combined
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:27.520]   with the billion dollar Microsoft research, combined with the let us not make waves but
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.280]   buy everything at its peak price.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.280]   Are you making serious investments in tech?
[00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:31.280]   Yeah, it's the tech.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:35.680]   You're now by everything you want to buy to compete with Yahoo or with Google at peak
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.400]   price with Microsoft's cash reserves.
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.400]   It's brilliant.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:40.400]   I don't know.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.320]   Make the worst company ever.
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:46.880]   But I don't think the government would let it happen.
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.640]   It's just bad, bad eye every which way.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:53.120]   By the way, what's going to be funny though, I mean, I would be highly amused if this
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.320]   kind of a thing ever happened.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.960]   It's an interesting story.
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.120]   Good news for internet radio.
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.880]   Jackie, you wrote the story for ours.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:39:59.880]   Technica.
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:04.600]   I guess what we were looking at May 15th is the drop dead date.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:10.120]   The copyright board's original ruling internet stations, radio stations that have to pay retro
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:13.840]   active royalties a year's worth on May 15th.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:18.920]   We interviewed Tim Restagrin of Pandora and he was saying, you know, we might be able
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:19.920]   to survive that.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:23.000]   We could probably pay that big bill but we wouldn't be able to survive much longer than
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   that.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.320]   Now they've got to July 15th.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.320]   What happened?
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.320]   How did that change?
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:34.240]   You know, I'm not, I actually am not entirely sure what spurred the decision to push the
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:39.280]   deadline back but obviously it's, you know, it's to the advantage of all the internet radio
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.280]   stations.
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:43.760]   Jackie, I'm going to give you a tip as a Twit panel member.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.120]   Never say you're not sure.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.680]   I never admit ignorance.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:50.880]   Just assert, you know, here's what I think.
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:53.200]   Well, I definitely know that.
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.200]   What do you know?
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.720]   Did NPR certainly had something to do with this?
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:57.720]   Oh yeah, definitely.
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:04.160]   Well, I mean, NPR originally, they kind of spearheaded the campaign to, you know, appeal
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:10.120]   the original ruling and even though the copyright, you know, royalty board kind of rejected the
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:15.280]   appeal, they must, I mean, they must have just come to a decision later or something
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.240]   and then extended the deadline.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:24.080]   Jay Inslee and Don Mizzullo introduced a bill, HR 2060, the internet radio equality
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:25.980]   act.
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:27.680]   That would have reversed the CRB's decision.
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:28.680]   Where's this?
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:31.600]   What's the status of that bill now?
[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.960]   I don't think the bill has actually really moved forward since its introduction.
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:42.520]   I mean, not in any significant way anyway, but I think the current thought is that this
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:49.040]   pushback deadline will now, you know, allow lobbying groups and, you know, everybody to,
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:53.760]   yeah, to push, you know, to push Congress and push, you know, representatives to take
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:54.760]   the bill seriously.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:55.760]   I don't want it to pass.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:56.760]   I don't want to pass.
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:01.740]   I want because it's good for podcasts that don't play music.
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:03.140]   It's good for us.
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.140]   Talk radio.
[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:05.980]   We don't have to worry about music radio.
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:08.140]   We'll be the only choice in town.
[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:09.300]   Go ahead.
[00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:11.260]   Put those guys out of business.
[00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:12.260]   Right.
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:15.300]   But otherwise, I mean, everyone.
[00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:16.300]   Public domain.
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.300]   Yeah.
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:20.700]   No, I mean, it is an opportunity actually for independent artists.
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:21.700]   Yeah.
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:26.640]   It's hard to imagine how the, how, what the RIA is thinking here.
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:31.600]   Why would they want basically to put out, put completely out of business, all music,
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:32.600]   internet, music, radio.
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:38.360]   Well, I think the thought is that the, the intention with the royalty hike is actually
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.640]   to do exactly that.
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:44.440]   I mean, they're, they're not making any money off of, off of songs being played online.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:49.040]   So, you know, they're this, it's just like with DRM, you know, they'd rather, they'd
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.840]   rather people just not listen to it.
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:53.220]   Tim, Tim Westman told me an interesting thing.
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:56.540]   He said that the, you know, there's two royalties.
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:43:02.540]   Internet radio, of course, all radio, music radio, broadcast and internet pays a published
[00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.140]   publishing royalty.
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:08.620]   But internet radio has paid all along a secondary royalty, a performance royalty, which regular
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:09.620]   radio.
[00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:13.100]   Satellite radio pays a similar performance.
[00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:20.180]   And one of these Tim said is he, he, he suspected that, you know, the, the, the folks from the,
[00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:24.260]   the, the organization that went up to the, the copyright royalty board, they do what you
[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:25.940]   always do when you go into negotiation, right?
[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:27.740]   You ask for everything we want.
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:31.260]   And, and I think they, they didn't intend, they didn't expect it.
[00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:34.580]   Like the copyright royalty board rolled over and said, great, you can have everything.
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:36.580]   We don't really want to all.
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:37.580]   It was great.
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:40.940]   And they thought they were going to make more money on these royalties, but they didn't,
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.540]   but they, I don't think they do want to put internet radio out of business.
[00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.380]   Is that what, is that what you're getting to better?
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:46.380]   Yeah.
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:49.780]   I mean, they're not, they're not saying, oh, you know what, just pay us half.
[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:53.660]   Um, so apparently they're not that worried about internet radio.
[00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:57.340]   They've always said we don't believe in that radio as of any value to the artist.
[00:43:57.340 --> 00:43:58.900]   There's no promotional value.
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:01.740]   You know, well, I think that's bull, but you know, I think that's a very interesting
[00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:02.740]   theory.
[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:06.140]   What you're asserting up, or whoever was in Western Europe.
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.140]   Yeah.
[00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:08.140]   Yeah.
[00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:13.380]   Is that the, is that the internet radio people were so naive and I guess dopey that they
[00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:17.580]   just, they signed the, what you would call the dummy contract, which is the contract
[00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:22.200]   because anyone who's done books or anything knows is this dummy's contract that they
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:24.740]   give you if you're stupid enough to sign it.
[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:25.740]   You know, you're just a dummy.
[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:27.860]   Copyright board said, uh, okay.
[00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:33.300]   If you want that, that's kind of funny that they, you be careful what you wish for.
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:34.300]   You might get it.
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.300]   Yeah.
[00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:38.660]   I mean, the thing about the dummy contract, John, is if it's the only way you're going
[00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:44.060]   to get what you want, you know, sometimes you have to sign the dummy contract.
[00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:45.060]   No, no, no.
[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:50.300]   It's the, the dummy contract, you know, I mean they paid, uh, you know, I, I, I, on one hand,
[00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:56.340]   yeah, it's wrong, but on the other hand, you know, post, you know, uh, you know, if somebody's
[00:44:56.340 --> 00:45:00.700]   looking to get the rights to the, to the music they want to pay, uh, it's, it's become, you
[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:04.380]   know, if, if the satellite radio stations got hammered, I don't see why the, you know,
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:10.420]   internet radio stations, yeah, they've gone from paying a percentage of their revenues,
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:15.820]   which, you know, they can afford obviously to paying a flat fee, which many, many, many,
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:17.540]   many internet radio stations can't pay.
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:20.420]   I just want to go on record saying I do want internet radio to survive.
[00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:21.820]   I do want music radio surviving.
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:26.100]   If you feel the same way, save, you finally realize you'll be getting a lot of letters.
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.100]   Whoops.
[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.140]   Somebody might actually believe that.
[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:31.540]   So go to save net radio.org.
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:35.300]   We now have 71 days, 70 days left.
[00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:36.980]   Curiously, I believe that Leo.
[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:37.980]   No, you didn't.
[00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:38.980]   You didn't.
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:41.220]   Oh, I was joking.
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:43.380]   That's, I said a wrap on Mac break weekly.
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:46.260]   I'm starting to get hate mail now from a rabs.
[00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:47.260]   And now who you are saying it again?
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:48.620]   I mean, I love a lot.
[00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:49.620]   Yeah.
[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:50.620]   Just repeat that a few more.
[00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:52.620]   No, I was all the way down.
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:53.620]   I was joking.
[00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:54.620]   Joking.
[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:55.620]   Catch it.
[00:45:55.620 --> 00:46:01.340]   Senator Obama wants his MySpace page back and he's pretty mad about this.
[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:03.740]   Who wants a MySpace page for God's sakes?
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:06.340]   I'm starting to question this guy's ability to leave you with my space page.
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:07.500]   No, well, there is a my.
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.740]   Is he mad about it?
[00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:14.540]   Obama's MySpace page is currently this, according to Slash Dot.
[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:17.940]   He's currently the subject of an underground battle for control by the campaign itself
[00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:22.460]   and the volunteer who created it back in 2004.
[00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:26.820]   Apparently Joseph Anthony who worked with the campaign initially has grown this site.
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:30.740]   He's got 160,000 friends.
[00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:34.580]   And it's probably bigger than the main Obama page.
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:42.860]   And so Obama's campaign is saying, hmm, maybe we should, they actually offered to pay him
[00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:43.860]   for it.
[00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:50.740]   He asked for $49,000 plus $10,000, a refund of some of the $10,000 fee he paid to become
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:52.180]   an impact channel.
[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:54.260]   Obama's campaign said, I'm not paying that.
[00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:56.660]   So they started a new MySpace page.
[00:46:56.660 --> 00:47:00.020]   Then Anthony posted a response on his blog.
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:01.580]   It's gotten ugly.
[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:02.580]   You're right.
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:05.260]   What's the matter about the leadership here?
[00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:08.900]   Maybe they're growing after that really valuable Obama dot TV domain.
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:15.860]   I think I have the fake Obama as like one of my friends on my screen.
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:17.820]   Well, it's not fake.
[00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:21.940]   Well, the volunteer is on to right.
[00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:23.780]   That's the greatest of bumper sticker.
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:25.580]   Vote for the fake Obama in 2000.
[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:32.900]   Now, I do have to praise him for his campaign, whoever it was, for insisting or requesting
[00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:38.620]   that future debates be Creative Commons licensed.
[00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:43.460]   Remember that MSNBC asserted a copyright and said you can't post any clips from the
[00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:47.580]   Democratic debate on YouTube or anywhere else because we own it.
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:50.100]   It's ours, dang it.
[00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:54.860]   So now not only at Obama, but many of the other candidates are saying, yes, let's license
[00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:57.300]   that are Creative Commons.
[00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:01.260]   Obama says, I am a strong believer in the importance of copyright, especially in a digital
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:06.300]   age, but there's no reason that this particular class of content needs the protection.
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:07.620]   We have incentive enough to debate.
[00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:11.180]   The networks haven't sent enough to broadcast these debates.
[00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:14.860]   Rather than restricting the product of these debates, we should instead make sure our democracy
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:18.100]   and citizens have the chance to benefit from them in all the ways that technology makes
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:19.100]   possible.
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.100]   That's I think exactly right.
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:24.980]   Boy, that guy sounds like a politician.
[00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:29.420]   Yeah, I mean, I agree, but he's definitely saying it for, you know, it's balanced.
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:30.420]   Impact.
[00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:34.620]   It's a good practice statement.
[00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:36.460]   Did you see what Sony did in Greece?
[00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:40.300]   Yeah, we blogged that into borac.org/flaw.
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:42.300]   I thought you would.
[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:44.460]   Yo, it's got our blood.
[00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:46.300]   It's got to pour it all over it.
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:52.820]   Perhaps you saw the picture in the Daily Mail of a slaughtered goat.
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:53.820]   Deheaded.
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:55.300]   Decapitated goat.
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:49:03.740]   So this is a promo party to celebrate the launch of God of War II for PlayStation 2.
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:09.700]   Guests at the event were even invited to reach inside the goat's still warm carcass to eat
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:11.700]   from its stomach.
[00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:16.260]   Yeah, but there wasn't anything in there but gummy worms, who I can tell.
[00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:22.220]   You know, this is a, somebody pointed out that this is a common party kind of a trick
[00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:23.220]   that's done.
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:25.460]   This was done in Greece where this is a very common practice.
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:27.460]   It's OK, I agree.
[00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:28.460]   Yeah, it's Greece.
[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:29.460]   They didn't kill the goat just for this.
[00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:30.460]   The Greeks, they used these.
[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:31.460]   The goat was already dead.
[00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:34.740]   They got it at the butcher shop.
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:35.940]   But it's so funny.
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:39.820]   And by the way, they also had bare-breasted maidens.
[00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:40.820]   So.
[00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:42.180]   Yeah, that was interesting.
[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:46.380]   You can see that if you looked on the Daily Mail's website, they had a picture of the
[00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:48.580]   goat with a girl standing or walking by.
[00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:51.100]   And they painted her top on.
[00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:54.340]   But with some sort of paint that you could see through it.
[00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:55.340]   Yeah.
[00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:57.540]   So what you're saying, it was a really good party.
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:59.700]   It sounds like for a bunch of gamers.
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:00.700]   That was the ultimate.
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:03.140]   That was the ultimate seven launch party now.
[00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:04.140]   Yeah.
[00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:06.940]   Although it would have needed Elvis Castell or maybe Alice Cooper playing.
[00:50:06.940 --> 00:50:09.380]   From the country that gave you Bacchus.
[00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:13.540]   The ultimate Bacchania.
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:14.540]   So anyway.
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:15.540]   It's still worth it.
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:17.940]   It's just as Sony's just they're losing it.
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:20.260]   It seems to me.
[00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:24.180]   Sony's UK office had been shocked, shocked to see the report in the official PlayStation
[00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:25.180]   magazine.
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:26.180]   That's what's really funny.
[00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:28.140]   They put it in the PlayStation magazine.
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:33.540]   Sony is recalling the entire 80,000 copy run of the magazine.
[00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:34.540]   Collector's item.
[00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:35.540]   No.
[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:36.540]   The magazine.
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:37.540]   Hold on.
[00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:40.860]   Because of poisonous glue, no doubt they're out there looking out for the convenience of
[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:41.860]   the consumers.
[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:42.860]   God bless them.
[00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:45.860]   The firm refuses to say how the goat died.
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:49.460]   He has no head.
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:51.420]   Is that for a reason?
[00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:55.740]   It's probably, you know, it could have been a possible cause.
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:56.900]   The head is now in stable condition.
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:58.740]   The animal was not slaughtered for the event.
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:50:59.740]   It's reported delicious.
[00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:03.540]   But bought for, bought, bought a local butcher store.
[00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:08.900]   We are conducting an internal inquiry into aspects of the event in order to learn from
[00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:14.300]   the occurrence and put the place into place measures to ensure this does not happen again.
[00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:15.300]   I like that.
[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:17.220]   Well, if it does happen again, we should be invited.
[00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:19.900]   I want to know what the goat being killed or the story getting out.
[00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:20.900]   Yeah, really.
[00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:21.900]   Yeah.
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:24.700]   It's almost like they just didn't consider that, you know, the internet exists.
[00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:25.940]   Oh, it's worse than that.
[00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:27.340]   They put it in a magazine.
[00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:28.340]   That's the funny thing.
[00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:29.980]   I don't know what they were thinking.
[00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:36.820]   This sounds a lot like the dig story to me or that a small vocal, very savvy group of
[00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:38.820]   people are trying to make everybody.
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:40.380]   Oh, I mean, one thing.
[00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:43.740]   Yeah, it's a despicable treatment of a goat carcass and it's wrong.
[00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:47.340]   And certainly if I was slaughtered, I would not like to find myself on a taming word.
[00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:51.100]   It's not even with people eating gummy worms out of my, don't get me wrong, right?
[00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:53.740]   But on the flip side, it's a goat.
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:54.740]   They eat goats.
[00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:56.940]   It's part of the culture, you know what I mean?
[00:51:56.940 --> 00:52:01.900]   It's like I've, I actually saw somebody in New York once throwing paint on people coming
[00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:04.220]   out of a first store while wearing a black leather jacket.
[00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:05.500]   I don't get it, right?
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:08.660]   But, you know, maybe the P to people are more consistent.
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:10.740]   I mean, who cares?
[00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:12.380]   You know, it's a PR event.
[00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:13.540]   There was a dead goat.
[00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:14.540]   It's I don't.
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:16.140]   It's not politics though.
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:17.140]   Come on.
[00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:18.140]   That's a dumb thing.
[00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:19.140]   You're a goat.
[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:20.140]   Sony.
[00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:21.140]   It's not.
[00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:22.140]   What do you mean it's not politics?
[00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:26.900]   Why is it not like, if it was a six year old, it was like a PR person.
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:30.340]   I can still, my goat and slaughtering at the Sony Cape Station event.
[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:31.340]   Yeah, then I bought that.
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:33.500]   What if the goat were named Patrick?
[00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:35.380]   Hey, you know what?
[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:38.260]   You know, I can't, I can't, I eat burgers.
[00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:39.260]   I like them.
[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:40.260]   Yeah, I guess you're right.
[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:41.260]   You know what I mean?
[00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:42.260]   I'm not going to, I'm not going to be like.
[00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:43.260]   I'm wearing leather shoes.
[00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:44.260]   You're right.
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:45.260]   I mean, you're wearing leather shoes.
[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:46.260]   Where's the rest of the cow?
[00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:47.260]   It's not like, you know, it did a little donation.
[00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:48.260]   It's over to Sony.
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:49.260]   The cow, 20 bucks.
[00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:50.260]   Yeah.
[00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:52.380]   I'm not offended by the killing of the goat.
[00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:56.700]   I'm just offended by the just the abject stupidity of PR people who can't think two steps
[00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:57.700]   ahead.
[00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:01.500]   I mean, this is almost like Tom, what Tom Cruise's last PR person would have set up for, you
[00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:02.500]   know?
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:04.300]   And then we'll get Oprah to come over.
[00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:06.980]   Although, although that was pretty cool.
[00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:08.860]   It does tie in with the whole God award thing.
[00:53:08.860 --> 00:53:12.140]   It's not like you're going to be having a nice fluffy, kind of brutal day or case.
[00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:13.140]   Right.
[00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:14.140]   Yeah.
[00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:15.140]   Yeah.
[00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:17.660]   So I want to, I want to hear from you journalists because you're all journalists.
[00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:18.660]   Harry McCracken.
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:22.300]   Yeah, that's a good one.
[00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:24.620]   Editor in Chief of PC World Resigned Tuesday.
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:25.620]   Yeah.
[00:53:25.620 --> 00:53:26.620]   In a huff.
[00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:27.620]   In a huff.
[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:28.620]   In a minute and a huff.
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:33.940]   Over disagreements with the magazine's publisher regarding stories, critical of advertisers.
[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:34.940]   McCracken.
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:35.940]   I was more to it than that.
[00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:39.900]   McCracken, was there, this guy comes over from Macworld, which is an obvious pandering
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:40.900]   magazine.
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:45.660]   And he decides that we should run our, you know, the PC magazine or PC World magazine
[00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:49.540]   the same way, which is essentially Kiss Apple's butt.
[00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:53.300]   I think it all stemmed from that story, that lame story that did about 10 reasons I hate
[00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:56.940]   Apple, which is based on, you know, that was, that was the precipitating incident.
[00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:58.420]   The guy wanted it pulled.
[00:53:58.420 --> 00:53:59.420]   He didn't understand it.
[00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:00.820]   He didn't want it in the magazine.
[00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:01.820]   He was on dig.
[00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:02.820]   It was everywhere.
[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:03.820]   That story got everywhere.
[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:09.500]   It was good for people that have talked to Harry and Harry said the whole story hasn't
[00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:10.500]   gotten out yet.
[00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:18.580]   The publisher who was, was the guy that Harry got into it with has posted on his own blog
[00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:21.620]   that, you know, we hold the, you know, the relationship with the consumer to be above
[00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:24.220]   all others and sign of this into editorial integrity.
[00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:26.140]   Man, man, man, man, man.
[00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:28.220]   Yeah, I mean, based on who he's supposed to be.
[00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:30.340]   Well, let's get Harry on to it.
[00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:33.020]   He's, he's, he's, he's available.
[00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:34.020]   What's he going to do?
[00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:35.020]   12 years at PC World.
[00:54:35.020 --> 00:54:36.020]   That's a big deal.
[00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:37.020]   16 plus.
[00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:38.020]   Oh man.
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:39.820]   He's probably online now.
[00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:40.820]   Harry, you got him.
[00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:41.820]   You got his Skype.
[00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:42.820]   Let's call him.
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:47.100]   I just like the idea of, I mean, I'm proud of him.
[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:52.300]   If the, if the editor said be, you know, pander to, pander to advertisers, pander to vendors,
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:53.300]   yeah, that's worth quick.
[00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:54.300]   I love this.
[00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:58.220]   According to the PC World source, Wired magazine quoting the PC World source, when Crawford
[00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:00.500]   was working, this is the guy they brought over for Mackerel.
[00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:03.260]   When Crawford was working for the Mac magazine, Steve Jobs would call him up.
[00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:07.620]   Anytime he had a problem with a story the magazine was running about Apple.
[00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:15.460]   I, you know, I understand if, if that's the case, McCracken, right on, dude, right on.
[00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:18.860]   Yeah, I just, I just wish that they'd finished that sentence.
[00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:20.060]   Steve Jobs would call him up.
[00:55:20.060 --> 00:55:21.460]   Yeah, and then what would happen?
[00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:22.460]   And then what happened, right?
[00:55:22.460 --> 00:55:23.460]   I mean, that's fine.
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:25.380]   That doesn't, there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:29.900]   I've heard from some folks that, that worked for a couple of those magazines back in the
[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:36.340]   day, Mackerel, particularly, who've said that, that, that, that they were precious.
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:39.340]   It was suggested to them that, that they take it easy on Apple.
[00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:40.580]   Yeah, that's two grabs.
[00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:42.860]   That's one of the problems though when you're in a house organ like that.
[00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:48.340]   If you cover one company, the whole magazine, it's kind of, I mean, that's tough.
[00:55:48.340 --> 00:55:52.100]   Most of your advertising dollar comes from that company.
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:57.860]   I do kind of feel bad in, in some sort of way that the story came out because, I mean,
[00:55:57.860 --> 00:56:02.380]   you know, the magazines are likely to suffer at least a little bit, you know, now that
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:06.740]   the whole world has come to this, you know, horrible realization that, you know, there's
[00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:11.180]   some possibility that the magazines might be, you know, chilling for whatever.
[00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:12.180]   Yeah.
[00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:13.180]   I'm not convinced of that.
[00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:14.940]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:19.660]   The audience generally feels that that's going on anyway.
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:20.660]   Oh, they assume it.
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:21.660]   And of course they do.
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:25.700]   And I think, I mean, you have to constantly, you always hear this as a writer for one of
[00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:28.300]   these magazines, they always say, "Well, the only reason the year I, not right about
[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:33.020]   that is because Microsoft is, you know, which I've always, especially with PC Magazine,
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:37.180]   I always try to point out to people that Microsoft doesn't even advertise in PC Magazine
[00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:39.300]   except maybe once or twice a year.
[00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:41.300]   They're like a lousy advertise.
[00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:44.380]   Well, I think they're, they're a common advertiser.
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:48.580]   There are certain types of people who think all writers are being paid off.
[00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:54.260]   But I think, I mean, I don't think this particular story would have spread so much if, you know,
[00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:59.180]   some people, you know, I guess didn't realize it before and now suddenly their whole world
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:00.180]   has been shattered.
[00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:01.180]   No, I don't know.
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:05.420]   I think it's an, I told you so spread title, you know, it's like, "Ah, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z."
[00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:06.420]   Maybe.
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:08.700]   Also, also, also realize that we're just getting one side of the story.
[00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:11.380]   I don't, I don't have much experience with PC world.
[00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:15.420]   I have lots and lots of friends inside Macworld Magazine.
[00:57:15.420 --> 00:57:19.060]   And all I can say is that they don't seem to me like the sort of person who would just
[00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:23.100]   spike stories that were in the public interest because a higher up said so.
[00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:27.180]   There is a firewall supposedly between the business side and the editorial side of every
[00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:28.180]   magazine.
[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:31.580]   Now, sometimes there are chunks in that wall, but I really want to see the other sides of
[00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:33.900]   these stories before I go choosing sides.
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:38.300]   Although, again, I really don't imagine that an editor would have left a job after 16
[00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:42.400]   years unless he either A was planning to do it anyway or B really, really got
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:44.340]   horked off by bad events.
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:49.700]   Not much of this is not the time to be planning to jump out of a job like that.
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:50.700]   I don't know.
[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:51.700]   You're right.
[00:57:51.700 --> 00:57:52.700]   We should try to check out the other side.
[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:53.700]   It'll boil.
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:54.700]   It won't keep following it.
[00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:56.300]   I'll bet you it would get to the bottom of it.
[00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:57.300]   The other side.
[00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:00.460]   I think it's, if they could just come down to a he said, she said situation.
[00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:02.460]   Yeah, but don't you think it'd be cool to hear the both?
[00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:03.460]   Yeah.
[00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:04.460]   Both of these.
[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:05.460]   We get a Crawford and McCracken on.
[00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:06.460]   They can battle it out.
[00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:09.860]   The same time team will put them in a cage match.
[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:14.140]   I just want you to know that the firewall between advertising and editorial at Twit
[00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:15.740]   is intact.
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:16.740]   We don't have any.
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:17.740]   Yes.
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:18.740]   No one wants to come near us.
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:19.740]   Hey, there's no advertising.
[00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:22.500]   I finally realized we're never going to get any advertising.
[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:24.820]   They're all going to go to CNET, ZEETE NET.
[00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:26.340]   It's going to go to you, Patrick.
[00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:31.260]   It's going to go to John's show Cranky Geeks because they know those guys.
[00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:33.540]   They don't know what I might say.
[00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:35.020]   I might say something bad about them.
[00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:37.020]   So they just, oh, you are so full of them.
[00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:38.020]   I'm never getting any money.
[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:39.780]   You're the bad boy of broadcasting Leo.
[00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:40.780]   Dell still hasn't paid us.
[00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:41.780]   Here we are.
[00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:42.780]   What is it?
[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:43.780]   Eight months later.
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:44.780]   What was that?
[00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:46.380]   Is his pod track submitted to Bill?
[00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:47.380]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:48.380]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:49.380]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:50.380]   I'm sure they will.
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:51.380]   This is standard practice in the advertising industry.
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:53.580]   You hold on to that money as long as you can.
[00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:56.220]   I think it's standard practice in every instance.
[00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:57.660]   Yeah, that's fine.
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:58.660]   I don't know.
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:00.420]   Who needs money?
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:01.420]   Yahoo, apparently.
[00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:02.740]   Yahoo is shut down.
[00:59:02.740 --> 00:59:04.940]   Yahoo photos in favor of Flickr.
[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:07.340]   We have a winner.
[00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:08.900]   I think, do we really?
[00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:09.900]   Do we really have a winner?
[00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:12.380]   I can't even use my little Zoomer account.
[00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:13.380]   Zoomer.
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:15.260]   I had to change my name.
[00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:16.260]   I had to know.
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:17.260]   You have to start using your account.
[00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:18.500]   And then I couldn't access this.
[00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:20.580]   I got a bunch of tech TV pictures up there.
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:21.580]   I can't do anything with it.
[00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:22.740]   I can't even load them anymore.
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:23.740]   Oh, that's terrible.
[00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:24.740]   I didn't have to change squad.
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:30.060]   All I had to do was I had to sign up for Yahoo email address plugged in as my sign in.
[00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:31.060]   I'm still using the same idea.
[00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:33.060]   You still have to do a magic merge.
[00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:34.060]   You know what?
[00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:37.820]   I didn't sign up because I already had an account.
[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:40.820]   And then you do this magic merge and it gets all fouled up.
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:42.500]   You got some bad luck here.
[00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:46.100]   Does anybody at Yahoo listen to this podcast help John?
[00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:47.620]   They don't listen to us.
[00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:49.860]   And Google never invited us to anything.
[00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:51.780]   These guys all hate us.
[00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:53.380]   Actually, speakers.
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:54.380]   They don't all hate us.
[00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:56.300]   They all hate us.
[00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:57.740]   They all hate us.
[00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:00.020]   I got invited to Google a couple weeks ago for companies.
[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:02.220]   I've been invited to speak at Google.
[01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:04.020]   I got one of them flashing badges too.
[01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:05.020]   Well, isn't that interesting?
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:06.020]   I don't want to speak at Google.
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:08.020]   I'm embarrassed to speak at Google.
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:09.020]   Hey, you know what?
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:10.020]   I'll go speak at Google.
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:11.020]   I'll go speak at Google.
[01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:12.020]   I'll go speak at Google.
[01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:13.020]   I'll go speak at Google.
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:14.020]   I'll go speak at Google.
[01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:15.020]   I'll go speak at Google.
[01:00:15.020 --> 01:00:16.020]   I'll go speak at Google.
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:17.020]   It's like when you and I went to talk to the Secret Service Patrick.
[01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:18.020]   That was embarrassing.
[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:20.020]   Actually, no, it wasn't embarrassing because we learned a bunch of them and there was actually
[01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:23.020]   a bunch of subjects they learned a bunch from us about it because some of the-
[01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:24.020]   That's scary.
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:27.140]   Well, let's tell the public here that's listening in.
[01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:28.140]   What did we learn?
[01:00:28.140 --> 01:00:29.140]   Did you learn?
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:30.980]   Oh, it was three years.
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:36.460]   Well, actually, what we learned is Nigerian 419 scams take up an embarrassing percentage
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:37.460]   of the Secret Service time.
[01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:44.180]   They said, "Please tell your listeners and viewers, don't answer these 419 schemes.
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:46.180]   There is no one going to give you money in Nigeria."
[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:47.380]   So believable that people-
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:54.660]   Hey, by the way, if you ever go to devorac.org/cagematch across the logo, the guy, there's a little
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:59.740]   Nigerian on the logo who is literally a genuine 419 scam.
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:03.100]   How do you find a scammer that somebody talked to him in the holding up a sign?
[01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.100]   Oh, that's neat.
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:05.260]   He's really a 419 scammer?
[01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:06.660]   Yeah, he has the real deal.
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:07.660]   He's really little.
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:08.660]   He's not that small.
[01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:09.660]   Oh, dear.
[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:11.660]   I think I might have to add that part.
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:13.660]   I guess I'm going to say that.
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:14.660]   Let's just take a step back.
[01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:15.660]   I just wanted to write it.
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:16.660]   Is he an ARAB?
[01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:17.660]   He's an ARAB?
[01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:19.020]   So you can differentiate them from the rest of the world.
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:20.660]   Somebody brought it up at 419.
[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:22.540]   I'm just telling you we have a Nigerian.
[01:01:22.540 --> 01:01:23.540]   And what?
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:24.780]   On the Cage Match forums.
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:26.100]   Oh, there he is.
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:27.100]   He's naked.
[01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.100]   Apparently, yeah.
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:32.980]   There's a bunch of clubs out there that people can join, which are called scam.
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:36.740]   They're generally scam the scammers and they're all 419 clubs.
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:37.740]   And they go out of their way.
[01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:38.740]   Don't do that.
[01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:40.300]   And one of them doesn't want to get me this picture.
[01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:44.380]   That's another thing that the Secret Service said not to do.
[01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:46.660]   Don't go to Nigeria and try to get your money back.
[01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:48.140]   No, they don't do that.
[01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:53.860]   What they do is try to scam the scammers by just wasting their time and making them take
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:55.620]   pictures of themselves and do what they do.
[01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:56.620]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:57.620]   They like this little sign.
[01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:58.620]   That's one of the examples.
[01:01:58.620 --> 01:01:59.620]   It's kind of sad.
[01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:01.900]   I mean, these guys probably are dirt poor and they're just trying to make a look.
[01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:02.900]   No, no.
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:03.900]   A lot of them are multimillionaires.
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:04.900]   That's true.
[01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:07.140]   He's a good-looking fella.
[01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.260]   All right.
[01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:12.060]   I don't know how I'm going to save that segment.
[01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:16.540]   There's no razor blade sharp enough to fix that segment.
[01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:18.340]   One last story.
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:19.340]   You brought it up.
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:21.180]   I was trying to save you.
[01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:25.820]   I was trying to save you, John, by deflecting all the rancor on me.
[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:29.460]   If you put a teaspoon full of vanilla in a saucepan and let it simmer for a while, it
[01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:31.820]   makes your entire house smell like cookies, everybody.
[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:32.820]   Cool.
[01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:34.420]   That's my tip for the day.
[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:36.060]   Andy and I, so calm this.
[01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:37.060]   Perfect.
[01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:38.060]   One last story.
[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:44.020]   The Iranian government noticed that the US military has created that great army game.
[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:51.220]   The Iranian military now has a video game recruiting tool called Saving the Port, released today
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:57.820]   by Tebyon, the official Information Dissemination Institute of Iran.
[01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:02.660]   It's an attempt to replace the, quote, "excessive amount of aggression seen in strategic Western
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:08.620]   games with rational thinking."
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:09.620]   I don't know.
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:10.620]   I want to download it.
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.820]   Why don't these guys just write patches?
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:13.820]   Yeah.
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:14.820]   Make them odd.
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:15.820]   Yeah.
[01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:16.820]   Make them odd.
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:17.820]   Or something like that.
[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:18.820]   Yeah.
[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:19.820]   Yeah.
[01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:20.820]   That's the word I'm looking for.
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:25.940]   Apparently, the story comes from IranMania.com.
[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:30.300]   I'll leave it to you as an exercise for the listener to go to that site.
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:34.260]   We're all just stunned and amazed in the silence.
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:35.260]   Yeah.
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:37.260]   I'm not sure I want that IP address in my track.
[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:38.260]   Well, I'll be happy.
[01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:39.260]   Yeah.
[01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:40.260]   You know what?
[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:41.260]   Let's all download a bunch of software.
[01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:43.660]   Let's say, why don't you go there and describe it to us.
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:44.660]   Okay.
[01:03:44.660 --> 01:03:45.660]   Iran, mania.
[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:47.660]   Well, first of all, it's in Arabic.
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:51.620]   But if you click the button that says, "See the site in English," look, they've got an
[01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:53.380]   ad for Mother's Day special.
[01:03:53.380 --> 01:03:59.500]   Do you hear that humming in the background as Leo installs this on his hard drive?
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:04.580]   That's actually his entire hard drive being skimmed in a summary being sent to someone.
[01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:08.180]   Here's a directory of Tehran movies and events.
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:09.820]   Business rates in reals.
[01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:11.940]   That's the, of course, currency in Iran.
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:14.620]   Leo, tomorrow, man, in a plumber's overall.
[01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:17.220]   It's going to knock on your door and ask to see your pipes.
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.220]   He's not a plumber.
[01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:20.780]   And we're never going to hear.
[01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:23.780]   We knew to write the new pipe through your phone closet.
[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:25.540]   We'll just be four or five hours.
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:26.540]   Okay, no problem.
[01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:28.620]   I'll just be doing a podcast.
[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:32.180]   Just don't flush your toilet before I'm done.
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:33.180]   Okay.
[01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:34.180]   Folks.
[01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:39.580]   So, besides the last round, what is this story about Commodore that is on our list?
[01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:40.580]   Commodore.
[01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:42.220]   Yeah, it says Commodore is back in the game.
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:43.900]   That's a really, really old story.
[01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:44.900]   But it is.
[01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:45.900]   Yeah.
[01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:46.900]   They're looking at old.
[01:04:46.900 --> 01:04:47.900]   They're making, I don't know why.
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:50.300]   They're making Commodore's making game machines.
[01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:51.300]   It was really not Commodore.
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:52.940]   It's the same thing as those Packard Bells.
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:55.780]   Somebody's licensed the Commodore name.
[01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:56.780]   Oh.
[01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:59.660]   And I probably just mistagged it or something.
[01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:00.660]   Whatever.
[01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:02.660]   But anyway, it's like Westinghouse.
[01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:03.660]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:04.660]   Yeah.
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:07.340]   So, although, you know, Westinghouse apparently makes a pretty good monitor.
[01:05:07.340 --> 01:05:08.340]   Yeah, is that funny?
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:11.740]   I see those in the price clubs and so forth.
[01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:12.740]   Yeah, they're dirt cheap.
[01:05:12.740 --> 01:05:13.740]   They get great.
[01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:14.740]   They've got good reviews.
[01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:15.740]   Yeah.
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:17.100]   I mean, it's a pretty licensed the name.
[01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:18.380]   No, no, they're licensed the name.
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:20.220]   They're actually another one of those Asian companies.
[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:24.100]   But it's a bunch of like, ex-Sam-sung marketing guys and a bunch of...
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:25.660]   Princeton graphics for one of the...
[01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:26.660]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:27.660]   The Princeton graphics.
[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:28.660]   The Princeton graphics.
[01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:29.660]   The guy is the graphic guy.
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:30.660]   Yeah, he still used to be great monitors.
[01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:31.660]   Yep.
[01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:32.660]   Yep.
[01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:35.180]   So anyway, the Westinghouse monitors may be worth looking into.
[01:05:35.180 --> 01:05:39.500]   Well, gang, this has been a very fine and enjoyable podcast.
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:41.620]   And I thank you all for being here.
[01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:45.180]   I'm going to sharpen my razor blade now and cut out all the offensive material, which
[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:48.020]   should leave us with a good 10 minutes.
[01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:50.460]   Jackie, I want to thank you so much for being with us and putting up with us.
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:51.460]   Jackie Chang is a...
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:52.460]   Oh, no problem.
[01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:54.380]   The Mac Blogger for R.S.
[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:57.180]   Technica also writes for the news at R.S.
[01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:58.180]   Technica.com.
[01:05:58.180 --> 01:05:59.180]   Great.
[01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:00.180]   Thank you for having me.
[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:01.180]   Great having you.
[01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:02.180]   Thank you for being here.
[01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:03.700]   We'll come back anytime we want us.
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:04.700]   I'll see you later.
[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:05.700]   Thank you, Jackie.
[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:06.700]   All right.
[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:07.700]   Thank you.
[01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:11.980]   Patrick Norton, of course, is the host of DL.TV with Robert Herron.
[01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:12.980]   And...
[01:06:12.980 --> 01:06:14.820]   We've got a good segment for everybody.
[01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:20.540]   You saw the ruined rear projection HDTV because the guy used too much wind used to clean it.
[01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:25.020]   We've got the after pictures from after the Windex dried out and Herron, Robert Exett,
[01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:29.460]   put together, he died on how not to ruin your HDTV while cleaning it.
[01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:30.460]   So, after...
[01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:32.020]   Can we talk about that just for one sec?
[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:35.820]   That is one of the most important things I think anyone's ever discussed.
[01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:37.700]   You know, because I ran into that.
[01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:42.420]   And I said, I don't think half the public realizes that this possibility exists.
[01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:46.580]   The fact that you spray Windex to explain it, you can explain it, Patrick, if you want
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:47.580]   to.
[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:50.660]   But the way I understand it, you spray a bunch of Windex on your rear projector.
[01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:52.340]   The Windex, you got too much.
[01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:57.620]   It runs down to the bottom where it leeches into the crack and then it just gets through
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:07:01.700]   capillary action and gets sucked up into the screen and ruins your set.
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:02.700]   Yeah.
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:06.460]   Basically, the front of a rear projection TV is...
[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:12.100]   It's a sandwich is like sort of a front screen, then a Fresnel lens, and then who knows what's
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:13.100]   all behind that.
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:15.780]   And the Fresnel lens, of course, has thousands of little tiny circles.
[01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:21.620]   Capillary action will pull the liquid up into, you know, all of the little scribes that make
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:22.820]   up the lens.
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:23.820]   And it's pretty ugly.
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:27.380]   I mean, basically, first of all, you got to be really careful what you use to clean
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:31.020]   any monitor because a lot of the coating, a lot of the things you might spray in a window
[01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:35.060]   and not think twice about will damage the coatings on the front of your monitor, especially
[01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:36.980]   notebook flat panel.
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:37.980]   I use...
[01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:38.980]   And some of the high-end monitors.
[01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:39.980]   Spitting elbow grease, is that okay?
[01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:40.980]   It's a bit work.
[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:44.060]   That's very good.
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:45.060]   But the...
[01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:49.380]   What was nuts about this is a front of ours just gotten this like huge 60-inch rear projection
[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:50.900]   in like four or five weeks later.
[01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:55.220]   I mean, the worst thing you can do is spray a whole bunch of wind decks or any other wet
[01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:59.180]   cleaner on the lens because it just, you know, spray it on a towel...
[01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:02.860]   If you're going to use a cleaner, spray it on a towel first, you know, spray it on your
[01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:05.220]   soft rag whenever you're using to clean the front.
[01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:08.780]   But Aaron's got some good stuff and it's not expensive stuff either.
[01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:11.660]   You know, microfiber and patience.
[01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:16.300]   Well, it reminds me back to the point, which is I don't think that these manufacturers
[01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:20.020]   have ever mentioned this problem because I know people must be spraying, you know,
[01:08:20.020 --> 01:08:21.020]   gobs of...
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:24.420]   What you think, it's like most of them are pretty clear about what, you know, things
[01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:27.580]   not to do with your monitor.
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:28.580]   I think it's on there.
[01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:30.820]   Well, you know what, it'd be interesting to check.
[01:08:30.820 --> 01:08:33.060]   I'll go home and check the manual for my little LCD explainer.
[01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:35.500]   It's kind of a natural thing to want to do.
[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:36.500]   I mean, wind decks.
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:38.260]   Good for cleaning windows.
[01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:42.020]   Well, I haven't used any sort of a wet product on any of my monitors in years.
[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:46.940]   Ever since I bought like a really good $12 paintbrush, like a 4-inch wide paintbrush,
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:47.940]   now just simply go...
[01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:48.940]   Just paint it.
[01:08:48.940 --> 01:08:49.940]   Just paint it up.
[01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:50.940]   Just basically toss off all the dust from it.
[01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:53.700]   Do you find latex or is better, latex paint or...
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:57.140]   Well, it's going to be three points coats of gray anywhere.
[01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:58.140]   Oh, okay.
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:09:00.580]   You use Zu Primer then.
[01:09:00.580 --> 01:09:04.340]   Anything to keep lifetime channel off the sunscreen.
[01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:05.340]   That's funny.
[01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:06.340]   I'm sick and tired of Mark E. Post.
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:07.340]   I'm sick and tired of seeing your...
[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:08.340]   It's a pre-post!
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:09.340]   I don't know.
[01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:13.500]   I think the thing to be concerned about is, you know, it's hard to...
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:17.260]   If somebody sneezes on your monitor, then the paintbrush isn't going to work.
[01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:22.580]   So this big expose will be on DL.TV.
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:23.820]   It's up there now.
[01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:24.820]   Right on the whole page.
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:25.820]   Go there now.
[01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:26.820]   Look at the pictures.
[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:29.580]   That's DL.TV and pull my divorce act now.
[01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:31.180]   Please.
[01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:33.580]   That's all the pay you're getting until Dell sends us a check.
[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:35.260]   So make sure you make those plugs.
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:37.420]   My favorite show on the Game Show Network.
[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:39.020]   Pull my divorce act.
[01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:41.100]   I like that.
[01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:43.260]   So does it make a sound?
[01:09:43.260 --> 01:09:44.260]   Let's try!
[01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:45.260]   Oh!
[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:46.260]   Wow.
[01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:47.260]   Thank you, Patrick Norton.
[01:09:47.260 --> 01:09:48.260]   Thank you.
[01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:49.260]   Take care.
[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:50.260]   Bye-bye.
[01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:58.540]   Annie and Aco is full of joy and mirth every week in the Chicago Sun times and every minute
[01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:01.540]   of the day at cwob.com, the colossal.
[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:03.540]   Zee.com or .com?
[01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:07.700]   I believe it or not, I was the first person at that domain.
[01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:08.700]   That's pretty good.
[01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:09.700]   I was really quite pleased.
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:15.060]   Wob.com, his colossal waste of bandwidth.com.
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:16.060]   Except no substitute.
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:17.060]   And it's always great to talk to you.
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:21.700]   Thank you for joining us, Andy, and we'll save the Russian singing for next time.
[01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:22.860]   It's been a slice, Leo.
[01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:23.860]   Bye, you're welcome.
[01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:24.860]   Bye.
[01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:25.860]   Bye.
[01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:32.700]   And finally, JohnC.org/blog, where you can get your daily dose of imagery and fun.
[01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:33.700]   Crackpot stories.
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:34.700]   Crackpot stories.
[01:10:34.700 --> 01:10:35.700]   Thank you, John.
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.700]   Good to be here as usual.
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:38.700]   You're a twit.
[01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:39.700]   Who's in the can?
[01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:40.700]   Do it the twit.
[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:41.700]   Do it the twit.
[01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:42.700]   All right.
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:43.700]   Do it the twit, baby.
[01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:44.700]   Do it the twit.
[01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:45.700]   All right.
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:46.700]   Do it the twit, baby.
[01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:47.700]   Do it the twit, baby.
[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:48.700]   Do it the twit.
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:49.700]   All right.
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:50.700]   Do it the twit, baby.
[01:10:50.700 --> 01:10:51.700]   Do it the twit, baby.
