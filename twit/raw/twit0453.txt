[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240]   It's time for Twit this weekend Tech.
[00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.740]   And we've got a great show.
[00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.620]   Harry McCracken here from Time Magazine,
[00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.020]   Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle.
[00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.540]   And we're going to kick things off,
[00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.740]   the security expert Bruce Schneier.
[00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.460]   He originally said Hartbleed on a scale of 1 to 10
[00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.060]   was an 11.
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.860]   He says it's not as bad as he thought.
[00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.900]   The details on Hartbleed and all the tech news
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.220]   coming up next on Twit.
[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.220]   Netcast you love.

[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.180]   Every week we get together with some of the best journalists
[00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.780]   in the biz to talk about the latest Tech News.
[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.340]   Welcome, Gary McCracken has been knocking it out of the park.
[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.540]   I told you when you got here with Time Magazine.
[00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.700]   I loved your Google 10th anniversary story.
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.540]   That was fabulous.
[00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.820]   Thank you.
[00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.860]   That was a lot of fun to do.
[00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.740]   Welcome back.
[00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.380]   Good to have you.
[00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.860]   Great to be here.
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.980]   Also here from the Houston Chronicle,
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.300]   our good friend Dwight Silverman, blog.chron.com/techbog.
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.700]   Blog, and he's in the offices today.
[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.900]   Covering, no doubt, heart bleed.
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.540]   No, I'm here for you, Leo.
[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.540]   I just don't have--
[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.100]   I moved and I just don't have the wonderful setup
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.100]   that I used to have, so I'm deep in the bowels of the mighty
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.100]   Houston Chronicle in a conference room.
[00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.660]   Well, you'd rather not be here on a Sunday.
[00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.140]   Yeah, I'm sorry that we made you come to work.
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.540]   Si.
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.900]   Also with us, probably one of the best known security experts
[00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.500]   in America.
[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.740]   He's a cryptographer.
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.900]   You may remember, I think he helped--
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.820]   in fact, last time you were on, I think we mentioned this,
[00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.300]   helped with the crypto in crypto NOMACON
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.180]   and a perfect guy to have on during heart bleed week.
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.260]   Rishnair is here.
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.260]   Hi, Bruce.
[00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.980]   Hey, hi.
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.580]   Great to have you.
[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.340]   So at the beginning of the week, you
[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.300]   said on a scale of 1 to 10, heart bleed is an 11.
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.940]   A very serious flaw.
[00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:36.440]   It's funny.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.460]   We thought this would be the week we'd
[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.980]   be talking about XP exploits.
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.540]   No.
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.460]   Well, it turns out you never know.
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.060]   These things happen kind of at random.
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.260]   Heart bleed--
[00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.180]   no, it was real interesting because for a whole lot of reasons.
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.260]   One, it was potentially catastrophic.
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.380]   It affected an enormous number of servers out there.
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.860]   And you can weaponize it with like three lines of shell scripts.
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.580]   I had colleagues who were up and running and scanning
[00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.300]   and attacking systems within 10 minutes of learning about it.
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.740]   Wow.
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.020]   So it was a big deal.
[00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.500]   It still is a big deal.
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.140]   You were able to send a packet using this heartbeat technique
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.100]   built into OpenSSL a couple of years ago.
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.260]   You're able to send a malformed packet that requests
[00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.300]   data up to 64K from memory of the server.
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.460]   But it's-- you can't be specific.
[00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.340]   It's whatever is there.
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.860]   Yeah, it has to do with how the heap's working.
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.340]   And it's kind of random what you get.
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.060]   But you can query that 64K multiple times.
[00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.620]   And you get different data.
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.260]   You don't always get the same.
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.140]   So if you're looking to get everything on the computer,
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.780]   you just do it again and again.
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.140]   Turns out you actually can't get everything.
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.580]   There are some weird reasons why some data comes
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.300]   and some data doesn't.
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.780]   We're still exploring that.
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.900]   But potentially, when we heard about this,
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.660]   you could basically grab everything and it left no trace.
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.380]   There's nothing in an audit log that
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.300]   said that you were attacked, which made it really scary.
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.020]   And we had to fix it quick.
[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.540]   Yeah.
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.220]   The fact that this has been around for two years,
[00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.140]   it's conceivable that somebody knew about it two years ago
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.780]   and has been just pinging servers.
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.140]   I mean, how rapidly can you do this?
[00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.900]   I guess every second or faster.
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.420]   Yeah, you can do it as fast as you can.
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.020]   And it turns out you can ping the entire internet
[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.940]   and see who's vulnerable in about 15, 20 minutes
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:30.940]   depending on your setup.
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:31.420]   Wow.
[00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.100]   So a bunch of research I've been doing that.
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.500]   And so we can watch the decay of sites that are vulnerable.
[00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.220]   We do know that we have good evidence
[00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.980]   that before the announcement, nobody
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.860]   was doing a sweep of the internet looking to see who's
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:46.460]   vulnerable.
[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.500]   So we have data from servers, from honeypots,
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.300]   that we've been able to comb through.
[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.380]   And I've seen no one use Heartbleed
[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.060]   at a global basis before that.
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.700]   We have no idea if they were targeted attacks.
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.220]   But that's very good news.
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.460]   That means it seems unlikely that this
[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.500]   is a vulnerability known in the hacker community.
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.180]   They'd be scanning sites looking for vulnerabilities.
[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.700]   A targeted attack, well, at least it's unlikely
[00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.580]   that you and I were a target.
[00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.140]   Indeed, right?
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.500]   The good news is the hacker community
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.740]   did not know about this, it seems.
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.740]   We started seeing scans within minutes of the announcement.
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.420]   But before that, we saw nothing.
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.900]   So that's the good news.
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.580]   The other good news is that subsequent research
[00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.260]   over the week has shown that while it's possible in theory
[00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.700]   and has been done in practice to retrieve the private SSL key,
[00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.380]   the master keys you're worried about,
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.340]   it's actually a lot harder than we originally thought.
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.140]   That's very good news.
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.580]   Because the concern was that all of these secure certificates
[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.820]   have been compromised, allowing massive man
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.820]   in the middle attacks, that you're saying that seems unlikely.
[00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.020]   That seems unlikely.
[00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.500]   Certainly possible.
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.220]   Cloudflare was a company that's been leading this research.
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.220]   They've put up challenges.
[00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.700]   One of the challenges was met.
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.420]   So someone did manage to extract the keys, but it's not easy.
[00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.460]   It's not a slam dunk.
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.780]   So for the most part--
[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:11.620]   What do you get?
[00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.860]   Passwords logins.
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.660]   What are you getting in these 64K chunks?
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.900]   You get the random cruft of what the server is doing.
[00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.940]   So yes, you get password changes.
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.300]   You get web pages served.
[00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.100]   If there are credentials in the URLs, you get those.
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.100]   You get random stuff.
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.620]   You get a lot of nothing, but occasionally you get something
[00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.420]   good.
[00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.700]   And what we're seeing--
[00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.420]   I mean, it's the obvious tactic from a criminal who
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.860]   would be using this-- is you just scan everything constantly.
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.500]   You hope when you get lucky.
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.780]   Now, there's some good news on our side.
[00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.060]   Some of this stuff is hard to parse.
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.140]   So it's sort of inching to watch.
[00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:55.220]   And we don't know really what the effects are
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.020]   in terms of enabling crime.
[00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.260]   And it's, of course, it's now being patched.
[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.020]   Now, a lot of the sites are no longer vulnerable.
[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.060]   Now, vulnerable to the ping, there
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.660]   are any number of universities who
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.900]   are basically auditing the net every hour
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:15.140]   and watching a site's patch their open SSL.
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.500]   Now, that doesn't mean if they were compromised before the patch,
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.860]   they're not still vulnerable.
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:22.540]   They had to change their key and their certificate.
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.140]   There's no way to check that.
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.300]   No easy way to check that.
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.700]   Right.
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:33.300]   So the initial estimate was about 2/3 of the servers
[00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.660]   would be vulnerable to this.
[00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:35.900]   And is that accurate?
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.340]   And is the number-- what is the number now?
[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.100]   That is accurate.
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.260]   The number is probably 10% that.
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:47.580]   And it's skewed because all of the big popular well-run servers
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.900]   have updated.
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.780]   A lot of the stuff that's left--
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.460]   I see a top 1,000 sites that are vulnerable list
[00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.220]   that some university publishes.
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.820]   And the sites are getting more obscure every hour
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:00.780]   that are still vulnerable.
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.180]   Are there any big companies, though, that
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.500]   should have fixed it that haven't?
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:09.820]   I didn't see any, but I'm not going to guarantee there aren't.
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.180]   It's an easy fix.
[00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.340]   Like all of these patches, it's an easy fix.
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.340]   You install the patch.
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.620]   But closing the vulnerabilities is a multi-step process.
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.460]   I mean, this is one of the reasons it was so nasty
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.580]   is that installing the patches just step one.
[00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.780]   Regenerating your public private keys are step two,
[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.860]   revoking your old key of step three,
[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.140]   getting a new key of step four.
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.580]   I guess you can switch three and four.
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.660]   And then every user on that site who could have had
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.180]   their credentials exposed needs to update their password,
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.820]   which is steps five through a million.
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:47.700]   And all of those things have to happen in sequence.
[00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:50.780]   I updated my own website and had to go through all those steps.
[00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.780]   But for me, it was pretty easy.
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.900]   If you're a banking site, at a minimum,
[00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:59.300]   any customer who logged on between when the vulnerability
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.500]   became public and when the site was patched,
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.100]   needs to update their password.
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.100]   Right.
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:06.940]   The good news is--
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:08.660]   And it might be nothing but that's just prudent.
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:09.300]   It's prudent.
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.140]   And the good news is it's not a bad thing to do once
[00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.100]   in a while anyway.
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.420]   Yeah, it isn't.
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:16.220]   But you know, we all have passwords that we rarely use.
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.020]   And then we remember, we don't like doing this.
[00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.180]   But I think it's safe that if you didn't
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:26.580]   log into the server between when the vulnerability was
[00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.220]   announced on Monday and when your server patched
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.260]   a few days later, you're OK.
[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.700]   So those obscure sites you haven't been to in a week or two,
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.900]   I think you're fine at this point.
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.580]   And second factor authentication hasn't been compromised.
[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.460]   Is that right?
[00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.740]   No, I mean, what's been compromised
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:48.700]   is the public key potentially, although it seems unlikely.
[00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:53.380]   And stuff that happened to happen on the server
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.020]   when someone did the ping.
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:00.180]   So if you got unlucky and your data was in the heap at the time
[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:03.500]   the bad guys did the scan, it was compromised potentially.
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.620]   It's pretty random, though.
[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.620]   And it seems like unlikely that they've
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.340]   been mass-compromised as a result.
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.860]   It's extraordinarily random.
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:12.780]   Mass is definitely unlikely.
[00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.300]   And it'll be individual.
[00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.180]   I haven't seen yet anybody with any estimates
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.660]   on what sorts of crime has been a result of this.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.940]   We know the hacker started pinging this vulnerability.
[00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.500]   As soon as public.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.500]   So they didn't waste it out.
[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.220]   And it was actually trivially easy.
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:33.740]   What's interesting, some of these other vulnerabilities,
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.900]   they're not in a computer to write to run arbitrary code.
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.180]   This one you can't.
[00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.140]   But this one, you could really weaponize within a couple
[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.340]   of minutes of learning about it.
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.860]   It's just so easy.
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.660]   Bloomberg said that two sources told them this was an NSA bug
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:50.700]   or that the NSA knew about it and had been using it for two
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:51.500]   years.
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.780]   Given its utility, that seems highly unlikely.
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.580]   You know, so we're all debating this right now.
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.700]   There was a Bloomberg article that said
[00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.940]   two anonymous sources of the NSA knew this for two years.
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:06.820]   NSA came out with actually the Director of National Intelligence
[00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.020]   on his blog, came out with a very strong denial.
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.460]   This is untrue.
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.220]   Answer is we don't know.
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.740]   It seems unlikely.
[00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:19.660]   This vulnerability is so big and so nasty.
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.020]   And the United States and other democratic countries,
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:27.660]   I think, are so vulnerable that it would make a lot of sense
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:31.500]   of the NSA if they found this to alert the community
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.740]   and get this closed.
[00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:36.260]   It's a bigger risk to us than it is value.
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:40.180]   Certainly, the NSA probably got an advanced notice of a week
[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.060]   or so, like some of the big companies.
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.180]   I mean, they, I hope they took it and ran with it
[00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.020]   and attacked everybody they could during that week.
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.300]   They've done not.
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:50.740]   Right?
[00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.780]   Mine is now.
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.780]   Who knows what you're going to get.
[00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.980]   But that's what you do, right?
[00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.540]   They're good at phishing expeditions.
[00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.060]   Notice of Microsoft bugs that are being fixed
[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.500]   to the next patch Tuesday.
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:00.900]   That's right.
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.100]   And they just run with them for the week and two they have.
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.180]   That makes perfect sense.
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.580]   We want them to do that.
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:06.180]   I'm curious.
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.660]   I saw Google said that honey, one version of Android
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.500]   was vulnerable, 411.
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.700]   How could Android be vulnerable at all to this?
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.740]   It's not a server.
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:19.300]   Well, anybody that's using OpenSSL and responding
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.700]   to Pings is vulnerable.
[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:24.140]   When I'm worried most about right now
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.900]   are some of the hardware devices.
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:26.820]   The routers.
[00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:32.300]   The cost, unpatable routers and switches and modems
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:35.380]   where upgrading involves the trash can, a credit card,
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.540]   or a trip to Best Buy.
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:36.820]   Right.
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.860]   And that's not going to be fun.
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.500]   These things are laden with problems.
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.020]   We've seen so many problems on these inexpensive routers.
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:43.420]   So--
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:46.020]   Well, I mean, it's because the economics is different.
[00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.020]   Right.
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.420]   I mean, essentially, they're like the computers
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.860]   were in the mid '90s, but they're very low cost,
[00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.740]   very low engineering expertise.
[00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:56.380]   They're not built with the same care.
[00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.740]   Then they're not as robust.
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.780]   So they're built as throwaway devices,
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.340]   yet they have these enormous vulnerabilities.
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.220]   And in the mid '90s, we got a whole community
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:12.140]   to embrace quick patching and open vulnerability disclosure
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.500]   and all of these things that made us safer.
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:17.860]   It's really hard to imagine the same systems working
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:23.980]   on your refrigerator just because nobody cares very much.
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.660]   Bruce, do you think this, as some have said,
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.460]   is an indictment of open source software
[00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.660]   that people can commit?
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.860]   The guy who did this as a German software developer who--
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.300]   I mean, we know who it is because there's a commit log.
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:37.700]   And he's been interviewed.
[00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.620]   And he's, I'm sure, really embarrassed about this.
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.100]   It's not an indictment of open source software.
[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:47.220]   It's an indictment of software that isn't independently analyzed.
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.300]   This could have easily happened in closed source
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:50.820]   in the proprietary software.
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:53.300]   Could easily have been thrown out there.
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.540]   The problem was nobody was doing the analysis.
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:15:00.020]   And any software open or closed needs to be analyzed.
[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:05.100]   Open software is more secure because it can be looked at
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.700]   by more people because it's harder to slip in something
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.140]   like this unnoticed.
[00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.980]   But open source doesn't magically mean someone's
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.700]   going to look at it.
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.660]   And this seemed to have fallen through the cracks.
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:21.460]   It was an incredibly pivotal, important, critical piece
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.580]   of code that's just being maintained by a few guys
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.940]   in their spare time.
[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.140]   Now, good for them.
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:28.620]   And I'm glad they're doing it.
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.940]   But they can use some backup.
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:31.500]   Yeah.
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:34.580]   I feel bad for Robin Segalman, who's
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.180]   the German who introduced the flaw.
[00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.820]   And he just said, yeah, I forgot to validate a variable
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:42.740]   containing a length.
[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:43.580]   It just--
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.860]   you know, I missed it.
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.300]   And that happens all the time itself.
[00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:47.420]   It happens all the time.
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.940]   Now, something interesting to ask.
[00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.940]   I mean, if we're going to speculate about the NSA,
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.020]   I mean, they spend millions of dollars
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.020]   searching for vulnerabilities every year
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.900]   in critical software.
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.420]   If they didn't find this one, maybe we
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:03.460]   should wonder how well our money's being spent.
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.500]   Yeah, this is like you can't get more critical than the OpenSSL
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.900]   library used by two thirds of all the server media.
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:07.900]   Right.
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.420]   You think somebody in the NSA would have looked at it
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:13.100]   and would have checked for all of these sorts of bounds
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.060]   checking problems and would have noticed this.
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:18.340]   The fact that they didn't, or at least claim they didn't,
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.180]   is independently interesting.
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:21.700]   We've heard President Obama's--
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:24.420]   it turns out President Obama has said, well, the NSA will not
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:27.140]   have-- if they find a flaw in software like this,
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.220]   and there's a compelling security argument,
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.620]   national security argument, for not exposing that flaw,
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.580]   then they can do that.
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:38.460]   In general, they will, but they do have an out.
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.940]   Well, you know, and this is all the weasel wording.
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:41.700]   Yeah.
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.820]   As long as the NSA's mission is primarily
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.700]   to eavesdrop on the entire planet,
[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:49.700]   there will be a compelling reason
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.340]   to keep these vulnerabilities secret.
[00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.140]   We know the NSA purchases the vulnerabilities
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.060]   on the open market.
[00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.660]   We know they keep things secret.
[00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:00.700]   I mean, this is a fundamental problem
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.220]   of giving the NSA both hats.
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.420]   That the same organization is in charge of security
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.700]   and insecurity, which causes some interesting debates
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.740]   inside the NSA.
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.660]   And this is called the equities issue.
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.860]   And in this case, I mean, looking at it,
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:18.500]   I would hope the NSA would make the right decision.
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.940]   And if they did learn about it, would try to fix it.
[00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.620]   Because I think we are uniquely vulnerable,
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:27.900]   more than I'm going to make us up the Russians or the Chinese,
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:31.780]   because we use SSL more than everybody else.
[00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.500]   Bruce, can I ask a question about--
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.900]   I want to go back to the idea of nobody looking
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.540]   behind the creators of this code.
[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:44.140]   Have you seen as a result of this a movement
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:49.300]   to create some kind of Q&A to do analysis arising from this?
[00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.500]   Are there going to be changes as a result?
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.140]   I haven't seen anything yet, but I
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.860]   think it's something that will be discussed
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:56.700]   in the open source community.
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.580]   Unfortunately, a lot of the open source community
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:03.580]   are people working for altruistic reasons, not for pay.
[00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:07.620]   But as long as this stuff is being put in for-profit products
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.700]   by big companies, they should pick up
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:12.060]   some of the auditing functions.
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.580]   And hopefully that'll happen.
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.660]   I haven't seen any concerted discussion about this.
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.900]   It'll certainly be something we're
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.580]   going to talk about, because it's important.
[00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:20.660]   I use LastPass.
[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:24.300]   One of the things LastPass's security check does now
[00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:28.060]   is go through the sites that I have passwords for.
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:29.300]   And it does a couple of things.
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.060]   First, it assesses whether that site was bit by heart.
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:33.620]   But then I think it's hard to do,
[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.820]   since sites often obfuscate what libraries and servers
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:37.780]   they're using.
[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:41.420]   Yeah, but the way you tell is you do the ping.
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.260]   If you do the ping and it comes back,
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.580]   you know they're using open SSL.
[00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.060]   You know that they're vulnerable.
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.060]   So you can audit this.
[00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.100]   You audit it by hacking it.
[00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.380]   Isn't that illegal?
[00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:57.580]   Well, you do it at four bytes.
[00:18:57.580 --> 00:18:58.780]   You don't do it at a match.
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:18:59.900]   It actually matters.
[00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:00.980]   Right, you take a small amount.
[00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:01.780]   OK, that's good.
[00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:02.820]   All right.
[00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.460]   And then they also, of course, check
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.660]   to see if the certificate has been updated.
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.940]   And there's no point in changing that password
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.100]   if a site was vulnerable and has the out of date certificate.
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:12.420]   Right.
[00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.180]   And we're trusting that they've regenerated their keys.
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.580]   And we don't know.
[00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:17.860]   We can't tell.
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.900]   That part we don't know.
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:20.820]   Actually, that's interesting.
[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.940]   You probably-- and I'm thinking of thinking about this out loud.
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.580]   The public key would be in the certificate.
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:26.420]   So you can tell.
[00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:27.020]   Never mind.
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:29.060]   If the certificate has been revoked
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:33.100]   and a new one has been issued in this last five days,
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.420]   then you're all right.
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.700]   Right, exactly.
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:36.260]   All right.
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:38.580]   And then if you have logged in during the danger period,
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.900]   you really should change your password at that point.
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.420]   It's just good hygiene anyway.
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.420]   Just do it anyway.
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.780]   Yeah.
[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:46.820]   All right.
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.500]   So I was curious to how well we can assess
[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:50.900]   whether there's a problem.
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:54.340]   It sounds like we can do a pretty good job of that.
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:54.820]   All right.
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.700]   So your advice to people?
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:58.140]   Wow.
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:02.700]   My advice to people is we could calm down now.
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.860]   Do change your passwords if you have to.
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:10.460]   And if the site you care about hasn't corrected itself,
[00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:12.700]   you need to bug them.
[00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:13.060]   Very good.
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.460]   Bruce, this is so great to talk to you.
[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.980]   Shania.com, the website.
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.380]   Bruce Shania is one of the--
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:21.980]   I'm going to say the best guy to talk to you on stuff like this.
[00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:22.340]   I just love--
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:22.860]   Yeah.
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.780]   I promise to get myself better lit next time.
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:26.780]   There's this kind of thing up here.
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.940]   If you agree to come on every once in a while,
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:30.060]   I'm going to send you lights.
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:31.340]   I'm going to send you cameras.
[00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.020]   I'm going to send you microphones.
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:33.500]   And I'm going--
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.580]   Actually, all I need is a backdrop, right?
[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.900]   A little tarp will do.
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.020]   Now, get you a green screen, Bruce.
[00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:39.780]   Anything you want, we'll get you--
[00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.820]   if you just come on every once in a while,
[00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.460]   because we just love having you on.
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:44.100]   That's the deal.
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:44.900]   All right.
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:45.540]   Thank you.
[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.860]   Bruce Shania, Shania on security.
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.020]   I want to see the green screen.
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:49.620]   That'd be fun.
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.860]   You got to put all of them things on.
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.460]   I can put you in the Kremlin.
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:56.460]   Thanks, Bruce.
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:57.180]   We'll let you go now.
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.180]   Thank you.
[00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:58.660]   Thank you.
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.980]   Take care.
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.300]   When you hear him talk, you just get the authority.
[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.820]   You know this guy knows what he's talking about.
[00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.140]   And he really does have that.
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.700]   Have the reputation.
[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.060]   So I feel better.
[00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.620]   It sounds like it's no longer an 11.
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.980]   It's only a nine.
[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.860]   So you were talking earlier about there's no real good test
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:19.820]   for it.
[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:22.860]   You have to do the hack.
[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:27.580]   Because what was funny, I had a debate with somebody online.
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.260]   They found that CRON.com was vulnerable,
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.900]   but the tests I were doing showed it not.
[00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.540]   And we were both working on the same tool.
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.220]   And it turned out well enough.
[00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:37.900]   Here's the issue.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.580]   You can't just query the server and say,
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:44.940]   are you running OpenSSL pre 1.0.1, the fix?
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.860]   Are you running engine X or Apache?
[00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.740]   Because most servers will just not respond.
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:53.380]   Honestly.
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.660]   It's foolish to tell people what you're doing.
[00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.900]   So if it's something at that level,
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:21:59.980]   that's not going to be useful.
[00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:02.460]   But obviously, it's not so hard to write a little test that
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.420]   says, well, let's just take advantage of heart bleed.
[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.340]   And I'm going to send you a word.
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:12.500]   So what you do is you say, here's an authentication word,
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:17.020]   cake, and send me back five letters.
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:21.620]   And if you get cake plus one back, it's got heart bleed.
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:25.820]   If you get cake back, then you know it's been fixed.
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.300]   It's a little sight so scary.
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:31.100]   Because Google is going to fix himself really quickly.
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:34.820]   But if you're doing business with itty bitty sites,
[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:36.420]   I mean, some of these things don't look like they've
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:40.020]   been updated in the last five or six years in some cases.
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:40.380]   Yeah.
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:42.260]   And maybe there's no me at home.
[00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:47.340]   Or hosting services where you share libraries for these kind
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:47.660]   of things.
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.660]   For example, I'm not saying that they had it,
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:53.780]   but say WordPress.com, where essentially everybody uses
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:56.900]   the same set of libraries across the board.
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:22:59.060]   And there are literally millions of sites there.
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.140]   Right.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.580]   Well, that's the problem with XP.
[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:04.220]   And that's a problem with a lot of things.
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.060]   In fact, I'm sorry.
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:06.580]   I didn't get to ask or should have asked,
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.420]   but I didn't get to ask a Bruce about XP.
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:13.020]   This was the week that XP ended its life.
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:13.620]   Again.
[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:14.780]   Again.
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.020]   We'll talk about that in a lot more.
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.260]   Harry McCracken's here, the technologizer from Time
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.940]   Magazine from the Houston Chronicle,
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:22.860]   the Great Dwight Silverman.
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:24.020]   It's good to have you both.
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.940]   Good time to talk about lots of things in just a bit.
[00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:30.140]   But first, a word from our great sponsors, Citrix,
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:31.860]   makers of Go to Meeting, which I think
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:38.140]   is without a doubt the number one meeting
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.740]   is software in the world.
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.460]   This is what people-- and boy, there couldn't be a better time
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:47.180]   as more and more teams are spread out all over the world.
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:49.060]   Very often, you're working with people
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.220]   in different time zones, different countries.
[00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:52.460]   It's hard to have a meeting.
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:56.620]   And meetings are so valuable to get on the same page,
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:00.620]   to communicate with each other, to understand,
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:02.660]   to break through the log jam.
[00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:04.820]   We have a rule here at least an institute.
[00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:06.660]   It has three emails on a subject.
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:07.340]   That's it.
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.980]   Boom, you're getting in the same room,
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:13.620]   and we're going to hash this out or have a Go to Meeting.
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:16.780]   You know what most of our contributors are not in Petalim.
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.140]   They're all over the place.
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.100]   When meetings matter, lots of people
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:23.500]   use Go to Meeting 34 million meetings last year.
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:28.420]   Up time, 99.9% and just a great platform.
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:29.700]   You could share the screen, but you
[00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:32.700]   could also share cameras so you could see each other face
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:35.140]   to face in crystal clear video.
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.700]   Go to Meeting allows you to present, demonstrate,
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.300]   and simply meet from anywhere with any Mac, any PC,
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:41.860]   any tablet or smartphone.
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.300]   We've got 30 days free.
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.780]   If you visit GoToMeeting.com, click the Try It free button
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.860]   and use our promo code, "Twit."
[00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:53.740]   If you want to do it on iPads and tablets and Macs and PCs
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:56.780]   and meet with everybody everywhere,
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:58.020]   just use our promo code, "Twit."
[00:24:58.020 --> 00:25:04.140]   30 days free, go to Meeting.com.
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.140]   Have either of you guys-- I mean, all three of us
[00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:10.100]   talk to real people from time to time.
[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.100]   Have any of you heard about problems with Windows XP
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.940]   in the past week?
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:18.060]   It was Tuesday, was the last update April 8th.
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:20.140]   I have a friend who works for a court system
[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:24.340]   in a large eastern US city, and they're still on XP
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:24.900]   and all of them.
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:25.860]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:29.460]   Oh, here in Houston, a lot of oil companies still use XP.
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.460]   Banks.
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:31.940]   Yes, banks.
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.980]   One of our energy reporters last year
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.820]   did with this deadline.
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:40.660]   Lumi did a big story on how it's so impacting the energy
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:44.740]   industry because they have so many proprietary programs that
[00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.860]   have been written specifically to run on XP.
[00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.820]   They can't move to 7 or 8.
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.420]   And essentially, they kind of have
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:53.100]   to wait till they can get the proprietary software fixed.
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:57.020]   Here at the Houston Chronicle, most of our desktop systems
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:58.420]   are still Windows XP.
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:01.060]   But you're not surfing the net and opening emails on those,
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.060]   where are you?
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.060]   Oh, oh.
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.060]   I hate Windows 7.
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.060]   I hate Windows.
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:06.060]   I hate Windows.
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.060]   I hate Windows.
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:13.740]   So, actually, our problem is that we are using a content management
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.740]   system for prints, for writing the prints.
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.580]   You're using basis or something, and you can't--
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:18.580]   You got to use XP.
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:19.580]   It's DTR.
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:23.300]   It runs on Adobe's suite.
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:27.620]   And so, we simply haven't updated it to run the Windows 7
[00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:28.620]   version.
[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.220]   We're in the process of doing that now.
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.940]   But a lot of big companies are in that case.
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:36.460]   And then you have smaller companies who can't afford new
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:40.380]   hardware and new software, and they're just kind of stuck on it.
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:45.940]   My wife runs Windows XP to run the software that she uses for
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.020]   her medical accounting.
[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:51.380]   She's a psychotherapist, and she has to use the software.
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.700]   And it's about $10,000 for her to upgrade to the new software,
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:56.340]   and she's just not going to do it.
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:00.020]   Microsoft does not get to decide when operating systems are
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:01.180]   not alive.
[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:04.620]   Within the last six months, I've seen businesses using DOS.
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:07.620]   And if DOS is still with us, I mean, the last XP machine is
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:12.460]   going to be shut off many, many years from now.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:13.980]   And medical systems.
[00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:15.580]   Dr. Mom was in our chat room.
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:16.980]   She's a physician.
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:20.700]   She was sending me pictures of X-ray machines and all sorts
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.020]   of medical hardware.
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:25.820]   And even desktops in hospitals are using XP.
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:28.060]   Now, the medical machines, the ATMs, they're not going
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:28.420]   online.
[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:29.900]   They're not doing risky things.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:33.460]   But nurses are using those XP machines to send emails and
[00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:34.380]   surf the net.
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:35.700]   And those are risky things.
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.220]   So that stuff survives.
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:40.420]   And it's expensive to shift.
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:41.100]   I understand.
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.860]   You said it exactly right, Harry.
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:44.900]   Microsoft doesn't get to make the decision about who stops
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.100]   using XP.
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.740]   We, you know, users do.
[00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:50.060]   It might be a terrible decision to keep using it, but
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:53.460]   it's not a decision Microsoft can make for anybody else.
[00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:54.620]   They try.
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.860]   One of the stories you have on the list, Leo, is about the
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:28:00.260]   fact that there are a lot of web servers that are the
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.980]   operating system, underlying operating system is Windows XP.
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.740]   And in that same story, they talk about the fact that
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:10.900]   there are still Windows NT 4.0 systems out there running
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:11.340]   websites.
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.580]   But can I point out none of those systems had any problem
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:14.860]   with heart bleed?
[00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:16.060]   Not one.
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:16.540]   That's right.
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.460]   Microsoft has not one.
[00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.420]   Doesn't use the open source.
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:21.980]   It's got its own library.
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.660]   IIS has its own SSL library.
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.620]   You mentioned content management systems that
[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:28.980]   brought to mind an article this week in the New York Times
[00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:30.300]   they're talking about Ezra Klein.
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.700]   And he left the New York Times, the-- or I'm sorry, the
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:37.460]   Washington Post won't blog to go to work for Vox.
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.860]   But the funny thing-- and this-- maybe this speaks--
[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:42.140]   maybe you could speak to this a little bit, Dwight.
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.900]   The funny thing is in this article, they said, many people
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:45.660]   go to Vox.
[00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:50.940]   Vox publishes the Verge, Espy Nation, Polygon, and now this
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.420]   new Ezra Klein blog.
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:55.260]   Many people go there because of their fabulous content
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.940]   management system.
[00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:00.140]   They wrote something from scratch called Chorus.
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:03.780]   And apparently, this is a selling point.
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:07.340]   One of the reasons Ezra Klein left the Washington Post
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:14.140]   and went to Vox is because of Chorus.
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:16.260]   You guys both work with content management systems.
[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:17.660]   They're sure they're a little bit antiquated.
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:18.100]   I don't know.
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:19.820]   Well, we're on WordPress.com actually.
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.580]   That's easy.
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:22.100]   That's a good one.
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.340]   If I had to pick anything, I would probably pick that.
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.900]   Particularly for a company that is probably not going to
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.340]   develop the next great CMS system itself.
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:32.020]   I think WordPress is a really good choice.
[00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:34.740]   Well, we're on one of the problems in the newspaper
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:38.140]   industry is that we have multiple content management
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:38.860]   systems.
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:42.420]   So we use WordPress, a hosted version.
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:46.580]   We have a separate set of software products for creating
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:47.700]   stories in print.
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:52.340]   And then we have a pretty nice CMS for running our website
[00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:55.780]   and managing the website that's fairly modern and up to date.
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.540]   And so we have to jump back and forth.
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:03.780]   The Holy Grail is one CMS that ends up handling both print
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:09.500]   and online if you have both components.
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:14.020]   But I can see people who have grown up using decent software.
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:17.780]   And suddenly, you go to work for a company that has a
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:18.700]   terrible CMS.
[00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.740]   It's going to be really painful.
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:21.260]   It's painful.
[00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.420]   And so I can see that happening.
[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:28.140]   I'm not sure I would jump to a company that had a great CMS.
[00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.580]   I'd jump for a company that's willing to overpay me.
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:31.940]   There you go.
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:35.340]   I'll suffer with your CMS if you give me enough money.
[00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:35.860]   That's right.
[00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:40.100]   Although I guess the whole point, of course, was it
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.740]   integrates social media.
[00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:43.340]   It's easy to update.
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:49.340]   You can do these multimedia things that these guys like to do.
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.740]   It's kind of funny.
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:56.220]   Apparently, in their interview process, they show people chorus.
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:59.620]   They say, how would you like to use this instead?
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:00.420]   Maybe they're really--
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.780]   They're probably taking any excited over that.
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:08.260]   I think the New York Times author started talking about,
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.740]   Ezra Klein and Vox, and then just fell in love with the
[00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:11.660]   content management system.
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:14.500]   The article ends up being about chorus.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.180]   It just shows you.
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.780]   I'm sure the Times has something--
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:17.220]   well, I don't know.
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:18.660]   We'll have to ask.
[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.100]   Leo, maybe you can show us--
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:21.100]   This week in CMS.
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.100]   CMS is.
[00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.380]   This week in CMS is.
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:27.140]   This week in-- yeah, maybe not.
[00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.660]   Well, show us your CMS.
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:30.780]   Get a bunch of these tech writers on.
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.180]   Show us your CMS.
[00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.380]   Show us CMS and what--
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:34.460]   I like it.
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.180]   All right, Chatham, would you like that?
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.020]   Show us your CMS.
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:41.260]   They all fell asleep at the end.
[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:46.180]   Apparently, on Tuesday, the Canadian Revenue Agency that
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:50.340]   collects income tax shut down because of heart bleed.
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:55.780]   They were so afraid of what heart bleed might bring that
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:32:00.020]   they blocked access to their online tax filing services as a,
[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:03.660]   quote, "preventative measure to safeguard the integrity of
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:07.100]   the information we hold."
[00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:09.380]   Wow.
[00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.580]   That may be taking it a little bit too seriously.
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:15.460]   The filing services will be down till further notice.
[00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:17.180]   That's a great graphic too for that.
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:20.900]   Yeah, heart bleed is really the first open source bug with a
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.700]   great logo.
[00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:23.740]   Great name, great logo.
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:24.500]   Great name.
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.140]   That's the Canadian flag too.
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:30.860]   So it's a credit to Mashable for mashing those two up.
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:31.420]   That's great.
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:32.780]   That's great.
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:35.380]   How do Canadians pay their taxes anyway?
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:38.980]   I know where ours is coming up April 15th, which is an
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:39.740]   interesting thing.
[00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:41.100]   That's Tuesday, right?
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:42.980]   Everybody, you all filed?
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:45.220]   Any Canadians here?
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:46.060]   No?
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.260]   Get another thing about Canada.
[00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:48.620]   I think it's a month later.
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:49.980]   I don't know why.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:51.420]   I think it's a month later.
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.060]   Like it's May 15th.
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:55.460]   And then because it's cold in the winter and things move
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:58.220]   slower.
[00:32:58.220 --> 00:32:59.660]   April 30th, apparently.
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:03.460]   They just, according to PC Guy, they just re-enabled a net
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.060]   file on Efel today.
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.420]   May 5th, apparently.
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.300]   May 5th this year.
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:11.620]   April 15th, interestingly enough, is also an important day
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:14.860]   because it's the one day anybody,
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:19.860]   anybody, can buy Google Glass for $1,500.
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.340]   You're going to run out and buy it?
[00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:23.460]   I already ran out some months ago and bought it.
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.860]   I already did it.
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.260]   How about you, Dwight?
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:27.740]   You're going to get some glass?
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.140]   I want to wait for the production version.
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:31.700]   I want the production version.
[00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:34.740]   Harry, would you go buy it again?
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.820]   As a guy who writes about this stuff, yes.
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:37.340]   You have to.
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.580]   As a consumer, I would say wait until the consumer
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:40.340]   version comes out.
[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:40.780]   Yeah.
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:41.780]   Right.
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:42.580]   Right.
[00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:43.580]   If that's--
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:44.940]   You are really, really well off, in which case
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.180]   it might be worth considering.
[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:49.860]   If $1,500 means nothing to you, buy it.
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:52.020]   If it sounds like a large chunk of change, wait.
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:54.220]   I don't think it's $1,500 useful.
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.620]   No, it's not.
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:56.660]   That's my issue with it.
[00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.420]   In fact, I did buy it, but I don't use it.
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:03.860]   I gave it a long story, but I never was that interested in it.
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:05.900]   So we got a glass--
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.500]   I had my Glass Explorer number from Google I/O last year.
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.460]   And when that came up, I said, Jason, you get it.
[00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:14.580]   Because he has a kid, he had a newborn, and I thought it'd
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:15.980]   be more appropriate for him.
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:19.420]   I just never really attracted.
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:22.260]   According to Google, we're opening a limited number of spots
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:25.620]   in the Explorer program at 9 a.m. Eastern on April 15.
[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:30.500]   So get on in there if you want to get glass.
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:33.500]   You think there'll be a rush for it?
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:34.980]   I don't think a lot of the people who
[00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:38.980]   want to know somebody who has invites, and therefore
[00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:42.420]   has already had that opportunity, but maybe not.
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:45.420]   One thing you should not do is wear it in downtown San
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:47.220]   Francisco.
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:48.940]   Or if you do, you should go like that.
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.900]   Some guy tweeted it.
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:54.420]   And I saw the tweet, and now it's a big story.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:56.820]   He was wearing his glass in the Mission District,
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:59.220]   if you know San Francisco.
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:03.820]   He got off BART and was walking through the Mission District.
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:10.740]   Somebody ran up, tore the glass off his face.
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:15.140]   OK, I mean, is it a little glass holy to get off BART
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:18.580]   in the Mission District wearing your Google glass, especially
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:23.500]   given the sensitivity right now?
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:27.780]   He was a reporter, ironically covering the protests
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:31.860]   going on in San Francisco about housing prices and evictions.
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.820]   So he should have been somewhat sensitized.
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.660]   I think he was.
[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:39.500]   A guy runs up to him and rips the glass off his face.
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.180]   But first I would thought, well, maybe he's stealing it.
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:42.260]   No.
[00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:43.460]   They give chase.
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:46.540]   The guy takes the glass, smashes it on the ground,
[00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:49.860]   and runs on.
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.140]   That's following on a story from a few weeks ago,
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:56.300]   a woman getting almost beat up in a bar for wearing glass.
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:36:00.260]   I think you should not wear your glasses at San Francisco.
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:00.980]   It is a mugging.
[00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:01.860]   He did call the police.
[00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.580]   They did take a report, but I don't think.
[00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:06.860]   And he took the pieces of his glass with him.
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:11.420]   Chris-- I'm sorry, Kyle Russell.
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:13.940]   He's a journalist with Business Insider,
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:17.020]   and he was covering those protests.
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:21.100]   I wonder-- I don't know.
[00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:24.620]   I guess glass and Google in general, but glass specifically,
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:29.900]   is a good-- is a hot point for all of this kind of upset.
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:32.100]   Yeah, I really wonder whether Google anticipated
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:35.740]   that it would become an object of fascination,
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:37.980]   but not entirely positive fascination and something like--
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.900]   Well, they now have training videos
[00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:43.660]   how not to be a glass in all and stuff like that.
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:44.500]   There's etiquette.
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.500]   I think they're aware of the issue.
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.700]   When Google Glass was first announced,
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.420]   and even when it was leaked, almost immediately
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:55.540]   the speculation about how it would be treated in social settings,
[00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:56.820]   the idea of it.
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.020]   You know, the etiquette around it,
[00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.780]   and it changing social wars came almost immediately.
[00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:04.580]   So I kind of would be surprised if Google didn't have an inkling
[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:07.260]   that if you have a camera pointed at someone
[00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:10.700]   while you're talking to them, there's a little light on it
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.740]   that it's not going to cause--
[00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:16.300]   It's kind of asking to get your glass kicked, to be honest with you.
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.860]   Right, right.
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.980]   And I think there's-- the other day,
[00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.140]   I saw somebody in a furniture store,
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:26.220]   shopping for furniture, and he was wearing Google Glass.
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:26.700]   And--
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:27.420]   Don't you just--
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:30.220]   Doesn't it-- your mind, did you just go a-hole?
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:31.300]   Well, what he was doing--
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:31.980]   He's taking pictures--
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:32.780]   --is I watched what he was--
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:33.620]   He's taking pictures--
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.220]   --of the furniture and sending it to someone.
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:36.740]   Yeah.
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.540]   I mean, I would do that with a camera phone.
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:39.940]   It's not that different, I guess.
[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:40.620]   Right.
[00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:42.660]   And it's better pictures of the camera phone, too.
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:48.020]   I'm not-- I don't find myself tempted at all.
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:50.580]   I feel like I understand why Google's doing this.
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:53.460]   In fact, I don't think they're going to ever productize it.
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:56.260]   It's my kind of belief that what Google's really doing
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:59.340]   is gathering information about how people use wearables.
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.260]   They understand this isn't the perfect form factor.
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:02.340]   It's a form factor.
[00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:03.900]   But they want the information.
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:07.740]   As we know, they're doing a SDK for wearables.
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.260]   It's more in their interest, I think,
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:12.780]   to support people who want to make wearables in whatever form
[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:15.540]   they want to make them and get Google on it.
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:19.340]   This was the debate over the Google phone.
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.060]   Fred Vogelstein-- I'll keep quoting this book.
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:22.260]   This is such a good book.
[00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.460]   Dogfight talks about Google not really being sure
[00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:26.180]   whether they want-- they were making so much money.
[00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:29.020]   It was so successful putting Google Apps on the iPhone.
[00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:30.340]   Did they really want to compete with it?
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:32.100]   Wouldn't it just make-- it's more sense
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:34.740]   from Google's point of view to support smartphones
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:36.100]   than to make them?
[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.380]   They ended up deciding to make them.
[00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:39.540]   But I wonder if they're going to make wearables
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:40.940]   or just support them.
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:43.580]   I mean, to me, the battery life is still an entirely
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.220]   unsolved conundrum.
[00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:47.700]   It does not make sense as a consumer product
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.020]   until it does way better battery life than it does.
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:50.540]   And it won't.
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:51.660]   It's too small.
[00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:52.580]   And what's your own--
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.100]   And we're a battery pack on their forehead.
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.780]   And you can make a phone larger and thicker,
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.820]   but there's a real limit to what you can do with something
[00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:59.140]   you strapped to your head.
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:38:59.660]   Right.
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:01.900]   So has there been any discussion about using solar
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:05.700]   power to power or recharge Google Glass?
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.700]   Because you certainly could line that with--
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:08.300]   It's not big.
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.580]   No, no, it's not a big-- you'd have
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:15.380]   to wear a special hat with a big brim to go with your glass.
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:17.260]   And then you'd really be a target.
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:17.620]   Yeah.
[00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:18.660]   I mean, top of a-- yeah.
[00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:19.180]   --preuse.
[00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:24.700]   Battery life's bad.
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:26.220]   To me, it's a little bit of a headache
[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.700]   he experienced to have to look up over my eyebrow.
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.420]   Yeah, I should say if I had the prescription eyeglasses model,
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:32.780]   I might be at least a little more excited.
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:34.940]   Because I prop it on top of my glasses,
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:37.740]   and I have to have it just so.
[00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.780]   Look, you ride around on a segue, you look like a dork.
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.380]   You wear Google Glass, you look like a dork.
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:42.700]   Right?
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:43.940]   It's the same thing.
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:45.860]   Originally, if you used a cell phone in public,
[00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:46.580]   you looked like a dork.
[00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:46.980]   True.
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:47.500]   We've gotten used to that.
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.060]   And when you did data on your smartphone in public 10 years
[00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:51.340]   ago, you looked like a dork.
[00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:51.820]   Now--
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:53.460]   Some of the stuff people get used to over time.
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:57.260]   Now, I find myself unusual if I'm looking up.
[00:39:57.260 --> 00:39:58.620]   Everybody's looking in their thing.
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:01.060]   You could--
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.460]   The problem, though, with Google Glass
[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:04.140]   is it's not where you're looking.
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.180]   It's that, well, it is.
[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:06.180]   You're looking at--
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:06.780]   At them.
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:07.780]   Out.
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.220]   You know, that's the difference.
[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:10.740]   It's that blinking eye.
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:11.660]   It's a little bit--
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:16.020]   I think maybe of 1984 and Brave New World had never
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:16.500]   been written.
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:19.780]   We wouldn't be so freaky about it, but they were.
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.300]   As Bleeding Heart points out, I do ride at tricycles.
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:27.340]   And people have thrown things at me out of their car.
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.180]   So I guess I'm not exempt from that.
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:32.020]   The dork factor.
[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.020]   It's not a tricycle.
[00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:35.980]   It's a three-wheeled bicycle.
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:39.820]   How many times do I have to say that?
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:40.820]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:45.340]   Do we have pictures of you, Leo?
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:46.380]   I mean, you're three-wheeled bikes.
[00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:48.020]   You know, when we first moved to this building
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:49.500]   and the base was empty, it was great,
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.820]   because I could go take rides around the basement.
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.300]   But now it's so crowded and cluttered,
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:56.420]   you can't barely walk down there, let alone ride the bicycle.
[00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:59.260]   If it was a recumbent tricycle, that would be cool.
[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:00.300]   It is.
[00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:01.220]   Oh, it's recumbent?
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:01.780]   Well, yes.
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:04.540]   What do you think I'm sitting high like on a thing with it?
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:07.900]   Pedaling as fast as I can as I go around town?
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.420]   The pedals on the wheels?
[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:10.220]   Never mind.
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:13.500]   Gary McCracken standing on the back holding my shoulders?
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:15.780]   No, it's a recumbent bike.
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:16.780]   Ah.
[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:17.380]   All right.
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:19.060]   It's two wheels of-- wait a minute.
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:21.180]   Is it two wheels in front and one in back?
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:24.020]   No, it's one wheel in front and two in back.
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.180]   You still like a dork.
[00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:26.420]   I don't care.
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:30.180]   I don't care whether it's recumbent or not.
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:31.500]   At least your feet are going around.
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:35.660]   And they're not going, bl bl bl bl.
[00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:37.380]   I want to take a break now, because I just
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:40.900]   can't get that image out of my head.
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:44.420]   Tricycles are very hipster, I'm told.
[00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:46.420]   Particularly the ones with the big wheels in the front.
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:48.580]   I still-- I see people going around in their segues
[00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:50.580]   and I think dork.
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:51.380]   I mean, they're cool.
[00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:52.340]   I love segues.
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:53.660]   They're really cool.
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:56.540]   But your eight feet tall on them.
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:59.620]   You look just weird.
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:02.380]   Am I wrong?
[00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:05.220]   Our show today brought to you by Shutterstock.com.
[00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:08.420]   If you are a blogger, if you have a website,
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:14.140]   you know that plain text on a page does somehow
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:17.420]   doesn't grasp the human imagination.
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:18.380]   We need images.
[00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:23.380]   And Shutterstock is a great source for royalty-free stock
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:28.100]   photos, illustrations, vectors and video clips,
[00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:30.500]   all kinds of stuff.
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.900]   In fact, I always like to look at the count.
[00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:38.780]   35,813,257 royalty-free stock images.
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.820]   When we started talking about Shutterstock,
[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.260]   a few months ago was $25 million.
[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:45.860]   They added this week a quarter of a million new images.
[00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:48.140]   They're entering new images like crazy.
[00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:50.460]   All of them carefully vetted, curated,
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:53.460]   so that they're gorgeous, they're useful.
[00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:58.300]   Most of them are from professional photographers and artists.
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:42:59.820]   Every time you visit, you'll find something new.
[00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:04.020]   You might say, well, what good is a 35 million image collection?
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:04.900]   How am I going to find it?
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.140]   Well, really, Shutterstock.
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:08.340]   And they keep making this better.
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:10.820]   It has a great search tool that allows you
[00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:13.780]   to search for footage, video footage, photos, vectors,
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:16.540]   illustrations, or all of the above.
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:20.420]   And you can search not just by noun.
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:22.460]   Let's say, what should I search for?
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:24.540]   Bicycle.
[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:26.580]   So I can search for bicycles.
[00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:28.540]   But then I can add stuff.
[00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:29.740]   I can say blue bicycles.
[00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.220]   In fact, they have a color picker that
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.340]   lets you just choose blue bicycles.
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.820]   I could say silly bicycles.
[00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:37.580]   You can add adjectives.
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:41.900]   And then you get pictures like this.
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:46.140]   So I think it really makes it a very useful tool.
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:49.260]   Then, by the way, you can use this without having
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:50.420]   an account or anything.
[00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:53.100]   But if you want to save these, just create a free account.
[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:55.140]   You don't have to give them any credit card or anything.
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:56.380]   Just get a free account.
[00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:58.380]   And then you could save images into a light box.
[00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.980]   You could keep that light box for further reference,
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:03.940]   future reference, or share it with colleagues.
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:07.060]   If you decide to buy images, they're very affordable.
[00:44:07.060 --> 00:44:10.100]   They have individual image packs or monthly subscriptions.
[00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.620]   We have the 25 image a standard subscription.
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.300]   We love it.
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:16.620]   We use it all the time.
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.380]   And you can download any image in any size
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:20.900]   and pay only one price.
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:24.220]   Great search tools, light boxes, their iPad and Android apps
[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:24.620]   are gorgeous.
[00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:27.020]   In fact, the iPad app won a Webby award.
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:29.060]   Multilingual customer service.
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:31.260]   They're in more than a dozen countries.
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:32.940]   Full time support throughout the week.
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:33.700]   You're going to love it.
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.220]   Shutterstock.com.

[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:55.980]   Shutterstock.com, the offer code, is Twit414.
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:56.540]   Great place.
[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:57.700]   And go to the footage.
[00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:59.900]   Don't forget to go to the footage tab on there.
[00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:00.660]   On that way, wait a minute.
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:02.460]   That was a silly.
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.860]   I had a really good bicycle, silly bicycle.
[00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:05.940]   The footage is incredible.
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:09.980]   1.6 million royalty free stock videos as well.
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:12.780]   Great for your presentations and things like that.
[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:15.060]   Shutterstock.com.
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.100]   That's a silly bicycle.
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:19.980]   That's me.
[00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:21.340]   That's what I was thinking.
[00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:22.300]   That's what I was thinking.
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:23.300]   Yes.
[00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:24.340]   Yeah, I have a trike.
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:25.540]   That's a nice trike.
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:30.340]   It looks like aluminum.
[00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:33.180]   I do have the little streamers coming off the handle,
[00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:35.220]   so you've got to have that.
[00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.660]   That's very important.
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:41.180]   Handheld quantum key generators, according to ours,
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:47.060]   Technica, just around the corner,
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:48.900]   this is actually a security issue,
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:54.180]   because one of the issues is getting good random numbers.
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:46:01.780]   QKD is a quantum key distribution.
[00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:06.180]   And while it's been very difficult to do in practice,
[00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:11.620]   the theory has really helped us create great security.
[00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:15.980]   And now, apparently, QKD is on its way.
[00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:18.860]   So I don't think there's anything to say about this.
[00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:24.180]   But a good article, hardly recommended from ours, Technica.
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:26.860]   Other than that, we need to get away
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:30.300]   some form or fashion from the traditional password
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:32.780]   and how it makes a path toward it.
[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:36.020]   Absolutely.
[00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:42.580]   I got my Amazon Fire TV, reviewed it on Tuesday
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:44.140]   and before you buy.
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:45.660]   Have you played with it a little bit?
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:46.420]   I have.
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:47.980]   What do you think?
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.260]   I think if you were already a big fan of getting
[00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:52.740]   stuff from Amazon, it's a good experience.
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:54.020]   Just like the Kindle Fire, right?
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:56.260]   Netflix and Hulu are really kind of off to the side
[00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:59.380]   and nowhere near as well done.
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:02.380]   The speech worked really well.
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:03.900]   Except it only searches Amazon.
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:05.340]   Right, it only searches Amazon.
[00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:06.180]   I guess it's not so.
[00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:07.980]   Also, the other thing, which is interesting,
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:11.460]   is on Roku, they neatly divide this stuff you have to pay for
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:13.220]   if you're a prime member from the stuff, which is free
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:14.740]   if you're a prime member.
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:17.060]   And on Fire TV, the free stuff and the stuff
[00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:19.220]   you have to pay for are all intermingled.
[00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:21.900]   And it is, therefore, more likely, I think,
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:24.900]   that you'll find something and then pay for it.
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:27.100]   I noticed that in the Tivo, too, I used to have this,
[00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:29.060]   you know, Amazon Prime streaming.
[00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:30.500]   On the Tivo, there's no entry for that.
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:31.780]   It's just all mushed together.
[00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:34.340]   That must be the new way with Amazon.
[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:35.660]   That makes serious.
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:40.700]   Harry is, if you have a Roku, is there any reason
[00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:41.900]   to get the Fire TV?
[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:45.900]   They seem to me to be essentially the same types of content.
[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:47.220]   But--
[00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.820]   I would not, if I'd already invested money in Roku,
[00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:51.540]   I would not invest more money in Fire TV.
[00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:53.580]   I mean, there are some differences.
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:56.260]   Fire TV is more serious about games.
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:58.020]   Only the high end Roku has games.
[00:47:58.020 --> 00:47:59.100]   Not very good games.
[00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:00.140]   Doesn't have very many.
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:01.460]   No, the games are bad.
[00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:02.980]   Games are pretty good on the Fire TV.
[00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:04.140]   We were playing asphalt.
[00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:05.180]   I mean, they're Android.
[00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:05.940]   It's Android.
[00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:07.300]   It's a nice controller.
[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.100]   Very much like playing a game on a smartphone.
[00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:11.100]   Roku has far more content overall.
[00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:13.220]   It has over 1,000 channels.
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:14.300]   Right.
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:18.100]   Actually, there's two weird gaps on the Fire TV.
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:20.020]   No HBO Go.
[00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:22.500]   And oddly enough, no Amazon Music.
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:25.140]   Although, that's-- Amazon Music is coming, I think,
[00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:26.220]   next month.
[00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:27.780]   It's their own service.
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:29.260]   And they have other music.
[00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:31.420]   They have a number of streaming music services.
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:32.260]   So strange.
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:33.820]   It must be that was--
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:35.820]   That's the way Amazon, when they have hardware,
[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:38.300]   they tend to release that missing two or three things
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:43.540]   you really want, but they come along pretty quickly thereafter.
[00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:45.940]   Yeah, you know, it's just a meat food product,
[00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.140]   except for that search thing, the voice search, which
[00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:48.780]   works pretty well.
[00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:50.740]   Although my Xbox One does something similar.
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:52.300]   Is there an API for the search?
[00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:53.500]   In other words, are they eventually
[00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:54.980]   going to open that up to other apps,
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:57.740]   or is it always going to be Amazon?
[00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:58.100]   Do you know?
[00:48:58.100 --> 00:48:59.580]   I'm not sure if they've said--
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:00.380]   Yeah.
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:01.100]   It's Android.
[00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:05.220]   In fact, Kosh was able to make his all cast, which
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:10.420]   is his Chromecast, all stuff to Chromecast app for Android,
[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:12.380]   work with the Fire TV almost immediately.
[00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:14.780]   He says, because it's kind of generic dial,
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:17.260]   it's a standard system DLNA in dial.
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:20.580]   So it is open in the sense that it's an Android--
[00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:23.460]   it's pretty much an Android device.
[00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:27.740]   Of course, you have to get on the Amazon store.
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:29.220]   It doesn't work with a Play Store.
[00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:31.540]   I mean, generally speaking, I think we have enough boxes
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:33.980]   at this type now, unless something comes out that
[00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:37.220]   is truly transcendent and radically better than Roku
[00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:39.980]   or Apple TV or Fire TV.
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:41.820]   There's not a lot of need for a new one,
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:45.220]   especially given that so many TVs have stuff built in,
[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:49.460]   the game consoles all have stuff built in.
[00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:51.980]   We don't need more things or are roughly comparable to what
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:53.460]   we already have anymore.
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:54.940]   You see, if you look at the controller,
[00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:58.820]   it looks just pretty much like a kind of a pancake Xbox
[00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:01.460]   controller, same exact buttons and everything.
[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:02.900]   That's 40 bucks.
[00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:06.340]   The Fire TV's $99.
[00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:07.580]   Yeah, you don't need it if you've already
[00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:08.780]   got a regular Apple TV.
[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:10.540]   Do you have no way to do this stuff already?
[00:50:10.540 --> 00:50:12.740]   And really, like Amazon, I think, actually,
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:14.780]   it has a pretty strong competitor?
[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:15.500]   I wonder--
[00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:18.620]   So with this and with Roku, which
[00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:21.340]   has a lot more content than Apple TV,
[00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:23.260]   is Apple kind of in trouble here?
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:28.020]   If they're expected update to Apple TV,
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:30.620]   doesn't really wow people?
[00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:33.620]   I figure Apple is betting the farm.
[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:37.020]   They're all in on the idea of making this deal with Comcast.
[00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:38.700]   They negotiated for years of Time Warner.
[00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:41.820]   Then they had to shift gears and go to Comcast.
[00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:47.180]   If they could get live TV on there,
[00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:48.460]   but I don't think Comcast is going
[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:50.340]   to make a deal with just one company.
[00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:53.900]   We had Peter Kafka on our coverage of the Amazon announcement.
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:55.740]   He said that.
[00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:58.220]   Everybody's learned their lesson from the music industry's
[00:50:58.220 --> 00:50:59.380]   experience with Apple.
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:01.580]   You give Apple too much power and you're in trouble.
[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:04.620]   So if anything, if Comcast ever makes a deal,
[00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:05.660]   it'll be with all of them.
[00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:07.820]   And I think maybe that's why Amazon did this, just so
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:10.700]   that they at least be in the hunt.
[00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.780]   But that would be--
[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:16.180]   you want the perfect cord cutter device.
[00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:18.140]   Well, and I have both.
[00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:20.540]   I have Apple TV and I have Roku.
[00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:24.620]   Shouldn't be getting a Fire TV shortly.
[00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:27.340]   And what's interesting is I find myself these days using
[00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:29.660]   the Roku more than the Apple TV, mainly
[00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:32.100]   because we have Ariel here.
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:33.940]   And I watch--
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:35.620]   I'm in the place I moved to actually
[00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:40.060]   has a very bad signal for HDTV over the air.
[00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:41.540]   And so I use Ariel.
[00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:44.420]   And Ariel is only on the Roku.
[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:49.100]   And it works quite well over a very fast connection.
[00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:51.980]   And to me at the moment, it looks like the Roku 3
[00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:54.900]   is probably the ultimate cord cutter device.
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:58.580]   So I'd be very curious to see if Amazon comes up with something
[00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:04.580]   like an Ariel app, particularly if Ariel wins its April 2nd.
[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:05.060]   That's right.
[00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:05.580]   That's right.
[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:06.060]   It's a Supreme Court.
[00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:07.380]   We're all on hold, right?
[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:09.460]   Everybody's on hold, including Ariel,
[00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:10.860]   because the Supreme Court has agreed
[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:15.300]   to review the lawsuit, the networks saying Ariel's stealing
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:16.740]   their copyrighted content.
[00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:19.900]   Ariel's saying, hey, you just written an antenna.
[00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:22.060]   That's just-- I mean, that's all.
[00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:24.980]   So Ariel has a Houston facility.
[00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:28.700]   And I got a tour of it about a week and a half ago.
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:31.580]   Chet Kenogia came down, and I got to interview him
[00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:32.780]   and got to see the--
[00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:34.700]   and it is incredibly efficient.
[00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:40.500]   It's two cabinets on the roof of a data center.
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:42.940]   There are a series of circuit boards
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.980]   with these little antennas inside the cabinets
[00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:48.540]   and a fiber connection that takes it down
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:53.540]   to about three or four servers in the data center down below
[00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:54.700]   and then out to the internet.
[00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:57.940]   And it is-- they can expand it quickly and easily.
[00:52:57.940 --> 00:53:00.220]   There's no Houston employees.
[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:01.660]   Everything is been remotely.
[00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:02.100]   Wow.
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:04.020]   And they're already profitable here
[00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:06.420]   and in most of the cities that they're in.
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:09.380]   They did have to shut down in Denver and Salt Lake
[00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:15.500]   because they lost a court case in that district.
[00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:18.340]   They've won two out of the three court battles
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:19.820]   that they have faced.
[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.660]   What are the odds on the Supreme Court's decision?
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:23.660]   What do you think?
[00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:25.940]   I mean, remember the Supreme Court
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:29.460]   decided on the lawsuit by the Motion Picture Association
[00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:32.980]   of America to try to stop video recorders.
[00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:36.740]   And the Supreme Court in the '84 ruled
[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:39.620]   that you could record for personal use.
[00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:41.380]   It wasn't a violation of copyright law
[00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:43.900]   and created an industry which I might point out
[00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:46.660]   the Motion Picture industry immediately benefited
[00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:49.100]   to the tune of billions of dollars.
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:55.900]   So I think at least-- and there's some history
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:58.260]   of the Supreme Court supporting new technologies like this.
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:53:59.500]   It was a long time ago.
[00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:01.780]   That was 1984.
[00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:04.940]   But you can bet that the defendants in the case
[00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:08.340]   will bring up that groundbreaking--
[00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:09.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:11.060]   But the other thing is, is there's--
[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:13.620]   one of the interesting side effects on this
[00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:17.100]   is that there was a 2008 case involving cable vision
[00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:18.980]   and cloud DVRs.
[00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:19.500]   Right.
[00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:21.340]   Which never went to the Supreme Court.
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:23.660]   That never went to the court.
[00:54:23.660 --> 00:54:25.900]   The current case law is such that it allows it.
[00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:27.740]   And that's why you have--
[00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:30.500]   and essentially what Ariel was doing
[00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:34.420]   is they're grafting the concept of outsourcing
[00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:37.860]   an antenna to a cloud DVR, which they say is legal.
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:41.220]   And so is putting those two together legal?
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:42.740]   They're both copyright issues.
[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:46.060]   And there are-- there's the issue of the carriage fees.
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:49.460]   And whether they should be paying carriage fees on that.
[00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:53.420]   But it's such a complex thing.
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:55.540]   Both sides try to paint it as black and white.
[00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:57.620]   But it's actually a really complex issue.
[00:54:57.620 --> 00:55:00.860]   And I could see the Supreme Court going either way on this.
[00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:02.460]   Ariel is doing us a favor, though.
[00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:06.500]   I mean, it's doing everybody a favor just by forcing the issue.
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:07.020]   Right.
[00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:07.780]   It's making everybody think.
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:11.660]   And before too long, we will know one way or the other.
[00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:12.180]   Really?
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:17.340]   So the oral arguments are April 22nd, a week from Tuesday.
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:19.420]   And by the way, you can hear those, which is great.
[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:20.700]   I don't know if you can hear them live,
[00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:23.140]   but you can hear them after the fact, like within a day.
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:25.820]   So I'm sure it'll be very interesting
[00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:28.060]   to listen to that.
[00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:32.420]   ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox, and others
[00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:35.220]   are all trying to get the court to say,
[00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:37.780]   you can't-- Ariel is a violation of copyright.
[00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:45.860]   It's Ariel, which was started by Barry Diller.
[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:48.700]   It's obvious it's a trick.
[00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:50.700]   I mean, everybody looking at it-- oh, that was clever.
[00:55:50.700 --> 00:55:52.540]   It's a clever trick.
[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:53.020]   Oh, no.
[00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:54.660]   Technology is like a certain flavor.
[00:55:54.660 --> 00:55:56.380]   Well, you're just renting in antenna.
[00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:57.820]   It's the fact that they're dime-shaped.
[00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:01.540]   And there's hundreds of them in a rack that's up in the Houston
[00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:02.420]   with no employees.
[00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:03.980]   But it's an antenna.
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:06.620]   And you're renting that particular antenna.
[00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:09.380]   And the fact that you're dev-- we're dev-y-rring it for you.
[00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:11.820]   That's on your behalf.
[00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:14.540]   But everybody knows it's kind of a wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:16.220]   See, isn't that clever?
[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:21.020]   Yeah, the dissent in the Boston case,
[00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:22.900]   the judge called it a contrivance.
[00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:23.500]   Yes.
[00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:24.740]   And that's what it is.
[00:56:24.740 --> 00:56:28.540]   But again, I think that all technologies like this,
[00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:30.380]   where they kind of--
[00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:33.940]   where they graph two things together, is a contrivance.
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:37.860]   And then it becomes-- if it becomes legal,
[00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:38.860]   it's not a contrivance.
[00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:41.100]   It's an innovation.
[00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:45.340]   And the reason now that these networks-- and it's ABC TV
[00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:47.300]   is the plaintiff in that--
[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:50.980]   the reason that these networks don't want it--
[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:53.220]   it's also a contrivance in a way.
[00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:55.780]   Because the networks have been offering free over the air
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:58.460]   television for as long as there's been television.
[00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:00.180]   And they support it with ads.
[00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:02.980]   And those ads in the free over the air television
[00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:06.420]   is just being sucked in the dime-sized thing
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:08.420]   and sent out to my iPad.
[00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:09.660]   So I'm still seeing all the ads.
[00:57:09.660 --> 00:57:12.900]   It's no different than if I literally were in Houston
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:14.380]   and I had an antenna.
[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:16.420]   But what they don't like about it is they
[00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:19.300]   have very lucrative retransmission agreements
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:21.460]   with the cable companies.
[00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:24.660]   And so in a way, I think you could also
[00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:26.140]   look at that as a contrivance.
[00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:29.340]   As in a way, the television networks
[00:57:29.340 --> 00:57:32.140]   have figured a way to make more money
[00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:34.460]   for the product they've been offering for free.
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:37.180]   And they don't want to do it for free anymore.
[00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:40.620]   There was a law that essentially created
[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:43.420]   the transmission fee system where it
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:49.220]   made the capture of the over the air local broadcasts
[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:54.460]   legal by the carriers of the cable companies.
[00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:56.020]   And they said, OK, you can do this,
[00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:58.260]   but you have to pay them for it.
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:00.700]   And they designated them as a certain type of business.
[00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:02.660]   And so that's why they have to do it.
[00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:05.180]   One of the arguments that is made by broadcasters
[00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:07.980]   is that if Ariel succeeds with this,
[00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:11.820]   then what is to keep Comcast and cable vision and so forth
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:13.140]   from saying, oh, we don't have to pay it.
[00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:14.340]   We'll just set up antennas.
[00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:16.340]   Well, there's a law that says you have to pay
[00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:18.260]   if you're this type of carrier.
[00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:20.260]   Ariel is essentially because it's over the internet
[00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:21.500]   is not that type of carrier.
[00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:24.100]   That's how-- what could happen is the law could be changed.
[00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:26.420]   That's how cable started.
[00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:27.860]   I remember in the early days of cable,
[00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:29.740]   you and I are old enough to remember that.
[00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:32.300]   It was they put an antenna up downtown,
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:34.700]   and then they had a long wire.
[00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:37.340]   They went to Petaluma from that antenna down down
[00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:40.540]   so I could watch TV as if I had an antenna downtown.
[00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:41.060]   Yeah.
[00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:42.500]   That's all it was.
[00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:46.180]   And that still exists in some communities.
[00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:49.020]   I forget the exact name of it, but it's
[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:53.140]   in places where you simply can't get a signal, companies.
[00:58:53.140 --> 00:58:55.820]   And I believe it may actually be nonprofits
[00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:59.180]   are allowed to set up antennas and then beam them back
[00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:02.940]   into those homes in those cases where they can't get
[00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:04.260]   a signal at all.
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:06.980]   Is Ariel out of business if they lose?
[00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:09.180]   They have said yes.
[00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:11.860]   Chek Kenojie has told me that there's no plan B.
[00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:14.340]   He says he's not thinking about plan B.
[00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:15.980]   Said, well, you're thinking about plan B.
[00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:18.180]   You're not thinking about plan A. And that's what he's--
[00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:18.700]   Wow.
[00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:20.700]   --that's his approach to it.
[00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:21.740]   It's really interesting to see--
[00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:23.260]   It's a very good way of saying--
[00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:25.180]   It'll be interesting to see if any of the networks who
[00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:27.860]   say that if Ariel does win, that they'll
[00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:30.060]   take their network off the air and go people only.
[00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:32.020]   If any of them will actually go through with that
[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:33.900]   or whether that's just posturing.
[00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:34.820]   Yeah.
[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:36.460]   Fox says we're going to take down FX.
[00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:39.100]   You're not going to be able to watch it over broadcast.
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:43.940]   There has been a lot of posturing on that.
[00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:46.620]   And a lot of the people I talked to, a lot of the analysts
[00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:49.220]   I talked to for the story, said that this is something
[00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:52.500]   that the broadcast networks have wanted for a long time
[00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:54.780]   is to take their stuff behind the pick.
[00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:57.460]   And that this is something of an excuse for that.
[00:59:57.460 --> 00:59:59.860]   However, if you have a broadcast license,
[00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:02.700]   there are certain expectations by the public.
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:05.460]   And if they try to take that off, I guarantee you,
[01:00:05.460 --> 01:00:07.820]   Congress is not going to be happy about it.
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:12.140]   Well, Congress had hearings this week on Comcast's bid
[01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:13.220]   to merge with Time Warner.
[01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.300]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:17.580]   Dwight Silverman is here from the Houston Chronicle.
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:20.060]   Blog.cron.com/techblog.
[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:26.460]   And your fabulous Pacifica radio show called Technology Bites.
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:28.340]   Oh, Leo, I'm not doing that one either.
[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:29.500]   What?
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:30.140]   Yeah.
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:31.660]   I skipped doing that in January.
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:35.980]   It's the end of the world as we know it.
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:39.220]   I decided that I've done that for 10 years.
[01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:41.500]   And it's a whole new Dwight Silverman.
[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:42.220]   Yes.
[01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:42.620]   Yes.
[01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:44.980]   Wider and Breezy-er.
[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:46.420]   All new, Breezy, Lighty.
[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:49.340]   Well, it's a lot easier for me not to have to plug with.
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:50.780]   One more thing, I don't have to plug.
[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:51.900]   I don't mind.
[01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:53.420]   Well, Technology Bites is still in the air.
[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:54.700]   It's still a great show.
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:59.540]   I actually will be a guest host when they're down a man or two.
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:00.780]   And so I'll be on it.
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:01.460]   But I know--
[01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:02.460]   I mean, let's be honest.
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:04.140]   They have 34 hosts.
[01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:07.100]   They don't really need you, Dwight.
[01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:08.100]   That is the most--
[01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:10.300]   there are more hosts on that show.
[01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:11.980]   It's five, and now it is four.
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.700]   Feels like more than five.
[01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:14.580]   It's like Ham Nation.
[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:16.020]   We have the Ham Show.
[01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:18.180]   I think how many hosts are on Ham Nation now?
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:19.420]   There's like 20.
[01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:22.220]   It's bigger and bigger and bigger.
[01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:23.940]   And the problem with Ham, how many?
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:25.180]   Eight?
[01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:26.580]   Eight?
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:31.180]   The problem with Ham's is nobody stops talking.
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:35.140]   They're trained talkers.
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:36.500]   Like me.
[01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:39.500]   Harry M. McCracken also here at the Technologizer.
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:40.940]   He's so good to have Harry.
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:45.180]   At Time Magazine, you've been doing so many great stories.
[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:46.620]   Everybody should read, and we talked about it
[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:49.780]   a couple of weeks ago, the 10th anniversary of a Gmail story.
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:52.460]   You really dug deep, talked to Paul Buhite,
[01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:53.940]   and really got the inside story.
[01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:56.500]   It was such a surprise, all the details.
[01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.340]   I learn an awful lot during that.
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:01:59.780]   Sometimes I do a story like that,
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:01.260]   and I just sort of have to write down what I know,
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:03.260]   and that one I knew almost nothing until I started.
[01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:04.220]   Well, nobody knew anything.
[01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:05.380]   In fact, many of the things you said,
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:08.820]   the fact that Google was, for instance, so ambivalent
[01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:09.700]   about the whole thing.
[01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:11.780]   They never-- they were a search engine.
[01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:12.940]   They were a search engine.
[01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:16.100]   That was at the time when all the things that used to do
[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:19.380]   only search started branching out and becoming portals.
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:21.380]   And people loved Google because it did not
[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:22.380]   want to be a portal.
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:22.980]   Right.
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:23.340]   Right.
[01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:25.700]   Gmail was the start of the Google portal era.
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:28.460]   Right.
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:30.820]   You go to techland.time.com is that the best?
[01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:31.660]   You can do that.
[01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:34.460]   You can just go to time.com and click on the tech section.
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:38.660]   But techland.com, actually, is the quickest way to do it.
[01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:39.940]   I love it.
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:42.380]   Oh, now you're interviewing Sid Meier civilization
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:43.980]   beyond Earth.
[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:44.780]   Wow.
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:46.020]   Yeah, my colleague, man.
[01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:46.700]   Wow.
[01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:47.900]   I didn't know Sid was doing a new--
[01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:48.420]   That looks so cool.
[01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:50.380]   A new sieve.
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:52.460]   Wow.
[01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:53.940]   You know, I keep buying sieve--
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:56.380]   I've bought sieve 3, sieve 4, sieve 5.
[01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:59.420]   I keep buying it, thinking I'm going to like this game.
[01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:01.420]   And I just-- I can-- I try.
[01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:03.940]   I really do because everybody loves it.
[01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:05.260]   But it's turn based.
[01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:10.060]   You know, you do a lot of stuff and then you go, OK, now your turn.
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:10.900]   I should like that.
[01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:11.620]   I play chess.
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:13.980]   That's turn based.
[01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:15.380]   Are you a sieve player?
[01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:16.740]   I have not been.
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:18.580]   I have not been.
[01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:20.140]   I just don't understand it.
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:21.620]   I admire Sid, but yeah, I can't--
[01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:25.660]   I love Sid because he's creating a universe in a game.
[01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:27.300]   Maybe I'll like this one.
[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:29.060]   You're in space now, right?
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:35.220]   All right.
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:36.500]   Let's continue.
[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:43.100]   By the way, $5 billion for Tinder, IAC says it ain't true.
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:45.020]   $5 billion.
[01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:49.620]   So you can meet your true love on your phone.
[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:57.420]   So moving on.
[01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:02.820]   We'll talk about the hearings and Comcast's very weak
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:06.340]   justification for why they should be by time-winner.
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:07.140]   It's good for you.
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:08.780]   Just take our word for it.
[01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:10.860]   But first, a word from our friends at stamps.com.
[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:12.020]   This really is good for you if you're
[01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:14.260]   spending any time in the post office at all.
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:16.620]   You know, it's just a time sink.
[01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:18.020]   The post office is always crowded.
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:22.580]   And now, April 15, it's going to be nuts.
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:25.540]   But if you're in a business that requires mailing,
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:27.820]   if it's just invoices or brochures, or maybe you mail
[01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:30.380]   packages, are you a seller on Etsy or eBay,
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:32.860]   then you know the last thing you want to do
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:34.300]   is go to the post office right about now.
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:36.060]   You should be using stamps.com.
[01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:38.140]   This is an opportunity for you to try it.
[01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:41.340]   Stamps.com, it brings all the services of the post office
[01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:43.780]   right to your desk.
[01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:49.500]   If you visit stamps.com right now, we can get you set up.
[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:52.660]   You can buy and print US postage for any letter, any package,
[01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:54.180]   using your computer, your printer.
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:57.460]   You do not need a postage meter or a special ink.
[01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:59.020]   The mailman comes every day, right?
[01:04:59.020 --> 01:04:59.900]   So he picks it up.
[01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:01.940]   But you can even-- there's a button on stamps.com.
[01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:04.620]   You press that button and a mail carrier will come.
[01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:06.860]   Immediately come and pick up the package.
[01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:09.140]   Stamps.com will even send you a free digital scale
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:10.780]   so you always have the postage you need.
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:13.180]   Oh, you know, I should have saved that envelope.
[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:14.940]   So somebody this week sent me something
[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:18.620]   to try like these bungee cords or something.
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:22.140]   And it arrived, postage to do $0.85.
[01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:24.020]   Do you ever get stuff for review that comes postage to do?
[01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:27.900]   It's like, this is not a good way to introduce yourself
[01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:28.980]   to the world.
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:30.980]   Hey, try our new product.
[01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:33.780]   It only costs you $0.85 in postage.
[01:05:33.780 --> 01:05:35.940]   If they had stamps.com, they would have
[01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:37.300]   plopped it on the scale.
[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:38.900]   They would have had exactly the right postage.
[01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.300]   It looks more professional.
[01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:42.700]   It's got the mailing label with your logo.
[01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:44.980]   It automatically fills in the return address.
[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:47.980]   And if you're sending it priority or certified mail,
[01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:49.900]   it'll automatically send an email to the recipient
[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:51.380]   saying it's on its way.
[01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:53.540]   It's just more professional.
[01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:55.700]   Stamps.com, you also get discounts.
[01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:56.260]   You save money.
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:59.940]   Discounts you cannot get at the post office.
[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:01.700]   I mean, why wouldn't you use stamps.com?
[01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:03.700]   Go to stamps.com right now.
[01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:06.780]   Click the microphone in the upper right hand corner.
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:09.180]   Enter our offer code TWIT and you're
[01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:11.900]   going to get a $110 bonus offer.

[01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:16.140]   You get the scale.
[01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:18.700]   You get a supply kit in a four week trial, of course,
[01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:20.500]   of stamps.com.
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:23.780]   If you've been looking for a reason to try stamps.com,
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:25.420]   April 15 is good enough.
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:28.540]   Stamps.com, please use our offer code TWIT
[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:33.740]   to get a special improved offer.
[01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:36.540]   So I watched a little C-SPAN this week,
[01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:42.740]   watching the testimony Comcast in Congress,
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:46.220]   explaining why they should become the largest broadband
[01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:49.420]   provider in the United States, the largest cable company
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:52.620]   in the United States, by taking over Time Warner.
[01:06:52.620 --> 01:07:00.420]   Do you think that Congress was moved by the testimony?
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:04.980]   Either one of you watching any of this?
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:10.980]   Well, in the wake of the failed AT&T T-Mobile merger,
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:17.780]   I think regulators may be more emboldened to just say no.
[01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:20.300]   That was fairly rare until that.
[01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:24.100]   And however, the argument that they don't compete
[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:28.540]   in the same space may make it harder for them.
[01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:31.700]   Houston is an interesting case because we're
[01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:34.780]   one of the few markets that had Time Warner
[01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:36.820]   and then it switched to Comcast.
[01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:39.420]   They traded territories.
[01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:40.980]   And so I've seen both of them.
[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:44.380]   It started out here as Time Warner and Roadrunner
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:47.100]   for broadband and then became Comcast.
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:49.020]   And there's two different eras.
[01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:53.460]   And on one level, Comcast is much better than Time Warner,
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:57.580]   at least again from the era that I saw Time Warner.
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:01.660]   But on another one, it's just Meet the new boss,
[01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:02.860]   same as the old boss.
[01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:05.300]   Brian Roberts, the CEO of Comcast, says,
[01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:07.460]   we want to be like Apple.
[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.660]   And we want to invest money in R&D.
[01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:11.100]   And we want to be innovative.
[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:13.980]   And meanwhile, according to Consumerist, Comcast
[01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:17.260]   is now the worst company in America.
[01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:20.060]   Consumerist has an annual competition that's only the second
[01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:22.140]   company to take this title twice.
[01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:25.140]   Comcast defeated Monsanto.
[01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:26.900]   I guess they do it like in brackets.
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:28.980]   I don't know where you go head to head.
[01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:31.020]   And then you advance.
[01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:34.460]   And in the Consumerist annual poll to find America's worst
[01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:39.340]   company, Comcast has emerged bloody and victorious.
[01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:43.140]   Send that to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:48.180]   Comcast says, even though we turned a profit of $6.8 billion
[01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:52.740]   last year, even though Time Warner earned $2 billion
[01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:53.500]   last year--
[01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:55.740]   so they're pretty successful companies--
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:59.580]   they want to get together so that they can spend money
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:03.060]   on research and development to make themselves a better
[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:04.860]   company.
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:06.700]   They don't do any R&D now.
[01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:09.740]   Very little.
[01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:12.980]   Neither company-- this is according to the LA Times--
[01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:14.980]   neither company has spent enough on R&D
[01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:19.420]   to even disclose its figure in the annual report.
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:22.020]   So why Comcast will suddenly do R&D
[01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:26.100]   because they merge with Time Warner is beyond me?
[01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:28.180]   An Apple doesn't spend all that much in R&D
[01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:29.780]   anyhow compared to a lot of other companies.
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:30.860]   Yeah, isn't that interesting?
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:33.140]   Yeah.
[01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:34.700]   You'd think they spent a lot more,
[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:36.940]   but I guess they get a lot of money.
[01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:38.300]   I mean, in late.
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:39.340]   AT&T does.
[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:41.460]   I know that AT&T does a lot of R&D.
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:44.540]   So perhaps you can look at it competitively that way.
[01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:47.340]   Does Time Warner own any broadcast licenses?
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:48.820]   Ah, that's an interesting question.
[01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:51.140]   Comcast owns NBC.
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:53.060]   And if I were a regulator looking at that,
[01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:55.420]   I would almost be tempted to say, you know what?
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:58.180]   We might consider this if you divest in DC.
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:02.740]   I would expect-- and this is fairly typical in these things--
[01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:05.580]   something like that, where we don't
[01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:09.140]   want you to control all media everywhere in every form.
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:11.460]   So maybe you could just get some of that stuff off
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:13.220]   of your table.
[01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:16.380]   Yeah, not just NBC, NBC, NBC, and Universal.
[01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:19.660]   They make TV, they distribute TV, they do it all.
[01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:26.540]   Comcast and Time Warner say, we're locked in a do-or-die
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:30.020]   competitive fight with Google, Apple, Amazon, and Netflix.
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:30.700]   That may be true.
[01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:33.700]   I mean, we're seeing these companies come up and start
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:39.020]   to Netflix, has done a very good job of offering content.
[01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:42.020]   And certainly, they distribute films as well or better
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:43.980]   than Comcast does.
[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:49.700]   But Comcast has its fingers in all of that, too,
[01:10:49.700 --> 01:10:52.220]   because those are the pipes that all of those companies
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:52.720]   use.
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:54.540]   That's right.
[01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:57.780]   I really sincerely hope that the merger is not approved,
[01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:00.620]   but one does not know.
[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:01.820]   I'm ready to against it, too.
[01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:02.820]   Yeah.
[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:04.580]   $40 billion merger.
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:11.420]   It would not help in competition, it would in innovation.
[01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:13.900]   There's just not a lot of evidence that companies like that
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:17.220]   getting huge and monopolistic improves the situation
[01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:17.900]   for consumers.
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:19.580]   It tends to hurt it.
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:21.940]   The worst company in America-- congratulations,
[01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:23.780]   Comcast, on your victory.
[01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:26.020]   I mean, this is why AT&T was broken up in the first place
[01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:27.820]   30 years ago.
[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:30.580]   And by the way, AT&T, you're back.
[01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:31.940]   They're back, but they're back.
[01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:35.020]   But I think it pretty clearly did benefit consumers
[01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:38.180]   that we had many phone companies rather than one enormous one.
[01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:41.220]   And I don't want one enormous cable company.
[01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:43.900]   Or one enormous internet provider.
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:44.500]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:47.940]   Cable, TV, and internet service.
[01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:51.460]   I love-- actually, I love how the consumerist does this.
[01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:52.820]   And I think it's somewhat just for fun.
[01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:54.660]   But they do have a bracket.
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:59.100]   So AT&T faced Microsoft AT&T, one for worst company.
[01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:02.580]   Verizon faced eBay and Verizon won for worst company.
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:07.140]   Then Verizon faced AT&T and Verizon won.
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:10.620]   Then Verizon faced Comcast and Comcast won.
[01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:12.020]   So you have to work your way up.
[01:12:12.020 --> 01:12:15.780]   It's much like March Madness.
[01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:18.180]   EA, which has for a long time, I think, been considered
[01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:19.780]   one of the worst companies in America,
[01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:22.740]   lost immediately, kind of an upset victory
[01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:25.980]   for Time Warner Cable, which is whoop-de-a right out
[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:26.700]   of the box.
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:34.020]   Then Time Warner Cable faced cock industries, coke industries,
[01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:36.820]   and beat them, beat the cock brothers.
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:39.740]   So there you go.
[01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:45.460]   And then finally Monsanto beat Time Warner Cable.
[01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:47.380]   It's just-- it's really exciting.
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:48.340]   I think we should have--
[01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:49.780]   next year, let's have some brackets.
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:51.980]   We can have the-- we can really have some fun.
[01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:54.700]   We have our little-- our pool.
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:58.100]   Sea World was in there, by the way.
[01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:01.700]   Sea World beat Johnson and Johnson and Ticketmaster.
[01:13:01.700 --> 01:13:06.180]   So it was crappy installers.
[01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:08.140]   And Chase.
[01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:13.420]   Sea World almost-- it got to the final four.
[01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:15.660]   I think Sea World-- that's got to be
[01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:17.820]   because of the documentary Blackfish, right,
[01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:21.900]   and the handling of the killer whales and all of that.
[01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:24.140]   Wow.
[01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:26.500]   Sea World faced Comcast and finally met their match.
[01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:29.780]   It's pretty hard to be Comcast in this game.
[01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:31.020]   Those guys are tough.
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:35.860]   Long time competitors for worst company in America.
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:37.420]   Facebook immediately got, by the way,
[01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:41.660]   was eliminated in the first round.
[01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:44.980]   Surprisingly.
[01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:46.700]   Anything to say about Facebook this week?
[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:47.220]   Not really.
[01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:49.140]   They were kind of quiet.
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:52.500]   They had to digest after swallowing that large--
[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:55.700]   What is the story about the removing chat from there?
[01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:56.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:57.060]   Their main--
[01:13:57.060 --> 01:13:58.140]   No, I keep-- so what are they doing?
[01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:01.460]   Because I keep getting this message on my Facebook saying,
[01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:04.260]   download chat, download chat, download chat.
[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:07.220]   Are they-- because chat-- I never did download chat,
[01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:08.740]   because it's in the Facebook.
[01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:10.700]   They're going to take it out of the apps.
[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:12.380]   I mean, already, if you have it installed,
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:14.020]   they're going to jump back and forth.
[01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:15.460]   And they will force that decision for you
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:17.180]   by taking it out of the app?
[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:19.460]   Yeah, I don't have-- I don't have a messenger installed.
[01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:22.860]   And I very seldom use chat on the phone app.
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:25.420]   But yeah, I've been seeing that message.
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:28.300]   And that's going to, I think, irritate a lot of people.
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:32.660]   I think that's not a smart move on the airport.
[01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:34.340]   And I'm not sure why they would do that.
[01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:35.900]   Well, they have the strategy of thinking
[01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:38.940]   that you should have different apps for different purposes.
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:42.820]   So you have Facebook and you have Instagram
[01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:44.100]   and you have Messenger.
[01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:45.100]   And you have WhatsApp.
[01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:45.940]   Is that the wrong direction?
[01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:47.620]   Do you want to consolidate all that?
[01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:48.740]   I mean, I think their argument is
[01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:51.380]   that it's easier to do a great chat experience
[01:14:51.380 --> 01:14:52.700]   if that's all an app is doing.
[01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:55.260]   I find it disjointed because I'm in Facebook.
[01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:59.300]   And it boots me out of Facebook into Messenger.
[01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:01.380]   It feels like they're trying to turn Facebook itself
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:03.820]   into a news app, which is ironic.
[01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:04.540]   Like Twitter--
[01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:05.540]   Right, the paper and--
[01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:06.100]   Right.
[01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:08.580]   And then Twitter is trying to turn into Facebook.
[01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:10.620]   Dropbox is also following this,
[01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:12.620]   because Dropbox just announced Carousel.
[01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:14.300]   If you're doing photos in your Dropbox,
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:16.780]   I think you should be using a standalone photos app.
[01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:18.660]   Rather than doing it within Dropbox.
[01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:20.300]   Same business idea.
[01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:23.220]   And they own mailbox, which is a standalone email client.
[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:25.700]   So is anyone still using that?
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:27.900]   It was called Paper, the app that--
[01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:28.820]   I like Paper.
[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:29.300]   I like Paper.
[01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:32.100]   I like it pretty easy.
[01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:33.980]   I found it hard to find the thing--
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:37.020]   to stay up with the things I wanted to stay up with.
[01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:42.020]   It looked like the pretty overtook, the stuff
[01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:43.100]   I actually wanted to see.
[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:43.980]   And I quit using it.
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:44.460]   It's still there.
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:45.780]   And every time that I open it--
[01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:47.020]   What is it you wanted to see?
[01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:50.340]   Because Facebook thinks what you want is news.
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:52.180]   But I've always thought people join Facebook
[01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:53.660]   and want to see their friends-- because they want
[01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:54.860]   to see their friends and family.
[01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:55.580]   I like groups.
[01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:57.180]   Groups are really hidden in paper.
[01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:57.900]   You use groups?
[01:15:57.900 --> 01:15:59.060]   Yes, all the time.
[01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:02.180]   And they are hard to find in paper, which I like even despite
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:02.820]   that.
[01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:03.260]   Yeah.
[01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:04.660]   What are you looking for that you don't--
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:07.300]   I'm looking for what my friends are doing.
[01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:10.100]   And what they think is interesting.
[01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:12.820]   I run our Facebook page.
[01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:17.180]   And so I want our readers to find our news through there.
[01:16:17.180 --> 01:16:19.860]   But my personal use of Facebook is not that-- there
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:24.060]   was a Pew study a couple of weeks ago about the way people
[01:16:24.060 --> 01:16:25.340]   use social media.
[01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:29.300]   And that most people don't use Facebook looking for news.
[01:16:29.300 --> 01:16:32.540]   But if it comes to them, they're interested.
[01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:34.780]   They see Facebook as a way to keep up with their friends
[01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:37.340]   and family, not necessarily a way to keep up with the news.
[01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:40.260]   Twitter, on the other hand, has more of the--
[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:41.300]   It's a news feed.
[01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:42.260]   It's a news feed.
[01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:42.460]   Right.
[01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:44.820]   It's everybody's personal AP wires.
[01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:47.820]   And in fact, we just saw a study in which Twitter denies,
[01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:53.940]   but a study that 44% of Twitter accounts have never tweeted.
[01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:57.780]   So people join Twitter to read, not to post, which
[01:16:57.780 --> 01:16:59.660]   surprises me a little bit.
[01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:02.340]   They read it to keep up with the-- that's how my wife uses it.
[01:17:02.340 --> 01:17:03.180]   She--
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:03.700]   Right.
[01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:06.100]   --first thing she does in the morning, she reaches over and grabs
[01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:08.020]   her phone and starts reading Twitter.
[01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:11.180]   It drives me crazy because one of the joys about being
[01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:13.660]   in the news business is you get to know everything first,
[01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:16.060]   but I can't tell her anything anymore.
[01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:16.940]   She knows it all.
[01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:17.820]   Right.
[01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:18.420]   That's good.
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:19.460]   That's what she wants.
[01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:22.180]   That's what you want.
[01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:24.420]   Yeah, so this new algorithm-- Facebook
[01:17:24.420 --> 01:17:25.740]   seems to want to do-- I don't know.
[01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:26.940]   They're up to something.
[01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:29.180]   What is their evil plan?
[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:31.220]   They make money from showing you ads, right?
[01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:33.900]   So everything is around making it a product
[01:17:33.900 --> 01:17:36.380]   that you will want to look at more.
[01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:40.220]   The more you spend on using Facebook,
[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:41.020]   the more money they make.
[01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:41.500]   Is that right?
[01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:43.020]   Is that what they care about?
[01:17:43.020 --> 01:17:46.140]   So does it mean that they want to sell different kinds of ads
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:51.020]   in chat versus a regular app that it essentially gives them
[01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:53.380]   another avenue to sell to advertiser?
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:56.380]   They can do it in chat, and it may be a different kind of ad
[01:17:56.380 --> 01:17:59.660]   and may have different kind of results from being in chat
[01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:00.580]   versus the main app.
[01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:01.300]   That would make sense.
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:03.300]   I think in some instances it's totally logical.
[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:05.100]   With Instagram, I would not want--
[01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:06.060]   No, please don't mix the two.
[01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:07.740]   I don't want Instagram to be part of Facebook.
[01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:09.420]   It makes sense for it to be standalone.
[01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:11.900]   I think the difference is that right now,
[01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:13.380]   if you're on Facebook Messenger, it's
[01:18:13.380 --> 01:18:15.700]   because you want to talk to your Facebook friends,
[01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:18.820]   and it's not a separate thing from reading their updates
[01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:21.180]   and so forth.
[01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:22.940]   And that's why you get into this loop where you're
[01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:25.020]   jumping back and forth between them, which does not
[01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:25.940]   happen with Instagram.
[01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:27.500]   Instagram, you're probably--
[01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:28.460]   I just want to see pictures.
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:30.300]   You're looking at other people's photos,
[01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:32.660]   and it's not the same group.
[01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:33.740]   That does make sense.
[01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:39.460]   Somebody in the chatroom said that the Unix tools model,
[01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:42.340]   where you want to do small tools that do things well.
[01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:44.860]   But on Unix, you can chain them together
[01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:48.100]   to make a bigger thing that does different things.
[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:50.380]   There's no piping yet in Facebook apps.
[01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:51.860]   Facebook does have this challenge
[01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:55.780]   that it does so many things.
[01:18:55.780 --> 01:18:56.260]   It's a lot.
[01:18:56.260 --> 01:18:57.980]   There's a real danger for it to be unbloated.
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:00.220]   And you won't be able to find stuff, which
[01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:01.380]   is already an issue.
[01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:02.940]   There are all kinds of things you can do on Facebook.
[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:07.220]   I don't know about, simply because there are three menus down.
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:10.380]   The irony, though, is that they don't have a great track
[01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:14.060]   record of it, of introducing new apps that take off.
[01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:15.460]   Pope is a flop.
[01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:17.340]   The Facebook home was a flop.
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:19.820]   I think it sounds like paper might well be a flop.
[01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:21.780]   And paper is gorgeous.
[01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:23.980]   They did everything right with paper.
[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:26.020]   But people just want the Facebook experience.
[01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:28.180]   It's the Windows XP effect.
[01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:31.140]   You people understand Facebook in its original form,
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:32.700]   and they don't necessarily want to give it up,
[01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:35.180]   even for something that is theoretically better.
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:38.460]   I think part of it may also have to do with just the overall form
[01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:41.940]   factor and the design of smartphones,
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:43.940]   the way they interact with the operating system.
[01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:46.260]   In iOS, when you switch to an app,
[01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:49.180]   there's a visual swapping of the apps.
[01:19:49.180 --> 01:19:51.500]   And that's jarring, saving in Android.
[01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:52.500]   It's less so.
[01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:55.740]   But if you chained it so that you didn't realize
[01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:58.580]   you were leaving the messenger app to go look at something
[01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:00.620]   that someone linked to you in a Facebook page,
[01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:03.580]   and then when you went back to the messenger app,
[01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:04.820]   it seemed seamless.
[01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:06.980]   That might make more sense,
[01:20:06.980 --> 01:20:09.980]   but the way smartphone interfaces work,
[01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:13.620]   it just kind of makes you blink and you don't like it.
[01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:16.420]   It strikes me there's a risk in separating messenger out.
[01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:18.340]   The people just won't use it.
[01:20:18.340 --> 01:20:20.380]   It'll be just like taking a chunk out of Facebook
[01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:22.220]   and throwing it away.
[01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:23.900]   I'm not going to download messenger.
[01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:25.820]   Particularly if you don't write, if you don't download it.
[01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:27.060]   Nobody messages me.
[01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:28.260]   Right, I don't need it.
[01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:29.580]   Right. And I use other things.
[01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:32.140]   I mean, people already have all kinds of messaging apps
[01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:33.980]   coming at you. There's WhatsApp.
[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:37.660]   There is, you know, there's iMessage if you use that.
[01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:39.900]   There's the messenger built into Android.
[01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:42.460]   You already have kind of many ways in which you can get
[01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:46.860]   notifications and to separate that out and make just one more
[01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:48.060]   seems to be like overload.
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:50.140]   So this is a, that's an interesting question.
[01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:53.500]   How do you think people like to use stuff?
[01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:57.340]   Would they rather have an omnibus app that does it all?
[01:20:57.340 --> 01:20:59.980]   Or would they rather separate all these functions out?
[01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:03.580]   Which would maybe allow them to choose in each case best in class.
[01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:06.700]   Maybe it's the Facebook messenger, but maybe it's not.
[01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:09.500]   I'm going to use the messenger that's best in class.
[01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:13.180]   Remember, like two or three years ago, Facebook
[01:21:13.180 --> 01:21:15.580]   gave everybody their own email address.
[01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:16.540]   Yeah, nobody used it.
[01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:17.580]   And they kind of envisioned it.
[01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:18.060]   It is.
[01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:20.540]   Yeah, they kind of envisioned becoming a primary email provider,
[01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:22.380]   which never happened as far as I know.
[01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:26.300]   I think they see messenger as getting people to think of it not
[01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:29.580]   as where you go to message Facebook users, but where you go first
[01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:30.700]   for messaging period.
[01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:32.140]   She can.
[01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:32.860]   Okay.
[01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:37.500]   Now I'm thinking, I can't remember any big successes recently
[01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.740]   in the last three years from Facebook.
[01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:43.340]   Any apps that took off anything that they've done that's been significant.
[01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:46.700]   They've done a good job of keeping Instagram strong, but obviously they.
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:47.980]   By keeping their hands off.
[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:49.500]   They didn't get going in the first place.
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:50.780]   And there's no question they've got growth.
[01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:52.140]   They're over well over a billion.
[01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:52.620]   What is it?
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:54.540]   1.2 billion now users.
[01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:58.220]   They're big successes that the Facebook mobile app has done really well,
[01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:01.660]   probably better than it necessarily would have because I think they've been
[01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:03.900]   generally speaking a good job of having a good mobile experience.
[01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:07.500]   They've been able to go to and that's the transition everybody was wondering if they could make.
[01:22:07.500 --> 01:22:10.620]   They've been able to remove revenue off the desktop to mobile.
[01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:13.100]   People are using Facebook and Vekmos.
[01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:16.540]   Most of their revenue is now mobile, like 54%.
[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:23.420]   But the reason why is that it duplicates or replicates the desktop look.
[01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:24.300]   It's familiar.
[01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:28.140]   When you're looking at it, there's no question, "Oh, I'm looking at Facebook."
[01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:30.060]   It looks like this on the desktop too.
[01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:32.860]   They kept the familiarity.
[01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:34.540]   Remember the early Facebook apps?
[01:22:34.540 --> 01:22:39.340]   Because they were using HTML5 or slow and irritating to use.
[01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:42.860]   Once they got away from it, that is what sped it up.
[01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:46.060]   But I think one of the big reasons why people use it is it looks like Facebook.
[01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:47.660]   Well, that's funny.
[01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:49.740]   Now, I don't use the iPhone version.
[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:50.780]   I use the Android version.
[01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:52.460]   I don't know if you guys are iPhone users.
[01:22:52.460 --> 01:22:54.860]   But they have really changed the Android one now.
[01:22:54.860 --> 01:22:57.820]   It's got these columns.
[01:22:57.820 --> 01:23:00.940]   It isn't like the old Facebook app.
[01:23:00.940 --> 01:23:05.660]   They moved the hamburger for absolutely no reason that I can understand.
[01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:07.820]   Remember that the settings used to be over on the left.
[01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:09.580]   Now they're on the right.
[01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:13.260]   I don't really understand.
[01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:15.100]   They've changed everything kind of randomly.
[01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:17.420]   Is it look like that on iOS?
[01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:22.060]   I do confess I do have an issue where there are like two hamburgers.
[01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:23.260]   There's my main hamburger.
[01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:24.140]   There are. There's two hamburgers.
[01:23:24.140 --> 01:23:25.180]   My messenger hamburger.
[01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:26.380]   And that is kind of confusing.
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:28.140]   It's very confusing.
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:31.660]   It is already does feel like a little bit like two worlds.
[01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:35.340]   It's the main world of Facebook and the messenger world of Facebook.
[01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:37.900]   Well, although when you when you look at the.
[01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:40.220]   So this is going to go away though, right?
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:42.940]   The newsfeed looks like Facebook on the desktop.
[01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:44.860]   That newsfeed does look like it does.
[01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:47.820]   It's unchanged.
[01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:49.500]   It's Facebook.
[01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:51.180]   It's exactly like Facebook on the desktop.
[01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:53.500]   So it's interesting.
[01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:56.140]   I mean, here's a company they talk about spending a lot of money on R&D,
[01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:58.940]   talking about being innovative and forward thinking.
[01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:04.140]   And yet can I can you think of a big hit that they've had lately?
[01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:05.980]   Chat faces.
[01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:09.500]   Chat heads, chat heads, whatever that's called.
[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:15.100]   I mean, really what have you done for me lately?
[01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:21.100]   Maybe you just you know, maybe just it's never we're not going to see companies on top anymore.
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:25.020]   It's just going to be a constant churn of companies going through the cycle.
[01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:28.220]   Although I have to say, I've been very impressed.
[01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:29.660]   We talked a little bit about this last week.
[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:31.740]   We certainly been talking about it on Windows weekly.
[01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:35.900]   Satya Nadella seems to have brought Microsoft back from the dead in some ways.
[01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:38.060]   I like the new Microsoft.
[01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:41.260]   They're they're opening sourcing some of their code.net code.
[01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:45.500]   They've they've reduced the price of windows on nine inch screens,
[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:52.620]   or less to zero unheard of the kinder kinder gentler Microsoft.
[01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:56.940]   And I think I just you know, Windows phone a one looks pretty darn good.
[01:24:56.940 --> 01:25:00.540]   Would you ever consider a Windows phone?
[01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:07.900]   Yeah, I mean, again, I my advice to myself as somebody who writes about this stuff is I need to
[01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:08.460]   do everything.
[01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:09.820]   So I jump back and forth.
[01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:12.540]   I jump back and forth between iPhone and Android kind of constantly.
[01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:12.860]   Yeah.
[01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:14.620]   And Windows, I think should be in that mix.
[01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:15.340]   I guess it should.
[01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:17.500]   I'm thinking I'm going to wait till the end of the month and then
[01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:21.420]   there'll be some Windows phones where they want all though you could buy one today and it'll be
[01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:21.660]   updated.
[01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:26.620]   I would recommend a Windows phone in some cases to like civilians who are looking for some things.
[01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:26.860]   Yeah.
[01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:28.540]   Yeah.
[01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:30.860]   What's the cricket metaphor for Satya Nadella?
[01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:32.140]   I need a cricket.
[01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:33.500]   He's apparently a big cricket fan.
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:35.820]   We don't know here in the States.
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:36.220]   We don't know.
[01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:37.420]   There's a sticky wicked.
[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:38.380]   It's a sticky wicked.
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:39.340]   That's a bad thing.
[01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:39.820]   Right.
[01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:42.700]   What's a what's hitting what's the equivalent of hitting a home run and cricket?
[01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:46.620]   That's a three bagger.
[01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:48.780]   I don't know.
[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:51.180]   There's a name.
[01:25:51.180 --> 01:25:52.060]   There's a word.
[01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:52.300]   Right.
[01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:52.860]   Come on, chat.
[01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:53.740]   Remember me out here.
[01:25:53.740 --> 01:25:58.460]   Uh, he's got a he's just I don't know.
[01:25:58.460 --> 01:25:58.940]   I don't know.
[01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:03.180]   Blackberry CEO speaking of not hitting a home run.
[01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:10.620]   He says that he is going to kill off Blackberry phones if they don't start making money.
[01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:13.580]   Forgive me, but what else do they?
[01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:15.340]   Blackberry messenger?
[01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:16.060]   Is that the business?
[01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:17.900]   The server stuff.
[01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:18.780]   Q and X and B.
[01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:19.180]   Yes.
[01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:20.460]   The enterprise stuff.
[01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:20.780]   Yeah.
[01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:24.220]   But if you don't have a Blackberry phone, do you need Blackberry enterprise server?
[01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:28.060]   I think they're general philosophy is that they will
[01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:30.620]   sell you a lot of enterprise software.
[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:33.820]   And hopefully you'll have some Blackberry phones.
[01:26:33.820 --> 01:26:36.620]   But if you also have iPhones and Androids that that's okay too.
[01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:37.900]   Yeah.
[01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:38.220]   He did.
[01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:40.860]   And then he said that he was kind of misquoted that he meant.
[01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:41.740]   He did in his blog.
[01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:46.860]   He said, I assure you I have no attention of selling off or abandoning this business anytime soon.
[01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:50.380]   This is this happens every time any CEO of Blackberry ever says anything.
[01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:51.740]   They have to clarify it a day later.
[01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:55.500]   Come on, chat room.
[01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:57.020]   So a home run is a sixer.
[01:26:57.020 --> 01:27:00.620]   So Satya Nadella has hit a sixer.
[01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:03.660]   Just doesn't have the ring to it.
[01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:04.780]   He's bolder googly.
[01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:06.940]   It's too early on.
[01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:08.540]   I don't think it's too early.
[01:27:09.340 --> 01:27:12.540]   Too early to say if they're you don't think he's bolder googly.
[01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:17.020]   I think he's still at bat.
[01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:17.340]   Okay.
[01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:19.660]   Is there a synonym for googly that doesn't have Google enough?
[01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:22.300]   I do believe that in cricket you could be a bat for days.
[01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:24.140]   Well, it is.
[01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:25.420]   That's what it'll take.
[01:27:25.420 --> 01:27:25.660]   Yeah.
[01:27:25.660 --> 01:27:27.420]   Days.
[01:27:27.420 --> 01:27:32.700]   Weave is off the hook, but only because of a technicality.
[01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:37.740]   We've really became a cause celeb for a lot of the hacker community.
[01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:41.820]   He himself bills himself as a hacker troll.
[01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:45.420]   But what we've did, which got him in so much trouble,
[01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:52.460]   was he discovered a flaw in AT&T system and used it to download the names and email addresses
[01:27:52.460 --> 01:27:53.500]   of iPad users.
[01:27:53.500 --> 01:28:04.060]   And he says, I told AT&T he downloaded 140,000 iPad owners from an AT&T website.
[01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:08.060]   Maybe he went a little far by publishing it.
[01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:13.180]   But it was a pretty he passed along the email addresses to Gawker.
[01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:18.140]   Although they didn't publish it without redacting some of the information.
[01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:22.540]   He was convicted in a New Jersey federal court of a felony
[01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:26.620]   for conspiracy to access AT&T servers.
[01:28:26.620 --> 01:28:34.060]   But the three judge federal appellate panel turned the conviction over
[01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:40.700]   on appeal saying, well, as it turns out, none of the servers were in New Jersey.
[01:28:40.700 --> 01:28:45.180]   So AT&T wanted to have the trial in New Jersey for some reason.
[01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:50.300]   Or maybe the government wanted to have it.
[01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:54.700]   The addresses were obtained from residents in New Jersey, but
[01:28:54.700 --> 01:29:01.660]   it turns out that the servers themselves, not one of them was in New Jersey.
[01:29:01.660 --> 01:29:06.780]   So purely on the technicality, he's off the hook.
[01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:09.740]   Justice Department has not decided to appeal.
[01:29:09.740 --> 01:29:14.780]   Yeah, there's some issue of doing another trial would be double jeopardy in this case.
[01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:20.860]   It's amazing that they only figured out that now, so long after all this happened.
[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:23.340]   Yeah, it seems like that's like, seems kind of basic.
[01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:29.740]   It was if a venue technicality that was fairly obvious, maybe they didn't know at the time.
[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:38.620]   The real issue is the computer fraud and abuse act, which is so broad that it really is possible
[01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:41.660]   to prosecute people for almost anything.
[01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:46.220]   And so I think that's really the issue that ultimately needs to be addressed.
[01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:55.580]   The third court of appeals said that weaves was charged, weave was charged in the wrong federal
[01:29:55.580 --> 01:30:01.740]   court, so celebration, but for all the wrong reasons.
[01:30:01.740 --> 01:30:09.260]   Hewlett Packard's going to pay 108 million dollars for bribing public officials.
[01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:18.700]   In Poland, Russian and Mexico, the international investigation found corruption in those three
[01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:23.340]   countries and HP is going to have to pay 108 dollars in fines.
[01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:29.420]   HP really seems to have a kind of bad business practices all around.
[01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:34.140]   This was the board that spyed on the Porter.
[01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:36.540]   Pre-texting stuff, right?
[01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:43.740]   All right, let's tell you what, you know, we had a pretty good week this week.
[01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:44.540]   Some interesting stuff.
[01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:48.700]   We debuted a new show, marketing mavericks on the network.
[01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:50.380]   Very happy with Tanya Hall.
[01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:54.940]   Very happy. In fact, we interviewed Tanya, interviewed the chief marketing officer of Taco Bell,
[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:56.540]   talked about their social media.
[01:30:56.540 --> 01:30:57.900]   And a lot of good stuff. Let's take a look.
[01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:02.060]   If you missed anything this week, here's kind of a quick summary of some of the things that happened
[01:31:02.060 --> 01:31:02.620]   on Twitter.
[01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:06.620]   Previously on Twitter, Twitter Live specials.
[01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:11.500]   Every year, everyone who's even remotely connected to content production comes to one place.
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:17.820]   The mecca of all things video and audio, ladies and gentlemen, NAB 2014, Las Vegas.
[01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:20.460]   Tech news tonight.
[01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:26.460]   A bug in OpenSSL, which if you haven't heard of as an open source cryptographic library,
[01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:30.940]   securing a big percentage of the internet's traffic has just been discovered and publicly
[01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:31.660]   disclosed.
[01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:33.580]   Security now.
[01:31:33.580 --> 01:31:34.700]   How the heart bleeds.
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:37.660]   Much overhyped, as always.
[01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:39.500]   Much misunderstanding.
[01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:44.300]   Nowhere will you get more comprehensive coverage of it than here?
[01:31:44.300 --> 01:31:45.500]   Marketing mavericks.
[01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:50.140]   We've got a really important guest with us today, chief marketing officer at Taco Bell.
[01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:52.060]   And we do love the Ronald McDonald campaign.
[01:31:52.060 --> 01:31:52.780]   It's clever.
[01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:53.500]   It's witty.
[01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:56.140]   What we're really pleased about is that people get the joke.
[01:31:56.140 --> 01:31:59.340]   We want to do everything that has a little bit of a wink, a little bit of rebellion.
[01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:02.060]   So pretty exciting times for Taco Bell.
[01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:03.260]   That is disgusting.
[01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:05.020]   It's what's for dinner.
[01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:09.100]   I love it.
[01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:12.940]   Actually, you know, NAB didn't have any huge stories, but we had some great coverage.
[01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:16.060]   And thanks to Scott Wilkinson and Father Robert Ballisare.
[01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:18.700]   And if you didn't see our NAB coverage, it's in the specials feed, right?
[01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:21.500]   Twit.tv/specials.
[01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:23.980]   A little out of breath.
[01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:31.100]   I just ran, ran across the studio and back during that, during that promo.
[01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:35.420]   One of the things that they did announce at NAB that we were very interested in Skype
[01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:37.660]   announced, you know, Skype's now a Microsoft product.
[01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:41.660]   Microsoft had acquired a company called Cat-N-Mouse.
[01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:43.100]   Is that it?
[01:32:43.100 --> 01:32:44.940]   Cat-N-Mouse.
[01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:47.260]   And they're going to do a new media product.
[01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:49.020]   So we called them a media.
[01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:49.420]   Skype TX.
[01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:50.220]   Skype TX.
[01:32:50.220 --> 01:32:50.460]   Yeah.
[01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:51.260]   Have you heard about that?
[01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:51.980]   Yeah.
[01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:52.860]   It looks interesting.
[01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:54.140]   You take it for broadcasters.
[01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:55.900]   It looks like it would.
[01:32:55.900 --> 01:32:59.580]   It's almost like a virtual trycaster.
[01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:00.220]   Who's that?
[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:00.780]   Yeah.
[01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:04.060]   I'm not completely sure what they're doing, but we did talk to them.
[01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:06.060]   And they knew who we were.
[01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:07.740]   They know we use Skype like crazy.
[01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:09.820]   You're on Skype right now.
[01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:14.540]   And so they're going to get us, we think they're going to get us a Skype TX pretty quick.
[01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:17.820]   So for all the people who tweeted.
[01:33:17.820 --> 01:33:19.740]   Will it change what we do here?
[01:33:19.740 --> 01:33:21.900]   I don't think from your point of view it will.
[01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:24.700]   I think you'll just use Skype as you are using it.
[01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:31.980]   But we will have a Skype TX box here that will have, give us all sorts of capabilities in terms of
[01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:36.380]   settings, things that we, under the hood that we haven't been able to dial,
[01:33:36.380 --> 01:33:37.900]   we haven't been able to twiddle in Skype.
[01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:41.100]   Plus it'll be integrated better into our hardware.
[01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:42.140]   That's set up.
[01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:44.380]   We'll have SDI video and all of that stuff.
[01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:49.100]   You should get better video back, a better audio back.
[01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:52.940]   And we should be able to, you know, there's all sorts of issues with
[01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:56.460]   screen sizes and stuff happening there.
[01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:57.820]   And we should be able to get better results.
[01:33:57.820 --> 01:34:00.940]   So to me, that was the big story.
[01:34:00.940 --> 01:34:01.260]   I don't know.
[01:34:01.260 --> 01:34:03.500]   A lot of you probably don't care, but that was the big story.
[01:34:03.500 --> 01:34:05.340]   I know enough of you care because I got a lot of tweets
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:07.900]   from people on emails flying back and forth.
[01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:08.460]   What are they announce?
[01:34:08.460 --> 01:34:09.020]   What are they announce?
[01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:11.420]   So we're excited about that.
[01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:13.900]   So that's good news.
[01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:18.540]   Do you have a week ahead with Mr. Mike Elgin?
[01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:20.860]   Let's see what's coming up on the week ahead.
[01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:24.300]   Coming up this week, Intel reports earnings on Tuesday, April 15th.
[01:34:24.300 --> 01:34:26.620]   Google and IBM do the same on the 16th.
[01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:31.660]   Also, Google selling Google Glass to the public for one day only, starting at 9am Pacific on Tuesday.
[01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:35.180]   The Twitter music app has already been pulled from the iTunes App Store.
[01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:39.660]   But if you still have the app, the service that powers it will be terminated on Friday,
[01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:40.540]   April 18th.
[01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:43.100]   That's the week coming up back to you, Leo.
[01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:44.860]   You know, actually it was really pleasing.
[01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:46.620]   It's kind of a plug, but I'm going to mention anyway,
[01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:50.140]   because Sonos just added Google Play music to the Sonos player.
[01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:52.460]   And that's it.
[01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:52.940]   I'm done.
[01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:55.020]   I'm so happy about that.
[01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:57.740]   I can play all my, not only all my music on that now, but
[01:34:57.740 --> 01:35:01.180]   everything in the Google store.
[01:35:01.180 --> 01:35:02.940]   I think it's 20 million songs.
[01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:03.180]   All right.
[01:35:03.180 --> 01:35:03.820]   We're going to take a break.
[01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:04.540]   Come back with more.
[01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:09.100]   Dwight Silverman from The Chronicle, Houston Chronicle from Time Magazine Tech.
[01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:11.820]   Technologizer, Harry McCracken.
[01:35:11.820 --> 01:35:13.020]   I always call you technologizers.
[01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:13.420]   Is that okay?
[01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:14.860]   That your title?
[01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:15.660]   Just flattering.
[01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:18.060]   The Terminator, the technologizer.
[01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:21.580]   Our show today brought to you by Carbonite Online Backup.
[01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:24.140]   Whether you have a computer, a single computer at home, or
[01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:28.620]   you've got external drives or multiple computers at your business,
[01:35:28.620 --> 01:35:33.340]   Carbonite is the place to back up your files to the cloud automatically,
[01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:34.300]   continuously.
[01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:38.300]   They are, I'm just, I tell you, they are a great company.
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:40.300]   What is the number?
[01:35:40.300 --> 01:35:42.940]   If you scroll down a little bit, I think it says 50,000 businesses.
[01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:50.220]   Yeah, 50,000 businesses now use Carbonite to back up 350 million files a day.
[01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:53.740]   30 billion files total.
[01:35:53.740 --> 01:35:57.980]   The thing about it is automatic, so you don't have to remember it.
[01:35:57.980 --> 01:35:59.900]   It's continuous.
[01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:01.340]   Whenever you're online, it's backing up.
[01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:04.540]   So instantly, you don't have to wait till the weekend to back up.
[01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:08.700]   You can get to your files anytime on the Carbonite servers.
[01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:09.660]   So it's in the cloud.
[01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:12.220]   You log on to your Carbonite account.
[01:36:12.220 --> 01:36:12.940]   There's your stuff.
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:17.020]   And it's just really easy.
[01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:19.100]   I'm sorry, 300 billion files backed up.
[01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:20.140]   HIPAA compliant too.
[01:36:20.140 --> 01:36:25.340]   And in fact, if you're worried about the idea that maybe your files would be
[01:36:27.180 --> 01:36:32.860]   visible to three-letter federal agencies in the Carbonite cloud, you do have the ability to
[01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:35.500]   further encrypt using trust, no one encryption.
[01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:37.180]   Only you have the key, not Carbonite.
[01:36:37.180 --> 01:36:40.060]   Just things like that that really make Carbonite great.
[01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:41.980]   Now, the best part is very affordable.
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:48.220]   Flat rate plans, $59.99 a year for everything on a single macro PC, but they've got plans for
[01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:50.460]   networks, servers, and more.
[01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:54.700]   Always one yearly flat rate, no matter how much data you have.
[01:36:55.420 --> 01:36:57.180]   Carbonite.com, you can try it right now.
[01:36:57.180 --> 01:36:58.220]   You don't need a credit card.
[01:36:58.220 --> 01:37:02.060]   Just our offer code, if you use our offer code, during your two-week trial,
[01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:04.940]   you'll get two weeks, so I'm sorry, two months free with purchase.
[01:37:04.940 --> 01:37:06.940]   You got to back it up to get it back.
[01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:08.780]   Do it right.
[01:37:08.780 --> 01:37:10.780]   Carbonite.
[01:37:10.780 --> 01:37:15.100]   Actually, I think there's been a lot of interest in Carbonite since we found out this week
[01:37:15.100 --> 01:37:22.860]   that Condoleezza Rice, the architect of the federal spying infrastructure that was created
[01:37:22.860 --> 01:37:25.500]   during the Bush administration, is now on the board of Dropbox.
[01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:26.540]   So that'll make it easier.
[01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:34.300]   Not that Dropbox would ever turn down a federal request anyway, but it's just,
[01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:36.460]   you know, we've got a channel right into the...
[01:37:36.460 --> 01:37:40.060]   No, I like Dropbox, but it is a little bit weird.
[01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:40.700]   Here's a good one.
[01:37:40.700 --> 01:37:48.060]   Apparently, the feds were able to get into GoGo's in-flight Wi-Fi.
[01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:54.540]   You know, in case you were wondering, when you're in the air using GoGo Wi-Fi,
[01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:59.100]   you're automatically sharing your stuff with law enforcement.
[01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:04.220]   Apparently, GoGo has voluntarily shared more than required with law enforcement.
[01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:07.260]   I've always assumed I was.
[01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:08.860]   Really?
[01:38:08.860 --> 01:38:10.220]   Yeah, I'm on an airplane.
[01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:11.980]   It should be public, right?
[01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:13.740]   Chris Seguayan, we love Chris.
[01:38:13.740 --> 01:38:16.060]   You're in the air, what the hell?
[01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:22.860]   Chris Seguayan, who is the ACLU, tweeted a link to a letter submitted from a GoGo
[01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:26.940]   attorney to the FCC, which said, "The commission's air to ground rules do not
[01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:30.060]   require licensees to implement capabilities to support law enforcement
[01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:35.180]   beyond those outlined in Kalea, but GoGo worked with federal agencies to reach agreement
[01:38:35.180 --> 01:38:38.700]   regarding a set of additional capabilities to accommodate law enforcement interest."
[01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:42.540]   Do you think terrorists in the air, like tweet, "I'm going to take over the plane before."
[01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:45.660]   Is that why you think because they're in the air?
[01:38:45.660 --> 01:38:48.300]   Yeah, I assume that at least the government would be worried about that.
[01:38:48.300 --> 01:38:51.900]   GoGo also said that the only reason there's a cap shop when you
[01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:57.180]   pay for GoGo in the air is because the government insisted on it being there,
[01:38:57.180 --> 01:39:00.060]   which I always wondered about because I didn't understand anybody could spam.
[01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:05.020]   I'm on a flight to Newark and I'm going to spam while I'm up there.
[01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:09.420]   I wondered whether anybody was worried about somebody building some sort of device.
[01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:10.380]   A robot?
[01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:13.660]   Which they could plan on the plane, which would log into GoGo,
[01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:18.620]   and then send information to the ground or be triggered from the ground or something?
[01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:19.900]   That's bizarre.
[01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:25.340]   GoGo says its primary concession to law enforcement was to impose a capture
[01:39:25.340 --> 01:39:28.300]   to thwart spammers and other network abuse.
[01:39:28.300 --> 01:39:30.380]   So a capture only finds bots.
[01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:32.060]   It doesn't do a very good job of it, by the way.
[01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:34.700]   In fact, nobody should be using capture ever.
[01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:35.420]   It's terrible.
[01:39:35.420 --> 01:39:40.540]   Besides annoying your users, it doesn't provide you with any additional security.
[01:39:40.540 --> 01:39:43.900]   In fact, we know that what bad guys do is they just make a porn site
[01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:47.420]   and they feed the captures into the porn site and say,
[01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:49.020]   "If you want to see porn, enter this cap.
[01:39:49.020 --> 01:39:49.980]   Tell us what this means."
[01:39:49.980 --> 01:39:52.620]   And then they take the results back and there's so many people hitting the site,
[01:39:52.620 --> 01:39:54.380]   they can unlock any capture right away.
[01:39:54.380 --> 01:39:57.660]   So captures are completely useless.
[01:39:57.660 --> 01:39:58.460]   They keep out people.
[01:39:58.460 --> 01:39:59.980]   They keep out people.
[01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:00.700]   That's the primary thing.
[01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:01.900]   They don't keep out robots.
[01:40:01.900 --> 01:40:05.740]   And what robots are there at 10,000 and 30,000 feet?
[01:40:05.740 --> 01:40:08.540]   Who's writing spam robots?
[01:40:08.540 --> 01:40:08.940]   You're right.
[01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:11.100]   It must be like, "We've infiltrated the air."
[01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:14.860]   I mean, what if somebody put a bomb on a plane in the cargo space
[01:40:14.860 --> 01:40:16.700]   and it was some unable to log under?
[01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:18.700]   Wouldn't it be great if the capture would thwart that?
[01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:21.100]   I sort of wondered if that was the reason it was there.
[01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:22.140]   It's bizarre.
[01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:25.180]   Because the stories I saw didn't really explain why the government would care
[01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:26.860]   if there was a capture on GoGo.
[01:40:26.860 --> 01:40:27.100]   Yeah.
[01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:30.220]   So GoGo says, "That's the kind of stuff we did.
[01:40:30.220 --> 01:40:32.140]   We didn't help them monitor traffic at all."
[01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:39.100]   Essentially, what if you could communicate with a bomb from the ground via GoGo?
[01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:40.700]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:41.580]   That's interesting.
[01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:47.020]   Okay.
[01:40:47.020 --> 01:40:54.300]   I can't quite figure out, but I'm sure that the NSA knows what it's doing.
[01:40:54.300 --> 01:41:01.420]   Sir David Attenborough, famous creator of documentaries like Planet Earth and Life,
[01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:06.060]   is doing a new documentary Conquest on the Skies,
[01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:10.060]   or filming with an eight-camera rig because they wanted to deliver
[01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:14.380]   360-degree video for "Wears of the Oculus Rift."
[01:41:14.380 --> 01:41:17.100]   Imagine...
[01:41:17.100 --> 01:41:19.420]   Now this, to me, is kind of intriguing.
[01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:23.580]   Imagine watching a movie in the Rift headset,
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:26.460]   and when you see something going over there, you look to the left.
[01:41:26.460 --> 01:41:27.900]   You see something going over there, you look to the right-
[01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:30.140]   And that's wild.
[01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:32.220]   The film will also be released.
[01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:33.820]   There's a regular version of the film.
[01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:34.220]   Yes.
[01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:35.500]   The film will also be released.
[01:41:36.300 --> 01:41:38.300]   In normal 3D.
[01:41:38.300 --> 01:41:43.260]   So which of the eight camera angles does he decide is going to be the...
[01:41:43.260 --> 01:41:44.860]   The middle.
[01:41:44.860 --> 01:41:45.820]   The middle one.
[01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:49.180]   It has to be the middle because you have to have something on the left and right to look at.
[01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:50.700]   But if it's 8, it's all around you.
[01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:51.340]   It's 360.
[01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:52.220]   Oh, it's 360.
[01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:54.220]   You could turn around.
[01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:55.820]   Wow, that'd be wild.
[01:41:55.820 --> 01:41:56.860]   That wouldn't be weird.
[01:41:56.860 --> 01:41:57.660]   I think one of the...
[01:41:57.660 --> 01:41:59.260]   Am I just paranoid?
[01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:03.740]   Because I think one of the problems with Oculus Rift is the fact that you are standing with a thing on your head
[01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:07.180]   that means you can't hear or see anything that's going on around you.
[01:42:07.180 --> 01:42:10.620]   And somebody could just come knock you on the head and steal your Google Glass.
[01:42:10.620 --> 01:42:12.060]   So there's a company here in Houston.
[01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:16.620]   I think it's called Virtuix Omni or something like that
[01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:20.700]   that has developed a treadmill for use with headsets like the Oculus Rift.
[01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:21.180]   No.
[01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:24.220]   It allows you to walk around in the world.
[01:42:24.220 --> 01:42:25.580]   Terrible idea.
[01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:26.540]   It has a...
[01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:29.500]   It's like a little platform with guardrails around it
[01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:32.140]   and it allows you to move around in this world.
[01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:33.740]   I think they just went up on Kickstarter.
[01:42:33.740 --> 01:42:34.060]   Yeah.
[01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:35.740]   Virtuix Omni is what it's called.
[01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:35.900]   Yeah.
[01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:37.260]   Yeah.
[01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:37.260]   Yeah.
[01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:38.860]   Yeah, they're based here.
[01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:40.220]   It's only 500 dollars.
[01:42:40.220 --> 01:42:44.780]   Wow.
[01:42:44.780 --> 01:42:47.340]   Yeah, I've seen that people...
[01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:52.940]   But you have to be harnessed because you could accidentally get excited and run off of it and fall down.
[01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:54.220]   Right.
[01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:54.700]   So you have to...
[01:42:54.700 --> 01:43:01.340]   In the early days of virtual reality, there was this pterodactyl game.
[01:43:01.340 --> 01:43:01.740]   Yes.
[01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:02.460]   That was going around.
[01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:03.020]   You remember that?
[01:43:03.020 --> 01:43:03.980]   Yes. I played it.
[01:43:03.980 --> 01:43:04.300]   Yes.
[01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:06.300]   At the SIGGRAPH.
[01:43:06.300 --> 01:43:07.100]   Yes.
[01:43:07.100 --> 01:43:08.620]   Guaranteed to make you throw up.
[01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:09.260]   Oh.
[01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:09.500]   I...
[01:43:09.500 --> 01:43:09.980]   This...
[01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:10.540]   So we had...
[01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:16.300]   We did a little demo of somebody had a virtual reality suit that you would be...
[01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:17.660]   You played the game like you'd aim the gun.
[01:43:17.660 --> 01:43:21.260]   You'd physically aim the gun and then they put the Oculus Rift on me.
[01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:23.900]   And I was beating zombies with a stick but then I got sick.
[01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:25.980]   And I don't...
[01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:26.940]   And that wasn't fun.
[01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:31.900]   But we did get an email from somebody saying if you put a cool damp washcloth
[01:43:31.900 --> 01:43:33.500]   in the back of your neck, you'll feel better.
[01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:36.300]   But I didn't get that to like three days later.
[01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:36.860]   So I didn't know.
[01:43:36.860 --> 01:43:38.300]   That's right.
[01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:41.180]   The high end version of the Oculus Rift comes with...
[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:41.740]   It comes with a cool...
[01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:42.220]   A cool...
[01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:44.300]   A cool cooling damp washcloth.
[01:43:44.300 --> 01:43:45.820]   Apparently that works every time.
[01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:48.060]   I don't know.
[01:43:48.060 --> 01:43:51.180]   I love the idea of immersive virtual reality but at the same time,
[01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:57.660]   it's like there's an uncanny valley with VR too that if it's kind of not perfect,
[01:43:57.660 --> 01:43:59.020]   it's like nauseating.
[01:43:59.020 --> 01:43:59.500]   Right.
[01:43:59.500 --> 01:43:59.580]   Right.
[01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:02.300]   Let's take a break.
[01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:03.020]   No, we did our...
[01:44:03.020 --> 01:44:03.740]   Did we do everything?
[01:44:03.740 --> 01:44:03.980]   Okay.
[01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:07.980]   So I can play the worst social media marketing song you've ever heard.
[01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:09.980]   You want to hear it?
[01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:10.860]   Oh God.
[01:44:10.860 --> 01:44:13.260]   It's called Let's Get Social.
[01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:14.700]   Oh no.
[01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:17.260]   Oh no.
[01:44:17.260 --> 01:44:21.420]   Let me see if I can find the video.
[01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:22.220]   It's on YouTube.
[01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:22.700]   Here we go.
[01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:29.100]   This is a social media marketing world which...
[01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:30.300]   Oh God.
[01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:30.620]   All right.
[01:44:30.620 --> 01:44:31.340]   Can you get...
[01:44:31.340 --> 01:44:32.700]   Are you getting my audio?
[01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:33.660]   You can't get my audio.
[01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:35.420]   You may be saved.
[01:44:35.420 --> 01:44:41.340]   Mary McCoy is the one to come out right now and she is going to sing a song
[01:44:41.340 --> 01:44:45.100]   that I wrote and then she and Dave Curtis, one of the band members,
[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:45.500]   helped play it.
[01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:47.820]   I always wanted it like she knows to do rap.
[01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:53.020]   I wanted to start talking and then have like a big loud beat come out
[01:44:53.020 --> 01:44:55.020]   and explosion and fireworks.
[01:44:55.020 --> 01:44:56.140]   Word is social.
[01:44:56.140 --> 01:44:56.940]   Can you handle it?
[01:44:56.940 --> 01:44:58.300]   And then do a rap.
[01:44:58.300 --> 01:44:59.660]   But this is not quite that.
[01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:01.180]   And say social, you're going to go...
[01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:01.740]   Media.
[01:45:01.740 --> 01:45:02.860]   All right.
[01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:06.060]   And Mary's going to actually sing Let's Get Social.
[01:45:06.060 --> 01:45:08.700]   I'll point to you and you'll say social.
[01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:09.020]   All right.
[01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:09.180]   Cool.
[01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:11.420]   Mary McCoy with Continuum.
[01:45:11.420 --> 01:45:12.620]   Please come line up.
[01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:14.140]   This is Let's Get Social.
[01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:15.340]   Just think of all the money you saved.
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:18.780]   You didn't really have to go to social media marketing world because...
[01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:21.100]   This may cause me to resign my current job.
[01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:24.700]   This is what you do for a living white soldier.
[01:45:24.700 --> 01:45:25.580]   No it's not.
[01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:28.940]   [Laughter]
[01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:30.140]   I promise you it's not.
[01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:35.180]   This poor woman's wondering why did I agree to do this?
[01:45:35.180 --> 01:45:35.820]   No, maybe not.
[01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:37.180]   Maybe she's actually enjoying it.
[01:45:37.180 --> 01:45:37.820]   He's into it.
[01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:40.540]   Oh Lord.
[01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:41.340]   I don't know if I should.
[01:45:41.340 --> 01:45:44.140]   [Music]
[01:45:44.140 --> 01:45:46.140]   Showing you things you like.
[01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:50.140]   Try to get engagement.
[01:45:50.140 --> 01:45:53.020]   There's some photos from my life.
[01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:56.860]   My cat, my kids, I'm baking.
[01:45:56.860 --> 01:45:58.300]   Face bomb baby.
[01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:01.100]   [Laughter]
[01:46:01.100 --> 01:46:03.900]   And sweet into the world.
[01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:07.100]   You love me, groom my clothes.
[01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:08.220]   This is not a joke.
[01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:10.220]   I promise that I'll share it with you.
[01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:11.020]   [Laughter]
