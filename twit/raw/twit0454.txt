[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   It's time for "Twit" Dan Patterson is here.

[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.240]   Our own Alex Lindsay.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.800]   We're talking about the week's tech news.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.240]   Either way, I don't mention it any time in the show.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.160]   But this is the ninth anniversary of the Twit Network.
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.680]   We begin our 10th year today.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.640]   We'll also talk about those wearable devices.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.120]   Is it the end of the line?
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.160]   For the fuel band, Project ARA, the phone you put together.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.920]   And true blood, it's actually real.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.000]   It's all coming up next on "Twit."
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.320]   Netcast you love.

[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.840]   Welcome, everybody, to the weekly show that covers the week's
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.680]   tech news.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.920]   And we have a great panel today to talk about everything going on.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.560]   We drag Alex Lindsey in, and he's going to explain in a bit
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.280]   what he's going to do that's a little different for this week's
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.560]   Twit.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.440]   Alex, usually the co-host on Mac Break Weekly,
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.120]   and of course, the man about time with the Pixelcore.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.800]   On air via Skype from New York City, Dan Patrick--
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.600]   I think you're in New York, right, Dan?
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.560]   Yep, New York City.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.480]   Dan Patterson, he's a broadcast digital journalist.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.440]   He just got back from teaching Sudanese media makers
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.840]   how to use Android phones to change the world.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.240]   He was in Cairo for the month of March
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.760]   with the group Small World News.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.640]   I think that's really exciting.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.960]   We were talking before the show about that.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.400]   We'll talk some more about it.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.360]   But it's great to have you, Dan.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.280]   Welcome.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.600]   Wonderful to be here.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.400]   And I want to welcome into a studio with this Jill Duffy.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.080]   Jill writes for PC Magazine.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.120]   He's been around a little bit for TNT.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.240]   We persuaded her to spend her Easter Sunday with us.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.880]   Thank you, Jill.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.880]   Thank you for having me, once again.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.800]   It's wonderful to have you.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.280]   Not your first time on Twit, so.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.640]   No, but first time live in studio.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.160]   In studio.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.600]   It's a little different.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.560]   It's a little different.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.520]   It's a little different.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.920]   My head--
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.720]   Don't stare at it.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.960]   It is abnormally large.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.800]   So what are we going to do with questions today?
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.760]   This is a little different.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.440]   OK, so we have been--
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.040]   for a couple of years, we've been building question engines.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.360]   A lot of when we do live shows, we
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.800]   want to find ways that users can interact with us on the air.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.600]   And so we've been experimenting with this.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.560]   This is our newest version, version 3.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.200]   And so what you can do here is go to Bitly.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.280]   That's B-I-T.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.320]   You're watching live.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.360]   There's no point doing this.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.960]   If you're listening after the set.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.800]   It's over.
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.560]   So this is the reason to watch live.
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.160]   And so you can go to bitly.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.040]   That's B-I-T dot L-Y slash Twit 454.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.280]   I may have gotten that number wrong.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.400]   I got that number right.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.080]   So Twit 454.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.080]   So it's bitly slash Twit 454.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.000]   And this is a question system.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.320]   And what you can do here is you can watch the show.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.040]   So you don't have to put this on a separate window.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.840]   There is a login.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.960]   So instead of using chat for the time being,
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.560]   if you want to do, you could use this.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.000]   It won't be as interactive as chat.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.200]   But we will see the questions.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.880]   We'll see the questions.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.560]   And you can vote them up.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.520]   I can see them right here.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.440]   I can give you the login if you want to see them there.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.440]   I'll let you be the question.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.320]   You can just come over to me and we can answer some questions.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.360]   So Alex, you're the one who has the answering power
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.200]   at this point?
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.160]   At this moment, I can give it to you too, if you'd like.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.160]   You can jump in there.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.800]   Give her the link.
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.360]   OK, so I'll send you a link and a login for that.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.520]   So you can just put it in the chat on the Google Drive document.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.760]   Yeah, just let me know what you register as.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.160]   Put it next to your thing.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.160]   Oh, here.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.200]   But no, I just have my programmer who's watching from London
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.960]   right now add you as an admin.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.760]   And your idea is that you might use this for hanging out
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.840]   some stuff when you do events.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.560]   Live streaming right now, personally, ask Alex.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.280]   I've been doing these kind of flash ones,
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.560]   where I give everyone 10 minutes warning.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.440]   I say, if you want to just ask questions about Rwanda
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.080]   or media or green screen, you just jump on.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.680]   And it's funny, we get about 20 people
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.520]   and they ask questions.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.520]   It's a great little conversation.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.280]   And so it's an app that you can get up there.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.120]   You can ask questions.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.320]   You can also vote on the questions up and down.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.160]   We can answer them.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.600]   So you'll see us experimenting.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.840]   I can answer them offline in text,
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.120]   or we can answer them on the air.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.640]   And we can also timestamp them, which isn't useful now,
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.320]   but will be useful in the future when we answer them.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.080]   So anyway, there's a lot of little bits and pieces
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.920]   that we're working on.
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.560]   And it's just designed to keep the online audience more
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.760]   engaged and have you actually have it sometimes
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.240]   with the IRC, everything's just going past
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.280]   and we don't know how popular that is.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.760]   It's just an experiment.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.640]   I'm always looking for ways to make it more interactive.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.240]   Because one of the reasons we do stuff live
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.680]   is so that people can watch live and interact with us live.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.160]   Exactly.
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.000]   We've tried a lot of things, some of which don't work so well.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.160]   And we're going to find out if we try to Google Hangout.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.800]   And that kind of was hard because we had nine people
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.560]   and we couldn't get them all in and stuff.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.360]   But this isn't interesting.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.880]   We'll try it.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.720]   We'll see what happens.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.040]   See if it looks good.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.280]   So if you want to participate and you're watching the live show.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.120]   For instance, the most popular question right now
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.440]   is when is Chad getting a raise?
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.480]   Actually, there's a typo.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.920]   So it's just when I can't get a raise.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.640]   When I check get raise.
[00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.120]   When when I checked out what was posted by OMG.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.040]   Weird.
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.520]   Who would have posted that question?
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.120]   Huh.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.080]   But it's suspicious.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.840]   But Chad, even though you obviously put it in there,
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.920]   it's been voted up by 38 people.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.960]   You have some people on your side here, Chad.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.880]   Yeah, fairly.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.520]   I think this is not going to work and I'm going to turn it off.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.760]   Can you give Chad--
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.320]   one problem is Chad's watching the link that has the feed in it.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.600]   Give Chad the moderation console.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.160]   Yeah, so Chad, just send me your username, your username.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.160]   And I can get you upgraded to admin.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.760]   We could just do that in the Google Doc.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.360]   So I think this is a top story.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.840]   You know why?
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.200]   Because I see a lot of people around here
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.440]   wearing these fitness bands, including you, Jill Duffy.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.800]   Where you wear Fitbit, what's it called?
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:05.800]   I wear everything.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.680]   I wear Fitbit Force often.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.520]   I also love the basis band.
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.520]   The basis card is still there.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.840]   Yeah, they just got sold.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.960]   Yeah, they were bought by--
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.520]   Somebody big.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.400]   Was it Yahoo Google?
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.160]   Somebody basis?
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.760]   I almost want to say Intel.
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:20.280]   Intel?
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.280]   I think it was Intel.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.080]   Congratulations.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.600]   Ding, ding, ding.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.440]   You're absolutely right.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.240]   It was Intel.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.800]   Yeah, no.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.040]   And that's great for the company.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.640]   I mean, it's a wonderful product.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.760]   It really came out first in this sense
[00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.680]   of having a heart rate monitor that you didn't have to wear
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.240]   around your chest.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.360]   So you could have this heart rate monitor on your wrist.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.680]   It would count your steps.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.560]   It does really cool stuff, too, if you bicycle, which I do.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.880]   So if you bicycle--
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.720]   The force doesn't know your bicycling.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.280]   No, but it doesn't--
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.280]   It thinks you're not exercising.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.480]   It doesn't really count anything.
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.080]   I used to put it on my ankle.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.040]   The basis, though, when you start to bicycle,
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.560]   it knows your wrist position and the amount of speed
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:51.960]   you're moving.
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.920]   And it's like, OK, now you're bicycling.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.080]   And same with running.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.040]   Once you start running, it automatically
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.480]   records that you're running.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.520]   And a lot of other devices that have that capability,
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.200]   you have to enable it.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.720]   This one just does it automatically.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.360]   It also does your skin temperature.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.480]   So between the heart rate, the skin temperature
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:13.640]   and the movement, it can tell when you're in REM sleep
[00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:15.600]   versus light sleep versus deep sleep.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.880]   So you just keep it on all the time?
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.840]   Yeah, you just leave it on all the time.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:19.640]   Is that your favorite?
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:20.800]   Carbon steel edition.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.360]   Yeah, it does.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.520]   It kind of looks like a watch, too.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.160]   It does.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.320]   It has a wonderful display on it.
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.480]   It's $199.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.400]   So it's more expensive than a lot of the other fitness
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.040]   trackers out there.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.280]   But that's by far my favorite one.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.120]   Dan, you sound like you're--
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.160]   you bonded to this, too.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.240]   What do you--
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.840]   Yeah, I mean, it's been said before,
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.160]   but it's worth saying, again, the wearables market
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:43.920]   is kind of waiting for its iPod.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:46.920]   But having said that, the Fitbit has really helped me do
[00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:51.360]   exactly what the silly hyperbole would lead you to believe,
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.880]   which is to bend your data curve in a positive direction,
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.800]   simply having access to this data.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.600]   I did the same thing when I quit smoking.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.640]   It just made a spreadsheet.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.800]   And having access to this data helps
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.000]   you understand what you're doing.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.920]   It helps you identify positive trends in your own usage.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.920]   So you know, wearing a Fitbit--
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.920]   Which model do you have, Dan?
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.000]   Which Fitbit do you have?
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.560]   Which model of Fitbit?
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.440]   I have the-- oh, what is this?
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.080]   The belt wearable one.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:14.760]   What is this model?
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.920]   One Fitbit one.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:16.880]   Yeah, the Fitbit one.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.440]   Super edit.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.160]   It's fantastic.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.200]   The only danger, of course, is that it's
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.680]   waiting to be thrown into the laundry.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.160]   But it is really in the last year or so
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:28.880]   that I've been using it.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.200]   I've really bent my data curve in a positive direction.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.600]   I get a ton more exercise.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.760]   And I see the beautiful city.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.880]   I have lost every one of these several times.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.880]   I killed my Nike Philband by accident.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.960]   Well, that's where the story begins,
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.880]   because according to CNET-- and they
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.440]   published this two days ago on Friday--
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.280]   Nike fired the majority of the fuel band team
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.080]   and will stop making wearable hardware.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.800]   And Nike is responded saying, eh, what are you--
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.680]   no, absolutely not.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.680]   They told a recode.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.760]   The Nike Fuel Band SE remains an important part
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.040]   of our business.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.160]   We will continue to improve the Nike Plus Fuel Band app,
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.560]   launch the new Metallux colors, and we
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.520]   will sell and support the Nike Plus Fuel Band SE
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.880]   for the foreseeable future.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.400]   Nevertheless, I think it's pretty clear
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.120]   that did lay off a lot of people.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:16.360]   And what it made me wonder is, are we
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.600]   about to see the big shakeout in this area?
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.760]   I thought the Fuel Band was the best device out there.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.800]   I totally disagree.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.640]   I totally disagree.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.160]   You don't.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:24.640]   I really do.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.160]   I worry about it.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:25.640]   So when I--
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.800]   I told you what time it was?
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.800]   It did.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.360]   In a hard bangle that wasn't going to bend or move
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.520]   at all, I found it uncomfortable.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.360]   Well, you have smaller risk than I do.
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.360]   It fit me well.
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.360]   I have pretty big risks.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.200]   I have pretty big risks.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:37.720]   All right.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:42.440]   But for $150, which is what the Fuel Band SE costs,
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.000]   you don't really get a whole lot of data.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.640]   So a lot of these other trackers
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.080]   will tell you your steps, your mileage, your heart rate,
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.280]   all this other stuff.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:53.000]   And Nike tried to do this thing called fuel points.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:53.480]   Right.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.040]   The problem with it.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:54.800]   I actually went--
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.000]   It wasn't real numbers.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:56.560]   I talked to them.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.720]   Yeah, they were like, no, how Weight Watchers started.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.720]   Weight Watchers points.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.880]   I was like, because nobody knew what calories were at that point.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.800]   But we know what steps are.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:04.680]   We know what miles are.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.000]   We know what calories are now.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.120]   You can't invent a new standard and hope that other people
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:09.320]   will know.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.040]   My question was, was that related to FDA issues, though?
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.680]   Like telling you exactly how many calories.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.120]   So it wasn't.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:15.640]   No.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:19.320]   So yeah, there is a fine line between what
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.800]   is something that needs to be FDA approved because it's
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.680]   considered a medical device.
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.720]   And it has to give you a diagnosis.
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.240]   OK.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.920]   I think the mistake that--
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.600]   Well, it seems like a mistake that Nike may have made
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.360]   is overlooking the importance of data in your fitness tracker.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.040]   Yes, these are neat little gadgets that we can wear.
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.400]   But really, the heart and soul of this
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:44.200]   is access to data and having that standard.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.720]   So know what steps walked are.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.480]   We know what miles are.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.760]   We know what calories are.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.400]   And that is what I really care about,
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.520]   is access to the data and how that can be--
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.600]   the value proposition is how this data can make my life better.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.640]   It is not having a gadget that is flashy,
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.800]   but isn't standard and doesn't work in a way
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.240]   that I would expect it to work.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.840]   I mean, I focus a lot on the software side, the app side,
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.320]   the usability of--
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.080]   because exactly what you're saying, Dan,
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.360]   is that if you don't understand all the data it's collecting,
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.960]   then there's no point in having that data.
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.960]   Right.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:22.760]   OK, so I bought the basis while you were talking.
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.320]   I'm getting it.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.800]   Another thing to lose.
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.520]   But it shares with everything else kind of this clunky, ugly form
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:30.600]   factor.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:34.040]   And I'm real thrilled to see that I can order even more ugly
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:34.560]   straps.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:39.400]   So that, I think, is part of the problem,
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:44.440]   is that while I see every geek I know wearing one of these,
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.240]   or maybe less so now, but for a while, everybody had a jawbone
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.960]   up, and they had a recall.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.000]   And then they had the Fitbit and all that.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   But I think that even the geeks are not wearing them as much
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:57.520]   anymore.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.400]   And I don't think I've ever seen a normal person.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.840]   But I wore my Nike feelband pretty religiously until I broke,
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.480]   and then I was like, oh, and then it was out of stock.
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.520]   No one buys another one.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.640]   And then I dropped out.
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:12.120]   And I guess the question is, of course,
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.960]   it's surprising that not all the smartwatches
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.440]   are just incorporating this into it.
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.080]   They're going to.
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.120]   They're going to, though.
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.800]   I mean, that's what's-- obviously, I've seen apples
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.600]   meetings that hurt about them at the FDA.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.920]   I mean, they're definitely thinking about it.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.420]   Yeah.
[00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.560]   And I had a chance to really test the Samsung Gear Fit.
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.080]   I thought it was--
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:26.960]   What did you think of that?
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.760]   That's the pretty one.
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.880]   It's curved.
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:29.720]   Yeah, it's curved.
[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.560]   It has this sort of rectangular shaped display.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.280]   And the display itself is beautiful.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.800]   The functions as a smartwatcher are pretty good.
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.160]   So you get notifications from your Android.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.280]   You can quickly text somebody back with a canned response
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.440]   that are all saved in there.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.760]   But if you're actually using it as a fitness tracker,
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.520]   it was not ideal, because that touchscreen on it
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.320]   was so sensitive that I found like if I'm moving around
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.920]   and I go to touch it, I had to stop what I was doing.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.000]   Sort of like the biaathlon.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.360]   You have to slow your heart rate
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.000]   and get your motor skills back.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.440]   So I found for that, it just didn't really
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.520]   have an active person in mind.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.480]   And you're an active person.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.480]   I'm a pretty active person.
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.920]   It'd be perfect for me, because I know I'll--
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.400]   now do you want that to be voice activated?
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.120]   Would that make it easier?
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.760]   Well, now we're starting to get into the idea of the true one
[00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.840]   wearable device.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.520]   And I think-- I mean, there's so much
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.320]   that I want to see out of that that we're not quite there yet.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.760]   I want to interact with it not really by voice,
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.480]   but I want to interact with it through passive gestures.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.160]   So there's some experimental pieces
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.760]   on the market that are coming to market soon anyway.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.320]   When I saw it CES that I really loved was called KiwiMove,
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.120]   it looks like nothing.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:42.400]   It looks like a little chip, a little box
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.840]   that you can wear on your lapel.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.040]   You can put it in your pocket.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.360]   But you can teach it to learn from your passive gestures.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.280]   So for example, every time I lean down to tie my shoes,
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.040]   activate my running sensors.
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.000]   So if you have a connected home, you have your doorway set up.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.400]   Every time I leave the door, lock my house or--
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.080]   How do you teach it?
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.680]   Does it say I notice you bend over a lot?
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.680]   What are you up to?
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:08.320]   Well, so the guys who are making it have an app--
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.200]   it's not out yet.
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.720]   I'm on their early list.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.080]   So I think it's going to be coming out in July or August.
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.520]   You would train it with this app.
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.520]   So you can do active gestures, too,
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.320]   and the one that they would show at CES was when I draw a music
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.400]   note in the air, that means--
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:23.800]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.160]   --monches-am.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.720]   Find out what song is playing, and then
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.320]   offer for me to buy it through my store of choice.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.480]   That's a little weird gesture.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.880]   But I guess you could have other gestures.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.400]   But it's neat because other people
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.640]   can't mimic your gestures because there's
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.680]   very specific things that humans do.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:43.040]   It's a wonderful pairing of humans and computers, I think.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:43.320]   Right.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.120]   I mean, Chad's a big, pueblo guy.
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.120]   I gave him my old pueblo because that's another one
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.760]   I got tired of, pretty quick.
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:49.920]   And that's a different category.
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.080]   So you've got, right now, a big division
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.280]   between the health stuff, like the Fitbit Force,
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.640]   and then the notification stuff, the phone extension,
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.360]   like the pebble.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.800]   And then I guess Samsung's kind of mixing a little bit of the two
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.440]   in together.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.000]   But what's interesting is the pebble also--
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.840]   Do you wish you had health features in the pebble?
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.520]   You can go install that from the store.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.000]   Oh, it does do that.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.680]   It does some stuff.
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.840]   So like RunKeeper is one of their most popular ones.
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.200]   It's basically just a predominant, or just like the other ones.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:23.240]   It's not doing any of the cool heart rate or skin temperature
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.080]   stuff, but it's still a pedometer.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.160]   And one thing that I got really excited about--
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:32.640]   I haven't tested yet-- is a sleep tracker.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.200]   And that's all built into the pebble because it's just
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.560]   a smartwatch at this point.
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.480]   That's why you don't get raises, by the way, Chad.
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.720]   I just give you my old crap.
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:41.200]   Right.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:41.560]   Exactly.
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:42.920]   That's kind of like a raise.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.800]   We think the whole movement of the--
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.520]   I didn't have 100 bucks on that pebble.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.200]   The wearable movement in general, there's a lot of stuff
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.880]   that I think we're going to jump over.
[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:55.040]   So I always talk about Google Glass.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.720]   And the problem is you're still looking at a screen.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:00.880]   And I think that's something we need to jump over.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.880]   What would you have instead?
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.200]   So like I was talking about passive gestures.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:05.880]   I think something--
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.240]   But you need a screen to read.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:07.560]   Right.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.120]   So eventually, you will look at your smartphone.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.880]   I think the smartphone is the thing that we're having to do.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:12.800]   Oh, you're not going to get rid of the smartphone.
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.560]   Well, but I think when you look at Google Glass,
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.160]   and then you look at the context of their building,
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.240]   it seems that they're probably Google Glass's kind
[00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.660]   of an early version of something that's
[00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.040]   going to be a lot more embedded into what we're doing.
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:25.160]   Yeah, I hope so.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.480]   And I think I have Google Glass.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.000]   And it's not something I wear every day.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.440]   I use it a lot for video.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.320]   So shooting videos and having that screen
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.320]   becomes super important.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.320]   There's a lot of other wearable devices
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.120]   that I can put on.
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.840]   And what I use it for a lot of times is instructions.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:42.960]   We have a lot of technical stuff.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.360]   And so I'm like, this is how you do this.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:45.520]   And this is what I--
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.880]   and send off a little video or capture it
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:48.560]   a little bit of moment.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.280]   And I can't do that with anything else.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.880]   I mean, like, effectively.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.600]   It sounds like you guys think that this
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.440]   is a fairly useful category.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:55.940]   I do.
[00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:56.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.720]   I wonder if there are market projections
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.600]   for the size of this market if it is only fitness-based
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.000]   versus if the value proposition comes from being
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.640]   able to do what Chad just described, which
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.600]   is install just like we do with our smartphones, things
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.560]   that do add utility to our life.
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:18.240]   And if we can, like Jill said, jump over that screen
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:22.600]   and really embrace something that adds value to our lives,
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.720]   then that market must be pretty massive, right?
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.800]   I think you guys have an overdeveloped imagination.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.400]   You're fantasizing about something that doesn't exist.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.600]   You agree, right?
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.760]   This is kind of-- well, someday this
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.560]   is going to be a useful category.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.200]   Right now, it's a pedometer.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.520]   Basically, it's a pedometer.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.600]   Because it does heart rate.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.720]   It gives you-- OK, maybe it's a pedometer plus heart rate.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.120]   Chad's watch says, hey, somebody's calling you, OK,
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.440]   but you still have to pull out the phone.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.360]   They're very-- a very limited use.
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.960]   And I think that's why they're not taking the market.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.240]   But I think the convergence--
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.520]   And the problem is that this is the elephant in the room,
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.360]   which is Apple.
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.880]   Like, well, is Apple going to do something
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.080]   as they have done in the past that puts this on the map?
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.680]   Or I think Apple doesn't have the mojo anymore.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.360]   But without Steve Jobs, I don't think they can--
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.560]   They have a lot of people working on it.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:11.560]   So it's--
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.000]   So presumably, they do something.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.880]   And I think there's three categories.
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:19.680]   There's the measure-- the quantified self-category.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:23.520]   There's the phone adjunct category.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.920]   And it's kind of part of quantified self.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.360]   But it's the more advanced quantified self
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:31.200]   that's the health category-- VO2 max or heart rate
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.920]   or blood pressure, that kind of thing.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.360]   A medical device.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.160]   So I think if you could make one--
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:38.680]   I don't know.
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.360]   Are you going to have one device that does all three?
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.120]   And then also understands it when you go like this.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.520]   I mean, what are we going to--
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.320]   Is that what you're fantasizing about here?
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.240]   Well, I mean, isn't that the beauty of tech
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.160]   is that we dream big.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.200]   And we think about the things that we would like to see.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.600]   And we would like to have in this wonderful, creative future.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.120]   And we get there slowly by--
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.040]   And we're very often--
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.040]   --like getting people involved.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.320]   Disappointed.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:00.800]   Sure.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:01.320]   Sure.
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.120]   Your heart gets broken a lot.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.960]   No, and I always think of my job
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:07.480]   as to be the skept-- the brutal skeptic.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.720]   And kind of like Devorak.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.000]   He taught me.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.720]   And say, yeah, this is all nice.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.840]   And I'll believe it when I see it.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:15.920]   I was very excited.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.400]   I still am a little bit about the Android wearable space.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.040]   Because we saw it completely fabricated--
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.000]   talk about imagination, demo.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.480]   For instance, this is the Moto 360.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.360]   They say they will sell this summer, which is basically
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.480]   Google Now on a circular screen.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.840]   And I don't understand the whole circular--
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:36.880]   I mean, I felt like it's very--
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:37.920]   So it looks like a watch.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.420]   I know.
[00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.080]   But I mean, we started making movies by shooting people
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:40.600]   on stage.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.560]   And then we realized we didn't need to stick to that--
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:45.880]   Well, I've yet to see something better.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:49.400]   Because the gear fit is weird, really.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.560]   It's a little longer.
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.480]   Kind of the oblong curve, but not to your wrist curve.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.480]   It's not flexible, right?
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.760]   It just kind of just hard to think.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:01.720]   Well, the watch face, as it were, part is not flexible.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.680]   The band is flexible.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.440]   The band is flexible.
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.160]   I like, frankly, the Nike Fuel Band,
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.200]   because it had the clock.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.560]   It fit my wrist.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.360]   Watch on myself.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.960]   Yeah, using that a lot, just by itself.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.480]   Because it had the basic information.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:15.480]   It was a lot.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.640]   And isn't there a little irony that we are now--
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:22.280]   done all this stuff in an era where people have stopped
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.160]   wearing watches entirely?
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.520]   I mean, nobody in your generation wears wrist watches.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.560]   Oh, I don't think that's true.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.060]   Really?
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:30.360]   Yeah, I don't think that's true at all.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.160]   But is it jewelry, or is it to tell a time, or--
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.160]   It's always those ones.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.280]   I mean, that's a big part of what I liked about the force,
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.200]   was I liked having the time on my wrist.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:38.640]   Oh, OK.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.840]   I didn't want to pull out my phone.
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.320]   Maybe we'll get young people wearing watches again.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.920]   How about pocket watches with fobs?
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.920]   No.
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:47.920]   That would be good.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.760]   You know, that's the other very exciting and wonderful thing
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.200]   about being journalists in the space,
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.680]   is that we can dream big and aspire for cool things,
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.960]   but we don't have to be cheerleaders.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.440]   And if and when this market collapses, then in a year or two,
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.640]   we have a fantastic story to keep talking about.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.960]   Why did this not take off?
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:02.520]   Well, God knows.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.080]   I spent a lot of time talking about it.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.280]   I know that.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.240]   But I also-- I don't know if I want
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.880]   to be a cheerleader for any technology.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.400]   Right.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.360]   I mean, I like science fiction.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.360]   We don't have to be.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.840]   I read science fiction a lot.
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.120]   I love the idea of pouring my brain into a machine
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.920]   so I never have to die.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.480]   But I'm not going to wait around until that happens.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.480]   All right, you've got some questions.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.600]   Oh, no, just one question.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.960]   We had one question that's very well-voted, and part of this.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.360]   This is from Christopher John in San Diego.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.600]   And he said, do you think Nike's back out of the fuel band
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.680]   has to do with them having an inside to the eye watch
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.080]   and working exclusively with Nike?
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.600]   They might, because J. Blonick, who was at Nike,
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.600]   is now an Apple employee.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.320]   But I will tell you what they said on Secret.
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.200]   Our new source for all things--
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.800]   Which, of course, Secret has to be tied into the watch.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.800]   You can secretly look down.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:53.680]   This was posted and not by one of my friends earlier this week.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.240]   Secret is the app on iPhone that
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.240]   allows you to share anonymously.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.880]   And it's really-- we've--
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.400]   It's addicting.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.440]   I have mixed feelings about it.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.920]   Do you post anything on it?
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.800]   I've posted once or twice.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.480]   Mostly, I just read and try to figure out
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.600]   which of my friends is doing that.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.400]   But this one was posted this week.
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.440]   The douchebag execs at Nike are going--
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.640]   and this came out before the story--
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.400]   are going to lay off a bunch of the engineering team who
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.760]   developed the fuel band and other Nike+ stuff,
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.680]   mostly because the execs committed gross negligence, wasted
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:29.440]   tons of money, and didn't know what they were doing.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.680]   It's bitter.
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.600]   Ouch.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.000]   And I have to say, because this came out before the story
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.960]   and then the story came out, I have to think maybe this
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.240]   is somebody on the inside who has a little information about it.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.480]   A lot of times on Secret, there's stuff that's made up.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.800]   And I shouldn't really even be quoting Secret at this point.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.560]   That's pretty lame.
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:47.880]   I'll tell you what's the new level of--
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.520]   First, it'll be a first time.
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.040]   But it might speak something to the problem.
[00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.000]   It's an internal problem.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:54.840]   It's a Nike problem.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.720]   It's a management problem rather than a problem
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.040]   with the category.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:58.540]   Yeah.
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:23:59.640]   That's the only reason I bring it up.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.240]   I definitely don't think it's a problem with the category.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.120]   I think the category just needs to find--
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.120]   Sounds like you guys agree on it.
[00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:04.880]   iPod.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:06.520]   It's like the iPod.
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.240]   There hasn't been an iPhone.
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.800]   Phones were horrible until the iPhone.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.240]   Can Apple do it again with the magic touch?
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.320]   I think we're going to find out this year if they can do it.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.360]   I don't know if they can or not.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.120]   But I think that this year is going to be the year to figure it
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:19.280]   out.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.920]   They're saying I should get a flavor-flave watch.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.040]   That would be awesome.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.240]   Hang around my neck.
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:26.760]   All right.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:27.440]   Hey, this is fun.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.000]   We got a lot more to talk about.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.400]   Jill Duffy is here from PC Magazine, Dan Patterson.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:35.080]   Digital journalist extraordinaire.
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:38.560]   Dan Patterson.com and Alex Lindsay from the Pixel Core.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.040]   Alex is our question master.
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.880]   If you have a question, and you're watching live,
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.800]   he still won't do any good to do this later.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:48.240]   bit.ly/twit.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.040]   454.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.640]   We'll get you into the question room.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.440]   You can vote up questions.
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.360]   I think this is a good idea.
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.320]   It's kind of fun.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.120]   It's working really well.
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.120]   Interesting.
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.000]   Afraid it would melt down with the number of people watching
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:24:59.520]   to it.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.280]   But so far, it seems to be holding up.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.760]   I'm answering some of the questions offline, and then people
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.240]   are answering them online.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:09.000]   And by the way, for Jill and Chad, just refresh your page.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.440]   You should see questions.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.760]   Did you all get in there?
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:13.800]   I did.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:14.320]   I did.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.840]   It's much moderating.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:20.760]   Woo hoo hoo hoo.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:30.360]   Atlassian is an Australian company that I really like.
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.720]   And it's like one of those companies that you've never heard of,
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:38.360]   but they're doing $200 million in annual sales because they help
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.160]   developers develop great products.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:45.960]   And I think we see these days that the project management is so important
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.960]   to the success of a product, to the security of a product,
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.280]   to the well-developed product.
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:57.440]   Atlassian's JIRA is the project management solution for teams
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:03.200]   that are not banning building and launching great products.
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.200]   It is a really neat company that is kind of snuck under the wire.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:13.720]   I want to tell you about JIRA because you can try it.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.680]   Forbes wrote Atlassian is to software as Apple is to design.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.400]   I like that.
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.400]   Atlassian-- and this is a little complicated.
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.760]   So if you're not a software developer, this may not make a lot of sense.
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.720]   But if you've ever worked on a team developing software,
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.760]   you will probably recognize the issues.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.840]   You would love to easily capture, organize, and prioritize your team's issues,
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.280]   tasks, features, and bugs.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.880]   Give that team a simple intuitive interface
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.680]   so you could collaborate in real time.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.160]   You could integrate all your planning documents wherever they are,
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.640]   your backlog, your issues, and your code repository.
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.840]   They've got great Git integration.
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:53.560]   Lows you to follow your code from development all the way through delivery.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:27:00.720]   They have REST API, so it was very easy to code your own tools to use with JIRA.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.560]   Everything from the planning doc, the files and chain sets, and the repository,
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.160]   all the way through to deployment.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:12.200]   You even have notifications via email, chat, app mentions, RSS.
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.600]   You can monitor streams of activity, self-updating reports and dashboards.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.360]   It's pretty sweet, pretty slick, pretty modern.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:23.320]   70% of the Fortune 100 use Atlassian JIRA.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.040]   NASA uses JIRA.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.480]   25,000 companies use JIRA.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.760]   If you haven't tried it, go to Atlassian.com/twit.
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.800]   For more information, monthly plans start very affordably,
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:37.440]   $10 a month for up to 10 users, and it's free for 30 days.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:45.520]   If you visit Atlassian, A-T-L-A-S-S-I-A-N.com/twit.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:51.320]   You're really thrilled to have Atlassian as part of the family.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:56.440]   I just loved this ad.
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:00.560]   I think this is it from an Australian marketing for engineers.
[00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:03.320]   I guess a billboard ad from Atlassian.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:15.480]   If your wife were in labor, we would think, and it's got the bash shell prompt, "Get push."
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:20.240]   It's kind of geeky.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.240]   Just like that.
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.240]   It's awesome.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:23.240]   You get it?
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.240]   No.
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.240]   All right.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.080]   Atlassian.com/twit.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:30.160]   Get push.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.480]   That's what geeks they are.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.520]   Let's see.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.520]   Let's move along.
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:37.800]   I guess we've talked about watches enough.
[00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.640]   Let's-- a little more Google news.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:44.800]   In fact, heart bleed news.
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:48.200]   Most of that we were talking last week, I thought a very interesting conversation.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:52.880]   If you missed it with Bruce Schneier about heart bleed, he had originally classified
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.160]   it 11 on a scale of 1 to 10 in terms of severity.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:01.240]   He says, "Not so bad as we thought."
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:06.000]   But I guess the patching process is a little slower than we might have liked.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.520]   He said, "Most of the big sites now have patched.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.800]   Most of the top 10,000, almost all of them."
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:14.680]   It's the next 10,000 that are not moving fast to patch.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.520]   But I'm just reading this blog post from Google on Wednesday.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.440]   It's a perfect example.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:25.240]   Google, which knew about heart bleed before anybody, they had a lot of advanced notice.
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:28.640]   They've patched most of the big services.
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:33.200]   Search Gmail, YouTube, Wallet Play, Apps, App Engine, AdWords, DoubleClick Maps, Maps
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.160]   Engine, Earth Analytics, Tag Manager.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:44.400]   But Cloud SQL, Google Compute Engine, Google Search Appliance, versions of Android.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.440]   There's still stuff.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:52.680]   It's hard to do, I guess, to fix it all.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:57.440]   The message that we've been passing along is wait till the service is updated and then
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.440]   change your password.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:02.640]   Have you gotten any emails from companies telling you to change your password?
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.640]   I've gotten only two.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.560]   Who have you gotten an email from?
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.920]   Tumbler and AnyDew, which is an app that you can use.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.920]   Yeah, me too.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:10.920]   I use AnyDew.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.440]   Tumbler maybe have been over aggressive.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:17.640]   They said, "Take the day off tomorrow and change all your passwords."
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.640]   There are some people saying that's a little bit over just because you had the problem.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:26.600]   Tumbler doesn't mean we did, for instance, my bank, Bank of America, did not use OpenSSL,
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.160]   so we didn't have to worry about that.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.960]   I think that, again, this comes up every time you see one of these things.
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.960]   The lesson is change your passwords off.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:35.960]   It's not a bad idea.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:36.960]   Don't use ones that are connected to you personally.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.440]   Use unique passwords on your side.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:42.680]   And really, whether you're using one password, we use LastPass.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:47.920]   What we like about LastPass is that, company-wide, I can share passwords for specific things
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.920]   with everyone.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:51.240]   I don't even have to show them what the password is.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:55.640]   I can simply give them the login for a specific site or whatever.
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:59.040]   Then I love just using almost everything now is all hashes.
[00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.800]   I just don't know anything about my passwords, which makes me a little dependent.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:08.440]   If I don't have LastPass, I'm in a little trouble.
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.320]   But I change them pretty often.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.480]   I think that's how most of us don't get ourselves in trouble.
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:19.760]   It's just using password or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or all the things that we think make it easier.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:24.280]   It's hard to get used to something like one password or LastPass, but once you start using
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.440]   something like that, it becomes...
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.440]   You have not gotten on.
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:29.440]   I don't even know what I was like before that.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:33.920]   I have to say, since I've really gotten into technology, that is the thing.
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:36.360]   I had no idea I was so passionate about it.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:40.400]   Once I started using a password manager, I really wanted to spread that message to the
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.160]   people in my life who are not technological.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:47.800]   I don't think they understand what password managers really do and how simple they make
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:53.840]   it to use the web and websites in general that require a login.
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:32:01.360]   If you are a tech evangelist, evangelist, there we go, go and tell everybody that you
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.200]   know to use a password manager and show them how easy it is because I think people have
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.200]   a misconception about what it is and what it is.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.200]   Now it is important.
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.200]   Oh, good.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.520]   Spreading the word, like you just said, may be one of the most important things to come
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.520]   from Harply.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.880]   Well, yes, there are things you can do.
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:19.480]   You can change your passwords, but really making more evangelists of normal people to
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.320]   say, "Look, change your passwords regularly.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:23.600]   Use a password manager.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:27.480]   This is why it makes the web easier to use and how your life will be better by simply
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.000]   doing these small steps."
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.800]   That's the best thing that can come from something like Harply.
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:35.040]   Now, the one thing I will say is that you do need to teach people a little bit about
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.040]   with great power comes great responsibility.
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:44.200]   For instance, we had to train people in our office to have it auto log off if it is not
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.880]   being used for a certain period of time, like LastPass.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:50.720]   Because now, if you leave it logged in, you walk away from a computer and now you literally
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.680]   every password in your whole life is opened.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:57.800]   So you do have to keep in mind that there is lots of little nuances to turning that on
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.960]   and off to make sure that you stay safe.
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.400]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:09.440]   You probably wouldn't want to do what this guy who reads the Washington Post did.
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:13.120]   This is from the Washington Post's The Switch blog.
[00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:19.200]   One of the Switch's readers posted in comments, "I couldn't give a flying fig about the heartbleed
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.520]   thing of a jig."
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.280]   Two years already, the thing's been running loose.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.920]   Not a word of somebody crying over its damage.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.440]   Say, "Does anyone really know it's origin?
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.840]   Russian crackers, Seattle high schoolers, the NSA, Yahoo's marketing department?"
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:35.040]   So he gave out his two passwords that he uses on all his accounts.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.720]   He said, "Read all the email I have.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.760]   Sneak into my Washington Post, New York Times, or CNN accounts.
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.400]   Go crazy making comments on my name.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.080]   Break into my Facebook or Twitter profiles.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.080]   Go ahead.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.080]   I don't care."
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.080]   And so what happened?
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.760]   His account on Tumblr, WordPress, Twitter, and Facebook all appeared to have been short
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:49.760]   dashes.
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.320]   It hacked almost immediately.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:34:00.720]   His location on Twitter now reads, "Gass City, Indiana."
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:05.360]   And people have been tweeting things like, "I am really stupid.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.560]   I am really stupid."
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:09.960]   Okay.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:13.120]   So maybe putting your password on a national news site.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.040]   Not such a good idea.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:18.960]   Our friends over at ITProTV have done a how-to.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:23.920]   I did a how-to last week, which is on our Twitch specials feed on how to use LastPass.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:28.040]   They've done a how-to on Heartbleed, how it is, how it works, how to fix it if you have
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:38.160]   a server that you might think is vulnerable.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:46.520]   So I'm going to give a little bitly link to this so you can get it.
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.440]   Ugh.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:50.440]   Link saved a few seconds.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.440]   How do I make a custom link?
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:54.720]   Just too much trouble.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:59.800]   You know, we have to-- we still have our own shortener somewhere.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:04.360]   Somewhere buried in the basement of our website.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:07.360]   There lives a shortener that should work.
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:12.040]   Let's see if this works.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.040]   Never mind.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.040]   Forget I mentioned it.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.040]   Google how-to.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.040]   Heartbleed.
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.040]   Yeah, ITProTV.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:20.040]   Tim Broom did it.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:23.760]   He's going to start doing some more help and how-to's for us because we want to do more
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.760]   of that.
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.560]   Thank you, Tim, for doing that.
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.320]   And don't folks give out your password.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.320]   I was just looking.
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.520]   You asked the question, Jill, and I think it's a good question.
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:33.520]   Did I get a lot of emails?
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.520]   I thought I did.
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.520]   I felt like he did, but you're right.
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.520]   It was Tumblr.
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:37.520]   And he did.
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.520]   It was a handful of them.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:39.520]   Dan, you acted like you got a bunch of them too.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:40.520]   Did you?
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.840]   Especially from actually Heroku, which I just saw out there.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:45.840]   Yeah, a ton.
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:51.480]   And I try to be in the best practice or use best practices with passwords and I've been
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.880]   using one password for years.
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:36:00.480]   Yeah, most of the sites that I use offer two-factor authentication and regular prompts
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.040]   to change passwords.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.760]   As far as we know, two-factor authentication was not affected.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:09.200]   Although I read an article the other day that implied that some people had had some issues
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.200]   with that.
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:16.520]   You're stealing the session token to lend a vulnerability, but that's not really the
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:17.520]   two-factor.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.520]   That's the session token.
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:19.520]   Right.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.520]   It's only good for a limited amount of time.
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:24.040]   The real issue is if you're using two-factor and your password's been compromised, you're
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.800]   really only using one factor.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:30.440]   So if you could have the idea to change your password still, then it would go back to two
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:31.440]   factors.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:39.880]   The bad guy knows one of them, then you need both of them.
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:40.880]   We'll Gmail blog.
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:43.480]   Actually, let me mention this real quickly.
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:44.480]   I can't remember.
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.720]   We didn't mention this last week, did we?
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:51.680]   I think we mentioned it on Twig that Google had changed its terms of service and privacy
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:55.320]   terms of service to admit, "Yeah, we're scanning your email."
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.520]   Like anybody didn't know that.
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:03.160]   But apparently it wasn't explicitly in the terms of service.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:05.400]   So they have updated their terms of service on Monday.
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:09.280]   I guess we didn't talk about it because it was this past Monday saying that, "Yeah, you're
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:15.960]   in-gumming and outgoing emails are automatically analyzed by software to create targeted ads."
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:23.640]   We think as in response to the various lawsuits against Google doing this.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:26.200]   They're being sued by a number of different groups.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:31.360]   The most of the U.S. is it mostly outside the U.S. that the law--
[00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:35.960]   No, there's two big lawsuits in the class action suits.
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:40.600]   People's argued users implicitly consented to the activity because they don't hide the
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:45.200]   fact that it's part of the process.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:49.880]   But now they're being a little bit more clear about they're doing it.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.720]   This is not-- are you surprised by this?
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:57.720]   No, it's a search company that's providing email.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:03.080]   I mean, I guess I kind of thought they might be doing it.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:08.520]   When Gmail rolled out that tabbed feature, did you keep it or did you get rid of it?
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.520]   I kept it.
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.520]   I love it.
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:11.680]   I immediately got rid of it.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:15.720]   You're an organizational expert and you got rid of it.
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:16.720]   I could stand it.
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.720]   Well, you had your own organization.
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:23.240]   Why would I give them an opportunity to start giving me more ads, more promotions, more
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.240]   newsletters, more--
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.880]   But it's all under a promotion tab.
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.280]   Yeah, I didn't want them.
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.280]   Then look what they do with my promotion tab now.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.280]   I was happy that they gave me the option to get rid of it.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.040]   They make it like Pinterest, see?
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.920]   If you had your promotion on tab, now all the promotional ads would look like Pinterest.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.480]   If it looks good, I'll keep it.
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.480]   Yeah, well, no.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.960]   But it's a tabbed so you don't have to look at it at all.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:42.640]   It's just like, I'm never going to go there.
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:47.400]   And now all my social stuff is in one tab.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:51.800]   When I request a password update, it always goes to update so I can always find it.
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:52.960]   Oh, look.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.520]   My order confirmation for my new basis wristwatch.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:56.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:56.520 --> 00:39:01.240]   You know, I've been using filters and labels obsessively within Gmail for years.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:04.120]   And that actually made that four tabs across the top very, very useful.
[00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:08.160]   Because you know, you set this, just get in the habit of doing this and training Gmail
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.480]   for say a month.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:13.000]   Just say, I'm going to label and filter everything for a month.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.760]   And then all of a sudden, I only see the email that is important to me.
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.520]   And I only get what I care about.
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.880]   Those other tabs really filter away the noise, especially during the day.
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:24.840]   And you know, it's a little bit of sweat going into it.
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:29.440]   But you know, a month or so of training Gmail and all of a sudden you'd be-- I live it in
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.440]   Box Zero.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:30.960]   It's wonderful.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.520]   You know what I do is I set up my theory about this a while ago.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:37.760]   So I use three different email-- well, I probably have like five different email programs.
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.600]   But I use three mainly.
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.920]   One is for my personal mail.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.840]   One is for all of the shopping that I do.
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:43.840]   And one is--
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.840]   --like junk sign up.
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:50.040]   So then what happens is instead of having a tab, I have an entire other account that
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.560]   I'm not tempted to even log into.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.560]   And that's why I have to find--
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.560]   How's your notes for the job?
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.560]   --or unless I want something there.
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:56.560]   Right.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.560]   Right.
[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.560]   So I compartmentalize, but I just do it in a very, very different way.
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.440]   It does the same thing.
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.600]   Do you feel like-- because it's sitting there, you're going to look at it?
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:08.000]   And especially like anything that has a badge count on it gives me anxiety.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.480]   Like I need to clear that badge.
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.800]   There's 300 new promotions.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.360]   Well, you're an-- see, that's the thing.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:17.560]   I think somebody who's an organizational expert is less likely to like the automated
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.560]   kind of one-size-fits-all organization that Google imposes.
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.040]   But I'm not an organizational expert.
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.040]   I suck.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:26.040]   So I'm very happy that Google gave me any tools at all.
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.040]   They did it for you.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:31.640]   And for me, I have 50 or 60 folders with a couple hundred rules.
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.640]   Yeah, you're like, "Yes, it's all--"
[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.760]   So I don't have like inbox zero.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.280]   I have inbox 26,000 because if it didn't get--
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.280]   32,800, 15.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:44.600]   That's like the refuse of what didn't get into the folders, which is all the important
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.600]   stuff.
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:49.400]   And so I go through inbox every day, kind of wander through it to see if I miss anything.
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.440]   And I occasionally do.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:55.760]   But there's a lot of-- but I literally get 400 actionable emails a day.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.080]   I can't-- I mean, I just get through his messages.
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:00.400]   Email's so broken, it's unusable.
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.400]   Right?
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:05.960]   I thought that when my kids had moved away from email and they really just expect text,
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.760]   I thought, I don't know how anyone could live that way.
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:11.400]   And now I find myself forcing my company more and more to-- like, if you want to contact
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.400]   me, text me.
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.320]   Can I put a question in there?
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.320]   Question.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:18.720]   Is email screwed up and unusable?
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:20.200]   Yes or no?
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.600]   And that should be in our question.
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:25.000]   Because it just seems like-- and unfortunately, you cannot abandon it.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.040]   That's the only way-- you know, I buy a watch and I want to know how else they're going
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.040]   to get a hold of me, right?
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:34.600]   There's a lot of companies who are trying this new push now to get rid of internal email
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:35.760]   by a certain date.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:36.760]   I think that's great.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:41.160]   I think if you can foster communication among your employees in-house, get them to talk
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:44.800]   to one another, get them to use something like, you know, maybe an instant messenger
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:50.280]   system or a SANA, which is kind of like a project management tool, some other way where
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:55.240]   they can have a clear idea of what they're doing day to day, who's responsible for it.
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:59.200]   You know, all these things that email doesn't really give you and then you save email for
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.640]   external communication only.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.120]   I think that's great.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:07.760]   Last week, the internet went crazy because Walker published a story saying that France
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:14.560]   had banned email after 6 p.m. that companies could not require employees to read their
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.120]   email after 6 p.m.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.000]   And it turned out not to be true.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.280]   It's much more complicated than that.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.880]   But I think everybody wanted it to be true and thought, well, some people thought, "Ah,
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.440]   that's France again, and again."
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:27.000]   But most people thought, "What a good idea.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.800]   Can we do that here?"
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:33.360]   I didn't think that, but I definitely, last week was a pretty heavy production schedule
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:37.400]   for me and I was in Coachella and everything, you know, shooting and didn't check email
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.560]   for three or four days.
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:43.640]   And I realized how calm I was and I was thinking, "Oh, maybe I should do this more often."
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.520]   The deal cited by the Guardian is not a formal law.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:48.800]   It did not affect a million employees.
[00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:53.440]   It doesn't even specify a specific time.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:58.880]   But two groups of employers last week cited an agreement with French unions outlining
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:04.480]   certain workers' obligation to disconnect.
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:13.480]   The obligation to disconnect applied to a smaller group of workers, flexible hour workers,
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:19.000]   workers that could work more than 35, the mandated 35-hour work week or 10-hour a day
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   limit.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:27.960]   What we call exempt workers in the US, and it's basically an acknowledgement that because
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:33.840]   they're always on the clock, they have a minimum daily rest period of 11 hours, which is to
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:38.480]   say they can work legally no more than 13 hours a day.
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:39.480]   But after that time...
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:40.480]   That's our minimum.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.480]   No, he can't write.
[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:42.480]   That's how we start.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:45.480]   You know, we sometimes give you Sunday off.
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:52.040]   But at this, I also underlines another problem with email, which is you're always in the
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.480]   smartphone and texting.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.480]   You're always connected.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.480]   You're always working.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:59.240]   Even if you're a nine to five employee, there's nothing to stop the boss from texting you
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:03.360]   at 5 a.m. saying, "Hey, smithers, pick up a paper on your way in."
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.920]   But I think in a lot of ways, technology is putting us in a position where we have to
[00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:11.400]   make lots of choices, whether it's choose what we eat, choose whether we're going to pick
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:15.240]   up the phone, choose whether it picked up our email, choose whether...
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:16.240]   We have to choose.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:19.800]   It's no longer that it just isn't available.
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.280]   We have to make choices about what those limits are.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.760]   Well, and I'm sure Dan will remind us that there are certain job functions where you're
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:26.760]   never off.
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:30.520]   If you're reporting from the field, if you're reporting abroad, that's your job is to be
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:32.160]   on all the time.
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.160]   You chose this.
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:35.120]   And it becomes global.
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:39.360]   When I'm in Rwanda, I get up and I finish the emails at six o'clock in the morning until
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.440]   730, I get all the emails I missed.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:44.520]   Then I'm at school until eight o'clock at night.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:49.160]   And then from eight to midnight, I'm on meetings with people in the US.
[00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:50.680]   And then I started over again.
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:52.320]   And so those are the hardest weeks.
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:57.360]   But we're becoming much more global where you really just have to decide when you're
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:01.360]   going to turn off because there's not going to be any turn off otherwise.
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:06.320]   That's a very interesting idea that whether you love or hate technology or somewhere in
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:12.040]   that golf in between, that you have no choice but to have technology as a part of your life.
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:16.240]   So the degree to which you want to interact with it, you cannot just be passive and say,
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:17.240]   oh, this washes over me.
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:21.080]   I don't want to watch TV or I don't want to listen to the radio.
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:23.200]   It's not like that.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:24.520]   You must make a decision.
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.680]   It's not something that is passive in our lives.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:33.640]   And if you hate technology, then making that decision probably increases your resentment
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.880]   of technology.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:39.480]   You two are from New York, the people here to my right.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:44.200]   Google, I think the tech scene in New York starting to pick up a little bit.
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.240]   It's like a big startup scene, right?
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:49.920]   Google's just announced that it's going to hire, it's going to have launching a search
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:53.800]   for space for 3,000 more employees.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:58.760]   Looking at leasing as much as 600,000 square feet in Manhattan.
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:00.560]   They already have a beautiful office.
[00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:01.560]   They do amazing.
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:02.560]   I've seen the pictures.
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.560]   It's great office.
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.560]   They're like slides and stuff, right?
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:07.880]   That's how I pay attention to it.
[00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:08.880]   Jungle gyms.
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:09.880]   I don't know.
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:11.640]   The only slide I know of is a mountain view.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.480]   They've been closed, I think.
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.080]   There's a pole in the YouTube space.
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:16.520]   They're in Chelsea right now, which is...
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:21.520]   Chelsea's kind of like a hipster-down market little bit hipster area.
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.520]   It's expensive.
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:23.520]   It's expensive.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.520]   It's expensive now?
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:29.080]   Well, isn't that where you're sitting, Nancy, at the Chelsea Hotel?
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:32.360]   I think you're in the raw deck, dude.
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:33.960]   So it's not fancy now?
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:37.960]   It's no longer like where the heroin addict superstars hang out.
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:38.960]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:39.960]   No, no, no.
[00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:40.960]   Not at all.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:41.960]   That's pretty fruit for a lot of good enough.
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:46.000]   They have 750,000 square feet in Chelsea on 8th Avenue.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   Well, they don't go to the building.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.240]   They bought the building in 2010 for 1.9 billion, and then on 9th Avenue in the Chelsea
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:53.240]   market.
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:55.240]   But they've run out of space.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:56.240]   We're going to find...
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.240]   Yeah, we're going to find more.
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:58.800]   Welcome to New York City Google.
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:46:59.800]   Searching for space.
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:00.800]   Good.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.800]   You know, you can have the Google buses.
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:06.320]   Let the protesters vomit on your buses for a change.
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:07.840]   We won't be able to tell the difference.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:09.840]   That's the thing.
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.280]   New York's probably going, "Yeah, come on.
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.280]   We'll figure it.
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:13.280]   We'll find somewhere."
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:14.280]   We'll just keep building up.
[00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:17.240]   We'll just go higher.
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:25.960]   Tech advertising and media jobs in New York City have grown from 265,000 in 2006 to 327,000.
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.880]   It is boom.
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:31.760]   If San Francisco keeps acting nasty to the tech sector, it could be bigger boomers.
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:40.840]   But I think it's natural to go to a lot of these big cities, but I start looking for
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.240]   a lot of people that I know.
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:47.840]   What we really care about is being clean and having a really good connection.
[00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:50.880]   And I think that a lot of internet connection.
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:53.080]   When I took a subway, it's like internet connection.
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:54.080]   I'm talking about internet connection.
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.240]   I hate train internet connection.
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:01.040]   I mean, I found myself, and I think it's very hard to make the turn, but we did a job
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.960]   in Oklahoma City.
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:10.120]   I was talking to a guy in a bar, and I said, "Canvas City has a Google 5 Oklahoma."
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:13.440]   It was Kansas City, but it was in Oklahoma.
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:15.240]   No, Kansas City is not in Oklahoma.
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.240]   It is.
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:17.240]   It's in two states.
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:18.240]   It's in two states.
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.240]   It's in two states.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.240]   It is.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.240]   So anyway, it's very confusing.
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:26.400]   Why can't we just tell you a message?
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:28.640]   Which Kansas City is Googling?
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:29.640]   Oklahoma.
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:30.640]   Okay.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:31.640]   So it's not Oklahoma.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:34.040]   I don't know where they're getting in Oklahoma.
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.240]   It's called Missouri.
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:36.240]   Have you heard of it?
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.240]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:38.240]   Oklahoma.
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.240]   So I'm Missouri.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.240]   I apologize.
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.240]   It's been a long week.
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:43.240]   I just got back for Brazil on Friday.
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.240]   I'm not stupid.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:48.240]   I know that the Kansas City, Kansas is not the Kansas City.
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:49.240]   I understand.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.240]   In Missouri.
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.240]   But you didn't know about the one in Oklahoma.
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:52.240]   But I never heard of the Kansas City.
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:53.240]   That's the one I just found here.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.240]   And there's a lot of people now.
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:56.040]   In Missouri, they're very upset with me.
[00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:58.040]   So it's Kansas City, Missouri.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:00.440]   And you guys both sounded like, "Oh, no.
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:01.440]   That's in Oklahoma."
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:03.440]   No, we just knew it wasn't Kansas City, Kansas.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:04.640]   I just know it's not Kansas.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:05.640]   It's somewhere else.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.840]   So anyway, but the, I was asking the guy to borrow.
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:10.520]   I was like, "So do you really get a gigabit at home?"
[00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:11.520]   "Nuzzi?"
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:12.520]   He said, "Oh, you never get under.
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:14.160]   You never get over 930 megs."
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:16.160]   "Oh, I hate it when that happens."
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:19.840]   I'm just like, and he goes, "That's only speed test to Google."
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:25.320]   But after that, I was like, "Oh, I wonder if we get open in office."
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:29.880]   And so for me, I think that when you look at a lot of these protests we see in San Francisco
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:34.280]   and when you look at the stuff that we're, you know, being upset, I wonder when these
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:37.640]   companies start deciding we're just going to find somewhere that's cheap, give it a
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:38.640]   great connection.
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:41.600]   I think Petaluma could use a little fiber, a little fiber love.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:42.600]   We love it up here.
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:43.600]   I think Petaluma would be great.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:44.600]   Have you been here, Dan?
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.120]   Oh, look, I used to live in Sebastian years.
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:48.120]   Oh, that's right.
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.120]   You're a hippie.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:52.880]   But I think a lot of those decisions are mostly based on infrastructure is who owns
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:56.560]   the pipes and who owns the, and how hard it will be to run the fiber.
[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:59.680]   And it has less to do with people being interested and more to do with how the city has set
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:00.680]   up its infrastructure.
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:04.600]   Oh, I know what you guys, you were thinking about Virginia City, Nebraska.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:05.600]   That's what you were thinking.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:06.600]   I wasn't thinking about anything.
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:08.400]   I was still waking up.
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:09.600]   I don't want the Google island.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:12.600]   That's what I want.
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:15.040]   Yes, exactly.
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.800]   We have a, you want another one of these?
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:17.800]   Yeah, more questions.
[00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:19.560]   Yeah, we've got from Steve in Florida.
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:22.880]   He said, "Are you going to comment on Adam Corolla's patent role fight?"
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:23.880]   No.
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:24.880]   No, there we go.
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:25.880]   All right, moving on.
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:26.880]   There we go.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:29.680]   I have, under the advice of my attorneys.
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:35.280]   Oh, you got to say, I have been advised not to talk about that.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:40.560]   But we support and love Adam and support and his fight.
[00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:43.760]   And I know so many things that I cannot say.
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:46.200]   You hear that?
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:53.680]   You hear Lisa going, by the way, that I will say that the, this American life on Patrons
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:59.560]   is two, two-parter and those are, this American life is must listen to in general, but those
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:00.560]   two are particularly good.
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:04.960]   And then also the money podcast that the NPR does.
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:05.960]   Market Watch.
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:06.960]   Planet Money.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:09.240]   Planet Money does a very good one on patent rolling as well.
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:15.240]   I am hopeful that all kinds of patent rolling are going to go away because there's a moving
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:19.040]   Congress to kind of restrict software patents.
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:23.480]   There's an executive order to change that as well from the Obama administration.
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:27.960]   I just, I feel like we're kind of, we're understanding the problem that these software
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:29.760]   patents lead to.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:34.600]   So regardless of my own dog and the hunt, and I do have a little bit of a dog and I
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:37.560]   think that it's bad in general.
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:41.360]   And I hope that things are going to look up.
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:48.080]   Intellectual Ventures, which is Nathan Miervold's company, is one of the worst in this group.
[00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:54.200]   And they were putting together a group of, I think, who joined it?
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:57.360]   Was it Yahoo?
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:00.920]   They're trying to create another patent fight.
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:03.720]   And I'm just dimly remember this story.
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:10.160]   Microsoft is investing and Sony is investing, but Apple and Intel did not.
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:18.760]   This was a story that ran on TNT this week or maybe last week.
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:21.600]   Intellectual Ventures, which was started by a Microsoft millionaire, Nathan Miervold.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:28.880]   A guy who really was pro innovation, but basically it was created to be a patent troll, to collect
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:33.480]   patents for things they didn't do, they didn't invent, and sue people or license them if
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:36.800]   they can and if not to sue them.
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:46.200]   Microsoft and Sony have invested in this intellectual Ventures effort to raise more money to buy
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:47.600]   some new patents.
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:49.600]   Good news, Apple and Intel turned him down.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:54.400]   So it's an interesting story and there's Nathan pretending to be a chef apparently.
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.200]   Oh, he went to cooking school.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.200]   Yes, he did.
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:58.200]   He is so phenomenal.
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:59.800]   He's one of the most phenomenal people ever.
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:02.080]   I mean, he's like- He's brilliant.
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:04.400]   He's found archeological- I know.
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.520]   And what's he doing with his patent troll stuff?
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:07.520]   Nathan, not at all.
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:08.520]   He's making him money.
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:11.600]   Those patentals pay for all the other crazy stuff that he does, like make really, really
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:14.160]   expensive cookbooks that cut things in his- Oh, that's right.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.160]   Isn't that his book?
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:17.160]   Yeah.
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:18.640]   They cut the charcoal thing in half and they take the trip.
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:19.640]   Yeah, that's a beautiful book.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:20.640]   It's cool.
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:21.640]   I don't care.
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:26.160]   I'm not supporting Nathan in any of his Ventures unless he knocks it off with the patent, with
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:28.680]   intellectual Ventures in the patent trolling.
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.240]   It's called Modernist Cuisine.
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.760]   Oh, it's sous vide.
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:32.760]   That's why he has like it.
[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:33.760]   There's a piece of it.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.760]   There's a piece of it, the sous vide.
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:35.760]   There's a whole history of book.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:36.760]   There's a whole history of book.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:37.760]   Like Alex Oobene.
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.760]   Yeah, photos in this- $468.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:41.760]   What is he eating in patent?
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:42.760]   It's gone down.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:45.760]   It's like seven or eight volumes of it.
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:50.120]   Yeah, it's the best book on cooking ever written.
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:51.640]   It better be at that price.
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:53.840]   Or collection of books.
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:54.840]   It's pretty- It's pretty-
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:55.840]   This guy have enough money.
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:57.760]   He has to charge 500 bucks for a book.
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:58.760]   When you see it, you'll understand it.
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:00.760]   It's a 20 person team at the Cooking Lab.
[00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:04.760]   I believe they built a lab specifically to shoot this book.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:05.760]   Yeah.
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:08.760]   This is like cooking book you've never seen before.
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.320]   See, now you're going to make me buy that.
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:13.480]   This is the most expensive show I've ever done.
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:14.720]   Let's take a break.
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:21.480]   I maybe need to make somebody so I can buy a $500 cookbook.
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:25.160]   So I have mixed feelings about Nathan Mirval because on the one hand, he's this brilliant
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:28.240]   guy who's done some amazing things.
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:35.800]   And yet, he's at the same time he's causing a huge havoc in the world with intellectual
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:36.800]   ventures.
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:37.800]   Come on, there's-
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:41.040]   And they're doing sleazy stuff like they're making small holding companies and they're
[00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:44.480]   hiding the fact that they're behind it and they're just sleazy stuff.
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:46.440]   And the tactics kind of betray their intent.
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:48.440]   Right.
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:50.400]   They're very much a part of this-
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:51.880]   Well, part of it is that we've brought-
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:54.560]   This American Life podcast, they talked a lot about intellectual ventures.
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:58.840]   And part of it is that we've allowed it to get much past the patent system to go much
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:01.640]   past what it was originally, how it was set up, how it was set up.
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.520]   It actually worked very well.
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:08.280]   And then we just kept on making it, you know, making compromises to a point where it doesn't
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:09.840]   work anymore.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:16.200]   No, no, oh, he also has a $100 book on the photography of the cookbook.
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:22.800]   So if he's not enough just to buy the cookbook, oh, I want that too.
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:24.560]   You have the other one, the modernist cookbook?
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:25.880]   No, I'm still waiting for someone to give it to me.
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:27.840]   Oh, I've only looked at it in the book for you.
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:32.320]   You should put it on your Amazon wish list, maybe a fan will get it for you.
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:35.360]   A $100 photography of modern.
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:36.360]   So-
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:38.720]   I'll take a look at this.
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:39.720]   He also-
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:42.720]   Go into New York Academy of Sciences when this book came out and Nathan Mirvold was there
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:43.920]   with Padma Lakshmi.
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:47.400]   So the most brilliant man you've ever met standing next to a supermodel and I kind of
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:50.480]   got ushered into a conversation with them for about five seconds.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.480]   Wow.
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:55.560]   I'm looking up at her and I'm looking down at him.
[00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:59.120]   But he's really, I would say in person, he was very soft-spoken.
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:00.560]   He was very inquisitive.
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:06.200]   He was not like an egomaniac by any stretch, but he really knows so much about everything.
[00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:07.760]   And I don't know.
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:09.680]   I mean, he figured out a way to make money.
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:11.640]   It was a loophole.
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:12.640]   He's not doing anything illegal.
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:15.040]   He's taking advantage of the patent system as it exists.
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:18.200]   So I guess in that regard, but it isn't ethical.
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:21.560]   And it has a huge consequence, depressing innovation.
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:27.000]   And you know, here's a guy who made his money as a software scientist, as an innovator at
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.160]   Microsoft.
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:34.320]   And he's doing something that is really terrible for innovation, draining billions of dollars
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:38.120]   from R&D efforts to go to lawyers in court.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:39.040]   And it's wrong.
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:42.200]   And I- so whether it's legal or not, it's wrong.
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:44.040]   And so I- boy, this is an interesting fellow.
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:46.680]   You got to wonder about the contradictions of this guy.
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:48.680]   And I just like to stay home and cook.
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:52.320]   And I'm just going to start a company and I just won't pay any attention.
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:56.400]   But I think, you know, it's the job of Congress to fix it.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.400]   You know, the course to fix it.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.400]   I mean, when someone's taking advantage-
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:00.400]   But it's still a lot.
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:01.400]   They do.
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:02.400]   They do.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.400]   They're all for him to be taken advantage.
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:06.240]   I don't disagree, but I think that the solution is not going to be to get people like him
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:07.240]   to stop.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:09.520]   The solution is going to be to rebuild the patents.
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:13.680]   By the way, if you don't want to pay $500 for the cookbook or $100 for the photographs from
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:17.680]   the cookbook for a mere $100, you can get the home version of the cook.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:18.680]   There you go.
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:19.680]   There you go.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:21.560]   And all three- this is kind of a deal here, Amazon.
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:22.560]   All three for $677.
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:27.440]   It's like Microsoft pricing, right?
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:29.720]   But they're not going to update it after next week.
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:30.720]   That's so true.
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:37.320]   Hey, by the way, did you see Microsoft says, if you got Windows 8.1, we're going to not-
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:40.880]   we're not going to give you security patches anymore after next month.
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:41.880]   What?
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:42.880]   Oh, this-
[00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:43.880]   Why?
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:47.440]   Let's save that for the break.
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:50.120]   That is- I mean, I was all hot.
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:51.160]   I was all excited.
[00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:54.160]   I was reinvigorated about the future of Microsoft.
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:58.880]   And then I read that and I thought, oh, it's not changing that much.
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:06.480]   Our show brought to you by audible.com, the great source of audio books, radio shows,
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:10.720]   classics, nonfiction, science fiction.
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.680]   Just love audible books.
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:13.840]   I'm a major audible fan.
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:17.360]   I've been listening to audible since the beginning of the century.
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:22.600]   I like saying that since 2001 because I had a terrible commute.
[00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:26.320]   Gabriel Garcia Marquez passed away this week, very sad.
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:28.220]   But of course, audible has his books.
[00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:30.520]   If you've been thinking, gosh, I never read any Marquez.
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:34.320]   I want to read some.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:38.000]   They've got them all and beautiful, beautiful narration.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.640]   I listened to love in the time of cholera, which is one of my favorite books.
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:43.360]   I'd read it, but I listened to it on Audible.
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:45.040]   And it's just gorgeous.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:49.200]   If you haven't read that or 100 years of solitude, you must- you can get one of them
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:52.040]   or both for free right now.

[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:09.760]   But the first month is free, so your first two books are free.
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:11.360]   Pay nothing in the first 30 days.

[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:19.880]   when you get a subscription plan.
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.520]   Maybe some Marquez.
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:23.880]   Or is that two obstrues, two literary?
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:27.320]   Perhaps you'd like to have some fun.
[00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:32.280]   You could listen to the wind in the willows or the new Daniel Suarez.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:34.200]   We've talked about that before.
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:36.640]   This is a page turner.
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:39.840]   Jeff Gurner, we had him on triangulation with Daniel.
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:42.400]   He reads it so beautifully.
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:44.720]   Audible's done a great job with science fiction.
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:49.960]   Mark Cintovich, if you haven't read "Zero Day" yet, Mark Cintovich is a Microsoft researcher,
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:51.480]   security expert.
[00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:56.080]   He wrote this novel a couple of years ago and it's basically come true.
[00:59:56.080 --> 01:00:04.960]   It is about a terrifying story of technology and security.
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.200]   If you're a geek, you're going to love it.
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:09.800]   Steve Gibson just raves about Mark's books.
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:14.080]   "Zero Day" and then the new one I think is coming out soon.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:17.360]   It's not an audible yet, but it will be any day now.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:21.880]   The new one, "Trojan Horse", "Zero Day" and the third just came out or is about to come
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:24.240]   out any minute now from Mark Cintovich.
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:25.240]   Get those.
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:33.720]   All you got to do is go to audible.com/twit2audible.com and you'll be getting two books to try it out.
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:38.640]   If you've never listened to audiobooks, this is a great opportunity to try them and listen.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:39.640]   I love them.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:42.920]   Listen all the time and highly recommend it.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:44.920]   I love to dogfight right now.
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:46.320]   That's how I clean my house.
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:47.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:48.320]   I listen to a...
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:49.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.720]   I run out of twit and then I run out of an NPR and then I just move to Audible and then
[01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:55.600]   I'm just listening to some book and working my way through the yard in the back and everything
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:56.600]   else.
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:01:01.960]   If you have a treadmill and you listen an hour a day on your treadmill, life will change
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.960]   for you.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.400]   There's so many good books here.
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.560]   The Terry Pratchett's newest just came out.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.600]   I'm a big fan of the Discworld series.
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:13.320]   I got to the point where I take a fence to the fact that there's some books that are...
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:16.240]   When I find out they're not an audible, I'm like, "Why are you?"
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.720]   I'm a little behind.
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:19.960]   That's where I take a fence to.
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:22.000]   I don't community more, so I'm actually behind.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.800]   I just got Leviathan wakes and flashboys and new Michael Lewis.
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:25.800]   I can't wait to read that.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:31.560]   When I'm finishing dogfight, there's a new 43-hour biography of the Beatles that just
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.480]   came out and that's volume one.
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:35.320]   Holy smokes.
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.720]   I can't wait to read that.
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.080]   Nick Bilton's, "Hey, I had you Twitter.
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:39.080]   Just finished that."
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.880]   Brad Stone's the Everything Store.
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.280]   I mean, these are all...
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:43.920]   I'm behind.
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:49.920]   I got more listening, less working, more working out, less working.
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:57.440]   Audible.com/twit2, the first two books are free, and then the rest of it, it's up to you.
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:01.640]   Yeah, I saw this and I thought this was a very strange story.
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:09.040]   Apparently, Microsoft wants you to move along on Windows 8.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:13.480]   Windows 8.1 came out a few months ago, I think.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:14.480]   Maybe...
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.480]   How did it come out?
[01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.480]   Help me out, Jack.
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:22.360]   Six months ago and really fixed a lot of the issues with Windows 8.
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:26.880]   Then they did an update just recently, Windows 8.1 update.
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:27.880]   One.
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:35.880]   Well, apparently, they're so anxious that you apply Windows 8 update that starting with
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:42.360]   the May patch Tuesday, Windows 8.1 users devices without the update installed will no longer
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:43.840]   receive security updates.
[01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:47.480]   This is from Microsoft's TechNet blog.
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:54.040]   No more updates for Windows 8.1 if you don't apply update one.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:03:01.160]   You're being nagged by now a little bit about update 8 to the 8.1 and you have a few weeks
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.160]   to install it.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:05.080]   But that just bizarre to me.
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:10.800]   They will support 8.0, but if you have 8.1, you've got to get update one.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:15.080]   It makes me wonder whether there's something they don't want to deal with there.
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:19.880]   It says if the Windows 8.1 update is not installed, newer updates will be considered not applicable.
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:22.640]   There's something deeper in there that they don't want to talk about, but they don't
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:23.640]   want to...
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:25.520]   That's what it feels like, is that there's something...
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:28.920]   Because it's not like they're not supporting other more historical ones, but there's something
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:31.040]   that's going farther back, yeah, absolutely.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:38.840]   So it seems like what a confusing way to coax your audience along now.
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:39.840]   Microsoft confusing?
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:40.840]   Never shocking.
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:47.840]   I've been bullish after Satya Nadella and I just bought a Windows phone because I can
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:51.760]   make it Windows Phone 8.1 and I'm really impressed with it.
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.720]   They've added the Cortana speech.
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:04:00.560]   They've added the swipe keyboard style that I really like.
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:04.280]   And I think that they're giving away Windows for sub nine inch screens.
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.800]   They're doing a lot of things right.
[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:09.360]   Windows 365 is now what...
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:11.240]   You get the personal edition for seven bucks a month.
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:12.240]   And they may be doing this right.
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.920]   We just may not know all the reasons that they're doing this.
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:14.920]   Maybe they have to.
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:15.920]   This is my...
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:16.920]   You're the voice of reason.
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:17.920]   Thank you very much Alex.
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:21.040]   It seems it seems logical that they're doing it other than there's something seriously wrong
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.760]   with that and they cannot...
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:25.880]   They don't want to advertise whatever that is, but they definitely don't want to keep
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:26.880]   it in the wild.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:27.880]   Right.
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:32.520]   One of the problems with Microsoft very obviously is that it became a conglomeration of different
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.520]   silos.
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:37.480]   Silos moved to different speeds, different priorities within the company.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:42.240]   And it's going to take a long time to kind of recombine the incongruencies there and
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:47.280]   get, you know, not just a product, but a culture that has shifted entirely.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:51.760]   So seeing Windows one update one dot x dot monkeys is...
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:54.320]   We're probably going to see that for a while, right?
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:55.320]   You don't know.
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:56.320]   We'll talk about it.
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:00.560]   I'll tell you what, Windows Weekly Wednesday will be very interesting both about Mary Jo Foley.
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:01.560]   I wouldn't put that.
[01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:02.560]   I'm going to say, "Okay."
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:05.160]   Sometimes I'll say to that.
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.160]   I'll say, "Paul, that's a pulp."
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.160]   Okay.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.160]   Explain to me what the hell is Microsoft thinking?
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.160]   He'll go, "What are you asking me for?"
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.160]   I don't know.
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:15.640]   I was about to buy a new car because I wanted to get the Apple's CarPlay, but I don't have
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:16.640]   to now.
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:21.040]   I can get an Alpine or Pioneer aftermarket.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:27.200]   Both companies have announced they will be making a third party aftermarket in dash
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.520]   systems that work with CarPlay.
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:29.520]   I think it's awesome.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:35.240]   I haven't bought an aftermarket car system for so long.
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:38.960]   I had a when I was in college, I had a Nakamechee.
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:45.000]   Normally, you'd have to buy a 2014 Ferrari, Mercedes Benz or Volvo.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.920]   But now you can put it in your Hyundai.
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:53.440]   It uses, believe it or not, not iOS, but QNX.
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.440]   Really?
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:59.480]   Well, CarPlay can be added to existing systems as the technology works in conjunction with
[01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:02.160]   BlackBerry's QNX.
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.640]   My car has QNX.
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:05.720]   A lot of cars have QNX as the operating system.
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:10.600]   It's a real-time OS owned by BlackBerry, oddly enough.
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.320]   Alpine's are less expensive.
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:17.360]   They're going to debut this fall in Europe in the US with a base price of $500 to $700.
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.360]   Pioneer's stuff, a little more expensive.
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:20.360]   It starts at $700.
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:23.960]   It goes all the way up to $1,400.
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:26.680]   I'm not sure when the availability is.
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.680]   Early summer.
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:28.680]   Early summer.
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:29.680]   Oh, wait a minute now.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:34.600]   They're going to add this to existing receivers via a firmware update in early summer.
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:36.720]   I wonder if I can put it in my car.
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:40.720]   Because my car is like an older car that is in that horrible in between where it only
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:41.720]   had a CD player.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:44.280]   Explain to me, Mr. Mac Break Weekly host.
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:48.120]   Does CarPlay just put the screen up?
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:52.280]   In other words, the car system just says, "You just display whatever you want."
[01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:53.640]   It's not running the system.
[01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:54.920]   It's running on the phone still.
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.720]   Yeah, it's still running from the phone.
[01:06:56.720 --> 01:06:59.440]   The phone is like airplay.
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:00.440]   But you get Siri.
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:01.440]   It's in your car.
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:02.440]   You get maps.
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:03.440]   Right.
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:07.360]   But it's still using the processor power from your phone.
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:08.360]   Okay.
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:11.600]   Does it have its own mic then built into the dashboard?
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:12.600]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.600]   Is that what the important thing is?
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.600]   Yeah, you don't want to have to talk to the phone.
[01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:17.600]   You need that audio there.
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:21.960]   I know a lot of times when you have an in-car dashboard, there's often a toggle on your
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:23.360]   steering wheel column.
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:24.360]   Right.
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:27.680]   I'm assuming wouldn't have that so you would need to have really good voice control on
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:28.680]   it.
[01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:29.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:30.680]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:34.720]   So if you buy it built into a car, you'll probably have controls on the steering wheel.
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:38.000]   It's a little dangerous if you have to reach for your phone.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.080]   Not that I would ever do that.
[01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.080]   Yeah.
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:48.000]   Marissa Meyer's secret plan, according to recode, Cara Swisher always knows what's up
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.400]   with Marissa Meyer.
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:55.800]   She says, "Marissa Meyer has a secret plan to get Apple to dump Google and default to
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.920]   Yahoo Mobile Search.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.720]   Who knew Yahoo still had search?
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.720]   I thought that was big."
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.760]   This is the iOS 8 rumor.
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:04.760]   Yeah.
[01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:07.800]   Like that Google is going to get dumped and Yahoo is going to come in.
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:08.800]   They've been moving that way.
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:14.800]   I guess I don't understand why Apple would go to Yahoo rather than go back to developing
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:17.040]   like for instance, developing their own solution.
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:20.200]   They just got out of Google Maps so that they wouldn't have to be dependent on a third
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:21.200]   party.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.200]   I mean, I--
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.680]   Well, that didn't go so well for them.
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:25.240]   Yeah, that really worked.
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:29.400]   Yeah, but it's still becoming-- it actually did go really well for them.
[01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:34.160]   I mean, it did go well from a PR perspective, but what happens is that you're an iPhone
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.160]   user.
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:36.160]   People end up using it.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:40.000]   And you hit a link and you're in Apple Maps, which is getting better.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.840]   It's still a little funky.
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:42.840]   Not bad.
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:49.440]   I admit, the UI is better than Google Maps in my opinion, but the accuracy is not.
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:50.440]   And that's--
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:52.880]   Yeah, what would you rather have when you're lost when you're--
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:54.600]   Which is why I use Google Maps.
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:59.240]   You know, so I mean, but I noticed that like, but what happened is I'll click on something
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:01.000]   and I end up in Apple Maps and I'll just use it.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.400]   And I think that a lot of people are just that way.
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:06.520]   What really gets confusing, by the way, is if you have voice activated on one of them
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:10.800]   and you open up the other one for some other search, and then you see one telling you,
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:15.920]   I got into this trying to get to Coachella, where I had one telling me to go one direction
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.280]   and the other one telling me, because I had given two different searches.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:20.800]   So having both on the phone has got its own problems.
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:21.800]   How was Coachella?
[01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:22.800]   Why was it telling me that?
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:23.800]   Coachella?
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:24.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:25.800]   Amazing.
[01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:26.800]   What are you, 18?
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:27.800]   I was working.
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:28.800]   Oh, OK.
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:29.800]   I was working there.
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:33.960]   The best thing to do at Coachella was-- or any of these big things is work there because
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:36.200]   they need the film pass, which means you can go anywhere.
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.200]   So I'm not--
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.400]   I'm not so much of a nerd on that.
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:41.000]   And tell me about Coachella.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.640]   Well, it's like it is just this massive music festival.
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.520]   Surely those of you back east have heard of this.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.520]   I have heard of it.
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.520]   I know it's a big--
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:48.520]   Of course.
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:49.520]   It's going on right now.
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:50.520]   It's finishing up.
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.520]   It's two weekends.
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.920]   It's 90,000 people in the Palm Desert.
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:54.920]   How-- OK.
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:57.640]   So South by Southwest used to be music film.
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:58.640]   And now it's something--
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:09:59.640]   Coachella--
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:01.800]   Coachella is more of a festival, isn't it?
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:02.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:03.800]   It's way more.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.800]   South by is an industry thing, right, regardless.
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:06.800]   Yeah, this is--
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:07.800]   Shows or not.
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:10.120]   And Coachella and a couple of the others that have popped up
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.040]   have been these evolving--
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:15.800]   what happened after Lollapalooza fell apart, right?
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.440]   Yeah, I mean, it's a lot less--
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:18.440]   I mean, I guess--
[01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:19.440]   It's always wonder in the terms--
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:21.000]   It's always wonder what happened
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:22.520]   that Lollapalooza fell apart.
[01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.920]   Like, you always wanted to know that.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:24.920]   It's a way easier--
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:25.920]   I don't know.
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:27.600]   Like, I went to the early--
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:30.080]   Lollapalooza-- I was in the industry back then.
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:38.960]   And the Coachella is a much more laid back, really cool.
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.960]   People are just-- you know how people running over each other?
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:42.360]   You don't have people-- the biggest problem
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.760]   you end up with is people taking too many drugs,
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:47.400]   typically, and in the sun.
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:48.960]   Yeah, it's in the desert.
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.760]   The desert is pretty unforgiving.
[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.760]   Yeah, and we had-- I was there last week.
[01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.400]   And so what we would do is we'd work all day,
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:55.160]   and then about eight.
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:56.680]   We'd finish what we were doing.
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:00.760]   And then we'd wander into Coachella and watch the pixies
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:01.760]   and throw--
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:05.000]   So what's the working angle to it?
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.240]   I can-- I can--
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:07.440]   I'm not even going to hang out for a period.
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:08.440]   I've never even had any experience.
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:09.440]   I've never even had any experience.
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.440]   And then he gets invited everywhere to do anything.
[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:14.640]   So he's got a scam like you wouldn't believe.
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:17.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:20.600]   I was working at Coachella late one night.
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:21.960]   So you were doing what--
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:23.200]   How many times do you hang out there?
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:25.680]   Yeah, people doing hangouts with bands and stuff like that.
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:28.000]   So they have band with out there in the desert?
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:28.680]   We did.
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:29.680]   We had a lot of band with.
[01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:30.600]   You want to know.
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:32.240]   Did you-- how did you bring that band within?
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.440]   Last thing in a truck?
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:34.280]   I didn't bring it in.
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:38.240]   We were just providing a little bit of the extra bits and pieces
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:39.280]   to make it work.
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:39.800]   So we were--
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:42.040]   Now let's run the company that does this kind of stuff.
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:42.720]   Yes.
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:45.760]   --by free-hand video conferencing stuff.
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.440]   Solutions.
[01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:46.960]   Yeah, so--
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:47.680]   I think it's funny.
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:49.960]   I mean, South by Southwest is probably the best example.
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:52.000]   But these festivals that have kind of come up
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.360]   as music and film festivals that grew into something else
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:57.440]   because people were interested in tech, more food,
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:58.560]   or something else.
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:01.920]   And it's just funny because it's so different from the days
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:03.440]   of a woodstock or--
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:04.280]   Right.
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:04.800]   --just a--
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:06.400]   Coachella was much more like that.
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:07.680]   Or even a burning man.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.680]   It's sort of about the music.
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:11.440]   It's sort of about this creative community.
[01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:11.940]   Right.
[01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:13.720]   This one's really about the art festival.
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:14.200]   This is music.
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:14.720]   This is music.
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:15.220]   Yeah.
[01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:16.600]   There's a little bit of art here on there.
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.360]   But this is really-- it's five stages.
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.280]   Four or five stages.
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.200]   Really cool in installations.
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:23.160]   Really cool location.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.680]   The only thing about it is, for instance,
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:27.120]   if you weren't working there, getting in and out,
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:29.360]   people are walking from miles to get to like parking
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.600]   and everything else.
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:32.480]   But it's great bands.
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:34.240]   As I said, really--
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.120]   It's like everybody plays there, right?
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:36.640]   I mean--
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.200]   And what's crazy is just people just show--
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.360]   it's the cool place to go.
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.280]   So people just show up.
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:41.720]   Like we were watching Pharrell.
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:47.200]   And then when Stefani just pops out, I don't know where it's like.
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.040]   She's not advertised.
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.920]   She just kind of comes out and sings a song.
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:53.840]   And Snoop Dogg just shows up on stage.
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:56.560]   And I think Beyonce showed up at her sister's concert.
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:01.160]   And so you get a lot of these kind of impromptu collaborations
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.520]   that just kind of pop up.
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:03.960]   And prompt you from the fans perspective.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:06.360]   But there is-- I see large-scale art installations.
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.120]   So there is some art to this.
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:10.360]   Well, there's a huge astronaut that is like--
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:12.120]   it looks like the MTV astronaut or whatever
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:15.200]   that is literally like 30 feet high that was like rolling
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:16.200]   around the system.
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:20.360]   And again, it's pretty surreal, especially at night.
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:23.560]   It was a pretty surreal experience.
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.720]   And the replacements played, which was--
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:27.200]   I was like wandering around going, I
[01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:28.240]   think that's the replacements.
[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:29.760]   I'm old enough to know who that is.
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:32.160]   And so anyway, there's a lot of mixture
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:33.680]   of old bands and new bands.
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:36.120]   And so you really get ones from the alternative--
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.160]   the Pixies were playing.
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:39.120]   And so you get these like 80s alternative rock.
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:41.920]   And then you also get Pharrell in the outcast.
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:43.840]   So "RKFire."
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.320]   News.
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.120]   News was like the worst band.
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:49.200]   But that was the one that had the-- that
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:51.920]   was supposed to be one of the best concerts there.
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:52.680]   I mean, I didn't see it.
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:53.560]   I was seeing something else.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:54.240]   But that was the--
[01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:55.760]   That was the--
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:57.680]   Yeah, I wasn't-- no, at the time, actually, it was not.
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:58.960]   I was-- he ate the brown acid.
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:13:59.480]   Is that something else?
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:13:59.960]   Yeah.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:01.720]   Don't eat the brown acid.
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:04.000]   How many times do I have to tell you?
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.040]   Chocolate was awesome.
[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:12.960]   So you get in the galaxy as five?
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:14.800]   Well, I did play with it a little bit.
[01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:15.800]   Yeah.
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:17.480]   You know, I have an iPhone for my personal phone.
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:19.560]   And then I use a number of different Android devices
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:22.880]   to sort of test software from time to time.
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:24.240]   I'll play with anything.
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:28.040]   Alex and I have settled on the HTC One M8.
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:28.560]   I do.
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:29.880]   I really like it.
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:30.840]   I still use my iPhone.
[01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:31.680]   I mean, I still use my iPhone.
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:32.240]   You got a lot of trouble.
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:34.880]   Two weeks ago, on Mac break weekly--
[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:35.520]   I chose it.
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:37.080]   You picked this as your pick of the week.
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:38.120]   It's the best camera.
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:40.760]   This is the coolest camera.
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:41.480]   It's pretty cool.
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:43.440]   My kids want me to make me the manleons all the time.
[01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:45.440]   There's this thing we can enhance the eyes, make the eyes really big.
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:46.280]   I'll show you what I did.
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:47.840]   It's like alien alien alien.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:50.520]   Like today, I literally had to make like three alien shots
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:51.920]   for them while I was in--
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.320]   well, we were Easter Sunday.
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:54.080]   So--
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:58.200]   But the idea of being able to short up the field
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:03.760]   and automatically and then be able to post it,
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.480]   there's not really any other phone right now.
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:07.080]   And the reason I picked it specifically
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:14.240]   was because it was-- you hassle-huffed.
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:17.560]   I hassle-huffed, but I'm trying to find the alien more.
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:18.000]   You know what?
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.560]   Google decided that the one with alien eyes is not--
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:22.000]   Oh, I think it was too--
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.360]   Oh, there's--
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:23.860]   OK.
[01:15:23.860 --> 01:15:25.440]   So this is built into the camera.
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:26.920]   What a thrill.
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:30.040]   My kids think it's awesome.
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:31.400]   You can do that.
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:32.880]   But it's also the short up the field.
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:35.280]   That's not really what you use a lot.
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:38.120]   But you can see it's a pretty crisp, even those four megapixels.
[01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:40.720]   A lot of people given the negative reviews
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:44.160]   because David Hasselhoff seems to show up from time to time.
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:46.960]   But I think it's a very good camera.
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:47.440]   I like it.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:49.840]   Now, times have changed a little because Google
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:55.920]   has released its official camera app to the Play Store.
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:56.920]   So you can put it on--
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.400]   In fact, you can use it on the internet.
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:15:59.560]   So what you can do is you can take a picture
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:01.600]   and then move the camera a little bit to give it parallax.
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:02.600]   And then put it on.
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:03.680]   Yeah, it's kind of interesting.
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:04.280]   I think it's fine.
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:06.480]   I mean, I like the idea that I can just take photos.
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:07.440]   And it's just this--
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:09.760]   I mean, I think-- again, the reason I picked it
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:12.480]   was because I love the idea of having something that
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.320]   is just automatic.
[01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:15.320]   And I think everyone's going to have it in two years.
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:17.040]   This is early on.
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:21.920]   I think it was a very interesting way to implement it.
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:23.320]   So I took a picture, for instance,
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:26.320]   here's a picture of the microphone that I took.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:29.640]   Actually, the first one was with everything in focus.
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:31.880]   And then I went and I made the background a little bit
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:32.400]   blurrier.
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:33.840]   And they made it even more blurry.
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:37.960]   And this looks like a fancy SLR shot.
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:39.960]   And you can, by the way, make the foreground blurry
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:43.200]   in the background out in focus because it has enough information
[01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:44.120]   to change focal planes.
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:47.040]   It's actually a little more flexible than the built-in
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:50.200]   application on the HTC One.
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:50.840]   And it's free.
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:51.800]   Google's giving it away.
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:54.320]   Think about Project Aura, if I make it.
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:55.520]   Let's talk about Aura.
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:56.040]   I like that idea.
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:59.000]   This is the module phone that Google is announcing
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.480]   as sort of a playground piece.
[01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:03.120]   And this week they announced that they were going
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:06.680]   to give 100K prize to somebody who developed the best module
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:08.200]   that will plug into this phone.
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:11.000]   So I believe it's just going to be one piece of glass.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.760]   And then the flip side of it will be ports for different
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:16.040]   components that you can plug in.
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:16.240]   So--
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.600]   Do they intend to sell it that way?
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:20.280]   It feels like it might fall apart in your pocket.
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.160]   Well, I think they had a demo of it
[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:25.680]   that actually didn't work because the screen was already cracked.
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:27.640]   They had dropped it in the screen and already cracked.
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:29.280]   But the idea is that we'd get away
[01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:30.800]   from some of the issues of fragmentation
[01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:33.560]   because you would have these swapable pieces.
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:34.560]   Like Lego block.
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:36.240]   And we would just be able to update the phone
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:37.240]   and think you want it.
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:40.120]   And I think it's interesting, instead of screwing on a lens
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:41.880]   to your camera, you could swap in a different camera.
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:42.640]   That's one of the most--
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:45.320]   I love the idea of someone building a half-inch chip
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:46.760]   with a crazy camera from my phone.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:48.920]   I love the idea of just being able to swap that in and out.
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:49.400]   That'd be really cool.
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.360]   Or if memory was the most important thing,
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:54.000]   you could put that in and get rid of other pieces
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.640]   that you don't need.
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:59.800]   I like it that there's a Microsoft OneDrive ad
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:03.200]   and a Nokia phone ad in front of the Project R.A. video
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:04.720]   demonstration.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:05.720]   Let's jump--
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:06.720]   I know their audience.
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:09.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:10.880]   No, no, no, no.
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:13.200]   I can't skip it.
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:15.680]   I think Project R though is-- it's a neat idea,
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:18.600]   but it's another one of these Google experiments.
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:20.400]   I mean, let's not take it too seriously.
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:23.360]   Well, it was-- in fact, it was a Motorola experiment
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:25.960]   which Google kept when they sold Motorola mobility.
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:28.000]   They kept-- actually, this is Dieterbone
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.840]   from the Verge visiting the Project R.A. team.
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:33.640]   So this is an R&D team that will stay with Google
[01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:37.160]   after the Motorola mobility sale goes through to Lenovo.
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.000]   But the idea is--
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:38.520]   Look at this.
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.560]   This is really interesting.
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:45.240]   This could really help mature niches in the market
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:48.240]   that, like photography or other things
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:49.920]   you would use a mobile device for.
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:51.240]   This is never going to be mainstream,
[01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:54.080]   but this could really push the edges of that market
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:55.960]   to do very creative stuff.
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:58.120]   I guess, I think if a consumer is going
[01:18:58.120 --> 01:19:01.000]   to look at the feature set in the phone and just buy that phone,
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:02.280]   it's not the first time we've seen this.
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:04.520]   Pfizer had springboard modules.
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:06.760]   Remember, you could pop into that-- you don't remember.
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:07.280]   But the--
[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:10.600]   Oh, and there's a parallel trend with gaming PCs.
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:14.480]   Razer just released a modular PC with swappable components.
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:16.560]   And I think there is something to be said for that.
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:18.880]   If you care about a particular spec
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:21.920]   and want to tweak that, then it's interesting
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:23.800]   if it's not mainstream.
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:26.880]   And it gives you a whole lot more flexibility over the price,
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:27.720]   too.
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:30.320]   You don't pay for the stuff you don't want.
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:33.480]   What it's encouraging is that we're far from the end of--
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:36.000]   it felt a little bit like we were at the end of the line
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.080]   and innovation in smartphones.
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:41.080]   The Galaxy S5 really isn't much better than the Galaxy S4,
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:42.920]   for instance, the HTC One M8.
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.000]   It's a little bit better than the M7.
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.880]   But maybe there is still a lot of room for improvement.
[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:48.640]   I think there's still a lot.
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:50.400]   Even though this HTC is really great,
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:52.880]   I think there is an enormous amount of improvement
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:54.640]   in low light performance for cameras.
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:56.840]   And I think that cameras are still the number one thing
[01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:59.160]   that people use their cell phone for-- over voice,
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.000]   over everything else.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:00.680]   I agree.
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:03.600]   And the only thing that people should be focusing on,
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:07.560]   as my opinion is at this point, is low light.
[01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.560]   Because that's what people really, the average person,
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:10.880]   is doing a lot of that cannot well--
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:12.800]   Low light flies like you're sitting there with one candle.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:15.200]   But low light is anything that's not bright sunlight.
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:16.000]   It's inside.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:16.680]   It's low light.
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:19.320]   Yeah, I mean, being able to shoot inside and without grain.
[01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:20.800]   And that technology is out there.
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:22.840]   I mean, they're definitely-- but it takes a bigger chip.
[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:25.840]   It takes less focus on resolution and more focus
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:27.080]   on light sensitivity.
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:29.760]   HTC was moving in the right direction with this ultra-pixel.
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:30.440]   Yeah.
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:32.040]   I think they're going-- definitely going in the right direction.
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:33.120]   I don't think they're there yet.
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.280]   But I think that they're definitely--
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:38.040]   I think the hardware is going to get de-emphasized,
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:40.360]   and they're going to really focus on software.
[01:20:40.360 --> 01:20:43.880]   I feel like we're getting the era of computational photography.
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:47.080]   If we can get the data--
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.800]   and I think that we probably can get the data that--
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:53.000]   you're going to see computational photography really take over.
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.400]   That's where Apple has always focused with the photography
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:57.000]   and the iPhone.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.080]   It has been to de-emphasize the hardware
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:02.440]   and to talk so much about what the software is capable of doing.
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:06.040]   And that's really the thing that differentiates them and Android.
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:11.080]   I mean, this new Android app, the actual camera app,
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:12.200]   may make some difference.
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:14.640]   But that slow shutter speed and the slow processing
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:16.240]   speed in Android is just--
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:17.840]   I don't care how many megapixels you throw.
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:21.000]   And it's incomparable next to an iPhone.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.240]   I have a new metric for rating cameras,
[01:21:25.240 --> 01:21:27.040]   because it doesn't make any sense anymore
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:29.320]   to talk about pixels.
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:30.560]   I have a new metric.
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:33.440]   It's called "pleasingness."
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:36.240]   Am I pleased by the photos I get?
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:39.480]   And actually, this is the HTC One camera.
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:40.000]   Let me--
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.360]   By the way, you know what the number one problem with this camera is?
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:46.960]   The fact that they put it on the apex of a convex surface--
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:49.280]   So you're most likely to scratch everything.
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:49.760]   As you said it--
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:51.000]   Oh, I'm always careful now.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.240]   I actually find myself setting my HTC down face down
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:56.120]   all the time, because I don't want to scratch the camera.
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:57.120]   Right.
[01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:00.280]   But it's become kind of-- I don't know whether it's really
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:02.600]   a real problem, but I can already see tons of microscratches
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:03.960]   that are in front of the lens.
[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:06.080]   Let me take a picture of you.
[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:08.680]   And now, I think I have it on set on the--
[01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:12.560]   yes, slowly raise your device and keep the subject centered.
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:16.440]   So I slowly raise the device and kept the subject centered.
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:17.920]   Now, it's processing the image.
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:19.080]   Look, you've got alien eyes.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:23.400]   No, that's the other thing.
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:28.280]   And then now, I can what tap the background?
[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:28.720]   What can I do?
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:29.440]   I can tap the--
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:30.040]   Well, it made it out.
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:30.360]   I think it's--
[01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:32.080]   Oh, it made it something.
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.400]   It definitely--
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:34.240]   Did it do anything?
[01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:34.640]   Rock it out.
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:35.040]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:36.640]   I first have to edit.
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:37.160]   No.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:39.000]   I don't think it made it out of focus.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:39.960]   Does it just do it?
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:40.320]   It does.
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.000]   You're the background's out of focus.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.240]   It looks pretty accurate.
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:46.800]   I think this, to me, is pleasing.
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:49.640]   So it's not the most megapixels.
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:51.960]   I don't know what the numbers are,
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:54.000]   but I find the image is pleasing.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:55.720]   And I find the iPhone image is pleasing.
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:23:00.800]   And I do agree with you, Dan, that the iPhone is the--
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:02.360]   that's the standard for all of this.
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.600]   But I think we're getting close.
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:06.400]   I think the S5 camera is very good.
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:09.080]   Obviously, the Nokia cameras are extremely good.
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:12.760]   Have you played with the 10, 20, or the other Nokia cameras?
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:15.680]   Dan, do you still think that the iPhone bests them?
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:16.760]   I have not.
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:18.920]   And in fact, I've seen them only very rarely.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:21.080]   I get sent Android phones to test all the time,
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:25.080]   but I never get sent these Delumia phones, which also
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:26.400]   kind of shows--
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:29.000]   I'm not the highest on the tech totem pole,
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.560]   but it shows where the priority is.
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:33.320]   And it just has not shifted to Windows phone.
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:33.880]   No, I agree.
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:35.200]   We don't see review units either.
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:38.240]   I actually had to buy-- I've ordered a 15.20, just so I'll have it.
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:41.080]   That's 20 megapixels, I think.
[01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:44.640]   Not the 41 of the 10, 20.
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:45.800]   Well, we'll see.
[01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:50.240]   I mean, I think what the good news is, at least at the high end,
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:53.560]   the picture-- the capability is getting pretty good.
[01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:53.920]   Yeah.
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:56.200]   And across the board.
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:58.320]   iPhone probably still the best, although I think they're
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:01.200]   those who argue the 10, 20 is better.
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:09.320]   And Nokia, by the way, also has that focus choice stuff.
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:11.560]   Do you have other feature wishlist items
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:14.480]   you want to see in a phone that we don't have today?
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:15.760]   Well, one thing that's interesting--
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:21.200]   I see Samsung doing this, and now HTC's done it on the MA.
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:22.960]   This works with the Fitbit app.
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:27.040]   It does some of that health stuff.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:31.480]   So both the Galaxy S4, the S5, and the HTC M8,
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:35.920]   you can actually have Fitbit monitor your footsteps.
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:38.080]   So it'll track where you're going all the time.
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:40.520]   And then sends it right back to Google, right?
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:42.480]   Which is also in parity with the iPhone.
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:44.000]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.400]   I think that, for me, again, low light performance,
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:49.600]   and then I don't see any phone.
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.520]   And only recently do we see--
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:53.280]   I think part of it is now we have cameras,
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:56.080]   Nikon's and Canon's that do incredible low light.
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:57.280]   So you know that it's possible.
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:58.800]   And so I think that's frustrating.
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:00.600]   I think that I want better--
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:03.040]   I want more interaction of my phones
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:04.600]   with other hardware devices.
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:05.720]   But I'm kind of a pro user.
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:08.360]   So I'm a little frustrated about how hard it is
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:10.160]   to get, for instance, an iPhone to interact
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:13.600]   through the lightning connector to lots of other things.
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:16.120]   I agree, having situational awareness,
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:17.640]   becoming part of the internet of things,
[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:19.080]   being able to control stuff and stuff.
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:20.760]   And not necessarily just wireless.
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:23.760]   Because you have a very powerful processor in your pot.
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:24.240]   Right.
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:25.600]   And we just like the little--
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:28.840]   Mackie makes a mixer that basically is a hull
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:32.320]   that you can just shove your iPad into and take over.
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:36.680]   And while a little limited, it is an incredible idea
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:41.640]   of having manufacturers stop making--
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:43.240]   stop trying to do the interface.
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:44.920]   Like literally just stop.
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:49.200]   And create a hull and let it be Apple or Android or whatever.
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:50.920]   I think that is something that we're just
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:51.680]   seeing the beginning of.
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:53.760]   And I think a lot of manufacturers, when you see CarPlay,
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:55.760]   I think what you're seeing is manufacturers
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:57.480]   starting to realize that they're just not very good at that.
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:58.280]   And that's really hard.
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:25:59.520]   Point of sale systems.
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:01.840]   Who gets a cashier that's trying to make your small business?
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:03.040]   And I can get a square.
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:04.040]   I can get a square.
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.440]   Yeah, that's pretty amazing.
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:07.560]   And by the way, somebody in the chat room just--
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:08.960]   he says, I just popped in to mention
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:12.520]   that the sensor used by the iPhone, the Galaxy S4, the Lumion
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:14.200]   on 20, all are from Sony.
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:16.480]   It's true, they make the sensors for most of these.
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:20.840]   And he says he believes the Xperia Z2 has the best camera
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:21.560]   of all.
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:24.160]   That actually is not my experience.
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:28.640]   But he does quote a review and a site that really
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:31.440]   is pretty good on this stuff, DXO Optics, where
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:36.240]   they talk about optics involved in this and sharpness,
[01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:37.120]   because that's what they do.
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:38.040]   They measure this stuff.
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:43.680]   And they say it's a very accurate camera.
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:46.880]   But I think Instagram users have proven that accuracy is only
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:47.880]   very small part of the camera.
[01:26:47.880 --> 01:26:49.560]   I don't think it's everything, is it?
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:50.560]   No, it's--
[01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:52.760]   Again, I think the pleasingness of when you're in the style--
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:53.720]   I agree.
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:56.000]   Why, you can look at a graph like this,
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.400]   which is their mobile benchmark tests.
[01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:01.880]   And I don't think this tells the story.
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:03.360]   I think pleasingness tells the story.
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:05.240]   Well, and I think cool features, like for instance,
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:07.320]   the other thing that the HTC has is the photosphere,
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:12.440]   where you can shoot the sphere, and then I can post it to G+.
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:15.400]   And people can actually click on it and experience the sphere.
[01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:17.880]   And those kinds of giving people a better way
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:21.120]   to interact with where you are or what you're sharing,
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:22.320]   I think, are great features.
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:23.840]   I did have a Z2 for review.
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:25.040]   I took a bunch of pictures with it.
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:26.040]   I was underwhelmed.
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:28.160]   They weren't particularly pleasing.
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:30.040]   It goes underwater.
[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:31.800]   A lot of-- almost everybody goes underwire now
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:33.600]   because it's barfons and apples.
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:34.640]   I have a case for mine.
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:35.200]   Oh, Dunk apples.
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:36.560]   I can do 300 feet.
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:41.000]   But see, on the graph, the Z2 is ahead.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:41.600]   There you have it.
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:42.720]   And that's all that matters.
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:45.240]   There is a very big class of geeks,
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:50.080]   including obviously this fell in the chat room, who look at this.
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:52.520]   They look at specs, speeds, and feeds, as you said.
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:54.400]   And they say, well, I can see on the graph, it's better,
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:56.080]   so it must be better.
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:57.960]   And that's pleasingness does not take that--
[01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:00.200]   Please do a count.
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:03.720]   It is a purely subject-- a totally subjective measurement.
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:04.880]   The Z2 just came out.
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:06.840]   So we haven't gotten that in for a minute.
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:07.360]   What did I have?
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:09.000]   Oh, I had Z1s.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.320]   The Z1s, I apologize.
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:12.000]   So I haven't seen the Z2.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.160]   Is it-- it just came out?
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:14.840]   So are we going to review it soon?
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:15.200]   Yeah.
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:16.040]   I hope so.
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:17.040]   Yeah.
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:17.720]   Yeah.
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:18.400]   Apologies.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:19.200]   I had a Z1s.
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:20.320]   You're right.
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:22.440]   Our show today brought to you also waterproof.
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:24.960]   But I didn't dare dunk it because I have a bad history
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:25.920]   with that stuff.
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:29.000]   Our show today brought to you by Squarespace,
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:32.440]   the all-in-one platform, hosting and software
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:35.800]   that makes it easy for you to create a gorgeous website.
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:37.920]   I'm not going to say inside Twitter is a gorgeous website.
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:40.960]   That's our blog site running on Squarespace inside.twit.com.
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:42.520]   But I'll tell you what, you can't bring it down.
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:45.640]   If every single person watching right now went there,
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:48.440]   we could bring almost any site down, but not Squarespace.
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:50.640]   No, sorry.
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:53.800]   That's because Squarespace so tightly integrates the software
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:59.600]   with the hosting that they have virtually endless capacity.
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:01.800]   They could fire up more bandwidth like that.
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.840]   In fact, it happens all automatically, transparently
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:05.360]   and instantaneously.
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:07.600]   So what the effect is, you always
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:10.720]   have a highly responsive site that looks great that's always
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:13.320]   secure because they apply the patches for you.
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:14.720]   And it's easy for you.
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:18.160]   You don't have to be a web guru to use Squarespace.
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:21.800]   You start with the 25 gorgeous designer templates.
[01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:24.520]   Use the logo creator tool to create a great logo.
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:29.440]   Use their iOS apps to post, to check metrics,
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:31.520]   to approve comments.
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:37.120]   You can always use a designer and do some more heavy duty stuff
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:39.440]   because they do have a great developer platform
[01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.080]   if you're a CSS guru, for instance.
[01:29:41.080 --> 01:29:44.120]   Look, Chad's making us a new logo.
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:46.120]   I love it.
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:50.680]   You have access to more than 300 Google fonts.
[01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:53.440]   I mean, it just is really great and getting better all the time.
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:56.600]   Now they've added e-commerce to all subscription plan levels,
[01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:58.360]   including the ability to accept donations.
[01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:01.560]   So if you're a nonprofit or a school fundraiser or whatever,
[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:03.160]   it starts at $8 a month.
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:05.040]   It then includes the free domain name
[01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:06.840]   when you sign up for a year.
[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:09.040]   All the sites look great on all size screens.
[01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:11.360]   They're automatically mobile ready.
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:13.280]   Even the code underlying is beautiful.
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:15.240]   And while I don't think you're going to need help
[01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:17.680]   because it's very intuitive, they do have the best support
[01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:21.200]   in the biz 24/7 from their Squarespace offices
[01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:23.960]   in luxurious Chelsea.
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:27.080]   Actually, I think they're in Soho, south of Houston.
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:28.160]   They are.
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:28.920]   Oh, you know?
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:29.600]   What am I saying?
[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:31.680]   Dan used to work out of their offices.
[01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:34.280]   Yeah, yeah, with Dan, with Anthony, the big guys.
[01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:35.360]   Not to plug them.
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:36.880]   I really like it.
[01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:38.480]   I think they're--
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:40.480]   I don't mind saying that.
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:41.680]   I really love these guys.
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:43.200]   And I think they do a great product.
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:44.200]   And I want you to write it all.
[01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:45.360]   Our sites are all Squarespace.
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.000]   Yeah.
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.120]   It's really easy to talk about this.
[01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:50.080]   If you go to squarespace.com, you
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:52.320]   don't need to use a credit card or even our Twitter offer
[01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:52.520]   code.
[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:54.320]   Just start playing with it.
[01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:56.240]   Import your existing content.
[01:30:56.240 --> 01:30:57.160]   Make your own site.
[01:30:57.160 --> 01:31:00.840]   Change it how it looks with a single click of the mouse.
[01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:03.040]   But when you do decide to sign up,
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:04.320]   make sure you use the offer code to it.
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:05.600]   You'll get 10% off.
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:08.640]   And you'll be showing them that you heard about it
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:09.960]   on this weekend tech.
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:12.640]   squarespace.com, a better web awaits starting
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:15.360]   with your new website at squarespace.com.
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:16.640]   Use the offer code to it.
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:19.360]   When you decide to buy, you will save money.
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:20.360]   Yeah, I forgot.
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:22.320]   You know those guys very well, Dan.
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:23.640]   They're wonderful people.
[01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:25.800]   And Anthony's--
[01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:29.240]   I mean, who is it's a big supporter of what you're doing
[01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:31.800]   now with his new effort?
[01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:32.560]   Dane was.
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:33.840]   But yeah, yeah.
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:37.160]   But Anthony is-- and I think Squarespace just raised--
[01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:38.880]   they just landed another 40 million.
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:39.880]   Oh, well, there you go.
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:41.480]   That's not to contribute to the--
[01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:42.960]   You know, they bought a Super Bowl ad.
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:45.080]   I had a feeling they were doing OK.
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:45.960]   They're doing OK.
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:46.440]   Wow.
[01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:47.680]   They're good people.
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:50.280]   And I knew him practically when Anthony was still
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:51.520]   in a dorm room.
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:54.800]   So it's really great to see that success and the progress.
[01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:59.240]   And that's what happens when you make a great product.
[01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:03.520]   DSL report says, "Cord cutting on the rise, especially
[01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:05.760]   among the young."
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:09.520]   This is actually-- it's a study by Experian Marketing Services.
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:12.440]   The number of court cutters and Experian defines that as people
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:18.280]   who have broadband but do not have cable.
[01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:21.520]   It's gone up 44% in the last three years.
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:23.320]   We have cable, but I barely know why.
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:26.120]   I mean, I watched like--
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:28.160]   I watched this week with George Steppenopoulos, I think.
[01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:28.680]   There you go.
[01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:29.680]   The only thing I watch live.
[01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:30.880]   I mean, in the steel games.
[01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:36.680]   Now, according to this study, in 2013, 6.5% of US households
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:38.040]   were court cutters.
[01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:41.040]   And that's up 50% from 2010.
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:44.040]   44% from 2010.
[01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:46.760]   The number increases for users who
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:49.760]   subscribe to Netflix or Hulu, 1/5 of Americans
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:52.200]   use those services.
[01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:53.000]   Ah, I'm sorry.
[01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.040]   Let me read this right.
[01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:57.160]   1/5 of Americans who use those services
[01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:58.680]   don't subscribe to cable.
[01:32:58.680 --> 01:33:02.840]   So there's a strong correlation between using Netflix or Hulu
[01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:03.800]   and not having to use cable.
[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:05.800]   That makes sense.
[01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:10.240]   1/4 of adults between 18 and 35 who subscribe to Netflix
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:13.040]   are Hulu who don't pay for TV.
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:13.720]   That makes sense.
[01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:15.400]   You don't have the money.
[01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:17.080]   You don't want to spend the money.
[01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:19.080]   And you're used to watching on a screen.
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:21.560]   And you just get back to interface and user experience.
[01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:23.560]   Anyone who's used the Comcast interface--
[01:33:23.560 --> 01:33:25.920]   I mean, if you think the Apple TV interface is bad,
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:26.960]   just you go into Comcast.
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:28.120]   You get used to it.
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:33.280]   But that is the most butt, ugly, stupid, messed up system
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:35.600]   ever made.
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:38.280]   I think it's running on a 1988 ROM chip.
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:39.280]   It feels like it doesn't.
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.600]   It feels horrible.
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:41.800]   What is wrong with these pieces?
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:43.880]   I'm just going to do a review actually
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:45.120]   before you buy I think tomorrow.
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:47.840]   The Tivo Romeo Pro.
[01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:52.640]   So Tivo is another company that hasn't involved as much
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:54.320]   as I'd expected by now.
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:58.000]   We were using Tivo's in 2000.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.560]   But it works with the cable card.
[01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:02.040]   So I don't need a cable box.
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:03.960]   I can do at least in some areas.
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:06.880]   In this area, we can do on demand from Comcast.
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:11.200]   So that means I don't have to listen to demand in this area.
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:12.560]   I don't know if this is everywhere.
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:14.200]   Maybe it's the same in New York.
[01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:19.120]   They have these e-hosteses who just blather on about progress.
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:20.200]   Or when you're in on demand.
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:21.160]   When you're in on demand.
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:22.160]   And you can't get out.
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:26.800]   And if you stop a show or pause a show, they come back.
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:29.200]   It's quiet and you leave the living room.
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:31.280]   And then all of a sudden you hear voices coming from the living
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:31.560]   room.
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:34.240]   And it's the e-hosteses trying to get you
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:37.760]   to watch the good wife or something.
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:39.040]   And I don't want that.
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:41.720]   Anyway, that's not on Tivo.
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:45.800]   You can cross channel and service search.
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:49.680]   So they have Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, streaming,
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:52.400]   and of course on demand, plus whatever's on your channel
[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:52.560]   guide.
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:54.600]   And you search all at once.
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:56.440]   So it'll say, oh, you can watch that show.
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:57.680]   And it'll show you all the different ways
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:34:59.960]   you can watch that show.
[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:02.640]   And you're right, Tivo really blew that first mover
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:03.240]   advantage.
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:06.000]   But what they did do is them and Slimbox, the Slimbox,
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.520]   really helped prime the market for what we're seeing now,
[01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:09.440]   right?
[01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:13.080]   And in fact, with the high-end Tivo,
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:16.360]   I think the Romeo Pro and the Romeo Premier, or plus,
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:20.760]   whatever it's called, it has Slimbox style features.
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:22.800]   So I can watch on my iPad here.
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:26.120]   I can watch my Tivo at home or anywhere in the house.
[01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:27.760]   That is kind of cool.
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:29.280]   And control it and have all that stuff.
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:31.680]   So very much like a Slimbox.
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:33.720]   So I think there are better solutions.
[01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:35.600]   I wish it were a little more elegant.
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:37.200]   By now, it should be.
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:38.240]   I'm curious to see.
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:41.480]   So I think this is my big theory for Apple,
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:43.800]   is that the safest way for Apple to experiment with this
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:46.800]   would be to incorporate Apple TV into a 4K monitor that's
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:48.400]   designed for the Mac Pro.
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:49.520]   So they just have a 4K monitor.
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:50.800]   And oh, by the way, the 4K monitor
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:54.000]   has 32 inch or 40 inch or whatever.
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.640]   And oh, by the way, it has an Apple TV built in.
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:57.480]   What?
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:58.280]   Oh, they don't.
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:35:59.400]   It would take-- you're insane.
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:00.160]   That would be--
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:01.720]   You got me excited for a month.
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:04.720]   But that would be the safest way for them to continue the hobby.
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:07.000]   Just because it's a chipset that they just add--
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.320]   it would be simple for them to add to it.
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:10.840]   And then it's just a--
[01:36:10.840 --> 01:36:12.520]   they're not selling it as the Apple TV.
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:14.160]   They're looking at studies like this going, OK,
[01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:15.080]   that market's creeping up.
[01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:17.160]   And by the way, they don't call it a hobby anymore.
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:17.800]   Right.
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:19.560]   It's not a hobby anymore.
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:19.960]   But I think--
[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:20.880]   I like that idea.
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:22.440]   And you add a webcam to it.
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:23.640]   You add a--
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:25.400]   whatever with a little slide thing, whatever.
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:28.600]   But the point is that that's something that I think
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:32.440]   would be very interesting to see Apple kind of safely
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:32.880]   going to get up.
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:34.360]   I mean, I think we know the difference.
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:36.720]   Do you think mainstream America knows the difference
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:40.720]   between the crap interface on their DVR box
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:44.320]   from the cable company versus an Apple TV?
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:46.440]   No, my kids won't use the Comcast one.
[01:36:46.440 --> 01:36:46.880]   You're a kid.
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:47.800]   They just go for it.
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:49.040]   My kids are like-- but my kids are--
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:51.360]   I mean, one of my men is-- I have a four-year-old daughter
[01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:54.240]   who all she knows how to do is get to Apple.
[01:36:54.240 --> 01:36:56.040]   The Apple TV, like she switches the input.
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:36:57.800]   And then she just-- and then she totally understands the Apple TV.
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:36:59.920]   I never had filet mignon.
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:01.760]   The hamburger, the McDonald's tastes fine.
[01:37:01.760 --> 01:37:04.280]   And I think that most people haven't had an experience
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:06.680]   of a good user interface, so you just don't know any better.
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:09.040]   Well, the user interface will stop you,
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:11.480]   but the real matter is the content.
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:15.040]   So I don't want to watch regular TV with commercials.
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:17.160]   I don't want to have a DVR that I have to set up
[01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:18.920]   to record it, then fast forward through the--
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:19.680]   It's a lot of work.
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:22.320]   I want to be able to binge watch shows when I'm interested in them.
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:24.800]   I want creators who are making content that
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:29.160]   is more suited for online distribution and streaming.
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:33.280]   So I want somebody to be writing a three-part series
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:36.280]   or a three-season series where they know the end of the story.
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:37.400]   They can plot it all out.
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:38.840]   They can have a good arc.
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:42.320]   Yeah, and I think that's really the more important revolution
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:44.600]   that's happening with TV, is how we're writing differently
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:47.080]   for it because the distribution model is changed.
[01:37:47.080 --> 01:37:49.320]   And also, this stuff can be smarter.
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:51.360]   And it needs to be smarter.
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:54.560]   And as a result, you get a smaller audience,
[01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:56.480]   but because this new model works with this,
[01:37:56.480 --> 01:37:58.280]   you can have-- Mad Men has a million viewers.
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:37:59.440]   It's not a huge show.
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:03.080]   But it can succeed for AMC in these new models.
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:04.400]   And that's kind of critical as well,
[01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:06.200]   is that you have a model so you can reach out
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:08.160]   and you can make better smarter programming
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:10.960]   for the smaller audience because you have a way to monetize it.
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:13.760]   Well, one of the things that these get bigger also is that we
[01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:18.680]   really live in this two-hour, 44-minute, 22-minute world,
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:21.960]   but YouTube's already begun to really break that up,
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:24.480]   where you can start thinking in three-minute or eight-minute
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:27.280]   or-- and as that market continues to get bigger.
[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:30.800]   YouTube getting bigger on the small side, small, short stuff.
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:31.280]   Yep.
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:35.880]   And then meanwhile, we're watching 13-hour movies on AMC.
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:36.920]   Right.
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:38.800]   I do think we've become accustomed, though,
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:42.080]   to the 20-- 25-minute cycle, 30 minutes with commercials,
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:44.880]   22, 25 minutes, and then the 42-minute show,
[01:38:44.880 --> 01:38:47.160]   which is the hour-long show with commercials,
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:49.560]   that we've become accustomed to it both in watching,
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:51.520]   like, what our attention span will hold,
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:55.440]   how often we expect to have a plot twist happen.
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:56.520]   And writers are really good.
[01:38:56.520 --> 01:38:57.120]   There's a beat.
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:38:57.520]   There's a beat.
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:59.880]   Yeah, and writers are really good at hitting that pace, too.
[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:01.960]   So I think those formats are fine.
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:04.360]   I mean, there's certainly room for a lot of experimentation,
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:05.160]   but I like those.
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:05.720]   I like them.
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:06.720]   No, I think they're great.
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:07.160]   I think they're just--
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:08.760]   Are we going to have another format that's an eight-minute
[01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:09.880]   format or five-minute format?
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:10.840]   Is there a spot on there?
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:12.680]   I think there's a really interesting possibility
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:14.920]   of, like, eight-minute, five-to-eight-minute formats.
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:20.280]   What used to be a segment could be really its own little bit.
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:23.160]   So network package ranges, depending on the show,
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:26.040]   good morning America, two to four minutes.
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:29.440]   If it's 60 minutes, then you maybe
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:32.040]   can get as much as a 15-minute package.
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:34.720]   But I think really they're shorter than you think,
[01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:35.200]   believe it or not.
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:36.920]   Well, but I think, like, the five-to-eight minute,
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:39.440]   I think that there's a-- because you could really do it.
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:42.200]   You can do small-- I mean, I have to admit that I'm--
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:43.760]   I've been working on a bunch of stuff that's
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:44.840]   like five-to-eight minutes long.
[01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:48.920]   And so it is-- you can definitely tell a whole mini story
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:51.600]   that's connected to a larger series in that little segment.
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.320]   Because that's what you're seeing when you're watching.
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:56.240]   But I think when you're watching something like 24,
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:58.600]   I mean, you really are seeing it in eight-minute chunks,
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:39:59.600]   in a six-to-eight-minute chunks.
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:00.400]   Yes, you are, because of the end.
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:00.960]   And then an ad.
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:03.560]   And so the thing is, it told you a whole story there,
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:04.320]   and then it stopped.
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:04.820]   Yeah.
[01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:06.120]   Well, the movie trails--
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:07.520]   The story is key.
[01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:09.280]   And what Jill said is exactly right.
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:12.840]   As long as we are in the process of refining and getting
[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:17.000]   very good at narrative content and narrative storytelling,
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:22.080]   it doesn't really matter what the formats evolve and change
[01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:22.800]   and always have.
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:25.160]   I mean, if you look at the last 50 years of television,
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:27.480]   formats have tightened and become more refined.
[01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:29.880]   But what really does matter is the economics, like you said
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:32.480]   a moment ago, Leo, that we can-- and we see this in web
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:34.280]   publishing-- we can live in niches,
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:36.160]   and those niches can make money.
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:39.840]   But as long as there is distribution and a market for it,
[01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:41.800]   this stuff will continue to evolve.
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:45.200]   And we will see changes in how we consume content
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:46.760]   and what a good package is.
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:47.600]   And that kind of stuff.
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:49.960]   But as long as there's a market for it,
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:52.360]   and as long as it's a good story and the distribution
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:57.040]   is there, then it will continue to evolve.
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:58.320]   I think it's so interesting that we
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:00.600]   are seeing such a short attention span culture.
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:04.320]   And yet, Lord of the Rings, eight hours, right,
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:06.560]   before you could see the end of that, or nine hours
[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:08.240]   before you could see the end of that story.
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:10.240]   How's the cards?
[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:15.040]   That was two 16-hour story arcs or whatever.
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:17.280]   For such a short attention span society,
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:19.720]   we seem to like long-form stuff an awful lot.
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:21.720]   And a 90-minute movie now is almost
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:24.360]   seeming too short to tell a compelling story.
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:28.060]   The character development we get on modern drama,
[01:41:28.060 --> 01:41:30.520]   episodic drama, is so rich and deep.
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:34.120]   And my wife just, while I was gone, watched all of Game
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:36.000]   of Thrones again, just to get caught up
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.400]   as she got ready for the new season.
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:39.200]   And she was just like, there are so many things
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:40.680]   that you see when you see it all together
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:41.720]   that you don't see when it's over.
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:43.520]   Well, that's a good example, because that show is--
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:45.000]   There are so many complicated things going on.
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.360]   There are not many shows that need a wiki and an app
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:48.760]   just to figure out who the hell--
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:50.200]   what's-- who's that guy?
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:51.920]   Why did he shoot him?
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:52.600]   What the--
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:53.160]   It took me a while.
[01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:54.320]   I thought there were three different people
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:55.680]   that were stannas for a long time.
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:56.360]   You know, it was like--
[01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:58.080]   Oh, he's stannas for a while.
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:41:59.360]   They all went to say.
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:01.040]   Yeah, they were the two people that looked the same.
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:02.640]   You just can't keep track of it.
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:05.240]   Exactly.
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:06.280]   I did too.
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:07.560]   And then there's King Slayer.
[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:08.560]   My wife, you're like, not stannas.
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:09.280]   And then the King Slayer came on.
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:10.280]   I said, it's not the King Slayer,
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:12.080]   because his hair's not blonde anymore.
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:13.440]   So I got very confused.
[01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:17.280]   So fortunately, there's a wiki and there's a great app
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:20.400]   on the iPad, but you have to buy each season.
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:23.280]   It's like a freemium app for Game of Thrones.
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:26.760]   It gives you everything you need to know about what's going on.
[01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:29.000]   I swear to God, last season, remember
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.760]   the show where they're all standing on the pier
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:32.680]   and somebody's died.
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:33.760]   I don't know who's died.
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:35.840]   And he's in a boat, and the boat's going down.
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:37.600]   And they keep shooting the flaming arrow,
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:38.400]   and they keep missing.
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:39.560]   I don't know who's shooting.
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:41.240]   And then another guy says, add all the way, kid.
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:42.200]   It's the arrow.
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:44.400]   I don't know who any of these people are.
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:46.960]   And I'm watching this and I'm going,
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:48.760]   I'm sure this is a meaningful scene,
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:50.000]   but I don't understand the meaning,
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.360]   because I don't know who the LA are.
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:53.480]   There's no spoiler alerts here, because Leo doesn't
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:54.120]   know the names of the anime.
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:56.120]   I just told you nothing.
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:58.560]   Did you already talk about the--
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:01.040]   Wasn't the English teacher with this class?
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:02.280]   He was having trouble with it.
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:03.320]   I think it was an English teacher,
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:04.600]   a history teacher that was having trouble
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:06.440]   with his class paying attention.
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:08.960]   So if they got out of hand, he started just writing down
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:10.480]   who dies in Game of Thrones.
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:11.320]   Oh!
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:12.160]   Oh!
[01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:13.600]   And that's cruel!
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:14.960]   He should be fired.
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:16.920]   You know what, it solved that problem.
[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:19.080]   It's a long list, too.
[01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:20.360]   But he just, he would start with the ones they knew,
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:21.640]   but he'd just keep on going,
[01:43:21.640 --> 01:43:23.040]   you know, because he'd already read the whole book.
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:23.880]   Oh.
[01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:24.720]   Work you through it.
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:26.360]   Man, and they've done nothing this season
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:28.200]   to make that better, I can tell you right now.
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:29.960]   All right, we are going to take a break.
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:31.280]   No more spoilers.
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:32.120]   No.
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:33.440]   (scoffs)
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:34.440]   Any more questions?
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:38.360]   I actually, actually got up out of bed last Sunday night,
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:44.600]   because I hadn't watched Game of Thrones or Silicon Valley,
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:48.160]   and I started seeing tweets,
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:50.080]   and I thought this is bad.
[01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:52.840]   So I actually got up out of bed and watched them,
[01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:55.520]   because I knew I was no way I'm gonna keep my head clear,
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:56.640]   so I better watch it.
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:00.640]   Terrible teacher, that's cruel.
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:03.320]   I just thought, well played.
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:04.520]   Well played.
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:08.040]   Hey, did you, I know there's a lot to watch on TV and off,
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:10.680]   but if you missed any of the great stuff
[01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:12.720]   we did this week on Twitch, we've taken it,
[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:15.760]   we've made an eight minute compendium
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:16.880]   of the best of Twitch.
[01:44:16.880 --> 01:44:17.720]   Take a look.
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:21.040]   Previously on Twitch, tech news today.
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:23.520]   Ariel takes his case to the Supreme Court next week,
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:25.040]   but first the company is throwing itself
[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:26.120]   on the mercy of the public.
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:29.920]   ProtectmyAntenna.org is part of that company's PR push
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:33.080]   to convince the world that it's merely renting antennas,
[01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:34.600]   not stealing content.
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:35.840]   Marketing Mavericks.
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:38.320]   What we really see with developers who are successful
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:40.720]   in making more than $100,000 a month
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:45.280]   are using between four and 10 monetization methods per game.
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:46.560]   Quit Live specials.
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:48.280]   I thought it'd be kind of a good thing,
[01:44:48.280 --> 01:44:50.440]   given all the attention to heart bleed
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:52.720]   and the need for people to change their passwords.
[01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:55.920]   To talk about the use of a password vault,
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:57.640]   how you set it up, how you use it,
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:44:59.280]   why it's a good idea.
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:00.280]   Gizwiz.
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:05.280]   The beer belly is a way to come seal and hold liquid.
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:08.920]   And a fake belly makes you look like your sandwich.
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:09.920]   Where?
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:13.000]   I would not walk around the clock with it hanging down.
[01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:13.560]   You know what I think?
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:14.480]   This is a treasure.
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:16.760]   I already have a beer belly, so I don't need that.
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:17.360]   Twitter.
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:19.800]   It's where your brain and tech meet.
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:24.320]   Oh, man.
[01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:26.120]   You still wearing that beer belly, Chen?
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:27.080]   Oh, it's a time.
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:28.400]   I thought you gained a little weight.
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:30.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:31.800]   I'm really glad you ordered that.
[01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:32.360]   I wanted that.
[01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:33.960]   We're one of those for a long time.
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:35.200]   Ever since I saw that on TV.
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:37.520]   It's in my office if you want to keep it.
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:41.120]   Mike Elgin is in charge of our news operation.
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:44.120]   He does, of course, TNT tech news today, Monday through Friday,
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:48.040]   10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern time, 1700 UTC.
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:49.480]   Mike, what's coming up?
[01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:50.920]   What are we looking at this week?
[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:53.280]   Coming up this week, a whole lot of earnings reports.
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:55.720]   Apple, Qualcomm, and Facebook report earnings
[01:45:55.720 --> 01:45:56.880]   on Wednesday to the 23rd.
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:00.800]   Microsoft, Verizon, and Amazon are up next on Thursday, the 24th.
[01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:01.440]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:03.000]   We'll be watching with interest.
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:04.080]   Make sure-- yeah.
[01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:06.560]   Somebody in the chat room said, very kindly,
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:09.960]   I have no more room for a beer belly chat.
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:11.600]   That space is currently occupied.
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:14.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:17.880]   They need to make a beer second belly, or maybe--
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:19.240]   Like, you could have double chin.
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:21.080]   Yeah, I was going to say beer, chin.
[01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:22.080]   Sure.
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:22.080]   Yeah.
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:23.240]   It's a good idea.
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:24.960]   Hey, I hope you're all having a happy Easter.
[01:46:24.960 --> 01:46:26.560]   I don't know if you celebrate Easter,
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:28.840]   but if you're in the group of people that do,
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:30.960]   I hope you had any happy Easter and the Easter Bunny
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:32.720]   was kind to you.
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:34.640]   We had a very good--
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:36.160]   I didn't get it in the promo, but I
[01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:40.720]   wanted to mention this week in law, this week, episode 255.
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:45.800]   The guest-- and I'm going to try to get him on triangulation.
[01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:47.120]   James Barrett.
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:50.520]   He's written a book called Our Final Invention.
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:53.480]   And it's well worth watching the first--
[01:46:53.480 --> 01:46:54.880]   I don't know, 45 minutes of the show.
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:57.200]   Actually, watch the whole show, but the first 45 minutes.
[01:46:57.200 --> 01:47:01.040]   They talk about our final invention.
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:03.800]   Basically, artificial intelligence
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:05.800]   in the end of the human era--
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:08.040]   we've talked a lot about this in the last few episodes
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:12.040]   of triangulation, the idea that in as little as a decade--
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:14.640]   and Ray Kurzweil, another who said this AI could match,
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:16.760]   then surpass human intelligence.
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:20.200]   We had Jeff Hawkins on, founder of Palm a couple of episodes
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:20.480]   ago.
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:25.320]   He's the guy who said he's working on a new kind
[01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:27.680]   of artificial intelligence, actually making hardware
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:30.200]   and software that works the way our brains do.
[01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:31.120]   And he said, you know what?
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:32.200]   I said, are you worried?
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:33.360]   He said, don't worry.
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:34.720]   It's not going to be a problem.
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:36.640]   Machines are not going to take over,
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:40.640]   as long as you don't let them replicate.
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:43.680]   But if you let them replicate, all bets are off.
[01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:49.280]   But he says, what Barrett's been saying is, OK,
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:52.560]   don't you think that with so many people around--
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:53.720]   We're the machines making machines.
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:55.520]   Somebody's going to let the machines make machines,
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:56.720]   and then it's all over.
[01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:58.280]   We already have machines making our cars.
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:00.120]   They're just not making each other yet.
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:02.920]   Our final invention, the heedless pursuit
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:04.320]   of advanced artificial intelligence
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:05.520]   is nothing you could do about it.
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:06.520]   It's too late.
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:09.520]   I-- my big thing is--
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:10.560]   What are you worried about?
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:12.480]   I think we're more likely to virtualize our world
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:14.680]   into a big giant video game that we lock into,
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:16.560]   then have machines take over this world.
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:18.640]   How do you know that hasn't already happened?
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:19.000]   I know.
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:25.800]   Mind learns.
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:26.440]   It's anyway.
[01:48:26.440 --> 01:48:27.640]   Mind blown.
[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:29.280]   One more bit of promo.
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:30.800]   More?
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:32.880]   Oh, let's not forget our t-shirt.
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:33.360]   A new t-shirt.
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:34.520]   This is the one I really like.
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:36.880]   It's now what we do is these are limited time only.
[01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:39.120]   We only allow you to buy these for a month.
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:41.520]   This is our spring 2014 t-shirt.
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:45.480]   Again, a wonderful design from our '99 design team,
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:48.120]   '99 design designers.
[01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:50.000]   There's a tank.
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.240]   We have women's sizes as well, so we have a women's tank.
[01:48:53.240 --> 01:48:55.680]   And we need to get 500 before we'll even
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:58.240]   begin to think about printing these.
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:04.440]   So right now, only 106-inch-old T-double-e-spring.com/twit.
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:06.680]   I think these are very-- I really like these.
[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:08.280]   By the way, the hoodies are starting to arrive.
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:09.720]   People are loving the hoodies.
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:11.640]   People are loving the hoodies.
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:13.360]   So thank you for everybody who bought one.
[01:49:13.360 --> 01:49:15.880]   And once these are sold out, we don't make them anymore.
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:16.240]   That's it.
[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:17.480]   We break the mold.
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:20.200]   We shoot the designer.
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:22.440]   These guys in '99 designs thought this was great.
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:23.720]   I got paid for this, and then some guys
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:25.040]   showed up at the door with a switch.
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:28.160]   You'll never make another design again.
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:30.000]   Actually, they used to do that in the Middle Ages.
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.520]   I remember going to Prague.
[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:34.400]   They have a beautiful in the Old Town Prague.
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:38.120]   A beautiful, very elaborate clock made in the Middle Ages.
[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:40.640]   The people come out in the hour, and they dance,
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:42.120]   and they do all sorts of stuff.
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:44.960]   And the King of Commission, it didn't want another one made,
[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:47.480]   so he blinded the inventor.
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:48.840]   That's cold.
[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:50.040]   It's terrible.
[01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:56.560]   I'm a little worried.
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:49:57.800]   I did a review of this.
[01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:00.640]   I bought this Lacy Little Big Disc.
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:01.240]   Love it.
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:04.400]   Very fast SSD drive for my Manoumac Pro.
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:06.680]   Apparently, the French hardware company, which is now a Seagate
[01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:09.240]   subsidiary, says, virtually everyone who
[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:15.680]   shopped on Lacy's website for the last year is at risk.
[01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:18.320]   A year-long credit card breach, I'm one of them.
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:26.280]   But how could this happen for a year?
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:30.400]   They were informed about the breach March 19th by the FBI.
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:34.520]   They think that all transactions between March 27th, 2013
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:37.840]   and March 10th, 2014 were affected.
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:43.000]   Brian Krebs actually broke this on his Krebs on Security Blog.
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.160]   Last month, he was the guy who discovered it.
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:49.800]   And it's a group of hackers that have broken into dozens
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:53.480]   of online stores that used cold fusion.
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:56.920]   And it's a security flaw they found in Adobe's cold fusion.
[01:50:56.920 --> 01:51:00.560]   Very popular in online commerce.
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:03.200]   Adobe itself, of course, had the similar problem.
[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:05.960]   I think this is the new generation of malware
[01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:06.920]   is going after--
[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:07.720]   Sure.
[01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:10.400]   This is instead of trying to hack your computer or whatever,
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:11.400]   we're going to hack--
[01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:13.560]   it's much more efficient to hack a server that
[01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:17.480]   has 3 million points of data.
[01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:19.440]   So about a year or two ago, I met with this company.
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:20.760]   I'm not going to say the company name,
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:22.960]   because I'm not sure that they're still in business.
[01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:25.600]   But they were coming up with a business solution
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:28.280]   for handling company credit cards, essentially.
[01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:32.280]   And what they did was they issued to each employee
[01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:36.320]   a unique card that could then generate new unique 16-digit
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:41.800]   numbers so that they could restrict how and how much each
[01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:42.520]   employee spent.
[01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:45.360]   So imagine that you went to make a purchase online,
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:48.440]   and you had a unique code that was only good for $50.
[01:51:48.440 --> 01:51:50.040]   And once you used it, it was gone forever.
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:51.360]   It's great.
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:52.320]   Why aren't we doing it?
[01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:53.320]   Like, it's kind of--
[01:51:53.320 --> 01:51:53.840]   Discover.
[01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:57.600]   And I think American Express will give you one-time numbers.
[01:51:57.600 --> 01:51:59.000]   So that's-- if you have--
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:00.320]   you should ask your credit card companies.
[01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:01.880]   Some card companies do this.
[01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:03.960]   Where you call up, you say, I want a one-time number.
[01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:05.240]   They'll generate a number for you.
[01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:07.080]   They're on the website or over the phone.
[01:52:07.080 --> 01:52:08.680]   You use it, and there's two choices.
[01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:10.280]   You can use one that's merchant restricted.
[01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:12.320]   So this will only be used in Amazon.
[01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:13.640]   And you can use one that's only.
[01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:15.040]   You can be used once.
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:16.680]   And then it's no good anymore.
[01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:17.840]   And that's a great idea.
[01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:18.200]   It is.
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:19.720]   It's got to be more convenient than that.
[01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:20.400]   Yeah, it's too hard.
[01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:22.000]   You're not going to do it.
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:23.760]   Chip and Pin is coming in the next year,
[01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:26.440]   so we will get a little bit more secure on our credit cards.
[01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:28.920]   When I'm in Europe, I always feel like I'm a caveman.
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:30.240]   Because they always look at you like that.
[01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:30.800]   What's your pin?
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:31.440]   Slide it in.
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:33.440]   And you're like, oh.
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:35.000]   And they're like, oh, right.
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.440]   There's like a discussion of how to deal
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:40.000]   with the American in his crazy card.
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:43.640]   I used a credit card in the Herdiegrut in Norway.
[01:52:43.640 --> 01:52:46.920]   And the guy practically patted my head.
[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:49.600]   He said, no, it's going to be OK.
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:51.520]   He practically-- he said, yeah, you don't.
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:52.240]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:52.840]   You're American.
[01:52:52.840 --> 01:52:54.520]   I didn't realize it.
[01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:55.880]   Wow.
[01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:57.440]   Wow.
[01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:57.960]   Let's take a break.
[01:52:57.960 --> 01:53:00.880]   When we come back, Maglev trains for all.
[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:02.080]   I just like that's a good tease.
[01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:02.720]   Love that.
[01:53:02.720 --> 01:53:04.720]   Everybody, and you will get a Maglev train,
[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:06.640]   and you will get a Maglev train.
[01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:08.680]   Our show today brought you by Carbonite Online Backup.
[01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:10.480]   I've told you before, you got to back it up.
[01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:13.600]   If you want to get it back, backup is not just
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:18.160]   for the average Joe.
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:19.640]   Yes, you computer geek.
[01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:21.360]   You should be backing up too.
[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:22.520]   Like you more than anyone.
[01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:23.920]   You're setting the tone.
[01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:26.440]   And you don't help your friends and family back up too.
[01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:28.120]   You want a solution that's easy to set up.
[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:30.480]   It's one of those solutions you can set up and forget.
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:33.360]   You pay for it once a year, and you just know you're safe,
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:34.680]   then you want Carbonite.
[01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:39.080]   Mac or PC, Carbonite is flat rate online backup.
[01:53:39.080 --> 01:53:39.920]   It's automatic.
[01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:41.320]   You don't have to think about it.
[01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:43.560]   It's totally secure.
[01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:45.800]   In fact, you can use-- if you're worried about Hartley,
[01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:47.440]   then they don't have a Hartbied problem.
[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:49.760]   But if you were worried about that kind of security,
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:53.200]   you can use what they call trust no one encryption.
[01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:55.920]   Carbonite supports that, which means only you can unlock it,
[01:53:55.920 --> 01:53:57.120]   only you.
[01:53:57.120 --> 01:53:59.360]   So it's super private.
[01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:02.080]   It's one of the few backup solutions that uses TNO backup.
[01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:05.000]   Steve Gibson vetted it for us.
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:08.680]   It also has a lot of nice features.
[01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:10.520]   You can get to your backup anywhere.
[01:54:10.520 --> 01:54:12.000]   You log on to your Carbonite account.
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.160]   They even have free Carbonite apps.
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:15.200]   Plans are very affordable.
[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:18.640]   $59.99 a year for everything on a single computer.
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:21.080]   Is less than $5 a month?
[01:54:21.080 --> 01:54:22.720]   It's a great deal.
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:27.160]   And they have plans for larger small businesses and so forth.
[01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:28.520]   You got to back it up to get it back.
[01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:31.880]   These guys know-- these are the guys.
[01:54:31.880 --> 01:54:33.960]   They know what they're doing.
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:36.320]   Carbonite.com-- use our offer code Twit.
[01:54:36.320 --> 01:54:38.120]   You'll get two months with purchase.
[01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:38.800]   It's two weeks for you.
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:40.280]   Do not need a credit card.
[01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:41.840]   But do use our offer code when you sign up.
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:45.080]   That way you'll get two months when you decide to buy.
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:46.600]   You got to back it up to get it back.
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:47.960]   Do it right.
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:51.800]   Harvollnite.com.
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:53.280]   Questions, any questions?
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:55.640]   From our question control panel.
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:56.720]   Yes, Leo.
[01:54:56.720 --> 01:55:00.800]   We have from Hawaii, COP in Washington, US.
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:04.800]   What is Google going to do with the end of Google Voice?
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:06.320]   So this is something that's coming up.
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:07.880]   And I don't think it's the end of Google Voice.
[01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:08.760]   God, I pray it's not.
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:11.520]   But March 15th-- wait a minute, was it March 15?
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:12.480]   March 18th?
[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:13.280]   Wait a minute.
[01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:14.080]   No.
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:15.040]   We're in April now.
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:16.040]   It's from May 15th, you mean?
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:17.600]   So maybe May 15th.
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:20.960]   They've announced that they're going to merge voice with Hangouts.
[01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:23.880]   Google's been doing this all along, right?
[01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:27.000]   They took Google Talk Made apart of Hangouts.
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.520]   The concern, and nobody knows, is that some features
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:33.240]   may get swallowed in that merger.
[01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:35.240]   If they do, I will be very disappointed.
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:38.480]   I remember Google bought Grand Central to create Google
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:40.360]   Voice.
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:43.720]   And it's insanely useful for free.
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:45.080]   Use it, right?
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:47.320]   I mostly just use Hangouts.
[01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:49.520]   I don't really--
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:50.640]   I don't talk to people on--
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:52.440]   Sometimes I give out a Google Voice number.
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:54.440]   If I'm working with, say, a PR contact,
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:56.880]   and they really, really want a phone number,
[01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:59.080]   I'm a little hesitant to give out my personal phone.
[01:55:59.080 --> 01:56:00.760]   So I give them a Google Voice number.
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:01.680]   I know I can get text.
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:02.520]   I know I can get--
[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:03.520]   I'm a troll it.
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:04.120]   It's free.
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:07.080]   I think within Hangouts, you can already
[01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:09.760]   add a phone number to the Hangout, which
[01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:11.680]   seem to have been quietly rolled out.
[01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:14.040]   And I would imagine that this is a similar kind of inbound,
[01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:15.520]   outbound routing feature in the--
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:20.520]   It's bad for people like me who use Obie High or Talk A Tone.
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:22.680]   There are a number of services I use both.
[01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:25.640]   That's how I know, that tie to Google Voice.
[01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:29.360]   And so I, for instance, place phone calls on my iPad,
[01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:30.680]   which is amazing.
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:31.600]   I was one of--
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:34.240]   my iPad Mini is big for a phone,
[01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:35.880]   but I was one phone capability.
[01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:37.360]   If somebody calls my Google Voice number,
[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:40.440]   rings my iPad among all the other devices,
[01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:45.080]   using Talk A Tone, which is a free and premium service.
[01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:47.480]   I get text messages, Google Voice text messages,
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:48.000]   and phone calls.
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.120]   I can answer the phone.
[01:56:49.120 --> 01:56:50.160]   It's awesome.
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:51.840]   That's not going to work after May 15th.
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:52.400]   Obie High, same thing.
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:54.120]   That better that it'll be integrated, though.
[01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:54.760]   It's working now.
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:57.560]   You can already do that and add phones and remove phones.
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:56:59.280]   So I would imagine that this is--
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:00.360]   it'll just be integrated.
[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:03.480]   Well, Talk A Tone does something a little weird as does Obie High.
[01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:05.320]   I think they integrate through Google Chat.
[01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:07.120]   They do something weird.
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:08.440]   But they sent me a notice.
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:10.520]   This is after May 15th, Talk A Tone
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:12.360]   will not work with Google Voice.
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:15.560]   There are no exceptions.
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:18.800]   But you can transition to a new account, I guess.
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:20.640]   Move your voice number, but that means it's not
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:22.640]   going to be Google Voice anymore.
[01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:24.120]   I don't care about Talk A Tone.
[01:57:24.120 --> 01:57:25.760]   I want Google Voice.
[01:57:25.760 --> 01:57:28.000]   So this is just a service that worked with Google Voice.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000]   I think one thing that's really missing in the Hangout
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:33.200]   app in general is that when I'm overseas,
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:38.840]   I make almost all my calls with Apple FaceTime Audio.
[01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:40.040]   I don't need to do it video.
[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:42.080]   I just want to talk to people.
[01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:44.840]   And I feel like that's one thing that you don't--
[01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:46.120]   and Hangout, you can add a number,
[01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:48.480]   but you can't just do a voice call.
[01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:49.840]   And I think that that is something
[01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:51.840]   that I would love to see.
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:56.000]   Because obviously we do a lot of Hangouts.
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.400]   So I use the Hangout app a lot.
[01:57:57.400 --> 01:57:58.720]   But being able to do that is--
[01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:00.480]   But what's going away is XMPP.
[01:58:00.480 --> 01:58:04.640]   And that's what both Talk A Tone and Hang Obie High use.
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:05.760]   It's Jabba, right?
[01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:06.840]   Yeah, it's Jabba.
[01:58:06.840 --> 01:58:09.240]   It's what Google Talk was the underlying service of Google
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:09.840]   Talk.
[01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:10.720]   They killed Talk.
[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:13.000]   They kept XMPP going for a little longer.
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:14.640]   But that's over May 15th.
[01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:17.160]   And I guess that really-- maybe this was Google's plan--
[01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:18.880]   cuts off these third-party services
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:20.560]   riding on top of voice.
[01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:23.960]   I would love to see Hangouts add some features like--
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:26.840]   I mean, one of the reasons I think our audience is particularly
[01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:29.040]   interested is I've been pushing Obie High for a long time.
[01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:30.160]   This was a great deal.
[01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:31.800]   You buy a $40 hardware device.
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:34.520]   You got a landline phone that uses your Google Voice.
[01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:37.360]   It was really awesome.
[01:58:37.360 --> 01:58:40.680]   But you know, I might as well toss it now.
[01:58:40.680 --> 01:58:42.400]   I'm finding myself-- I can barely remember.
[01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:43.280]   I was very embarrassed.
[01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:46.560]   I had to give a number, an international flight, for my wife.
[01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:49.040]   And I realized it took me a little while
[01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:50.560]   to come up with my wife's phone number now.
[01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:54.520]   Because I just know her as whatever I say.
[01:58:54.520 --> 01:58:56.720]   And I haven't dialed her actual number for a long time.
[01:58:56.720 --> 01:58:58.720]   And I think that we're a decade away
[01:58:58.720 --> 01:58:59.960]   from not having phone numbers.
[01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:02.200]   I mean, I don't think that we were really going
[01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:03.440]   to do this for much longer.
[01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:04.920]   I mean, the big problem with a lot of these.
[01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:07.120]   I don't mind having one number for the rest of my life.
[01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:08.360]   But I don't think it's going to be one number.
[01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:09.640]   I just don't think it's going to be a number.
[01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:12.080]   You have to have a--
[01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:12.880]   Your Skype ID.
[01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:16.520]   You have to have an ID that is unique.
[01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:17.840]   But I think we're going to have--
[01:59:17.840 --> 01:59:19.800]   like our Skype ID or our--
[01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:21.120]   Our numbers work so well though.
[01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:22.880]   Because if you've got area--
[01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:25.760]   I mean, everybody in the world has a unique phone number.
[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:27.200]   But I pick my numbers now.
[01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:30.040]   Like my Android phone is a Washington DC phone,
[01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:31.200]   because that's why they're obvious.
[01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:31.880]   And this one is this.
[01:59:31.880 --> 01:59:33.480]   But it doesn't-- but I guess for me,
[01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:35.120]   I think that that whole global needing
[01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:38.200]   to be specific somewhere doesn't really mean anything anymore.
[01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:41.320]   I mean, I think that it's just how to contact me
[01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:42.120]   is what's important.
[01:59:42.120 --> 01:59:45.320]   And I don't know if my--
[01:59:45.320 --> 01:59:47.120]   I like the fact that without a number,
[01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:49.280]   now I control completely, like, who can call me?
[01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:50.520]   Who can call me?
[01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:54.800]   And the big problem with a lot of these right now
[01:59:54.800 --> 01:59:56.960]   is that the VoIP solutions actually
[01:59:56.960 --> 01:59:58.480]   don't manage bandwidth very well.
[01:59:58.480 --> 02:00:02.000]   So that's the biggest problem that I have overseas,
[02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.120]   is that they try to make it really high quality,
[02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:08.640]   whether it's go to meeting or Apple FaceTime Audio
[02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:09.480]   or any of these other ones.
[02:00:09.480 --> 02:00:11.760]   They try to use up too much Skype, even.
[02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:13.760]   Whereas what you really need is something that I can say,
[02:00:13.760 --> 02:00:14.680]   OK, I want low bandwidth.
[02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:16.080]   I don't want to use more than 8K a second.
[02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:16.600]   It's a phone.
[02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:18.000]   But the phone, you make it phone.
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.320]   And then I can get a good solid connection.
[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:23.000]   You know what this could be very good for our companies,
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:26.120]   like Twilio, that provide that type of underlying--
[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:27.360]   they do the infrastructure, right?
[02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:28.640]   And so this will be good.
[02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:30.080]   Third party developers will be fine.
[02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:31.160]   No, it won't be Google Voice.
[02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:33.040]   But it could be the third party developers are--
[02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:33.680]   Oh, I agree.
[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:35.240]   Twilio and do that kind of stuff.
[02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:35.600]   I agree.
[02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:36.600]   And there are lots of good choices.
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:37.160]   Skype's a good choice.
[02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:39.640]   We use TeamSpeak for a bunch of work.
[02:00:39.640 --> 02:00:40.160]   Right, right, right.
[02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:41.720]   Really low bandwidth impact.
[02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:42.720]   It's just not free.
[02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:43.560]   Mumble.
[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:45.200]   We've been lucky because we had free.
[02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:45.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:47.240]   When we have it, we just put up our uncertainty.
[02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:48.360]   And I don't want to be chicken little.
[02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:50.880]   I don't know what's going to happen.
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:52.280]   This is merely something that Google
[02:00:52.280 --> 02:00:55.760]   said they were going to deprecate years, almost a year ago,
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:56.960]   XMPP.
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:00:59.600]   But I do hope-- and I just--
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:01.600]   I'm not saying this bad thing's going to happen.
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:05.040]   I just want to put a word out to anybody who's at Google.
[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:08.240]   Voice is holaciously useful.
[02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:11.280]   Even if Alex doesn't want to use it, I want to use it.
[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:13.480]   Within Hangouts, you can toggle to Voice.
[02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:15.840]   And in fact, I did that yesterday with my Fitbit
[02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:17.880]   as I was walking through town.
[02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:20.640]   You do have to turn the--
[02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:24.280]   within Hangouts, you have to hit the no video thing, right?
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:25.120]   Which is--
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:25.440]   OK.
[02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:27.320]   I mean, it's not quite a hack and it's fine.
[02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:30.040]   But what that is is just toggling everything over to Voice
[02:01:30.040 --> 02:01:32.040]   and then all of a sudden, Voice really improves.
[02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:34.640]   So it's a user interface thing that Google obviously
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:37.080]   does to push you into video, but it's just
[02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:38.440]   as effective to send Voice.
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:39.640]   Yeah, no, it is.
[02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:41.480]   As I said, I just think that that-- for me,
[02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:42.680]   I use it so often.
[02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:44.800]   And if it was there, I would never
[02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:46.240]   call anyone in my company again.
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:48.960]   You know, like I would be just constantly using that
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:49.880]   as the phone.
[02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:51.440]   That would be--
[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:53.080]   And that's the issue.
[02:01:53.080 --> 02:01:56.560]   And what I love about Hangouts in general is--
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:01.480]   so for instance, is that I can have text conversations,
[02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:04.360]   video conversations, and I can do it on my laptop, on my iPad,
[02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:05.040]   on my iPhone.
[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:07.560]   All of those are continuous between any of those.
[02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:08.920]   And I don't have to think about it.
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:10.280]   And it's just a much better solution.
[02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:12.920]   And my disclaimer, of course, is that we do 300 Hangouts
[02:02:12.920 --> 02:02:14.800]   a year and a lot of them are for Google.
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:16.360]   So just to make sure I say that.
[02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:17.360]   But we like a lot.
[02:02:17.360 --> 02:02:18.720]   It's been somewhat transparent.
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:20.160]   It's moved from Voice to Hangouts.
[02:02:20.160 --> 02:02:21.600]   So so far, so good.
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:22.240]   I know.
[02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:23.120]   I use Hangouts all the time.
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:25.000]   I make Hangouts all the time.
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.880]   And you have WhatsApp if you want to.
[02:02:27.880 --> 02:02:28.720]   Well, and--
[02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:30.280]   They're going to add phone, by the way.
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:30.640]   I know.
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:32.080]   But the problem with WhatsApp is it's
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:33.240]   attached to one of my phone numbers.
[02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:35.520]   And I want to attach to all of my phone numbers.
[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:36.600]   That's the problem with--
[02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:39.240]   I use WhatsApp because I have a lot of our partners
[02:02:39.240 --> 02:02:42.840]   in South America and Africa use it.
[02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:45.320]   So to content them, I'm using WhatsApp.
[02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:49.160]   But the problem is it limits me to one device.
[02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:51.600]   Pono got funded.
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:52.560]   I just like saying that.
[02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:53.400]   Pono got funded.
[02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:54.840]   Why, everybody.
[02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:56.600]   $6 million to the tune of $6 million.
[02:02:56.600 --> 02:02:59.200]   Pono is Neil Young's high--
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:02:59.840]   Are you getting one?
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:00.320]   --bit rate.
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:01.320]   Yes.
[02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:02.880]   High bit rate-- of course I am.
[02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:03.600]   Music player.
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:05.440]   It looks like a--
[02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:10.040]   looks like a kind of like a triangular iPod.
[02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:13.440]   And I ordered one for $400.
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:15.040]   Kickstarter has now closed.
[02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:16.440]   They were asking for $800,000.
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:19.040]   They raised $6.2 million.
[02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:21.360]   There's some question, however, over whether this
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:28.640]   is snake oil because the premise is that even uncompressed CD
[02:03:28.640 --> 02:03:33.120]   quality audio, 44.1,000 kilohertz--
[02:03:33.120 --> 02:03:34.040]   40,000 for 1,000.
[02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:35.040]   But they're not only 44.1.
[02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:36.400]   They're doing much higher than that, aren't they?
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:40.400]   Well, this is CD and 16-bit resolution is not enough.
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:40.920]   It isn't.
[02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:42.120]   You're losing music.
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:42.640]   You are.
[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:45.000]   And Golden-eared people--
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.200]   I talked to Joe Walsh, who was on the Amnation a little while
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:47.840]   ago.
[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:49.760]   And I said, what do you record at?
[02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:51.200]   Record master at.
[02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:55.200]   He said, 44.1, 24-bit.
[02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:57.280]   He said anything more-- anything with a higher sample
[02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:00.920]   where the file size gets too big.
[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:02.120]   I don't know if it says I've--
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:03.120]   I've just--
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:05.880]   Well, so for recording, the acquisition medium,
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:07.480]   I think that's crazy, to be honest with you.
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:08.120]   I mean, I--
[02:04:08.120 --> 02:04:09.920]   Hard to actually use higher risk.
[02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:10.680]   Well, yeah.
[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:12.720]   And the thing is, is that when you record--
[02:04:12.720 --> 02:04:17.760]   like, I had one where I accidentally recorded 40 dB off.
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:19.760]   But I recorded it at 192.
[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:20.760]   And when I--
[02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:21.840]   Scaled up information.
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:22.760]   There was enough information there
[02:04:22.760 --> 02:04:24.240]   that it sounded just fine.
[02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:25.800]   Now, the--
[02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:28.520]   So you recorded-- well, what do you prefer to record it?
[02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:30.360]   Well, for voice stuff, I'm still doing 44.1.
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:32.440]   If we're doing music, I record it 192.
[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:32.960]   Whoa.
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:33.880]   You know, I mean, so it's--
[02:04:33.880 --> 02:04:39.600]   So this player will play 192.000 Hertz by 24-bits.
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:41.080]   That is very--
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:41.960]   lot of detail.
[02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:45.040]   The big thing is, is what you're committing to in that player,
[02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:48.240]   though, is an entirely different scale of headphone
[02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:49.240]   and--
[02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:50.240]   Right.
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:51.240]   And you've got a very good quality DAC.
[02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:52.240]   Or you won't hear it.
[02:04:52.240 --> 02:04:53.680]   But you definitely can hear it at 44.1.
[02:04:53.680 --> 02:04:55.440]   What I will say is at 44.1, you can definitely hear it.
[02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:57.080]   And where you hear it is when the song's ending,
[02:04:57.080 --> 02:04:58.680]   and the high tones, and the--
[02:04:58.680 --> 02:04:59.920]   you'll hear quantization.
[02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:02.080]   So it's basically when you see blocking--
[02:05:02.080 --> 02:05:03.080]   you know, blocking YouTube--
[02:05:03.080 --> 02:05:04.080]   So it's not golden.
[02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:05.720]   It's definitely not a golden ears product.
[02:05:05.720 --> 02:05:08.120]   This is going to be something that people are going to be
[02:05:08.120 --> 02:05:08.800]   happy with.
[02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:10.600]   I think the people who are buying it are definitely
[02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:12.720]   going to be people who can hear that
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:13.680]   and are willing to invest.
[02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:17.280]   If you take your little earphones that are--
[02:05:17.280 --> 02:05:19.160]   You're like, I want to put your iPod headphones in this,
[02:05:19.160 --> 02:05:20.160]   of course.
[02:05:20.160 --> 02:05:23.720]   The commitment is you're not going to spend less than $3 to $500
[02:05:23.720 --> 02:05:25.280]   on headphones and hear any difference.
[02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:26.280]   Right.
[02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:27.360]   So that's the other thing to remember, is that you're buying
[02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:29.240]   this, but you're also going to have to invest in headphones
[02:05:29.240 --> 02:05:30.240]   that can hear it.
[02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:31.760]   And really, the ones you're really going to hear it on
[02:05:31.760 --> 02:05:35.600]   are these really expensive open-air ones that are $1,000 to $2,000
[02:05:35.600 --> 02:05:36.120]   each.
[02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:38.080]   You definitely are going to hear the difference.
[02:05:38.080 --> 02:05:38.920]   But that's what you're--
[02:05:38.920 --> 02:05:39.720]   But this is--
[02:05:39.720 --> 02:05:41.480]   But if it's only because you spend so much money--
[02:05:41.480 --> 02:05:43.600]   No, people spend--
[02:05:43.600 --> 02:05:44.520]   You can definitely hear it.
[02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:45.440]   You can definitely hear a difference.
[02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:46.280]   Oh, no, no, no.
[02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:47.520]   I mean, I don't know.
[02:05:47.520 --> 02:05:49.440]   I used to be a stereo file a long time ago.
[02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:50.560]   By the way, these will not be--
[02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:51.840]   Do not have money to continue.
[02:05:51.840 --> 02:05:54.720]   --to be compressed, but with lossless compression.
[02:05:54.720 --> 02:05:57.120]   They'll be stored in flack.
[02:05:57.120 --> 02:05:59.560]   No DRM, which I like.
[02:05:59.560 --> 02:06:01.760]   That's brave of the music industry.
[02:06:01.760 --> 02:06:04.560]   The companies that will make albums available.
[02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:07.720]   And the master quality albums available with no copy
[02:06:07.720 --> 02:06:09.640]   protection are really saying we trust you.
[02:06:09.640 --> 02:06:11.280]   Well, I mean, I think DRM is--
[02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:11.600]   It's dead.
[02:06:11.600 --> 02:06:13.240]   For music, I think it's dead.
[02:06:13.240 --> 02:06:14.720]   And you know, it's over.
[02:06:14.720 --> 02:06:16.520]   So I'm happy.
[02:06:16.520 --> 02:06:18.040]   Look forward to this.
[02:06:18.040 --> 02:06:20.800]   They come with a two inch tape deck.
[02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:21.680]   That would be awesome.
[02:06:21.680 --> 02:06:22.680]   Real to real, man.
[02:06:22.680 --> 02:06:23.880]   Oh, man.
[02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:25.960]   It's 32 RPM.
[02:06:25.960 --> 02:06:26.760]   And some of us--
[02:06:26.760 --> 02:06:27.800]   I tried to-- I did that in Katadi.
[02:06:27.800 --> 02:06:28.840]   I cut that Prairie Sun.
[02:06:28.840 --> 02:06:30.800]   I cut two inch tape with razors.
[02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:32.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:33.720]   Is it an eight track?
[02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:35.200]   Was it eight track?
[02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:36.160]   I didn't do--
[02:06:36.160 --> 02:06:37.520]   It was a bajillion.
[02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:38.400]   A bajillion track?
[02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:39.120]   Jesus.
[02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:40.160]   A bajillion track.
[02:06:40.160 --> 02:06:41.080]   Mine was only--
[02:06:41.080 --> 02:06:42.040]   Mine was only quarter inch.
[02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:42.560]   No, it's not a track.
[02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:44.560]   I'm really glad that I was in radio long enough
[02:06:44.560 --> 02:06:50.520]   to have to have to cut a quarter inch tape, where a cross vade
[02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:53.520]   was 45 degrees and a cut was 90 degrees.
[02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:55.600]   And that was--
[02:06:55.600 --> 02:06:57.160]   It was good times.
[02:06:57.160 --> 02:06:59.000]   Letty fingers, man.
[02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.080]   So Jill, they're talking about this idea
[02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:04.120]   that you used to have to record on a magnetic medium
[02:07:04.120 --> 02:07:05.240]   that's really--
[02:07:05.240 --> 02:07:06.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:07.200]   Cut into the beat.
[02:07:07.200 --> 02:07:07.720]   Wait, wait, wait.
[02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:10.720]   Cut into the beat was like this.
[02:07:10.720 --> 02:07:11.200]   And then--
[02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:11.720]   Cards?
[02:07:11.720 --> 02:07:12.640]   Do you guys remember cards?
[02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:13.240]   Cards?
[02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:14.040]   Oh, yeah.
[02:07:14.040 --> 02:07:15.480]   We're all radio guys.
[02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:16.400]   I apologize, Jill.
[02:07:16.400 --> 02:07:17.400]   I apologize.
[02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:19.720]   But yeah, you used every radio station.
[02:07:19.720 --> 02:07:21.720]   It had a little template that you would cut--
[02:07:21.720 --> 02:07:22.320]   Loomin' and Block.
[02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:22.840]   You'd cut on.
[02:07:22.840 --> 02:07:24.600]   They have razor blades all over the place.
[02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:27.360]   Very handy when you wanted Coke.
[02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:28.520]   You had the razor blade.
[02:07:28.520 --> 02:07:28.680]   And--
[02:07:28.680 --> 02:07:29.880]   And you had a good excuse to have it.
[02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:31.720]   And then we used a grease pencil.
[02:07:31.720 --> 02:07:32.680]   So you'd mark it.
[02:07:32.680 --> 02:07:33.280]   Yeah, right.
[02:07:33.280 --> 02:07:35.280]   And you slice it with a-- mark it with a grease pencil.
[02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:36.000]   Look at that.
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:36.440]   There it is.
[02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:37.720]   There it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:37.720 --> 02:07:38.480]   I was looking to touch it.
[02:07:38.480 --> 02:07:39.200]   I haven't touched it.
[02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:40.200]   Oh, oh.
[02:07:40.200 --> 02:07:40.720]   Oh, oh.
[02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:42.040]   You know what's really sad?
[02:07:42.040 --> 02:07:43.320]   Your commercials would all be on cards.
[02:07:43.320 --> 02:07:45.240]   The music, too, and some crap stations,
[02:07:45.240 --> 02:07:49.600]   like the ones I worked at, these were basically eight tracks,
[02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:51.400]   except they only had one track.
[02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:52.920]   And they had a Q-tone at the beginning,
[02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:55.880]   so they would always queue up back to it.
[02:07:55.880 --> 02:07:57.600]   And slam it in, push back--
[02:07:57.600 --> 02:07:58.520]   Slam it in, boom.
[02:07:58.520 --> 02:07:58.920]   And then--
[02:07:58.920 --> 02:07:59.520]   That's fine.
[02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:00.240]   You know what's really funny?
[02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:01.840]   That's how you got your listeners, too.
[02:08:01.840 --> 02:08:03.840]   So if you had them call in, you'd slam one of them,
[02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:05.720]   hit record, and talked them on the phone,
[02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:07.360]   and make one of them, and then put it back in,
[02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:10.160]   and play it for everybody.
[02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:11.640]   This is the real deal.
[02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:12.640]   This is a fidelity back.
[02:08:12.640 --> 02:08:13.760]   It is so awesome.
[02:08:13.760 --> 02:08:15.560]   Aster cart.
[02:08:15.560 --> 02:08:16.280]   Missed those days.
[02:08:16.280 --> 02:08:18.080]   A lot of radio stations are right in one of these.
[02:08:18.080 --> 02:08:19.280]   It's sad, because it gets in your head.
[02:08:19.280 --> 02:08:21.000]   And I think this means I have Alzheimer's.
[02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.840]   But I can remember the cart numbers of songs.
[02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:26.560]   Like Kenny Rogers, "The Gambling" in 1938.
[02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:28.760]   That was the number.
[02:08:28.760 --> 02:08:30.120]   You know, if you find one.
[02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:32.080]   Act 1 Lemon Seeds Service was 134.
[02:08:32.080 --> 02:08:33.960]   You remember, too?
[02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:35.440]   Because you grab it all the time.
[02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:36.800]   And you're going to get your little ground.
[02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:37.640]   You're a little gambler.
[02:08:37.640 --> 02:08:38.480]   I'd always get that one.
[02:08:38.480 --> 02:08:39.120]   Yep.
[02:08:39.120 --> 02:08:42.280]   You have to know and hold them.
[02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:44.760]   Oh, where to fold them?
[02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:46.000]   Oh, I did mention Maglev.
[02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:49.280]   So let's mention briefly the popular science article.
[02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:53.800]   The company in Japan that owns the rights to Maglev trains
[02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:56.840]   says, "We will give the technology to the United States
[02:08:56.840 --> 02:08:57.320]   for free.
[02:08:57.320 --> 02:08:57.760]   JR.
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:08:58.800]   OK."
[02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:02.240]   Says, "It will not charge the US to license proprietary Maglev
[02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:03.240]   technology.
[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:06.280]   It allows the trains to hover four inches above tracks
[02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:11.040]   and travel at speeds of 310 miles an hour."
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:14.120]   This will never fly in the US.
[02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:15.440]   We're really missing out, too.
[02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:15.960]   I know.
[02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:15.960]   I mean--
[02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:17.680]   It's barely enough trains as it is.
[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:19.200]   Have you ever-- has anybody-- have you ever
[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:20.440]   ridden another Maglev?
[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:20.960]   No.
[02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:22.200]   No, look, it's an Amaglo.
[02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:23.600]   Like a bullet train?
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:24.960]   When we do work in Tokyo, we always
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:28.200]   go up to outside in Agonown.
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:29.640]   And there's a high speed train.
[02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:31.960]   I don't know if it's Amaglo, but it's a really fast--
[02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:34.880]   it's probably 180, 200 miles an hour.
[02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:36.600]   And it is awesome.
[02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:38.560]   And every time I'm on it, I'm just like,
[02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:41.600]   I cannot believe that we don't have these.
[02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:43.720]   I mean, it's just-- it's so--
[02:09:43.720 --> 02:09:45.600]   people are bringing little things to eat.
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:50.440]   And I take Amtrak all the time, up between DC and New York.
[02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:51.560]   That's the plan.
[02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:52.080]   That's the plan.
[02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:55.640]   They want to build a 300 mile an hour train from New York
[02:09:55.640 --> 02:09:56.160]   to DC.
[02:09:56.160 --> 02:09:58.680]   It would make the trip in 40 minutes.
[02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:00.080]   No, I'm sorry.
[02:10:00.080 --> 02:10:01.160]   I'm sorry, in an hour.
[02:10:01.160 --> 02:10:01.640]   Because New York--
[02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:03.840]   Assello right now is like two hours and 45 minutes,
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:04.840]   I think, from DC to New York.
[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:05.560]   That's the Assello.
[02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:08.280]   The regular Amtrak is still the first to four hours.
[02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:10.440]   But I took an Assello once.
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:13.360]   And because the tracks are so crappy, half the time
[02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:14.400]   it's going slow.
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:15.400]   You can't go fast.
[02:10:15.400 --> 02:10:17.320]   But it's still two hours and 45 minutes.
[02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:18.640]   Save that extra hour at 15.
[02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:22.120]   Go ahead.
[02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:24.520]   Yeah, the infrastructure is terrible.
[02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:26.520]   I mean, they're running in the same infrastructure
[02:10:26.520 --> 02:10:27.240]   on the same route.
[02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:28.360]   So there are traffic issues.
[02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:31.240]   And there are-- it becomes very narrow.
[02:10:31.240 --> 02:10:32.320]   The terrible infrastructure.
[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:36.800]   So Amtrak right now is trying to fix up a Union station
[02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:38.040]   in Washington, DC.
[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:39.040]   And rather than--
[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:40.200]   You know what the bill for that is?
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:42.440]   $7.5 billion.
[02:10:42.440 --> 02:10:44.120]   I spent one morning on the tracks.
[02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:45.280]   The station there is fine.
[02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:46.120]   Who cares?
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:46.600]   It's fine.
[02:10:46.600 --> 02:10:47.920]   It's going to be a dumpy station.
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:48.920]   Let's get good tracks.
[02:10:48.920 --> 02:10:50.760]   I keep the birds out of it.
[02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:52.240]   It's expensive to build maglevs.
[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:55.280]   But at least we won't have to pay lights and sink fees.
[02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:59.560]   And True Blood is true.
[02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:01.600]   This is actually a very big story.
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:07.560]   Artificial blood-- welcome, trust.
[02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:10.360]   Welcome, trust funded stem cell research
[02:11:10.360 --> 02:11:13.720]   has produced red blood cells fit for transfusion,
[02:11:13.720 --> 02:11:18.040]   paving the way for mass production of artificial bloods
[02:11:18.040 --> 02:11:21.600]   in factories.
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:22.600]   This is in the UK.
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:24.040]   That's why it's got a strange name.
[02:11:24.040 --> 02:11:27.520]   Welcome, trust.
[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:30.280]   Limitless supply of type O blood free of disease compatible
[02:11:30.280 --> 02:11:33.760]   with all patients.
[02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:35.520]   Currently it costs about 120 pounds
[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:37.640]   to transfuse a single unit of blood.
[02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:40.240]   If you could actually manufacture blood using this technique,
[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:43.200]   it would be a lot cheaper.
[02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:44.760]   So this is very exciting news.
[02:11:44.760 --> 02:11:46.000]   This could be a big breakthrough.
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:49.880]   And it means the vampires, you can come out of the closet.
[02:11:49.880 --> 02:11:51.160]   Come on now, guys.
[02:11:51.160 --> 02:11:51.920]   It's OK.
[02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:54.520]   We've got blood for you.
[02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:57.640]   All right, I think I'm going to wrap it up after that bad joke.
[02:11:57.640 --> 02:12:00.840]   I have no reason to go on.
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:01.440]   Anything else?
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:02.200]   No, I'm just looking.
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:04.280]   Hey, Jill, I want to thank you for coming all the way out
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:04.760]   here.
[02:12:04.760 --> 02:12:05.260]   Oh, thank you.
[02:12:05.260 --> 02:12:05.800]   It's my pleasure.
[02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:07.800]   Next time, Dan, you've got to come all the way out here.
[02:12:07.800 --> 02:12:08.240]   We'll be right back.
[02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:08.760]   We'll be right back.
[02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:09.760]   We'll be right back.
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:10.920]   It's really nice to have you.
[02:12:10.920 --> 02:12:13.080]   Dan Patterson, what are you working on next?
[02:12:13.080 --> 02:12:15.880]   What's DanPanson.com, of course?
[02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:17.080]   Yeah, so right.
[02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:18.600]   I just got back from this trip from Cairo,
[02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:20.400]   where we spent several weeks training
[02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:22.280]   student-use human rights activists,
[02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:26.000]   how to use mobile devices, and encryption, security,
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.480]   and storytelling tactics on Android devices.
[02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:31.600]   So what's next is managing the content that comes out
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:34.720]   of places like Darfur, Cordafan, Porcidin,
[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:37.080]   very interesting places within Sudan.
[02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:39.280]   And then after that, I might have just
[02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:40.960]   been cast on a reality show.
[02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:41.960]   What?
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:43.080]   Yeah, we'll see.
[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:44.440]   Well, that was.
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:45.320]   Silicon Alley?
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:45.840]   Oh, it's a turn.
[02:12:45.840 --> 02:12:48.760]   I can't-- you know, that is my next.
[02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:49.200]   We'll see.
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:52.800]   I have not signed anything, but it involves desert islands
[02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:54.880]   and surviving, so--
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:55.960]   No.
[02:12:55.960 --> 02:12:56.920]   Oh, my God.
[02:12:56.920 --> 02:12:58.080]   No.
[02:12:58.080 --> 02:13:01.000]   Well, I'm rooting for you.
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:01.480]   Yeah.
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:02.240]   Oh, that's exciting.
[02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:03.200]   Well, good luck.
[02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:04.920]   When will you know?
[02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:06.000]   I know now.
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.600]   We're just talking about timing and money and--
[02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:11.040]   Do they pay you to do stuff like that?
[02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:12.880]   Well, they do.
[02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:13.800]   How much?
[02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:14.920]   Yeah, we'll see.
[02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:16.880]   OK, so you're negotiating that.
[02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:17.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:13:17.440 --> 02:13:19.680]   We're chattering.
[02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:22.880]   Do you say things like I will not eat bugs?
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:24.480]   Yeah, that's what we're actually talking about.
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:26.280]   Like, aye, I won't do anything that's embarrassing
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:28.480]   to my friends, family, colleagues, you know, a career.
[02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:30.400]   And you're allowed to stipulate that,
[02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:32.400]   or is that something they fight you over?
[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:35.400]   No, we want you to embarrass your friends and family.
[02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:36.840]   Nobody's pushed back yet.
[02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:39.000]   But safety is--
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.080]   I mean, that's one question.
[02:13:41.080 --> 02:13:44.400]   Are you going to be naked in this show?
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:47.640]   That-- no, I will not do anything.
[02:13:47.640 --> 02:13:48.920]   No nudity.
[02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:50.800]   OK, because there is one.
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:52.080]   I was shocked.
[02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:53.120]   That is the craziest.
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:55.000]   I'm tuning around on the dial.
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:56.920]   I immediately erased the channel, it's Discovery Channel.
[02:13:56.920 --> 02:13:57.480]   That's it.
[02:13:57.480 --> 02:13:58.120]   You're dead now.
[02:13:58.120 --> 02:13:59.400]   Yeah, right.
[02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:01.880]   Naked and afraid, it's the worst thing
[02:14:01.880 --> 02:14:03.480]   I've ever seen in my life.
[02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:05.320]   And they cover up the naughty bits.
[02:14:05.320 --> 02:14:07.400]   So like, what's the point?
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:08.480]   It's like, you know they're naked,
[02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:09.920]   but you can't see that they're naked.
[02:14:09.920 --> 02:14:11.560]   I don't understand it.
[02:14:11.560 --> 02:14:14.760]   Is there a naked and afraid subscription model
[02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:17.720]   where they don't cover up the naughty bits?
[02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:19.960]   Let's hope not.
[02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:22.560]   Truthfully, the people they got, I don't want to see the naughty
[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:23.800]   bits.
[02:14:23.800 --> 02:14:25.040]   Isn't that always the case?
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:26.640]   But Dan, now, do you have tattoos?
[02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:28.160]   Anything you want to tell us about here?
[02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:30.760]   Yeah, covered in the ink.
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:31.760]   We'll go, we'll see.
[02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:34.400]   OK, you've sleeved on both sides.
[02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:35.680]   Sleeved and clean.
[02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:37.520]   So that's exciting.
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:40.680]   How do you get-- do you have an agent that shops you around?
[02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:43.440]   You know, this has been in progress for about a year.
[02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:46.560]   So it's known not yet.
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:49.760]   And I honestly hope it doesn't come down to that.
[02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:52.000]   I love the life I live covering geek stuff.
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:53.720]   Well, so you feel like you have mixed feelings
[02:14:53.720 --> 02:14:55.280]   about agreeing to do this?
[02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:55.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:14:55.880 --> 02:14:58.440]   I mean, I really-- I'm very appreciative of the opportunity
[02:14:58.440 --> 02:14:59.000]   to do this.
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.040]   And it sounds like it could be very interesting.
[02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:02.880]   But again, I love the life I live.
[02:15:02.880 --> 02:15:04.000]   And I love what I get to do.
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.360]   If they want to do a reality show about a guy who
[02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:08.800]   goes to Africa and covers stuff, I'm all in for the show.
[02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:10.200]   Yeah, but they don't.
[02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:10.880]   Right.
[02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:12.920]   I mean, it's like you just said with this other show.
[02:15:12.920 --> 02:15:14.920]   You know, I'm not going to do anything that will embarrass
[02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:17.560]   my friends or family or be professionally limiting.
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:19.560]   So we'll say, brushwood show.
[02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:22.040]   Now, that is cool.
[02:15:22.040 --> 02:15:22.720]   Yeah, I don't know.
[02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:23.520]   Did he get renewed?
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:24.280]   Do we know yet?
[02:15:24.280 --> 02:15:24.880]   I know they're working.
[02:15:24.880 --> 02:15:25.400]   I don't know yet.
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:26.720]   They're trying to get him renewed.
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:28.480]   Sometimes he is naked and afraid.
[02:15:28.480 --> 02:15:30.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:33.280]   I'm not sure.
[02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:34.600]   Jill Duffy, great to have you.
[02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:35.640]   Where can we find your work?
[02:15:35.640 --> 02:15:37.120]   PC Magazine, I guess, yes.
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:40.640]   pmag.com/get-organized.
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:44.440]   I have a new Get Organized E Kindle single coming out next
[02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:45.560]   month about travel.
[02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:48.240]   So if you are a disorganized travel person,
[02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:49.920]   don't know what sites to use--
[02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:50.520]   I need that.
[02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:51.160]   --book your stuff.
[02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:52.000]   Don't know how to plan.
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.480]   Don't know how to budget.
[02:15:54.480 --> 02:15:55.760]   Kindle single coming out next month.
[02:15:55.760 --> 02:15:57.560]   I'm glad you told me this at the end of the show,
[02:15:57.560 --> 02:15:59.840]   because I would have been very nervous sitting next to you,
[02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:01.800]   because I'm so disorganized.
[02:16:01.800 --> 02:16:03.760]   And I feel like you're judging me right now.
[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:04.440]   I'm not judging.
[02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:05.240]   I'm being a help.
[02:16:05.240 --> 02:16:06.720]   You know I wrote this book.
[02:16:06.720 --> 02:16:07.920]   A lot of love.
[02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:09.200]   And it's really to help people not
[02:16:09.200 --> 02:16:11.440]   to shame them about their messy digital lives.
[02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:14.040]   Wine notetaking for beginners.
[02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:14.640]   I'm good.
[02:16:14.640 --> 02:16:15.240]   I'm good.
[02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:16.240]   Yeah.
[02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:16.760]   Oh, I talked to you.
[02:16:16.760 --> 02:16:17.800]   I can't figure it out.
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:19.520]   I haven't figured out how to do that well.
[02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:22.440]   The executive editor of Wine Spectator
[02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:23.520]   spoke to me for a minute.
[02:16:23.520 --> 02:16:24.040]   Great place.
[02:16:24.040 --> 02:16:25.120]   And he told me a whole bunch of stuff
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:26.920]   I never would have thought of on my own.
[02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:34.920]   I use corks, c o r dot k z, and seller tracker dot com.
[02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:37.360]   Highly recommend seller tracker dot com.
[02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:40.000]   You have a database of all your wines.
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.320]   They tell you it's time to drink.
[02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:45.280]   Does anyone want you to take a picture of the wine glass?
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:45.800]   Yeah.
[02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:46.600]   Well, the label.
[02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:47.280]   You want the label of wine.
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:47.600]   That's what I want.
[02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:48.360]   I want you to feature--
[02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:50.200]   I mean, I want to take a picture of the other thing.
[02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:52.120]   And then have it automatically tell me
[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:53.400]   what the Wine Spectator is.
[02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:54.240]   Most of them do.
[02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:54.720]   OK.
[02:16:54.720 --> 02:16:55.240]   Yeah.
[02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:58.040]   I tried maybe two long ago and then gave up.
[02:16:58.040 --> 02:16:58.840]   Yeah.
[02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:01.160]   I was like, not going to be useful until I can walk into the store
[02:17:01.160 --> 02:17:01.720]   and take pictures.
[02:17:01.720 --> 02:17:03.800]   Because it drives me crazy when they don't give me the ratings.
[02:17:03.800 --> 02:17:04.840]   Because I'm not very smart.
[02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:05.340]   Yeah.
[02:17:05.340 --> 02:17:05.360]   It's--
[02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:05.680]   Yeah.
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:06.440]   You need professional--
[02:17:06.440 --> 02:17:07.360]   None of them are perfect.
[02:17:07.360 --> 02:17:08.680]   None of them are perfect, frankly.
[02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:09.600]   They don't do a great job.
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:10.880]   But Lee, hey, at least you can do it.
[02:17:10.880 --> 02:17:13.360]   Yeah.
[02:17:13.360 --> 02:17:13.840]   Well, good.
[02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:15.520]   And the book is going to be out next Wednesday.
[02:17:15.520 --> 02:17:16.040]   Next month?
[02:17:16.040 --> 02:17:16.560]   Next month.
[02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:17.040]   Yeah.
[02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:19.200]   And it'll be-- we'll come back and you can plug it then.
[02:17:19.200 --> 02:17:20.760]   Amazon single kind of thing or--
[02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:21.520]   Yeah, Kindle single.
[02:17:21.520 --> 02:17:23.240]   Kindle single.
[02:17:23.240 --> 02:17:24.720]   99 cents.
[02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:25.560]   No, no, no, no.
[02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:26.400]   No, no, no, no.
[02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:27.440]   I think that's what we're going for.
[02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:27.960]   Yeah.
[02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:28.320]   All right.
[02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:29.160]   It's high quality stuff.
[02:17:29.160 --> 02:17:30.080]   All right.
[02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:32.440]   OK.
[02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:35.160]   Yeah, I was friends with the old editor in chief of Wine
[02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:36.120]   Specter as a matter of fact.
[02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:40.320]   I used to do a cooking show with him of all things.
[02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:41.880]   Harvey--
[02:17:41.880 --> 02:17:42.880]   can't remember his last name.
[02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:48.120]   Alex, let's say anything you want to plug?
[02:17:48.120 --> 02:17:49.920]   Everything you do is top secret.
[02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:51.400]   I don't--
[02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:54.440]   I'm going to be doing more of these kind of flash acts out.
[02:17:54.440 --> 02:17:57.000]   Ask Alex's if you want to--
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:57.520]   Yeah.
[02:17:57.520 --> 02:17:59.880]   Just as we keep on experimenting with this question system.
[02:17:59.880 --> 02:18:00.800]   I think the question--
[02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:02.080]   Did we get-- yeah, did we get--
[02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:03.440]   I didn't ask you enough about questions.
[02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:07.600]   We had about 300 people using it, which was--
[02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:08.400]   Harvey Steiner.
[02:18:08.400 --> 02:18:10.760]   I really appreciate everybody who was willing to be part
[02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:11.640]   of our little experiment.
[02:18:11.640 --> 02:18:13.080]   We've been doing lots of little ones
[02:18:13.080 --> 02:18:16.280]   and we were like, well, can it really handle a large audience?
[02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:17.520]   And so--
[02:18:17.520 --> 02:18:19.720]   and I think that we got a lot of great suggestions.
[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:21.440]   And so I'll be keep on--
[02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:23.720]   as we keep on developing it, and I'll
[02:18:23.720 --> 02:18:25.320]   keep on doing some ask Alex's.
[02:18:25.320 --> 02:18:26.520]   And you'll probably see more of that.
[02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:28.680]   So if you follow me on Twitter, which is just Alex Lindsay,
[02:18:28.680 --> 02:18:32.680]   or Google+, follow the one with my picture.
[02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:34.080]   There's one without my picture.
[02:18:34.080 --> 02:18:37.240]   That is my account, but I don't use it.
[02:18:37.240 --> 02:18:40.480]   So any last questions from our--
[02:18:40.480 --> 02:18:42.520]   Last one that was particularly highly
[02:18:42.520 --> 02:18:44.880]   voted was from Will D in Washington, DC.
[02:18:44.880 --> 02:18:46.520]   He said, should software companies
[02:18:46.520 --> 02:18:49.680]   stop supporting older versions if the upgrade is free?
[02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:54.080]   Should it just-- older if the upgrade--
[02:18:54.080 --> 02:18:55.880]   then not like Windows 8.1 update.
[02:18:55.880 --> 02:18:57.480]   So they say, if we're going to upgrade for free,
[02:18:57.480 --> 02:18:58.320]   should we get one?
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:18:58.320]   Yes.
[02:18:58.320 --> 02:18:59.000]   You know why?
[02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:00.600]   Because not everybody wants to upgrade.
[02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:01.720]   There are reasons not to update.
[02:19:01.720 --> 02:19:04.960]   In fact, if you're using Windows 8 in business,
[02:19:04.960 --> 02:19:07.120]   it has not yet been vetted for update one.
[02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:07.440]   So--
[02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:10.440]   I don't even have Maverick chip.
[02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:11.880]   Because it broke some over hardware.
[02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:12.800]   It broke some over hardware.
[02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:13.720]   It broke some over hardware.
[02:19:13.720 --> 02:19:14.080]   Yeah.
[02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:16.720]   So yes, they should be required to support it.
[02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:18.200]   Because not everybody can upgrade.
[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:19.920]   Even if it's free, it's not that it costs money.
[02:19:19.920 --> 02:19:22.560]   It's not everybody can organize.
[02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:23.720]   When was it get organized day?
[02:19:23.720 --> 02:19:24.560]   How did I miss that?
[02:19:24.560 --> 02:19:26.440]   It was free cone day.
[02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:28.360]   Free cone day.
[02:19:28.360 --> 02:19:29.520]   Leave no hand on cone.
[02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:30.080]   My favorite day.
[02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:32.080]   Ben and Jerry's gives up free scoops once a year.
[02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:32.580]   Yeah.
[02:19:32.580 --> 02:19:33.120]   My favorite day.
[02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:34.080]   See, if you're really organized,
[02:19:34.080 --> 02:19:35.360]   you don't miss stuff like that.
[02:19:35.360 --> 02:19:37.560]   That was a relief that I missed it.
[02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:40.240]   Yeah, I guess they're reading your column.
[02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:41.840]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:43.600]   We do Twitch Sunday afternoons.
[02:19:43.600 --> 02:19:46.120]   Even on holidays like Easter at 3 p.m.
[02:19:46.120 --> 02:19:49.640]   Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:52.160]   That is 2200 UTC on twit.tv.
[02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:53.200]   Watch live.
[02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:54.840]   You can ask questions.
[02:19:54.840 --> 02:19:56.560]   Well, I think we should keep using that.
[02:19:56.560 --> 02:19:56.840]   Sure.
[02:19:56.840 --> 02:19:58.720]   I think it's a slow start this time
[02:19:58.720 --> 02:20:00.760]   because we'd never used it before we didn't tell anybody.
[02:20:00.760 --> 02:20:01.240]   Right.
[02:20:01.240 --> 02:20:02.440]   But can we keep using this?
[02:20:02.440 --> 02:20:03.040]   Absolutely.
[02:20:03.040 --> 02:20:05.400]   Because I like the idea of being able to take questions.
[02:20:05.400 --> 02:20:05.600]   Yeah.
[02:20:05.600 --> 02:20:06.600]   So we'll figure out better.
[02:20:06.600 --> 02:20:06.800]   We'll make it better.
[02:20:06.800 --> 02:20:07.160]   We'll make it better.
[02:20:07.160 --> 02:20:08.200]   Yeah, we'll make it better.
[02:20:08.200 --> 02:20:10.120]   Flow of the show.
[02:20:10.120 --> 02:20:11.320]   And that's why you want to watch live.
[02:20:11.320 --> 02:20:12.680]   Because we like that interaction.
[02:20:12.680 --> 02:20:13.960]   But if you can't watch live, of course,
[02:20:13.960 --> 02:20:15.640]   we make on-demand audio available.
[02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:18.280]   And video to after the fact on our website,
[02:20:18.280 --> 02:20:21.320]   TWIT.tv.
[02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:23.960]   And wherever they aggregate netcast like iTunes,
[02:20:23.960 --> 02:20:27.000]   and the Xbox Music Store, and Dog Catcher,
[02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:29.080]   and Insta Cast and Pocket Cast and all.
[02:20:29.080 --> 02:20:31.280]   There's a lot of cast apps now.
[02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:32.400]   Thanks for being here.
[02:20:32.400 --> 02:20:33.520]   Did I do everything, Chad?
[02:20:33.520 --> 02:20:34.240]   Did I thank you?
[02:20:34.240 --> 02:20:35.560]   Chad Johnson?
[02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:36.800]   Underpaid?
[02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:39.920]   Employee Chad Johnson?
[02:20:39.920 --> 02:20:41.400]   You just didn't you just get a raise?
[02:20:41.400 --> 02:20:44.120]   Am I wrong?
[02:20:44.120 --> 02:20:44.800]   I don't--
[02:20:44.800 --> 02:20:46.000]   I didn't hear of that.
[02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.440]   We'll all go talk to Lisa and we'll get your raise.
[02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:49.080]   Yeah.
[02:20:49.080 --> 02:20:50.120]   I think you spilled the beans.
[02:20:50.120 --> 02:20:51.880]   I think it was going to be a surprise.
[02:20:51.880 --> 02:20:52.840]   It was a surprise.
[02:20:52.840 --> 02:20:54.560]   It was for an Easter surprise.
[02:20:54.560 --> 02:20:55.040]   Right.
[02:20:55.040 --> 02:20:57.320]   I hid it in an egg somewhere in the backyard.
[02:20:57.320 --> 02:20:59.960]   Go look for it.
[02:20:59.960 --> 02:21:00.640]   Thank you, Chad.
[02:21:00.640 --> 02:21:01.240]   Thank you, everybody.
[02:21:01.240 --> 02:21:02.000]   We'll see you next time.
[02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:03.000]   Another TWIT.
[02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:04.080]   It's in the can.
[02:21:04.080 --> 02:21:04.880]   Happy Easter, everybody.
[02:21:04.880 --> 02:21:07.760]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:21:07.760 --> 02:21:08.520]   Do it the TWIT.
[02:21:08.520 --> 02:21:09.520]   All right.
[02:21:09.520 --> 02:21:11.480]   Do it the TWIT, baby.
[02:21:11.480 --> 02:21:12.240]   Do it the TWIT.
[02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:13.640]   All right.
[02:21:13.640 --> 02:21:15.800]   Yay.
[02:21:15.800 --> 02:21:19.480]   There's a little tradition going on here in the studio
[02:21:19.480 --> 02:21:21.280]   of applauding after shows.
[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:23.400]   And really, really, it's too much.
[02:21:23.400 --> 02:21:24.000]   No, no.
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:24.680]   I'm still--
