[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This is Twit, this weekend tech, episode 40 for January 29th, 2006.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Yellow lasers.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Here I am.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   I can't believe it.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Yay, Steve Woznek in Las Vegas.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Well, I'm outside of a Starbucks in a table because the trick in line of my hotel was waiting long.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Perfect.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   What better thing to do when you got to, you know, just hang out?
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   And guess who walks by a Las Vegas friend that I never called when I'm in town?
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   I'm in Starbucks, having no idea I'm here.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   You got mittnik with you? That's great.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   I heard mittnik was just on art. You were just on art bell, Kevin.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   He can't hear you right now. I split my earphone connection, but with another friend.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Hang on, he's putting an earphone on.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   How many people you got with you there?
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Well, my friend Alex is here with me.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   He's a good one for jokes.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   Hey, Kevin, how you doing?
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   All right, you won't believe this.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   This is the microphone. I'm running out of Starbucks because I was going to do some work here and get a latte.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   And sitting outside here at the table is Woznek friend Alex.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   That's hysterical.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Oh my God. Yeah, there's just a hysterical because they didn't even tell me they were in town.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   So I'm kind of angry right now.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Well, the FBI, you know.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Now you know by location.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   We're using Mojo-Go-Go right now to track him.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   We have no idea where he is.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   We've narrowed it down. He's in a Starbucks.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Starbucks in Vegas.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   I'm only leaves 4,000 other places.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   There's just like 40 of them and a strip.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   So John C. Devorak is on the line with us. Patrick Norton is there.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   And by the way, Woz, Patrick is fixing his car while he's doing this twit.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   So this is the weirdest twit we've ever done.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   He's actually under his car.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   What are you doing?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   You're brake fluid, Patrick?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Yeah, I'm flirting with brakes.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   It's probably because we have so many people on here, John, but I sound fine to me and that's all that really matters.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   No, because I'm recording it.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   I'm not doubting. It's just always a funny line to hear.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   I'm recording it.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   So Kevin, you were just on Art Bell.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Yeah, so Art Bell, that's nice. Patrick Norton?
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Hey, man.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Hey.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   They say these type of clothes are in there.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   This is like, I must be dreaming.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   This is really weird.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   You know, bumping into Woz at a Starbucks and then anything up on your show, I guess, with the only up.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Yeah, you're on this is twit.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   So before we go further, how did you, you just came to the Starbucks, right?
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Yes.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Oh, my God.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I had no idea you're in town.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I put it in my bag.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I know.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   And you changed your cell phone number. I tried calling you the other way.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Oh, boy.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   We'll talk about that later.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   You too can fight this out.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Maybe we should get him a room.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Welcome.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   There you go.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   There's a furniture convention in town.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   It was the longest taxi line, the longest registration line I've ever seen.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   I've never seen you or seen some long ones.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   What brings you to Vegas, Woz?
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   Oh, believe it or not, for the first time in my life, I am doing, I'm actually a paid-for speaker for another technology company.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   This is so strange for Division of Sharp.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   And they have a dealer's meeting here and I'm going to get up there and fill them with my best jokes.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   That's awesome.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Are you going to tell them quid, quid, latina, dictum, sid, altum, viditor?
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   I don't know that one.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Yes, you do.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   You signed your emails with it.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   You used to sign your emails.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   I remember that one.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Whatever it means, whatever is said in Latin sounds profound.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Actually, I said, "Gone off the airplane."
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   I thought of a joke, which is, "I was going to bring my printer, but they wouldn't allow any sharp objects on the plane."
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   That's good.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Nice.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   That's good.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   That's a good business doing the comedy bits in front of corporate audiences.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   I know a lot of comics have turned to that as a way to make a living.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Oh, no.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   This is so serious.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   They're updating me on their new products and want me to talk about them and be hospitable and be in business dress.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Well, for me, business dress is a soft sweater over a teacher.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Yeah, I've never seen you in a time in my life.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   So, I thought, I bought a lot of suits for a road show we're doing to raise money from investors, mostly on the East Coast.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   I bought a whole bunch of suits real expensive and then they told me, "Oh, you can come as you are."
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   And I have some, I haven't worn them.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   I'm going to save those for the high school robot competitions.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Yeah, where suits to those?
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I wanted to ask you about that.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   The last time we did "Twit," you were unavailable because you were rehearsing for the road show.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Is this to raise money for wheels of Zeus or...?
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   No, this is actually a whole new startup that's filed with the SEC and we're basically going public in a couple of weeks.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Do you want to talk about it or is it quiet periods, I guess?
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   No.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   You know, there's all sorts of SEC.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   You can get in trouble by talking publicly about these sort of things.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Right.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   There's sort of an SEC quiet periods and whatnot and I don't know what really gets in trouble or just gets your hands slapped.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Well, I know.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   So, it's like private.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   It's private for now only to the right investors.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Now, if you are one of those.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Well, I felt somebody's starting a car.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   I love this.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   This is great.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   I love this.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   I have to say, everybody, this could be the "Twit" meeting of investors in Waz's new startup right here.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   This is all the investors.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   They've been very generous with us.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   One thing I didn't tell you, Leo, is it's what's called a SPAC, an acquisition corporation.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Special purpose acquisition corporation.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   So, we are not allowed to know what we're going to do.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   We're not allowed to have any preexisting knowledge of any company or investigation of a specific company or even allowed to talk about
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   a specific company that we might acquire.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Once we get the money, we have 18 months to acquire a company.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   The clock starts ticking and it's very strange.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   So, it's a long, long time.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   We don't even get to get paid a salary either.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   If we ever acquire a company, maybe then we go into management and get a salary.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   So, it's a long, long process, a big, big sacrifice.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   Have you ever heard of such a thing, John?
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Does this, hello, John, are you there?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Yeah, sorry.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   I was over there cleaning up.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   I was listening to that.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   I never heard of this.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Anything like this.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   I think it would be worth writing about it.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   I should probably talk to Woz about it.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   A SPAC.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Special purpose acquisition corporation.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   You can look it up and learn.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   There have been a lot of them.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Basically, they can, they tend to make it if they find an acquisition, but you've got to get 80% shareholder approval.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   So, what?
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   You've got to spend 80% of your money on one acquisition.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   It's not easy.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   What's the point?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   What's the reason for doing that, said, just going out and buying a company?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Well, I'm not a financial person, so I would have no idea.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   I think that's what you're going to say.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   This is starting to sound like a money Python skit.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   It's very low risk.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   I know why John.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   John, the answer is a low risk for the investors because 95% of their money, over 95% of their money is held in trust.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   And if we don't ever accomplish skidly squat, they get their money back.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   You know, pretty low, low downside.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And if we find a company, we're bringing a bunch of a lot of experience and management talent and success to the table.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   We would probably run it.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   We're the strongest team they've ever seen of that sort.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   Who's the...
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Who do you mean that they've ever seen?
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Who's they?
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   The investors in spouts, a certain people in those...
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   And who's your team?
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Can you talk about...
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   We've managed to get you into trouble here with the SEC.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   I hope we're not asking for too much, but are you...
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Are you taping this now?
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Actually, actually...
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Yeah, with the person...
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Of course we're on the air.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   What do you think?
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Oh, gee.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Because it was filed, there were websites that had our team.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   It's myself, a former Apple CEO, Gil Emilio, and Ellen Hancock.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   And Gil called us up as good friends that he trusts and feels very bright.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   The three of us bring a lot of different pieces of the company to the table.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   That's an interesting team.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   That's quite cool.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Did you get along pretty well with Gil and Eileen when they were running Apple?
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Yes, but especially Gil.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   I see him, he laughs at jokes, and he really loves the technology working well.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   He loves it when it's great.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   He doesn't...
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   He's not one of these people.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   He's just a staid manager, and he'll do the right steps to plug the holes in this amount.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   No, he loves the technology too.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   That is a pretty prestigious group of people.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Eileen, when she left Apple to Chico, to HP, where did she end up working?
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I'm trying to remember.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   She went to work for...
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   No, no, she worked for IBM.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   IBM, that's right.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Ellen Hancock.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   Yeah, and IBM, the business.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And her server farm.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   That's right.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I'm 10 years Exodus.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Exodus, that's right.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Exodus, better fact, my friend Alex said right next to him.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   He really ran it, and then she just sort of sat on his coattails.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   I never said that.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   And Kevin hacked it, right?
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   That was the deal, right?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   No, I don't hack any more, Leo.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   He doesn't hack.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   No, he's a secure...
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Alex, it doesn't hurt me for a personal.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   I do not.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   So many gifts from Christmas.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   He's a good boy.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   No, I have to say...
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   In fact, all three of us are in Vegas right now.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Oh, wait, it's your convention.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Ali Hack, when Patrick leaves a cell phone in the rent a car.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   You ever know Patrick?
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   I don't know intimately.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   What happened?
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   I never heard about that.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   What happened?
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   I never quite recovered with that cell phone.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   What did he do?
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Did he reprogram it?
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   What happened?
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   He left his cell phone in the cab, and I recovered it for him.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Then I had a...
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   It was a joyous moment.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Handy, get back to him.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Say you have a very interesting cell phone there, Patrick.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   That's all he had to do.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Oh boy.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Simple.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   He's a social engineer.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Kevin's a master of that social engineer.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   I'm supposed to be posting all his chats for the well.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   I trust Kevin, but every time I get a crank call, I just scream.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   So he keeps breathing to get some away every time.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Say, um...
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Please, I'm not going to be a professional.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   I'm not going to be a professional.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   So he keeps breathing to get some away every time.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   So you think we should...
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Well, Leo, I'm going to interrupt for a second.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   I think we've got this news piled up.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   I think you guys being on the line here might contribute to it.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Leo, you want to start the...
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Should we take a look at some of the top stories in the week's technology news?
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   And Alex and Kevin and Woz, I just hope you'll jump right in and give us your nickels worth.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   I should, men as well, say who's online.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Robert Heron is also with us from DLTV.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Of course, Patrick is working on his car.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Patrick, you know, continue on.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Please don't stop.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Bleed those breaks.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   John C. de Vorac.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   And, you know, it's funny, Woz, that you should run into Kevin in Las Vegas,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   because I don't think Kevin's ever in Las Vegas.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   It's just a weird confluence here.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   I agree.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   He's only in Las Vegas when I'm here.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   And of course, I never call him.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   You never call us as well.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   But he doesn't know I'm using GPS technology to track him.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   So, last week, Kevin was still living in Utah.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   One way to away.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Before we get to the news, I want to ask, because I mentioned that Woz has this signature that he used, the Latin signature.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   But now you have this new signature in your email.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   TV is Wakeboard.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   What does that mean?
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   TV is Wakezone is a nanogram of my name.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Take the letters of Steve Woz, and you can rearrange them.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   TV is Wakezone or OK, a new size TV.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Ah, so it's just puzzling people, but it's really just your name twisted.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Yeah, yeah, it's not super clever.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   It's not super good.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   I like it.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   But at least it's something that doesn't, you don't know what it is.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   It got me thinking.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   I was trying to, what is TV is Wakezone?
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Hmm.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   We know what it is now.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Now we know.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   You're going to have to get a new one to know Woz.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   So the big story of the week, of course, Google deciding to go into China and do what the Chinese
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   government asked, censor news sites.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Interest in reaction to this.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   One group of bloggers says they're going to pull AdSense ads.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   They're not going to run Google ads anymore, biting the hand that feeds them, because that's the main source of revenue for most blogs.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Another blogger, a very well-known blogger, Jason Calicanis said, "Google did the right thing, and he would do the same thing.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   So which is it?"
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Google did the right thing, in my opinion, because I grew up with a concept of United States, America, our constitution, what it all means.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   And I'm still very true to that, even though it's being clobbered all over the place.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   But one of the key elements was that my dad taught me about right to privacy, that your home is secure.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   People don't come in and disturb it.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   And also, one country doesn't go in and change another country.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   We all have different cultures.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   We're different kinds of people.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Let them be their way.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Let us be our way.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Don't say there's one right way.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   You have to be our way.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   So you say that it's being res-
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   It's just sharing.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   It's actually sharing, of course, to say that they can have their way.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   Interesting point.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   It's respectful, you're saying.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Yes.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   And they will respect us the same, I hope.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Well, you know, is it respectful if you were going along with the program with Adolf Hitler, you know, to bring up an old bromide?
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   Well, we're talking about what's in their country.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   That's true.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   But on the other hand, we invaded Iraq because we didn't like who was running Iraq, so we certainly don't have a tradition in this country of respect to other forces.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   To other foreign nations.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Sovereignty.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   No, we don't.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Not about ever, but we should.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   And sovereignty is important, and it's just as important from a country to a country the same way as you would think of your neighbor.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   You know, your neighbor's doing something you don't like in his house.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   What?
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   You have a right to go in and kill him and then clean up the house and say we painted it nice, pretty blue.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   But, Woz, maybe Google should just, as I've said, we're not going to do business in a country where their human rights are ignored and people, they want us to censor the information that their citizens can get.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   We just don't want to do business in this country.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   I'm not saying that they should not agree to go along to the Chinese, they should just take the high road and say no.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   Leo, before Woz comes in on that, let me make a comment here because I got to a debate with a couple of people that go on my blog a lot.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   And after arguing back and forth and back and forth, because I'm actually kind of on Woz's side with this, I don't think it's really, you know, I think it's a business decision and that's just the way it is.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   But the guy made this final point, which I think has to be considered, which is Google made such an arrogant statement about, we shall do no evil, that that's why these guys are jumping all over them.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Because if you're going to make these kinds of comments, you know, like you're above it all, you better, you know, stick to it.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Well, they're not doing it to us.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   I know, but they're doing it to the center of evil.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   They said they will do no evil according to the way we see things, censorship is evil by definition, and so people are jumping all over Google on this.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   That's why I think that there's a big controversy.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   If Google had never made such a stink about that particular comment, because nobody cares that Yahoo and MSN and these other guys are going along with the program.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Although actually, John, there's some reports that some of Google's primary competitors are not going along with their quest to the Chinese government.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   So what's the story on that?
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   Well, is that true because the Yahoo guys, I would be shocked if they weren't going to.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   Microsoft's going in, Yahoo's going in, IBM is going in, and all of them are agreeing to the Chinese rules.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Here's my point of view on this.
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Google, it's, you know, I'm not saying evil, not evil.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   The issue is should Google a search engine be an editor of content?
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   First of all, somebody said that censorship is evil, censorship is bad.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   It is bad here in the United States, but it is not necessarily bad somewhere else.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   And we have to respect that concept where we're going to say, everyone who's not like us will take them down.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   That's a religious view.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   My religion is the way we live in the country.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Yeah, but just under mind the entire hack of ethos.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   If we say freedom of information is bad, is that not undermining the entire hacker ethos that we've been promoting?
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   All right, that thing should be able to...
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   Let's look at this.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Yes, and we have a voice that we can present.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   We can't present a vote in China, though.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   Have you ever seen your appearance having sex?
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   That was censored for a good cause.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   No, I'm not against censorship.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   I think, though, that Google should not be in the position of censoring.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   Google is not a leader.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   I am against censorship for anyone who wants to know.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Do you want to see your parents having sex?
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   I'm not going to stop those any way.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   How about you, Kevin, Nick?
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Do you have any opinion on this?
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   I just get around it.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Remember a safe web in Triangle Boy?
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   I wonder if that's still working.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   Absolutely, there are a number of technological ways for Chinese citizens to get around Google.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   I think this isn't obviously the way to prevent it permanently.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   It just makes it a little more difficult for the non-sophisticated Chinese web user.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   Yeah, but politically, I don't believe in censorship, but that's just my own personal view.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   I understand what you're saying, Steve.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   It's not necessarily...
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   Certainly not the US government's role or any business's role to tell the Chinese government
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   how to run their country.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   But we don't have to do business with them if they're violating human rights.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Leo, I think it was wrong to go into Iraq and tell them that the way you run your country
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   isn't satisfactory to us, so we're going to enter and just wrong to do the same thing to China.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Well, if we could have completely removed Iraq from the Googlebot index,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   there would be no problems in that country.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Removing Saddam Hussein from the Googlebot has saved the world.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   We've been boycotting Cuba for 40 years because they're a communist country
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   causing untold hardship in that nation.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   So I agree that there are times when it probably isn't a good idea.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Maybe Google's making the best choice, the best, better to able by at least having some
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   search engine capability in there.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   In fact, if you look at what they're blocking out, it's not kind of uniform.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Leo, here's how we make the positive steps.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   We show the world how good it is not to have the censorship, how it works here,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   and it's beautiful.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Jim and the sky of countries, and then they'll come our way.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   Well, and I think you're right, John.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   I think that it wish wouldn't be happening if Google hadn't kind of proclaimed that they were somehow
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   superior to everybody else.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   Yeah, and there's one more thing we need to observe here.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   This is an awful lot of publicity for Google.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   Hey, what's the stock doing?
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Is it still going down?
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Has anybody checked?
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Actually, I haven't looked at it.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   We can't talk about any of the clients in Google's stock price.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   It finally took contract.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   The stock price has more to do with what the US government made do.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   It really has nothing to do with these.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   I would agree with that.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Or, and Google not living up to Wall Street's expectation that might be another.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   That's ever going to happen.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   So Wall Street changed in its line.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   So, Dateline.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Who put this story in here?
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   NBC News Dateline did a story on MySpace and scaring every parent in the world about MySpace
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   and how there are little kids in there and there's all sorts of sexy stuff.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   Did anybody see this story?
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   Hey, I've been looking for stuff on MySpace.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   Alex, get out of MySpace.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Is he in MySpace?
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   I don't know.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   I'm a 13-year-old girl.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Don't mess with me.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Well, in the last month, according to Dateline, the 30s have charged at least three men with sexually assaulting teenagers that they met at MySpace.com.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   And just this week, police found a missing 15-year-old girl who investigators say was sexually assaulted by a 26-year-old man she met on MySpace.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   So, clearly, there are hazards, but is MySpace any worse than the rest of the internet?
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   I agree with that.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   You know what?
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   You've got to look at it this way.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   I'm going to do that to a 16-year-old girl.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   You should be a 16-year-old boy.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Great.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   What's the same as LiveJournal, by the way?
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   What happened to LiveJournalists as the nexus of this sort of thing?
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   That's a good question.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   LiveJournal was the bad guy for a while, weren't they?
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   I just find it.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   I think there's a generational thing with MySpace because the LiveJournal people, I think, are slightly older.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   I think there's probably be another one come along.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   It's almost like a club.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   It's weird.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   Nothing more to say on this one, I guess.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Robert, do you have any thoughts?
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Robert, do you?
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   How's your side doing there, Leo, on MySpace?
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   I don't know.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   I haven't been there in a while.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Robert's the youngest guy here.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Are you on MySpace?
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   He's not.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Patrick, you're younger than Robert?
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Patrick, you're the kid?
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   I'm the kid.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   God.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Who would have thought that?
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   That just looks older.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Yeah, well, he's about a hard 35 years.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   I don't know.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   You guys know, I mean, have you guys actually spent time on MySpace?
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   As little as possible.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   It's really designed for younger minds and eyes, I think.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Actually, it wasn't designed for younger minds.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   It's been taken over by younger minds.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   It was designed to promote indie bands.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Right.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Right.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   And it kind of got adopted by high schoolers in an insane way because it's like the best way ever to meet people and hook up with them.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   That's fundamentally what it's a tool for.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   It's an amazing number of people.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   If you think about it, if you're a predator, you're going to go where the kids are.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   So it's not MySpace's fault.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   It's any successful site that draws young people is going to draw the predators, right?
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   Like them all.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Like them all.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   And you're asking Alex for opinions on this sexual predators?
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   MySpace, how old are you, Alex?
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   How old are you, Alex?
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   You know, silence at a lamb is when he goes out to the barn.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   I'm a 13-year-old girl.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   You know, it's just a very deep voice.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   A little hormonal issue.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   Do we have enough?
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Well, how many people are on MySpace?
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   How many people are on MySpace?
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   Does anybody know?
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Some are between five and fifteen billion.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   It's a huge number.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Wow.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   Irony is...
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   It was up at Duke's Corp.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Yeah, Rupert Murdoch owns it.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   That's the amazing thing.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   Speaking of dropping money, did you see the Rupert Murdoch?
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Rupert Murdoch?
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Rupert Murdoch?
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   You think Rupert Murdoch has a MySpace profile?
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   We've got to find out.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   He and Sergey Brana have been using this for years.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   To hang out together?
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Of course.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Well, I'll have to hook up.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Oh, she's just creepy.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   Has she wanted to find out?
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   I'm doing a search right now.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   I've got to find out.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Rupert Murdoch's MySpace page.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Let's see real quickly.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   Rupert, My Profile.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   Yeah, he's in here.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   He says he's a 75-year-old man, though.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   Are you alive?
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   It says, "About me.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   I just bought MySpace.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   Soon I will own the rest of the internet.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   I aspire to become the most powerful man in the world."
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Well, that's good.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   This is the real guy.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   This is the real guy.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   Isn't that ironic that the new owner of MySpace has a faux MySpace?
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   Rupert Murdoch's interest, general, global domination and the conjunction of church and
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.680]   state, censorship of private or liberal interest groups, censorship of MySpace pages that do
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.000]   not agree with my views.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Favorite quote?
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   "Dictatorships are fun as long as I'm in charge."
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   I put even money on the fact that Murdoch has never been on MySpace and can't use a computer.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   I guarantee you.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   Let's not forget who the largest private owner in the news corps is outside of the United
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   States, right?
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Whatever happened to Prince Alba, he'd been to law.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   Does he own, is he really a big partner in the news corps?
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Interesting.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   It's all a conspiracy.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   Interesting.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   By the way, Rupert Murdoch's sign is Virgo.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   Just in case you're interested.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   That'd be great.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   I'm in good comfort.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   [laughter]
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   One less thing to keep me awake tonight.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Were you following the, I was following with great interest, the rumors flying around the
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   logosphere that Kevin Rose, our good friend and erstwhile twit, was going to sell dig
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   to Yahoo for $30 million this week.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Kevin got online and denied the whole thing, but I was very disappointed.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Did any of you feel any jealousy at any point when you heard that story?
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   No.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   I could have known about that.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   I never felt that Jawsy, but I'll tell you this.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   He's buying.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Next time he's buying.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   He's buying.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   Well, we'll see if that actually happens.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   But he claims we're not even talking to Yahoo, which I don't know.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   I tried to get Kevin on the show today, but he's not even talking to us.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   So who knows?
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   So what else is, you know, that's, we don't, there aren't a lot of big stories this week.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   Anybody else have any issues?
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Did you see the DS like?
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Did everybody, wait a minute, did everybody miss Mickey Mouse changing his last name to
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Jobs this week?
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   Or was that just me that's all about him?
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   That was a big story.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.360]   Steve Jobs is the, Steve Jobs is now the biggest stockholder, the biggest shareholder in Disney.
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:25:04.120]   He doubled his personal fortune with $3.7 billion when Disney bought Pixar Corporation.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:08.000]   So the first thing that happens is John Lasseter gets to say there's not going to be a Toy
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   Story 3.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   Well, yeah, that's right.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.720]   Now there's going to be Toy Story 2 and a half.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.280]   Interesting that there was an ongoing conflict beforehand, kind of like Jobs decided one out
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.280]   on that one.
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.280]   Did anybody hear that?
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.560]   Steve was staying standing five feet away from the microphone.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.560]   No, I did hear that.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.200]   So what's the inside story on that was?
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.920]   I don't know the inside of the story.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:31.920]   Yeah, I know.
[00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.920]   I'm going to tell them.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.920]   Yeah, right.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:34.920]   Tell them Steve.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:35.920]   I can't.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.920]   It wouldn't be ethical.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.920]   All right.
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.400]   So there is a story.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.600]   Apparently we now know there's a story.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.680]   There's a deeper story here.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:51.040]   What I didn't know is, well, wasn't Disney, didn't Pixar say they were going to cut the
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.640]   cord with Disney and stop making movies for Disney?
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.800]   Maybe that's what we were referring to.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.880]   Their contract was up.
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.280]   So they were going to have to find distribution.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.720]   Disney was going to have to find somebody other than people who write about Lamas to
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.000]   write movies that don't suck.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Right.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.960]   Well, what I read though was that Disney had a ton of people working for Toy Story 3 already,
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.760]   like 100 people working on it.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.440]   Even though John Lasseter didn't want to do Toy Story 3, he thought it would cheapen the
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.080]   franchise.
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:24.280]   I don't know if that was in the past, but you sure got the feeling that it was that
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:28.040]   yeah, the Pixar didn't want to do any more Toy Story 3 and 4.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.520]   And yet it's Disney buying Pixar.
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.000]   It just shows you the balance of power is not completely clear.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.280]   I mean, even though Disney buys Pixar, you'd think that means that Disney would get to
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.000]   tell Pixar, yes, you are doing Toy Story 3.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.440]   And in fact, it's quite the opposite.
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:44.000]   Of course, Steve Jobs is now on the board and is the largest shareholder of Disney.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   Do you think?
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   I hope so.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.240]   But I don't look at it in terms of business here, business now.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.440]   I mean, what did Disney start with?
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.640]   Animated cartoons.
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.640]   Right.
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.640]   It's not funny.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.200]   Maybe they're trying to go back a little bit and find their roots.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:01.360]   I would like to see Steve Jobs take over Disney and run it.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:07.320]   Well, he might well, you think he'll, you think he will start to exert influence over
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.720]   the Disney Empire?
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:09.720]   If he wants to.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:13.920]   That's got to be a nightmarish bureaucracy to try to turn it in there.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.600]   I think it's fun to watch.
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.200]   I'm not saying it would be fun to watch.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.200]   Yeah, I got a story.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.440]   I got another story that we should probably discuss.
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.440]   Sure.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.400]   Probably more important than anything we've discussed so far.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.400]   Good.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.400]   I'm ready.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.400]   Greater than the right of ground than Ensenada?
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.400]   No.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.000]   Old Booth Babes at E3 Expo.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.240]   Old Booth Babes?
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.240]   No Booth Babes.
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:37.360]   They've, the woman running or one of the women there is inside the band All the Girls
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.080]   that are going to, they usually at E3.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:42.960]   No, they, unless this has gone a step farther, they've just decided they want them to actually
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.640]   have a monocomp of clothing on this year.
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.640]   No!
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.520]   This is so good.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:53.160]   That was the last trade show that really did feature a Scannily clad women prominently
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:54.680]   in the booths.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:58.760]   You need to spend more time in the darker corners of CES and at some of the automotive
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.000]   and surfing trade shows.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.720]   I should say the last tech trade show.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:07.360]   But I guess CES still has, I, I, I thought CES was pretty tame.
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:08.360]   Didn't they?
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.360]   Oh, it was boring.
[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.360]   Well, I wasn't there.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.360]   So boring, I stayed home.
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.000]   You were in our eyes, Sonny.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.040]   Quote, I ain't even saying the phrase Booth Babes.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.720]   So, so, so they're going to, they're going to, which is it?
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.760]   They're going to have a no, no, no, no, no.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.960]   No, Patrick says, well, no, no, Patrick says is true.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:29.000]   But in fact, this is going to really kill things because they're going to have a $5,000
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.760]   fine on the spot for anyone if it's determined to be semi clad.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:33.760]   Wow.
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:34.760]   And who's going to make this determination?
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.960]   So obviously some stiff.
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:40.360]   They're going to have some none with a ruler measuring the length of the skirt above the knee.
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.360]   There you go.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.360]   You guys, you guys got to relax.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:51.440]   You guys need to go to New York City and you need to go to a nice Orthodox temple on Saturday
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:56.120]   because what you'll find out is you can have an ankle like skirt that will leave nothing
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:00.800]   to the imagination and will just terrify people and it'll completely follow, you know,
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.560]   it's not just about talking.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:05.600]   This is, this is Patrick and I'm trying to figure out where he goes to synagogue.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.640]   I'm trying to figure what this is coming from.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:08.640]   And it's, it's, when is this?
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.640]   What is Jewish?
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:10.640]   I didn't know that.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.640]   I didn't know this.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:19.520]   Patrick has a life that goes well beyond anything you or I can, John.
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.120]   The thing I know what I'm saying is it's not, you know, great.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.840]   So okay, they're going to get fongs off the floor.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.920]   They're going to get bathing suits off the floor.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:29.920]   You know, it's not like, you know, people are going to be wearing hot pants or short
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:34.600]   skirts or school girl outfits or any of the other crap that makes, you know, game editors
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.200]   and vendors and buyers go to Zurich.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.800]   I haven't been to E3 since.
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:39.800]   I haven't been to go for Zurich.
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.640]   I haven't been to E3 since it started, but I have heard and maybe you guys can confirm
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.640]   this.
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:49.520]   Some, some really nasty stories about stuff that goes on behind closed doors at E3 at
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.600]   hospitality suites at E3.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.960]   It sounds like it was a very out of control conference.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.800]   Is that true or is that just, you know, height?
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:58.800]   Where are we talking about this?
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:04.000]   Is that a someplace that doesn't let you bring cameras or cell phones into a concert?
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Where's that?
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Everywhere.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.800]   I mean, I know they're more of a concern to us, I think.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:13.480]   And as far as I know, the rules that they're going to be enforcing are the same rules they've
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:16.760]   had for a few years, but they just simply, they weren't enforcing them.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.720]   They're kind of letting it all slide by.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.840]   And, but the fine though is pretty crazy.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:26.280]   And well, it just be interesting to see if anybody actually gets nailed for it this year
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.280]   around.
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:31.280]   Waz, can you bring a camera into the concerts at Shoreline?
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:34.480]   You can't use it.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.080]   Well, get used it officially.
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:40.320]   I mean, you see so many people holding up cell phones now taking movies of shows.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.320]   So what?
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.320]   Isn't that great?
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.320]   Isn't that promote the show?
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.320]   Why would they not?
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.320]   Of course it does.
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.320]   Of course it does.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.440]   What I'm saying is, you know, you're talking about people restricting, you know, certain
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.240]   kinds of of nude behavior or something somewhere.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:54.560]   And we should be talking about where we can't, aren't allowed to use certain part of vices
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.560]   that will really help us.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:56.560]   Something that really matters.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.600]   I think censorship in America is what we want.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:30:59.600]   Something that really matters.
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.600]   Well, all right.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.600]   I'm up for that.
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.360]   What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.
[00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.960]   So what are you guys drinking?
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:11.680]   Starbucks Apple Cider.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.640]   Oh, it's no care about it.
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.880]   The hot apple cider?
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:15.880]   Correct.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.880]   All right.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.120]   And Kevin, what do you have in there?
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:22.560]   I didn't have an opportunity to go get a latte yet, but I will in a moment.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.560]   All right.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.560]   And Alex, are you having anything?
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:27.720]   Actually, is this one the show?
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:28.720]   I think so.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.200]   You're gonna try with six pumps.
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:34.080]   I think people are interested in what big celebrities like me.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.000]   No, like a glass of 82 moutins for anyone wanting to know.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.280]   Nobody cares about you.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:41.600]   I just want to know what the celebrities are drinking.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.360]   But talking about celebrities, we should get Amber on.
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.560]   Let's take a spot over for it.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.560]   All right.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.560]   Let me see if I get Amber in here.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.840]   I think Patrick has dropped off, so we'll call Amber back in.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.240]   So Amber, you're there?
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:55.600]   So I don't know, Waz, if you know Amber MacArthur, she's my co-host up in Canada on call for
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.600]   help.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:00.160]   Steve Wozniak, also with Steve in Las Vegas.
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:04.000]   Kevin Mitnick, old friend of the screensaver, and Alex.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.600]   What's, I don't even know Alex's last name.
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:06.600]   What's?
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:07.600]   Oh, thank God.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.600]   Fielding.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:09.600]   Fielding.
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:10.600]   Too late.
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:11.600]   You're in the middle.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.600]   I'll give you the scoop later.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:13.600]   Oh, Jesus.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.600]   Alex Fielding.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:15.600]   All right.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.600]   Thank you, Kevin.
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:17.600]   And they're all hanging out of the Starbucks.
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:21.080]   Amber is up in Toronto, and of course, John C. Devorek and Robert Heron.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:24.040]   So that's everybody in here.
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:26.080]   Have you guys picked up Superman?
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.040]   Adventures of Superman issue 648 yet?
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.040]   The March issue?
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.080]   Christopher Reed dives in the strip club?
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.800]   No, not that one.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.000]   It's horrible.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.480]   On a page.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.320]   It's devastating, isn't it?
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.400]   It's a, I actually don't have page numbers on this thing.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.400]   We'll throw those mouth too.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:42.400]   It was just awful.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:46.560]   But whoever works at DC Comics doing the illustration of this must be a podcast fan
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:53.160]   because there's a scene where three hoods are looting a television store, old-styled
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:59.560]   CRT TVs, and they're wearing a command-end t-shirt, a hack five hat, and a twit hoodie.
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:06.280]   So, now the good news is even though these guys are looters, Superman comes along and
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.120]   he says, "All people really need to know is that they are valued.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.640]   Sometimes they just need a little direction."
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.200]   And he turns them to the good side and they end up helping people.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.760]   That's just like us.
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.760]   Just like us.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:17.760]   We were hoods.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:18.760]   So isn't that great?
[00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:22.280]   So, Twit and Command-N and Hack 5 have now made it to the mainstream.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.120]   I'd like a twit hoodie.
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.120]   You don't have one?
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.320]   Oh, I think I gave one to my daughter, no.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.640]   Alright, I'll get you another one.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:30.880]   Amber has a whole bunch of them.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:34.960]   What's cool about the little one my daughter wears is that when she walks around and says
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:38.480]   "wit," she has to actually lift her arm before it says "twit."
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.480]   It's...
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.520]   And Leo, there's a couple boxes full up here.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.080]   Yeah, and poor Amber is stuck with a bunch of twit hoodies.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.080]   That's alright.
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:49.920]   So, John, will make sure that we send you a nap.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:50.920]   Ah, thank you.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.920]   Hey, Leo.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:52.920]   Yes, Kevin.
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:57.320]   Hey, remember when I was on the screen, Shavers, and I demonstrated the color ID
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.320]   spoofing?
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.800]   I love that hack.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.920]   You called my phone from the White House.
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.600]   Right, well, check this out.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:07.840]   A dear friend of mine, she called me from Vegas.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:12.600]   She was visiting from Miami yesterday and the number that was calling me was my own cell
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:13.600]   phone number.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.360]   So, of course, I pick up the phone and I said, "Hey, very funny.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.360]   Thanks for spoofing my number."
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.360]   Who is it?
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.640]   And it sounded like this guy with a raspy voice.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:24.280]   And I basically hung up on the guy and then she called back 30 minutes, no, 30 seconds
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:26.520]   later and said, "Hey, that was me."
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:30.760]   And apparently there's this new service that not only lets you spoof color ID, but lets
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:33.120]   you change your voice to a woman or to a man.
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.120]   Oh, my God.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.200]   Do you know the URL?
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:36.200]   It's spoofcard.com.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:37.200]   It's spoofcard.com.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.200]   Wow.
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.800]   And it lets you change your voice, which is kind of funny.
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:47.080]   So I thought that might be interesting to you because spoofing color ID is cool, but
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:52.280]   actually adding voice changes, you can imagine, well, I'm sure that the master of pranksterism
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.840]   sitting next to me, Steve Wozniak, can figure us some good pranks to pull with that.
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.400]   We're using that on my space later.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.320]   You could sound like a little girl, Alex.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.080]   It says spoofcard.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.080]   The next generation--
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.080]   Yeah, I got it.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:07.560]   She's getting just going on to devork.org/blog immediately.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.640]   The next generation of phone spoofing, it offers you the ability to change what someone
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:12.440]   sees on the color ID.
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.640]   But you have to pay for this, don't you, Kevin?
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:20.320]   Yeah, it's like you could buy a calling card.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:24.120]   It looks like 10, 20, probably 40 bucks.
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:28.240]   But what was cool is I never saw a service that had a voice changer as well.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.720]   So it's kind of interesting.
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.200]   Is this a whole, a security hole in the way the cell system works?
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:36.920]   I mean, I'm surprised that now that it's so well known, in fact, there are services that
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.120]   allow you to do this.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:41.120]   You know, as changes color ID that somebody hasn't fixed this.
[00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.120]   It's a feature.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.120]   Yes, it's exactly.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.120]   It's a feature.
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:47.200]   It's like if you're a biker soft and whenever an employee makes an outgoing call from the
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:51.800]   company, you want the main telephone number to appear, not their extension or their telephone
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:58.600]   number so you can program your CPN, the calling party number into your switch.
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:05.760]   So now with the asterisk and voice over IP, you can basically set your own number by writing
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.920]   a script so you can touch tone in the number you're calling, the number you're calling from
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.280]   and it will spoof it.
[00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:12.280]   Are you using asterisk?
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.040]   It's like corruption.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.480]   This is a problem with the system.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:20.320]   Now you can be Bill Gates and sound like a little girl using a new system and still
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.680]   look like you're calling from Microsoft.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:28.000]   Hey, but what's scary is with some of the cellular companies like T-Mobile, if you spoof
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:34.360]   a target's number to the voicemail, to the voicemail access number and the use of default
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.920]   setting, you go right into the voicemail without a password.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.960]   You know, somebody that uses the spoofing technology is the New York Times.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:48.120]   The New York Times, as you get a call from the New York offices, it comes in as 111-111-111.
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.120]   Oh, interesting.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.120]   And that's good.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:54.320]   I remember the days when Markov used to check Kevin's voicemail.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.440]   Don't bring that guy into this.
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.560]   We don't want to get into a fight.
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:04.440]   So the reason I understand that they do that is because when they're calling confidential
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:09.400]   sources, they don't want it necessarily tracked back to the New York Times by their employer.
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.680]   It's pretty obvious.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:11.680]   It's 111-111.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.680]   Who else would it be, right?
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.680]   Yeah.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:19.400]   In Moscow, in February, whenever you get a call from the U.S., it actually came, the caller
[00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:21.480]   ID was changed to all ones.
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.480]   Interesting.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:27.480]   There were times when previously the only people who called Moscow, so they just figured
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.480]   what the hell.
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.480]   Make it all be.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.120]   You're number one.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:37.880]   Actually 111-111-111 was used to be a number that you could enter in as the serial number.
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:41.680]   It was a back door to Microsoft's Windows.
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:45.200]   It was a serial number you could enter in and it would work on many copies of Windows.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.200]   Of course, they fixed that one.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.720]   Yeah, they used all zeros too.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:51.600]   Their authentication fixed that, but that was a well-known feature.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:55.400]   By the way, they wouldn't let me use my power book on the plane flight.
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.400]   Why not?
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.040]   I had a Windows seat.
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:02.040]   We got any more news stories.
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.040]   We're going to be listening to these jokes.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.040]   Leo?
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.880]   Leo and Leo and Patrick are all.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.280]   I got a new laser and John.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.120]   I got more new lasers.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:14.560]   I got my first yellow laser and it's gorgeous.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.560]   Wow.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.560]   Yellow.
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:20.120]   Yes, it's sort of a yellow, slightly orange-ish, but it's just a beautiful color.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:23.480]   I got more powerful green ones and I was doing this trick the other night where I was trying
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:27.800]   to green one in one ear and a friend shines a blue one up on the ceiling after I've explained
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:29.600]   why it changes color.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.880]   My ear started feeling like there was a candle on the table.
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.240]   When I looked down, there's no candle.
[00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.240]   Just getting warmer.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:41.080]   We got one green that uses sea cells and it actually smoked some bread into toast.
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.080]   You're kidding.
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.080]   You're kidding.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.080]   Outback.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.360]   We're no no no matches with it and everything.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.360]   So it's pretty hot.
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.360]   It was?
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.360]   Yeah, it was.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.360]   It's not way to test it.
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.320]   What's the element that's used to make yellow green or that yellowish?
[00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:59.040]   That one I do not know, but they're fairly expensive like in neighborhood of $4 to $500
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.800]   and they have some blue lasers.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:01.800]   I got my first blue laser.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:02.800]   That's cool.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.800]   I had some blue ones for free that were made for me and they kind of come out purple.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:11.040]   These come out pure blue and I guess the materials are made by Sony.
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:17.440]   The 10 milliwatt when I got cost, you're going to die $1,500.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:26.600]   They sell a 20 milliwatt for $2,500, 30 milliwatts for $3,000 and 40 milliwatts for $3,500 for
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.600]   one laser pointer.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.600]   We can go for those biggies.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.280]   We can go to casinos and bet on black.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.760]   Maybe we could make some extra money to buy some more lasers.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.920]   I'm going to make my new parents to make a black laser.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:38.920]   A black laser?
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:39.920]   Yeah, I'm going to sell it.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.360]   If I can get a heat sink to help cool it, I can get more power.
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.960]   Well, the speed of dark is much faster than the speed of light.
[00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:46.960]   That's right.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:47.960]   Everybody knows that.
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:48.960]   I get it.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:49.960]   All right.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.560]   Do you get... are you led into the casinos at all, Kevin Mittnick?
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.360]   Or do they see you coming and make you go the other way?
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.720]   No, I'm allowed in.
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.240]   I'm not a threat to the casinos.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:02.160]   They make him take his shoes off, but he's like a dark counter.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.560]   I don't think Kevin knows any casino games.
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:08.000]   I think I've been in there with him and he doesn't know what he's doing anyway.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.440]   I can't play such complicated games like Roulette or Blackjack.
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:18.760]   Well, I did confuse me with the Texas hold them or Yelp 21.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:21.160]   But I'm really good at the computer games like video poker.
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.080]   Those ones, oh my God.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:24.080]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.080]   You got it down to just right.
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:26.480]   Ten more tries to jackpot.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.480]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:28.480]   Real flush.
[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:29.480]   Boom.
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:30.480]   He called it.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.480]   Did he really?
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:33.840]   That's actually a famous hack, isn't it?
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:36.560]   They found out they were using a pseudo random number generator in the...
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.720]   Well, this was today.
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:44.200]   I cannot confirm or deny that new system.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:47.920]   Yeah, because it's a pseudo random number generator, so it repeats after a certain number.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:52.440]   So once you start seeing the repeats, then you know what's coming up.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.960]   But you would have to know, you'd have to know it pretty well or spend a long time watching
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.720]   it.
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.840]   I thought they'd fix that.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.040]   No, they did.
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.760]   They now use three pseudo random number generators.
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:04.760]   It's a lot harder to get them.
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:11.160]   A lot harder so the time to drive the pattern, it's not feasible.
[00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.160]   Kevin was up all night.
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:16.560]   That's my new job, Leah, playing video poker.
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:20.400]   I'll catch some MIT around him too.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.120]   I don't know what that was about.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:23.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:27.480]   Hey, those guys, is that group still around the MIT card counting group?
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:28.480]   But they still do that?
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:29.480]   Bringing down the house?
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.840]   Bringing down that wonderful book, bringing down the house.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:33.600]   I think they have a second book out.
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:37.800]   I think I saw it in an airport bookstore.
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:42.480]   Do they still do that or is that all done?
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:45.080]   Probably there's a detective agency out here called Griffin's.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.000]   Their photos are probably all in their books.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.680]   Well, it would have to be somebody new, obviously.
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:49.680]   But that's what they were doing.
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:50.680]   They were recruiting new kids.
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:51.680]   They didn't train them.
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:52.680]   Yeah, they were training them.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:53.680]   That's exactly what...
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:54.680]   Great book.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.680]   If you've never read it, bring it down the house.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.480]   Now they only go to Indian kissing notes.
[00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.480]   Maybe.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:03.560]   But some of the shoes, some of the new shoes on blackjack tables, they never ever get
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:04.560]   to shuffle the cards.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.520]   It's just a shoe that automatically shuffles the cards so you can never really keep an
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:10.520]   accurate count.
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:12.480]   An endless shoe?
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.480]   An endless shoe.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.200]   And some of the casinos.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.200]   That seems like that's cheating.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.200]   That's like bottomless drinks.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.200]   That's like bottomless drinks.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.600]   That's like some concept.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:22.600]   Not at E3.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:23.600]   Oh, please.
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.600]   No bottomless anything.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:25.600]   That's right.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:26.600]   You've got to go over to crazy horse for that.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:37.600]   I have this great watch that gets me caught going through airport security every time.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:38.600]   What's that?
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.600]   It looks like the biggest watch you've ever saw.
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:46.120]   It's got a couple of nixie tubes, vacuum tubes in it, along with a battery through
[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.840]   a clear through top.
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:48.840]   The watch has ends.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:54.400]   Yes, and if you turn it to the right angle, which I can program, I programmed it for 45
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.320]   degrees, it displays the time.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.880]   It's almost 10 hours, then minutes, then seconds.
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:42:59.880]   Wow.
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:00.880]   Kevin wants to see.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:01.880]   Are you bringing it?
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:02.880]   I'm going to go.
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:03.880]   Are you bringing it?
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.080]   They don't know what it is.
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:08.680]   And they tell me, sometimes they tell me you shouldn't bring this through airports.
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:11.640]   Well, I can't down.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:13.560]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:14.560]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:15.560]   I'm going to display this clear.
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:17.800]   And I'm thinking inside the cup of the cup.
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:18.800]   It's a big battery.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:20.440]   And who knows what circuitry?
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:23.840]   It starts counting seconds, you know, 45, 46.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:25.600]   You can find this at alcida.com.
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:26.600]   Wait a second.
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:27.600]   Wait a second.
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:32.840]   About a year ago, Steve was showing me that he can carry knives on aircraft that were
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:34.440]   a metal detector wind detector.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.000]   Were those those plastics?
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   Ceramic knives.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   Ceramic knives.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   All right.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   I have a lot of history, including pictures.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   A lot of stories about doing that.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.640]   Well, you know, Corey Doctorow from the E.F.F. printed up the Bill of Rights on a piece
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:47.920]   of metal.
[00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:50.680]   And the whole idea was you're supposed to carry it through the metal detectors.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:53.600]   And when they stop you say, oh, yeah, it's the Bill of Rights.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.600]   I guess that's a problem here, isn't it?
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:57.600]   I don't know.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:58.600]   I don't know.
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.000]   I guess if you want to get harassed by tea.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.600]   That's for humor, not serious.
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:03.480]   Yeah, I don't want to do it that seriously.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.600]   I used to get on board and complain about their knives.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:07.280]   And I hope that the meat was tender.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.800]   And then I'd pull out my nice ceramic knife of a six inch long blade.
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.800]   And the other passengers got more upset.
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.400]   And the services didn't know what to do.
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.600]   They'd say, well, a plastic knife.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:19.000]   And then help if you were wearing a turban.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.040]   Oh, please.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.400]   You don't do that anymore, right, Steve?
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.560]   I mean, that really nowadays, I think they're very sensitive about that kind of thing.
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:28.640]   I haven't done that since 9/11 yet because it would not--
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:29.640]   Yeah.
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:30.640]   It doesn't go over well.
[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.640]   Yeah, we want to hear about you getting arrested or something.
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:35.280]   They aren't worried about weapons anymore, though.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.280]   Why?
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:40.760]   For example, they let me take on a big screwdriver with an eight inch blade, a big screwdriver.
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:41.760]   Let me take it right on.
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:42.760]   Boston said that's fine.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:46.760]   They let me take on two huge batteries, the size of shoe boxes that they've never gone
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.240]   through X-ray or anything.
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.240]   No, they've changed the rules.
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:53.760]   And it's actually very upset about the fact that the rules are changed and that some of
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:57.440]   these devices, things like screwdrivers, are now legal.
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:44:58.440]   Not on--
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.440]   Yeah, but you're worried about it.
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:04.320]   No, it's because I think they've protected the pilots from access well enough with steel
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:05.320]   doors.
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:06.320]   Wait a second.
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:09.000]   That's why the flight attendants are upset because they're basically the sacrificial
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   lambs, you know.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.560]   Yeah, but every time I fly, like you fly internationally, they give you real silverware,
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:18.880]   a fork, a real butter knife and a spoon.
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:21.280]   You're not sure allowed in the civilized country.
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.480]   International, not in the US.
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:25.680]   In the US, you fly first class, you get a plastic knife.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:31.680]   Also, international flights are allowed to take lithium segue batteries, not domestic
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:32.680]   flights.
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:33.680]   You know, friend.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:34.840]   And then the Rick Rule.
[00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:39.440]   One of the researchers who works on call for help had a bunch of equipment that he was
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:44.680]   flying to-- I think he was flying to CES and he got-- he thought he was on Delta, but a
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:50.520]   Delta is a partner with L.O. and it turned out it was an L.O. flight.
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:52.280]   And that must have been fun.
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:53.280]   Quite different.
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.280]   The rules are quite different.
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:58.880]   They took all of his battery packs, all of his powers and took them.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:45:59.880]   They said no--
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:03.120]   You're supposed to get their four hours before departure when you're flying L.O.
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:06.000]   They just took them and they said, "Sorry, you cannot take that on the plane.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   We'll ship it to you."
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.480]   And of course, he never got them back.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.480]   They're gone.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.440]   He was flying from where?
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:14.760]   He was flying, I think, from Toronto to Vegas.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:15.760]   What?
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.160]   From Baghdad to Tel Aviv?
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.160]   Do you remember?
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.640]   That's a bad flight.
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:24.400]   Was it-- Do you remember what flight that was, Sean, was on the amber?
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.400]   Did he fly to Vegas or maybe to LAX?
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:29.400]   Maybe it was LAX, yeah.
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:30.400]   But it was--
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:32.600]   I'll find LAX and see the extra security requires.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:36.400]   Well, there is a rule that if you have-- you can carry lithium batteries on cell phones
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:41.400]   and computers, but if you have a package of 24 or more, you can not ship on any flight
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:43.640]   or any capacity that people are on the plane.
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:44.640]   Because you can make them on that of them.
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:45.640]   So you're not--
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:46.640]   No, it's a rule.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:50.240]   No, the extinguisher systems in cargo can't put out that size fire.
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.240]   Ah.
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:52.240]   Ah, so fish sure.
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.080]   So it's really a good reason.
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:59.920]   They kind of came up with a number, 24 cells in a package, but at least they did some thinking
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:01.960]   about there's a number that you've got to cut it off at.
[00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:05.520]   Yeah, I think that's completely reasonable.
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.360]   Somebody who flies a lot.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:10.000]   So, so, Woz, do you have a MacBook Pro yet?
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.600]   Or are you waiting in line like the rest of us?
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:15.120]   I'm waiting for it to be delivered.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.800]   I want to get a 17-inch MacBook Pro.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:17.800]   I wonder where those coming out.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:18.800]   Yeah, I want that too.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:19.800]   Give me--
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.800]   You know what I'm actually waiting for?
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:26.000]   I hope-- and of course, the big rumor that's been circulating, probably worthless, is the
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:31.640]   next will be the iBook, the 13-inch iBook with the Yona single core Intel chip.
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:38.440]   But I'm looking for-- and I hope Apple does this-- a very thin, lightweight Sony 505 style
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:39.440]   notebook.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:42.560]   It's really thin when I think that would compete very well.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:43.560]   That would be nice.
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:48.680]   I just bought a one of the Dell Inspiron lightweight laptops, so because I was tired of dealing
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:51.000]   with my 17-inch notebook on the plane.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   Exactly.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.160]   Yeah, I'm a fan of the little ones, especially for travel.
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:58.760]   Oh, by the way, you should always turn off your wireless interface when you're flying.
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:47:59.760]   Why?
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:05.520]   Because, you know, oh, well, what happens, how Windows works is when your interface is
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:11.320]   on, what Windows does, it goes through your active-- well, what networks it sees, and then
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:13.160]   it compares them to your preferred networks list.
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:18.280]   If it doesn't find it, then what happens is it looks for any ad hoc networks.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:23.560]   And if one-- if you ever had a preferred network as ad hoc, you become that ad hoc network.
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:27.640]   So all you have to do is set the link layer IP address.
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:28.640]   It's called automatic IP.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:31.640]   It's in the 169.254.x.x.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:37.560]   And what you could do is then you could trick anyone on the airplane that has a wireless
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.840]   card into associating with your laptop.
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:41.600]   And you could log into their system?
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:46.400]   Well, they're on your network, so now you could use the normal hacking tools to enumerate
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:49.280]   information and compromise our machine.
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:50.280]   Very interesting.
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:53.760]   So just by leaving on your airport or your Wi-Fi card, you actually could be opening yourself
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:54.760]   up to get--
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:58.120]   Yeah, but can you imagine the fun you could have with playing certain types of MP3s through
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:59.120]   their computer?
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:02.760]   I'm trying to find out if you could use it across the internet.
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:03.760]   Have you shared iTunes?
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:04.760]   Well, here's what I do.
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:08.840]   What I do, whenever I get on a plane, whenever I get on a plane, well, not whenever, but
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:14.720]   a lot of times, I just turn on my Wi-Fi sharing, which I shouldn't, because it's a transmitter.
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.920]   And I set up a network, and I usually name it United Free Wi-Fi.
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:21.120]   Just look around me to see if anyone spots it.
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:22.120]   I haven't succeeded yet.
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:25.120]   No, you should name it like a cockpit control.
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:30.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:35.120]   And share it through the plane with Wi-Fi, just to see if somebody says, "What is this?"
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:39.120]   Put a little remote control program up and let them fly the plane.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:42.120]   I'm going to switch microphones now to my--
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:43.120]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:44.120]   Do you still hear me?
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:47.120]   Oh, yeah, that's much better, in fact.
[00:49:47.120 --> 00:49:48.120]   Which mic is this now?
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:49.120]   Can you hear me?
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:50.120]   Yeah, sounds great.
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.120]   What are you using?
[00:49:51.120 --> 00:49:56.120]   I was the eyesight camera has its own built-in mic, it's better quality, and I forgot to switch
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:57.120]   to it this time.
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:59.120]   It's much better quality than the laptop was.
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:05.120]   You know, Apple just sent me this new Snowball, Latvian Snowball mic by Blue, and I'm looking
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:06.120]   forward to trying that.
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:07.120]   It's a USB mic.
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:10.120]   There's a lot of USB mics out there.
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:15.120]   Yeah, when I travel internationally, because I got nailed with myself, and when I was in Moscow,
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:17.120]   I didn't realize it was $4.99 a minute to Rome.
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:20.120]   And I got hit with a huge bill, so now I use Skype when it oversees.
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:21.120]   What?
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.120]   What do you call Rome for?
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:23.120]   It was a contact to the US.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:26.120]   Oh, no, I was in Moscow.
[00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.120]   That's Russia.
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.120]   Oh.
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:31.120]   He had his cell phone set to Roman.
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:34.120]   Well, I figured, no more.
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:35.120]   Sorry.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:43.120]   Any other big hacks or security issues, Kevin, that are going on right now, people who
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:45.120]   ought to know about anything going on.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:47.120]   I like that airport one there.
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:53.120]   Yeah, the Wi-Fi thing is really interesting because it's where people think about, oh,
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:58.120]   we got to protect our access points, you know, if you're running a business, but now the
[00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:02.120]   clients could be hacked by tricking the client to associating with you.
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:07.120]   All right, and you heard about that guy that just got busted for running a -- selling a
[00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:11.120]   botnet service to do distributed denial of service attacks and sending spam in LA.
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:13.120]   Do you hear about that case?
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:17.120]   No, he was using ad hoc networks to do it.
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:18.120]   No, no, no.
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:21.120]   What he was doing is he was setting up botnets.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:22.120]   Right?
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:25.120]   He was, you know, sending a worm or a virus or whatever.
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:26.120]   Right.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.120]   Compromising, you know, an army of machines.
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:29.120]   Right.
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:32.120]   And then selling a service to use those army of machines to do things.
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:35.120]   He was renting out other people's machines, essentially.
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:36.120]   Exactly.
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:39.120]   So distributed spam, distributed denial service attacks, you know.
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:42.120]   I'll tell you what, Wi-Fi in airports, that one's really busted a guy in --
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:43.120]   San Jose, one night.
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:47.120]   He showed me on his screen, he had this program that sniffes the air and prints any pictures
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:48.120]   that are going by.
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:49.120]   Oh, boy.
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:51.120]   Here comes a bunch of pictures of women's pants.
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:54.120]   So I go downstairs to a vending machine at one point and I look back on a guy's computer
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:57.120]   and he's looking at one of those pairs of pants.
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:58.120]   It was a guy.
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.120]   I think --
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:00.120]   No comment.
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:03.120]   He was -- he was shopping for his wife.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.120]   Now, come on.
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.120]   There's nothing wrong with that.
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:06.120]   Yeah, oh boy.
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:11.120]   Hey, any of you guys use blackberries?
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:16.120]   No, I use a Nokia 9300.
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:18.120]   I live on a blackberry road.
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:25.120]   Do you -- are you -- are you -- are you worried about losing your blackberry service, so why?
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:27.120]   I live on a blackberry road.
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:28.120]   That's the name of the road.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:29.120]   Oh, that's the name of your road.
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:30.120]   Oh, jeez.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:31.120]   All right.
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:32.120]   I guess --
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.120]   Nobody uses it, Leo.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:34.120]   How do you like that 9300?
[00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:37.120]   That's the smartphone that opens up and it's got a full keyboard or --
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.120]   Yeah, it's very cool.
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.120]   Except I don't like a GPRS story.
[00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:44.120]   GPRS, I guess Verizon has the fastest service on EVDO.
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:51.120]   But in Europe it works great because then I could get a prepaid SIM card and use their UMTS service.
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:58.120]   But Nokia is releasing this quarter in 9300i, which now -- with the same device, with the same size, you could --
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:00.120]   you know, you have 802.11 built in.
[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:02.120]   So that's kind of cool.
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:03.120]   Mm.
[00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:06.120]   I'm going to buy that as soon as it comes out.
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:10.120]   So, Woz, you think the line at the hotel is shortened now?
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:11.120]   Well, I'm hoping so.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:15.120]   I have a 6 o'clock dinner, so I'll either check in before the dinner or after the dinner one or the other.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   You would think --
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   Don't they --
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   Don't they --
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   Don't they --
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   Don't they --
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   Don't they --
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   Don't they --
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   Don't they --
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   Don't they --
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   Don't they --
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   Don't they --
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   Don't they --
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   Don't they --
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   Don't they --
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   Don't they --
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   Don't they --
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   Don't they --
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:17.120]   Don't they --
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:17.120]   Don't they --
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:17.120]   Don't they --
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:18.120]   Don't they have a VIP line for you or something?
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:19.120]   You can just jump right in.
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:20.120]   You know you got to get --
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:21.120]   You got to get connected.
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:24.120]   Tell me your tech support and we're in Apple Show.
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.120]   One's in a while that's happened.
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:28.120]   I hope I have a room.
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:30.120]   That's all I'm hoping.
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:33.120]   John, you got to set up Woz with your buddy Steve Nguyen.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:35.120]   You get him in a decent room here.
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:36.120]   Get him some treatment.
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.120]   Where's your stuff?
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:38.120]   The Hard Rock.
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:39.120]   The Hard Rock.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:40.120]   The event.
[00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:42.120]   I didn't have a choice where I'm staying.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:43.120]   I'm staying at Caesar's Palace.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:44.120]   That's because we're at a nice place.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:45.120]   I don't know.
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.120]   I don't know.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:47.120]   I don't know.
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:48.120]   Mirror's on the ceiling, really?
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.120]   I don't know.
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:51.120]   I have been in the office.
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:52.120]   I'm in the office.
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:54.120]   I prefer to go to just different places.
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:55.120]   I've burned out of it.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:58.120]   I'll go to the quiet little town 40 minutes down the road.
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:03.120]   Priem works a little casual or I'll go off the strip to the Alexis Park Resort, which isn't it?
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.120]   Casino?
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:05.120]   You're not going to parrump, are you?
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:07.120]   Of course, I'd probably say I have friends to stay with you.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.120]   I love you.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.120]   Parrump.
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:10.120]   Parrump.
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:13.120]   Parrump, of course, is where Art Bell and his trailer are.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:14.120]   Unless they've moved.
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:15.120]   I don't know.
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:18.120]   No, I would hate to mistakenly walk into Art Bell's trailer.
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.120]   I'm looking for something else in Parrump.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.120]   Parrump.
[00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:22.120]   Parrump.
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:23.120]   Parrump.
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:24.120]   Straight.
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:26.120]   You know, that's the only, that's probably the only setting in the stick.
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:29.120]   We can rent an automatic weapon, go to a Bravo and somebody fireworks.
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:30.120]   What's the crux?
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:31.120]   What's the crux?
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:33.120]   One year and bought a ton of great fireworks.
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:39.120]   We went through the border in three different places and three different cars going back to California.
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:41.120]   God, that was horrible.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:42.120]   That was great, actually.
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:47.120]   Have you ever done the shooting ranges there, the automatic weapons of the shooting ranges?
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:48.120]   Nope.
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:51.120]   I kind of can't do that now.
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.120]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.120]   They kind of discourage that, don't they?
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:55:07.120]   If you go to my blog, I've got a link to that shooting rate, that thing they do every year in Oklahoma where people bring all the machine guns and bombs and grenade throwers.
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:08.120]   It's quite an interesting video.
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:09.120]   That'd be fun.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:10.120]   What's your problem, Kevin?
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:12.120]   Do they have a payphone there or something?
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:16.120]   No, with a touch tone there.
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:17.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:17.120 --> 00:55:18.120]   And I can whistle.
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:21.120]   As long as I can whistle, you know, there's a serious problem.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:24.120]   John, you've blogged an interesting story that I don't know what to make of.
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:40.120]   An Australian security company says that OS X, because it has all this old Unix stuff in it, is actually more vulnerable than Windows or Linux, they haven't done the proper job in securing these old programs that, you know, Linux, they're secure, but not on OS X.
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.120]   Yeah, I know.
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:50.120]   That's been talk about that for a number of years. I mean, the fact is that Apple never gets a tower that OS X never gets attacked so they never, you know, go say, "Oh, my God, look what happened."
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:55.120]   I mean, like Microsoft is getting pretty robust, more or less, because they're always being attacked.
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:56:02.120]   And I think if the OS X ever became popular, it would be under attack and it would probably start falling apart quickly.
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:06.120]   There's been identified vulnerabilities in OS X that have been critical.
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:10.120]   Absolutely. Although they have, Apple seems to patch them as soon as they're identified.
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:13.120]   I'm wondering what this guy is talking about.
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:14.120]   I'll say call it a feature.
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:30.120]   Right, yeah, right. The guy's Neil Archibald, he's with Shursec, and he says the problem is it's not so much in the, you know, the well-known flaws that are getting patched, but in a lot of this older stuff that is just sitting on OS X and nobody's paying any attention to.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:34.120]   Well, it's not under the hood, it's really free BSD, right?
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:37.120]   Exactly, yeah. And there's a lot of free BSD in there.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:41.120]   So, on the other hand, it's easy to say that. He doesn't talk very much about any specifics.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:45.120]   In fact, the one thing he mentions was patched by Apple as soon as it was discovered.
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:52.120]   Speaking of systems getting hacked, I checked my domain registrar the last couple of days, bulkregister.com.
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:57.120]   They got a message that comes up saying, "Do to unscheduled maintenance." It's for shutdown.
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:57:01.120]   Unscheduled maintenance.
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.120]   Unscheduled maintenance.
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:06.120]   Yeah, to return some database, and it mentions database restoration.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:10.120]   That's another euphemism for a crash, right? Unscheduled maintenance?
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:11.120]   Well, or something.
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:12.120]   I like it.
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:18.120]   It's trying to hijack the walls that are working like they did, six.com or what.
[00:57:18.120 --> 00:57:22.120]   That's right. Well, I'm going to let you guys in Vegas go. I appreciate your joining us.
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:26.120]   It's great to have Kevin. You know, it's funny. I've been trying to, I've been wanting to get Kevin on the show for a long time.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:29.120]   Next time you're in town, please come by, Kevin, and join us in the studio.
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:30.120]   Where are you?
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:35.120]   We're in San Francisco. We do it in Marin County in San Francisco, but you can always join us via Skype, too.
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:37.120]   It's great to have you on.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.120]   It's great to talk to you again, Leon.
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:42.120]   Where are you heading out to next? You could be home for a while?
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:52.120]   Well, I'm going to Tel Aviv on the 15th of the speak at IDC, and then I have to come back here to speak at University of Utah, then I go to South Africa.
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:53.120]   Wow.
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:57.120]   And then in June, actually, Woz and I are keynoting Interop in Moscow.
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:58.120]   In Moscow?
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:57:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:00.120]   That'll be fun.
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:03.120]   So we get to go to Moscow to go to Steve. How about that? Red Square.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:06.120]   I'd like to send a camera crew along on that one. That should be so nice.
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:09.120]   Hey, I'm going to Hayward next week.
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:15.120]   Well, I'll tell you what, Kevin, let's figure out a time and I'd love to get you on a regular basis.
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:19.120]   And, of course, Woz, I'm going to see you shipboard in about five days.
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:22.120]   We're going on the Macmania 4 down to Mexico.
[00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:23.120]   That is right.
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:24.120]   That is right.
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:25.120]   Yep.
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:29.120]   I get home from my roadshow for like one night, and then I'm on the off to the gate group.
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:31.120]   Bring your yellow lasers, okay?
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:33.120]   Oh, yes, I will. Absolutely.
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:34.120]   Good.
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:41.120]   When you see my yellow, my purple, my blue, my red, and my green all going at once, it's a beautiful sight.
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:44.120]   It's like the Jamaican flag, I think.
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:48.120]   All right, guys. It's great to talk to you. Nice to meet you, Alex. Thank you for joining us.
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.120]   We really appreciate it.
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:50.120]   Nice to meet you, Alex.
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:51.120]   All right. And come back and...
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:53.120]   By the way, Nitro is acting snagged. You send their love.
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:54.120]   Oh.
[00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:57.120]   I adore them. So you know them, huh?
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:59.120]   Yeah, they're wonderful.
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:01.120]   They're the people, the joy of tech.
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:03.120]   And actually they...
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:04.120]   I think we've all...
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:08.120]   I think we were sitting right next to me the last time I was on a twit, and I didn't think to bring them in.
[00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:10.120]   Yeah. Oh, well, yeah. We should have had them in.
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:19.120]   And you know, it's funny, of course, that they're the ones who did the very famous Kevin Mitnick cartoon, Kevin Mitnick's first day back on the Internet.
[00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:22.120]   Oh, I remember that, Leo, like it was yesterday.
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:25.120]   He was on the screen savers was was there too.
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:28.120]   And... It was a long time waiting to get back up the Internet.
[00:59:28.120 --> 00:59:29.120]   Have you ever...
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:34.120]   I'm gonna remind you, these two people actually came down and taught in my class once, back when I did class this week.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:36.120]   Oh, they're great. They're really fun. Yeah.
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:41.120]   Well, it's nice to meet you. I'll have a great day, and I hope you can get into your hotel, I was.
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:43.120]   We'll make...
[00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:48.120]   We'll make a call down to Steve Win, maybe we can get him to let them in.
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:54.120]   Can you believe Woz has to sit out at a Starbucks and because their line is too long at the Caesars Palace?
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:57.120]   Seems like there should be something we could do about that, John.
[00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:58.120]   Don't you have Vegas connections?
[00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:00.120]   That's a good place. You know, it's a good...
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.120]   You see, this is a great place.
[01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:06.120]   Have you ever stayed there, Robert? I know you're a Vegas fanatic.
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:10.120]   Not at Caesars, no. I did have a chance to go into the new wind casino, though.
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:12.120]   How was that? Is that nice?
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:15.120]   It's the newest thing there. It is beautiful.
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:18.120]   And they have, what is, like a 200-foot waterfall right out front?
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:20.120]   Always eye catching.
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.120]   A two-hut 200 foot, you said?
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:25.120]   Yeah, like a 150-200 foot high waterfall right out front.
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:26.120]   That's really cool.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:28.120]   Man-made mountain.
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:32.120]   Amber, you know, I'm sorry we didn't get you in at the beginning, but we're glad we could have you join us.
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:37.120]   Any stories that you were on your mind that we talked about the Google story, I...
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:40.120]   There wasn't a lot of news this week, I'll be honest with you.
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:44.120]   I just added one a while ago, but the SMS messaging world records match.
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:47.120]   Yeah, let's talk about that. I was wondering who added that.
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:52.120]   Tell me, so there's a world record for SMS messengers?
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.120]   I know, I can believe it either.
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:58.120]   Yeah, I just read somewhere today that there was a contest held in Singapore,
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:02.120]   and the record holder walked away with $10,000 US,
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:09.120]   and I guess they typed in 26 words into a cell phone's text message in 43 seconds.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:14.120]   26 words, 43 seconds. Well, it's not exactly a world-beating typing speed, but it sounds pretty...
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:18.120]   It sounds pretty numbing if you're using... They're not using T9 or anything either.
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.120]   That's letter by letter, I would guess.
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:24.120]   Yeah, that's triple. I just can't believe that it's such a contest, even if it's still either tricky.
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:26.120]   Do you use SMS?
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:31.120]   Yeah, I do. I use it all the time. I find I use it more than probably talking on the phone.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.120]   Really?
[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:33.120]   Yeah.
[01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.120]   How about you, Robert? Do you ever use it?
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:38.120]   I receive a lot of SMS from other people, but personally, I rarely use it.
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.120]   It's too hard for me to type anything.
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:47.120]   That's too. I'm wondering, wouldn't a Morse code set up be faster than doing the T9 text input anyway?
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:49.120]   Yeah, if you knew Morse code.
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:51.120]   Yeah, that's true, of course.
[01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:53.120]   That might be a problem.
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.120]   Who's going to learn Morse code? Do your kids John use SMS?
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:02:00.120]   No, I don't think Americans in general use SMS as much as Europeans in Japanese.
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.120]   And Canadians, apparently.
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.120]   Well, at least a few.
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:07.120]   At least a lot of your friends in Canada use SMS.
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:11.120]   Yeah, I mean, I went out with some friends for dinner last night, and everybody had their phones,
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:15.120]   and they were all sending SMS messages and just saying, "We'll meet you here."
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:17.120]   At this time, this is where we are. We're on our way.
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:24.120]   And no one's talking on the phone. So I think it's just a polite way to be able to talk to people without actually talking on your cell phone.
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.120]   Right.
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.120]   It tends to be really popular here.
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:28.120]   Is that intro? I don't know.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:32.120]   I've heard people complain that they can't figure out how to use it.
[01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.120]   Well, yeah, exactly.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:36.120]   On some phones, it's not easy.
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.120]   I mean, I don't think it's Americans.
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.120]   Just don't get it. I don't understand it because it is huge.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.120]   Forget the phone. There's no common interface.
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:45.120]   I mean, one phone does it one way, another one's buried in a menu someplace.
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.120]   These phones that will use suck.
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.120]   Maybe that's it.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.120]   I agree with that one.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.120]   Yeah.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:50.120]   We have terrible phone.
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.120]   Although they have the same phones in Canada pretty much.
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.120]   I don't think it's any different.
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:58.120]   For the longest time, every SMS message I was receiving didn't have the person's name attached to it.
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:03.120]   So I'd kind of have to read the message and see what it was, and then I finally contacted the phone company.
[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:05.120]   They were saying, "Oh, you have to enable another service.
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:08.120]   You can actually see who it is that sending you these messages."
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:10.120]   I'm like, "That's brilliant, guys. Thanks, sir."
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:15.120]   Well, this is kind of enabling that is one of the problems we have in this country generally.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:20.120]   You know, trying to use these phones, these GSM phones that supposedly work over a season.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:23.120]   You go over there, you can't make a call because it hasn't some trigger.
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:28.120]   Some mechanism has to be turned on over here in advance and nobody knows about it in advance.
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.120]   It's ridiculous.
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:39.120]   One thing I do find that's different here, just from my past travels to the US, is that I find in Canada, at least in Toronto,
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:43.120]   that people are less likely to be in restaurants talking on their cell phones.
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:47.120]   So they tend to, you know, that's where SMS kind of comes into play a lot of times,
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:53.120]   whereas when I go to San Francisco, other cities, I find, you know, it's kind of more common for people to just be in restaurants and talking in the phones.
[01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.120]   And it's not a big deal. It's kind of part of your life.
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:00.120]   But here it seems that you don't see it as much, but you see people, the Canadians kind of hiding in the table.
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:03.120]   Canadians are much more polite, I have to say.
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:07.120]   I was going to say, at least among my friends, it's considered rude to be sitting at the table talking.
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:08.120]   It's awful. It's terrible.
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:12.120]   But I agree that I think people, do you see it? You go in a restaurant, people are doing it all the time.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:18.120]   Well, it's worse is the guy with the obnoxious ring and he takes five or six calls during, you know, dinner time. It's unbelievable.
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.120]   Ringtones have got to die.
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:20.120]   Yeah.
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:21.120]   Terrible idea.
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:28.120]   I think it's when you're sitting on the plane and you're about to take off and someone's still got to squeeze that last second on their cell phone.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:31.120]   Inevitably, I'm sitting next to the guy.
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:36.120]   I mean, I couldn't care. You're listening to their business. It's always a sales. Some guy's doing sales.
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:40.120]   We're going to get them. We're going to. Oh, I just, it's awful.
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:45.120]   I'm telling you, any of your headphones I bought are the best thing for flying. It just drowns it all right out.
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.120]   Silence.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:51.120]   Canadians make you take your headphones off during takeoff and landing. So you have to hear these guys.
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.120]   That doesn't mean easy.
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:56.120]   See, there's no reason to do that because they end up playing the announcements through the headphones.
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:00.120]   Oh, you can keep those on, but it's the ones hooked up to your iPod.
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:01.120]   Yeah.
[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:04.120]   And then you try to hide them under your jacket. They still come up and find them.
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.120]   Really? You've tried to do that.
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.120]   Oh.
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:14.120]   Yeah, they definitely will find them. They'll come up to you and say, "Can you please take them from around your neck and set them down in your lap or put them away?"
[01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:15.120]   Oh, they're mean.
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.120]   They're very strict about it.
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.120]   That's a little bizarre.
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:22.120]   Well, that's so that if they, you know, they say, "The plane's going down. We're ditching. Jump."
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:23.120]   You'll hear it.
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:25.120]   See, I typically plug into the armrest.
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.120]   I'll probably be walking out to some music and not really noticing that.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:30.120]   You're right. You're the last. You look up. There's no one on the plane.
[01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:32.120]   Where'd they all go?
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:33.120]   That's such a good song.
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:37.120]   And why are we pointed down?
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:42.120]   All right. Well, I think we're going to call it a wrap on this one because I'm going to have to do some cleaning up.
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:52.120]   It was a little bit noisy in Vegas, but it was just an amazing thing that not only did we get was at a Starbucks, but who wanders by, but Kevin Mintnick?
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:54.120]   Does anybody but me find that a little weird?
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:56.120]   No, it's very weird.
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:58.120]   It's very strange.
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:03.120]   It's the strangest thing ever. And it's the, this must be the weirdest episode of Twit, ever.
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:09.120]   We're going to do this again via Skype for the next couple of weeks, and then we're going to do a live one at the Apple Store.
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:15.120]   We'll give you the details on that. And we have our new studio in Court of Madeira, which is a really nice place to do video.
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:20.120]   It's a full TV studio at Golden Gate Studios there. That's a really nice place.
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:26.120]   We thank the folks at America Online. I think we've, and you know, every time I've mentioned this, it's always been at the end of the podcast.
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:29.120]   But I think we have licked this Akamai issue.
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:36.120]   America Online switched to Akamai, Akamai servers a couple of weeks ago, and we were having trouble with truncated podcasts.
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:42.120]   But I think we figured out what's going on. I'm hoping now you'll get this entire podcast.
[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:44.120]   What's going on?
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:50.120]   For some, well, for some reason, I think, I'm not sure exactly the details. I think I figured out how to get around it.
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:56.120]   Some of the Akamai, you know how Akamai works? It's a bunch of servers that keep copies of the content.
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:05.120]   So when you try to download our podcast, you're not really getting it from AOL anymore, which is a good thing because we've been drawing a terabyte a day from AOL.
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:14.120]   You're actually getting it from a local server, an Akamai server, so it's faster, and the burden is spread out over hundreds of servers.
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:21.120]   It seems that a couple of the Akamai servers had partial copies of the podcast, not the full copy.
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:30.120]   So about, I got about 500, 600 people complaining, now this is out of a quarter of a million, but about 500, 600 people complaining that they only got 10 minutes of the podcast.
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:45.120]   And it happened not only to this podcast, but security now. What I did this week, and I don't know if it's the Akamai engineers fixing something or this, but what I did this week is I uploaded ahead of time and waited before I posted the announcement about it, about an hour or two just to allow it to percolate out through the Akamai network.
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:49.120]   And that seems to have solved that problem, so we'll do that from now on.
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:57.120]   I want everybody to go to the website, press the buttons, support to it with your donations because this is all pie in the sky.
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:06.120]   What we really count on is the support of our listeners, and you guys have been generous, but we still have lots of expenses, including Big Bandwidth, Beatles.
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:10.120]   So that's it. Thanks everybody, I really appreciate you being here.
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.120]   Thank you.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:15.120]   Amber MacArthur and Robert Herron, DLTV, it's going well.
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:21.120]   I think Patrick fell out under his car at some point during that conversation, but that's okay.
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:27.120]   John C. Dvorak at dvorak.org/blog, and I'm Leo LaPorte, another Twitch.
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:30.120]   Is it okay? This weekend tech.
[01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:38.120]   This is a crack-dinner ratio.
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:46.120]   This is a crack-dinner ratio.
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:51.120]   This is a crack-dinner ratio.
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:58.120]   This is a crack-dinner ratio.
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:03.120]   This is a crack-dinner ratio.
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:07.120]   This is a crack-dinner ratio.
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:13.120]   This is going well.
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:15.120]   This is going well.
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:17.120]   Now our servers there.
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:19.120]   This weekend tech.
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.120]   This weekend tech.
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:22.120]   We are here.
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:24.120]   Here, here, here.
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.120]   Tech.
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:30.120]   Tech.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.120]   Tech.
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:38.120]   My friends, my tweets, are you ready?
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:41.120]   We have a Twitter army.
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:44.120]   I don't know what the answer is. I really don't.
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:47.120]   Let me introduce the table mates.
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.120]   John C. Dvorak.
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:54.120]   Kevin Rose.
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:57.120]   Patrick Norton.
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:01.120]   David Prager.
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:05.120]   Robert Herron.
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:10.120]   I got the Twitter army behind me.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.120]   This is going well.
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:14.120]   Microsoft poop-rooted.
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:17.120]   This is going to ignite us.
[01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:19.120]   There's no problem.
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:21.120]   This is going to hurt our system.
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:23.120]   We're going to dig.
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:25.120]   This is going well.
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.120]   It's a fool's paradise.
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:30.120]   This is amazing.
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:43.120]   I'm going to dig.
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.120]   You're going to do the Twitter.
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.120]   All right.
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:48.120]   You're going to do it, baby.
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.120]   You're going to do it.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:51.120]   All right.
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:52.120]   You're going to do it.
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:53.120]   All right.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.120]   You're going to do it, baby.
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:56.120]   You're going to do it.
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:57.120]   All right.
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:58.120]   You're going to do it, baby.
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:59.120]   You're going to do it.
[01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:00.120]   All right.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.120]   You're going to do it, baby.
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.120]   You're going to do it.
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:04.120]   All right.
[01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:06.120]   You're going to do it, baby.
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:07.120]   You're going to do it.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:08.120]   All right.
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:09.120]   You're going to do it, baby.
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:10.120]   You're going to do it, baby.
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:12.120]   You're going to do it, baby.
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:13.120]   You're going to do it, baby.
