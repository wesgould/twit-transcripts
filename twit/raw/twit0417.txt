[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.880]   It is really good to be on the show. Oh, I missed you. Such awesome people.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.640]   I know what a panel, huh? Yeah. So glad you could be here also joining us in studio John C.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.640]   Devorek. That would be me. Always off television. No, you do no agenda show.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.000]   Chailed Devorek. Yeah. And I got a new ebook that just came out.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.200]   Oh, we're going to talk about that. I'm very happy for you. Well, thanks.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.040]   He's done it. I'm doing one every two weeks. Is this your first book in and how long? Two weeks?
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.360]   No, I'm going to do one every. I got all these back to all those back to me. I get the vinegar
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.320]   book. I got the cycles. Are you going to do the vinegar book? I think I'm going to do that.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.560]   It's already written. It's already written. I just talked about that. John is many people think he's
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.600]   a tech expert. He's actually a vinegar expert. I am. This is a fact. It's a fact. He knows all about
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:07.360]   the must. The vinegar must. The vinegar must. We call it the mother mother. Yes. We'll talk about
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.360]   that later. I know you're going to stay tuned for that. Also here from Bismit Blue.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.080]   From Bloomberg Business. Say that again.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.800]   Vinnie Vinnie. Hello there to Mark Millian. Good to have you back.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.480]   Thanks. Welcome. Good to be here. You stopped at Phil's. You were coming all the way up here
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.400]   and you brought your coffee with you. I got this in the morning before I got out of the city.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.640]   The problem was getting out of the city traffic. Oh, it's bad. Well, I appreciate you're making
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.000]   that. Well, thanks. Molly's going. Thank God I stayed home. I know. I'm kind of. Yeah.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.880]   Is it a holiday or something? Is there some reason for the try? I don't understand that.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.080]   I don't know. Getting over the bridge. Thank you for coming up. I know it's hard to be here.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.880]   We appreciate it. We know we're in the middle of nowhere. And from Frog Pants Studios.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.120]   Yay. Scott Johnson's also here. Hello, Scott. Hey, Leo. Thanks for having me back.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.360]   Always good to be on Twitter. You know what's cool? Scott has actually carefully arranged his
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.600]   shot so that there is a spot for the lower third. Yeah. I did. I'm going to help the brother out.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.280]   That's very funny. Is that a big thing?
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.840]   A head. You have a piece of lumber in front of you. What are you doing?
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.440]   No, that is actually just a big 30 inch display, but it's just perfectly positioned. I have no idea.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.680]   That's awesome. Wait a minute. We're watching you on TV.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.920]   No, no, no. I do a lot of big along with everything else we have going on over here.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:29.600]   I do a lot of video stuff and this big display is kind of in charge. I'm a fan of the morning
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.880]   stream. Oh, thanks. Yeah. John C. Devorak is not, but that's a topic for today. What?
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.120]   We so this is the morning show that Scott does with a bunch of other people. It's very good.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.800]   Yeah. There was a huge fan of that show. You don't even know what it is.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.040]   You won't remember. Maybe you will remember, but we had a fun little fake little feud that was
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.120]   going on that I had no idea about really, but it was more of a fan thing. So it's good. It's good
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.600]   to know that you enjoy the show. If you tune in the morning stream, you can get it at frockpance.com.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:02.960]   You'll hear such great episodes as I can't feel my crotch. It's those guys from five by five. I
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.840]   don't like spitting on fans with Dan Benjamin was here last week. I should have been here.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.520]   You should have been here. I could have chewed him out for what they do. What did he do? I'm just
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.280]   kidding. Oh, we love Dan. We're, you know what? It's a small universe of podcasters,
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.200]   and it's great to have everybody on. And I shouldn't even say podcasters. I include you,
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.120]   Molly would new media types because always on is a real TV show, but it's done on the internet.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.920]   Yeah, they got a budget too. I still think everybody up. My mind's. Chromecast. Let's start
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.680]   with Chromecast. Oh, yeah. Vimeo and Redbox instant say we're going to croak cast. HBO goes
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.400]   as we're going to Chromecast. This is the $35 dongle you plug into your HDMI port and you can
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:53.600]   tell it to play video back from an app or from a chrome tab. Yeah. And they sold quite a few.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.840]   You know, we were speculating how many they sold. They're cheap. Why not? I bought five.
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.720]   Would you add for what reason? I have that many TVs. I have five holes to plug.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.800]   Yeah, exactly. But I put one on three TVs in my house and it's great because last night,
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.880]   for instance, I was thinking I wanted to see a YouTube video and I started watching it on the
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.640]   Nexus 7 and I said, wait a minute, I could just put it on the TV. It looks good. The sound went
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.080]   through the speakers and everything. It really sounded good. If you got them early enough,
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.800]   you only spent about 11 or 12 bucks. Because you got that Netflix deal where you got three
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.440]   months free. So it was pretty much too good to pass up. I bought it the minute they went on sale.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.240]   So we're trying to figure out how many they sold and an Amazon, a guy works for Amazon,
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.160]   told us that he thought they, you know, Amazon sold out within a day, actually within a few hours.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.680]   He thought that they had four to 700,000, 400,000 to 700,000. So if that's how many Amazon had
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.000]   Google sold out right away as well, you got to figure they sold at least half a million to a million.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.800]   Probably sold a million. It's cheap. That sounds about right too because that's about the size of
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:01.200]   kind of the Roku audience. And I think that is the most likely target. No, I disagree with this.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.080]   You do? Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to get one of these things. I've got a Roku box. I got a
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.840]   WD. I got all these boxes already. And I don't need another dongle thing to stick in the HDMI
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:15.680]   ports, which are full. Yeah, you would buy it instead of it. I totally agree. I'd buy instead
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.640]   of a Roku, not with a Roku. Right. When this thing came out, I did a little count of how many
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.840]   devices in my home already do some version of what the Chromecast does. And I think I got to like six.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.480]   I mean, not including laptops and phones and tablets and just like the TV, the Blu-ray player,
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:37.040]   the TiVo, the Xbox and the Roku all do that. But I still kind of got suckered into buying one
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.080]   because they all do it in some form, but it's not as easy as it should be. They all do Netflix.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.000]   Every everything my refrigerator practically does Netflix. Everything does Netflix. That's
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.440]   the default, right? But what it's doing is a little different. So for instance, instead of the Netflix
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:56.320]   interface on my Apple TV or my Roku, I'm using them. I, in my opinion, much better, much easier
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:01.040]   to use Netflix interface on my tablet or my phone. And then saying, yeah, that movie sent it to the
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:05.840]   TV. That's a better experience. And I'm not denying, by the way, if you already have a Roku or an
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:11.040]   Apple TV, you really don't need this yet. But let's say they do get more than Netflix. Let's say they
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.920]   do, you know, Kush, the guy who have you ever looked at the lineup of what they have on the Roku?
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.600]   Oh, it's thousands of thousands of crap. Well, you know what they don't have?
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.760]   You two nobody. Yeah, nobody really wants that. Everybody wants to be sitting around.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.160]   The only reason that I ended up playing podcast. I don't have sling box.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.240]   Because what happens is like my brother comes over and a bunch of us are hanging out. And we
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.640]   all start talking about that YouTube video that have you seen? Have you seen the blah blah blah?
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.400]   And then we crowd around a little tiny phone and we try to watch it and we pass the phone around.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:43.920]   And so if we could just go flick to the TV for 35 bucks, that seems worth it. I still don't think
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:49.440]   it's a giant market by any means. Like everybody's really portrayed it as a huge low-cost disruptor.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.840]   And I think that remains to be seen, especially because apparently when you flick video from a
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.120]   mobile to the TV, it stays in the mobile resolution and there's no way to change it.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.040]   That's not true. Kind of a letdown. That's actually not true. So if you're using Netflix,
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:07.280]   it goes to 1080p. And it looks beautiful. Yep. If you and I did YouTube last night, as I said,
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:12.880]   and it started at the crappy resolution and YouTube sensed it and went to a high-def resolution.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:17.440]   It looked gorgeous. Five ones surround too. So it senses what's going on because it's the
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:22.080]   Chromecast that's doing the rebroadcast. And admittedly, I think probably all of these
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.800]   streaming systems, it takes a little while for them to notice that you've changed, but they do
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.720]   adjust. My wife said we didn't really buy a new dongle. We basically bought a fancy remote.
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.640]   And we did it kind of in a weird way. So you buy the dongle, you plug it in. And now
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:42.640]   your tablet or your phone becomes this thing that your other dinky remotes for your Apple TV
[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.000]   or Roku or whatever never really accomplished, which is a more dynamic sort of
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.200]   send stuff, get stuff back, find feedback, all that kind of stuff didn't exist on your crappy
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.760]   little remote. So you finally got to use an existing device in a way with your TV that you
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.560]   couldn't before. And you did it with this tiny dongle. And that's if you think of it that way,
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:05.360]   that's the genius of this thing. I agree with you, Leo, the whole power of this thing is cheap.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.400]   Number one, I mean, it's almost disposable at 34 bucks. And number two, you can, you know,
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.640]   the way you interact with this thing is so much better than some crappy remote with a couple
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.680]   of double A's in it. Those remotes are crummy. I want to do say, I want to say something about
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:25.200]   the about the Roku three, which I think people don't really awesome because it has a feature
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.960]   that don't list it. They don't tell you about headphones in the remote. Well, there's that
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.000]   that's a feature, but the feature that really gets me is the universal search. Oh, really,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.680]   it searches across all of stuff? I didn't know that to be I know they don't talk about it,
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:42.160]   but it's right at the opening. You go you search for like a movie and it'll show you all the
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:48.240]   services that have the movie and all the prices. You know who else did that? Google TV. Well,
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:53.520]   Tivo will do that too. My Tivo kind of does that too. I don't think it shows me the price.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:57.760]   I think that's the holy grail though. I agree with you because we know, you know, the killing
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.920]   is going to be on somewhere. In fact, this really pissed me off. You find it free. Exactly. I bought
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:07.280]   it on iTunes and then I found it free on Netflix or Amazon. I think Netflix. And it was like,
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:13.120]   Oh crap, I just made 50 bucks for something I didn't need. And a global search would have solved that.
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:18.800]   To give you an idea, here's some numbers. The best we can tell Roku has sold three million units.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.760]   Most of those units around 99 bucks, you can get a $50 Roku, but I would guess most people
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:31.200]   buying the Roku three for a good box. Apple TV, 100 bucks sold 15 million total life of.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.200]   So that's 18 million. That's a small market out there. It's not a big market.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.760]   However, people don't realize that you can even do this.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.920]   Right. Well, that's the way it works. Yeah.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.200]   Only about half of all smart TVs are even hooked up to the internet.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.520]   This should all be hooked up to the internet. Apparently, my my my
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.520]   Moto X thought I said something that I should pay. It has things to say. What internet? I'm right
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:57.040]   here. I got your internet right here. It won't. I don't you know, it shouldn't. I don't know
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.920]   why I did that anyway. It shouldn't have done that. It did. My mom bought a brand new TV that
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.840]   does all the stuff you're talking about. She has no idea. It's sitting in the corner. It's not plugged
[00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:11.280]   into anything. It's more than half of the people who have smart TVs don't even hook it up to the
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:16.560]   internet, let alone know how to use it. It's the blinking 12 problem. However, I think this
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:22.800]   Chromecast for Geeks is amazing for court cutters. You do you do a court cutting show on this network,
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.320]   Scott. And I got to think that for frame rate, this is a big deal.
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.160]   Yeah. I mean, having been on frame rate and talked about this all the time and having been a
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.400]   court cutter for five years now, I think maybe more than that. How long does it take to cut a
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:40.880]   cord? It took a while. I'm still not on at it. But no, it's this is the kind of stuff that interests
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.960]   me. So when other people are hearing about a new show coming to a network or getting excited about
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:49.280]   a new season of something on HBO, I'm that guy getting excited about a new piece of hardware that
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.280]   let me stream these things. Exactly. And the minute I heard about this, I was like, well,
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:57.280]   no brainer, even though I've got these other devices, they're all working fine. I really like
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.680]   the interface on the PS3 for Netflix, for example. It's not like I'm lacking in that department for
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:08.000]   that particular app or whatever. But I'm happy to have new ways to do it. And to me, the power of
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.840]   search is where this needs to get, you know, where this gets crazy. And when that happens,
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.640]   I'm really in a little bit. I agree. And I don't know how you do that with Chromecast,
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.080]   because it's kind of not a unified solution. Every app is its own master.
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:23.280]   Yeah, I don't think this is even targeted at Geeks, though. I think the price is really
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:32.400]   such a such a big factor here. $35 for Netflix has what that 40 million subscribers. This
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.960]   potentially opens up that market. I think the mainstream is starting to hear a lot more about
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:44.240]   Netflix, but they don't have the device to to play it on. And $35, you know, this is a perfect
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.880]   birthday gift, Christmas gift. You know, these will be flying around. These are easy to pick up.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:55.120]   If Netflix renews that either a three month or a one month offer, that was a good deal.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:59.920]   It's going to be hugely mainstream. Anybody noticing that Netflix is losing a lot of their
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.400]   business? A lot of studios are pulling out their own thing. In fact, Amazon Prime just got
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.320]   epics, which is going to be a big problem for Netflix. Why do you think they're doing arrested
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.480]   development and a house of cards? And I mean, and the orange is a new black. They realize they've
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:18.480]   got to create original exclusive content. The good news is if your Netflix, you know, they
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:23.600]   estimated in their last quarterly earnings call, they got 600,000 new subscribers to watch arrested
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:29.120]   development. The good news is these special shows are paying for themselves. What was it?
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.080]   Scott? A hundred million dollars to make house of cards? It was very expensive.
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.400]   150 something like that. And it looks I was just talking to somebody about this this morning.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.960]   It looks like a HBO production. It looks like a production. Yeah, it's not like
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.640]   the message. 13 any nominations. Yeah. And I was reading reading something on the
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:49.200]   Verge. They were talking about in terms of like production value, effects value,
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:54.720]   post production, cinematography, all this stuff that they're either on par with what
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.560]   cable is doing or in a lot of cases, better than what any networks are doing. Main street
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:03.120]   networks are trying to put together, comparing it to say under the dome, which is kind of cool.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:08.480]   And people are into that, but under the dome has this weird kind of everyone's too pretty and clean
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.880]   and kind of fake looking kind of quality to it. These guys are digging deep into what people really
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:19.200]   want, which is gritty and great looking and they're pulling it off. I think that's where they're
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.800]   banking everything as original programming. I mean, it's good. Great to have a back catalog.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:27.120]   It's great to have all this other extra content. But I think original programming is where Netflix
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.400]   ends up. I think that's where they think they end up winning this fight.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:35.280]   I mean, it's a huge promotional vehicle. People will talk about house of cards. It's up for,
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:41.200]   for what? Emmys? 13 ammys. So imagine the conversation. Oh, I'm arrested development.
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.680]   They're making it again. Yes, honey. But we need to have Netflix. Oh, why don't we do?
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:49.680]   Well, here's a $35 device and it gets us three butts of Netflix and we can watch
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:54.640]   House of Cards. That's a pretty much a no brainer. If you're a big or arrested development,
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.240]   if you're a big arrested development, nobody's saying, Oh, did you hear that Netflix lost the
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:04.320]   stars deal? No, I mean, that's not we are, but we just did. But the main story here is about
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:10.240]   House of Cards. They don't hear about the stars deal or them losing a few blockbuster movies.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.560]   I think they definitely hear about that. But do you think they actually really hear about the
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:20.080]   $35 little job that they can plug into the show? Switch a roof. Make the thing go to the other thing
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:26.000]   if you switch it from the thing. I mean, versus, Oh, I can watch that on my laptop or my TV does that
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.560]   or what my Xbox does that I still think Apple TV and Xbox have a stronger, well, they have better
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:37.040]   brand recognition for one thing. I think Chromecast makes no sense to anybody. I feel like that's
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:41.680]   so much likely so much more likely to sell to people who want to watch YouTube on a TV better.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.600]   Right. Well, I think that's up to how Google plays it because now it's still early. They
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:51.840]   don't have the inventory to fill out any any sales right now. But if they ramp up the promotional
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:56.160]   vehicle, I only think is I don't I'm not really sure what's in it for Google here because they
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:02.320]   can't really be making much margin. They watch everything you watch. And I feel like Google will
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.960]   play it exactly the way they play everything else, which is like release the thing into the world
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.800]   let it be free. Never speak of it again. Well, that will be interesting. That's a possibility.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.640]   But do you think there's any meaning to the fact there's a little microphone in each one of those
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.680]   devices? There isn't John. Stop it. But they don't need to because they're seeing everything you watch
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:25.040]   already Google now. When I do you're telling me that if you go to Netflix and start watching
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:31.680]   something is going to phone home? Yeah, of course it is. Not just Netflix to Google and the NSA.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:36.400]   And let me point out when I launched my Google now on my Wi-Fi my Wi-Fi connected phone,
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:41.920]   it says, Oh, I see you have a TV on this network. What are you watching? And then it asked me to
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:46.480]   press record and it will listen to the TV show and tell me the show and then give me more stuff about
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.400]   it. They're very much playing that game. And that's money for Google. Absolutely.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:56.240]   But I don't well, do you care? I don't care. I don't well, I who cares if Google knows what you
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:02.720]   watch on TV, unless it's homo erotic stuff. I don't even know what that means.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:09.280]   So I think the play is kind of interesting as a niche play because what the way Chromecast really
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:15.280]   kind of plays itself is every app developer will put it into an app. So when Amazon streaming,
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:19.840]   for instance, puts a Chromecast, that's going to be huge. When, you know, when Frog pants,
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.720]   the morning stream has a Chromecast button in its app. Oh, enormous game changer.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.280]   Well, I don't know about that, but we're going to, but we're going to have Chromecast buttons in our
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:34.080]   app. Coosh, the guy who did clockwork mod is working on it for a Twitter app. So what happens
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:39.360]   there is each of these slices starts to say, Oh, I want it for this reason, for that reason,
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.680]   for this reason. I think that's an interesting market. You're right.
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:47.120]   Mark makes a good point about the way Google does this. They didn't do an ad,
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:52.560]   you know, on NBC on Tuesday night. They didn't do like an Apple play with this where they make a
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:57.600]   bigger deal out of it and spend a bunch of money on that. They literally got up and showed it at a
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.640]   very small conference on their own campus in front of a very small group that was streamed a
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:08.240]   bunch of us nerds. And that was your audience. They didn't go further than that. So now, in a way,
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:13.040]   we're part of their plan. So we, we start evangelizing and we start telling our, you know, telling people.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.560]   And then they'll make that decision that Molly's worried about whether they, whether they put it
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:20.880]   down the wild and just forget about it, Google TV style, or if they really support it, it's all
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.760]   about us from now. I'm here on the track record says yes to Molly. But I think it's a new Google
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:30.880]   and it's a hardware manufacturer company. Same company. The next new Google? Yes. The Nexus 7
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:35.600]   is a tablet that kicks butt in that size. There's nothing close, especially for $229.
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:42.320]   The Moto X, their first Motorola phone as a Google company is a phenomenal phone. It's not as good
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:48.400]   as this. He's pointing to my HTC one. Yes, I'm pointing to his HTC one. Which may, I don't know
[00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.880]   what this phone is. I think you should get, you should keep this phone and you should give me this
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:59.200]   phone. Oh, that's his play. That's what he's doing. I love the screen feature, but the screen just
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:03.440]   kind of lights up lightly. So what they did with the Moto X is the AMOLED screen, which you can
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.760]   up light up parts of. So if it's been in my pocket for a while and I pull it out, it will light up
[00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:11.440]   what time it is thinking. Maybe you want to know what time without me telling it to. And it will
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.840]   also show notifications. And without actually launching the phone, I can, I can swipe the
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.760]   notification. I don't have any or I would have, I could show you this, but I would swipe the
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.600]   notification and could read it, put it away. And it does that without turning on the whole screen,
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.840]   because it's AMOLED. It could turn on a little bit of the screen. So it's battery. They have battery
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:32.880]   life's excellent so far. It's about 15, 16 hours, even with heavy use, because I've been, you know,
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:37.520]   I'm reviewing it for Tuesday and I'm using it like crazy. The best part is though, is in your pocket,
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:43.680]   you can talk to it. You really have a thing about this. Well, or in the car, more useful.
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:47.040]   You got a mouse in your pocket. More useful in the car. It could be sitting on the seat.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:51.200]   And I guess, watch here, I'll do it. Now I trained it. Well, let's make it a noisy car.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:58.880]   Okay. Okay. Google now. Okay, Google now. I did a stupid thing. Wait a minute. Now I did it.
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:04.880]   I'm driving the crew crazy with the pound is stupid thing because I did it. Sorry. I did it.
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:09.600]   You just talk. But a whole lot. I have to explain. I did it with a kind of funny cartoon voice,
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.360]   which is a mistake because now I have to do it just so. But go ahead and you guys keep talking
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.800]   and I'll ask it to do something. Go ahead. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:22.400]   Wait a minute. Google now. It's in the car. It's in the car. It's not going to be sitting
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:27.280]   too. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Ready? Okay. Now everybody's talking. Okay.
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.680]   Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:43.760]   Yeah. What? What? According to Wikipedia, Molly Kristen Wood is an executive editor at
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:49.520]   CNETCOM and previously a writer for Associated Press, Mac, Journal Magazine, and O'Reilly Media.
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:53.120]   Now I did that with a noisy environment about four feet away from me.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:57.520]   Are you sad? Molly, how glad are you? It's not the other Molly Wood.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:04.240]   Yeah, the stripper. No, she's not. I wish she were a stripper. She's a full on porn actress.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:11.840]   And I was like, yeah. Really? I didn't know that. Oh, yes. There's I was literally like my
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:14.800]   blood went cold for a second there. I was like, please don't say porn star. Please don't say
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:20.800]   my begging you. Wow. I'm sorry. I had no idea, but you're relieved because I didn't know you
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:27.680]   worked for the AP. I thought that was pretty amazing. So I think Google is doing porn. I think
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:33.040]   it's kind of a new Google where you got you got the Nexus 7. You must I mean, that's amazing,
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:39.200]   right? Is it? Yeah, it really is. $229. It's a. So that's your tablet of choice now? Beautiful
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:43.760]   tablet. So would you recommend that over somebody? Oh, an iPad? Get an iPad. Yeah. Why? It's 100 bucks
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.000]   less. It's higher screen. It's retina. You know, you can't get a retina iPad mini. I'd recommend
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.360]   it over the mini. I don't know if I'd reckon over the 10 if you want a 10 inch, I maybe go
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:57.600]   with a 10 inch iPad. But boy, the Nexus 7 for $229 is a very compelling product. The point being
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.200]   Google can make and we've mentioned this last week, but Google can make products without making
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.960]   any money on it because they make money on the back end just like Amazon. It makes it very hard
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.200]   for Apple and others to compete with. Samsung and Apple have to make money on the hardware up front.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:14.320]   Hardware is a different game though that Google's Google's now getting into it. They're going to
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.080]   have to figure out what they want to do. You know, this is getting the hardware? Microsoft.
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.840]   Yeah, but Microsoft has a reason. How is that worked that for? Not so well.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:26.960]   Microsoft and Microsoft interestingly pays so much more attention to their hardware than
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:31.040]   Google ever does. And yet it's wildly unsuccessful. It's not wildly unsuccessful.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:35.520]   They're all designed for the Microsoft rollout of the stores. They were rolling out stores.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:41.360]   Yeah, stores are amazing too. Have you been to one? No, because there is no store in the San
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:45.920]   Francisco Bay Area. There's one in court of Madeira. There is one in court of Madeira. I hear it's
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.840]   total Apple store clone actually. It's a total clone. There's one by Stan. Yeah, no, they're all
[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:54.240]   the Apple logo would be is the windows logo. You may have to go to the store before you can
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:24:00.400]   criticize it. So wait, John, you're saying that the hardware only exists to help support the stores.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.160]   That makes no sense. Their whole orientation is to build out a bunch of stores and do it.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.840]   They just want to be a retail company. They got to have stuff to sell. That's why they're bringing
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.600]   out these products. Yeah, but it's taken them two or three years to roll out all those stores.
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:15.520]   It's taking too long. I'm not arguing that. It's taking way too long. And if you can't get
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.320]   anybody excited about the hardware in the first place, they're not going to go to the store to
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:22.160]   look at the hardware. Well, you got to get them in the store in the first place was something kind
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:26.080]   of interesting. Well, going down to quarter Madeira right now to go to the Microsoft store.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.400]   Is it a close? It closes at six.
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:35.040]   You know, is it a cross street from the Apple store? Probably is. No, it's in the quarter
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:39.600]   Madeira, but that one other mall. I don't know. Is it in the Nordstrom mall? I don't know.
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:43.360]   That's the app. I haven't been there myself. Oh, you neither. Huh? No, I'm going to go.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:47.280]   It's a real drawing. It's a real drawing card for that mall. Man, they're flocking.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:51.680]   Meanwhile, sounds like actually is popping up little baby stores left and right. Have you seen
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:56.400]   these? The Samsung experience stores? Those are in best buys. Yes. They're in best buy now.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.520]   They're in airports. Like they just seem like they're all over the place.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.440]   Well, I think we could draw a conclusion here that software companies and services companies say
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:08.480]   we need to make hardware hardware companies say we need to have retail outlets. Apple is really
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:13.440]   the model for all of this. That's because the Apple per square foot sales is the biggest in the
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:18.080]   world in the Tiffany, right? And so Microsoft, if they just do half the business, they'll be
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:22.400]   making tons of money better than forever 21. But they still have to have something in the
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:26.720]   store that people want to buy. I just I mean, I hate to keep coming back to that. So they've
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:32.880]   so they've so they're gonna sell. They open an Xbox store that would kill. It is in the store.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:36.640]   That's a better brand, isn't it? The Microsoft brand. It would be. Yeah. They put it. They put it in
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:41.280]   an entire setup with nothing but Xbox is in there. But the Xbox one out there. I go to that store.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:45.520]   So in the layout, at least in the Stanford store, they put the Xbox is in the back corner. Oh,
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:51.040]   you have to go through the windows phones. Look at the surface. That's a casino methodology.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:56.480]   So they've lost nine Xbox store. I'm excited about this. They could sell TVs there too. Like
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:01.680]   you could have it be a whole sweet home theater kind of store. Oh, I like it. I love it. They
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:05.920]   could have all different accessory. Yeah, there's a lot of Microsoft bashing going on here. Ladies
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:09.520]   and gentlemen, 900 million they lost on the windows. That's not true. I said I would totally love
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:14.720]   an Xbox on a surface art. I wrote a column about this $100 off their Surface Pro, which apparently
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.960]   is not selling well either. I did the column on this and I calculated the amount of inventory they
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.040]   had left over. They would have dumped it like HP did at the proper price for these things.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:28.160]   I hundred and fifty bucks. Yeah. They would have gotten 900 million exactly what they wrote off.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.280]   But remember, they have to make them that cost money to build them right now. It's saying.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:39.360]   There's a little issue there. They would have to take a $900 million right off. I think they still
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:43.600]   have to take a right off of the manufacturing costs. The point is now just to happen today,
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:48.800]   Surface Pro, the supposedly big dog, also $100 off. Now that may be to clear out
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:56.160]   if it's not enough. That's not enough off. Well, and we've seen in the Microsoft
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:00.800]   quarterly earnings, I think they said they made what 700 to 800 million on Windows surface
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:06.160]   hardware. Now they didn't break it down RT and Pro, but that's nothing. They've sold very few of
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:11.680]   them. Let me tell you the crowd that loves pros and here's the problem. They're not big enough to
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:17.040]   be a market, but they're allowed to group. That is artists and illustrators. I've got back here,
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:21.360]   a big way, comments, spent way too much money on. We do what we can to do what we do as digital
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:27.600]   artists. It's great, but the Surface Pro turned out to be a really comparatively inexpensive way to
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:32.960]   get a stylus and a tablet and to do your work. You went to a cabin, didn't you with a surface?
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:38.000]   No, it wasn't me. My friends who do it, a micro hula, at Penny Arcade, for example,
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.640]   is totally sold on the thing. It uses it for everything. It's great for that kind of portability,
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:46.960]   but some people are just straight up using it and making it their replacement digital art device.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:51.360]   That crowd's awesome and they're loud and outspoken and all that. They are not big enough.
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:55.280]   And they're the only group that I've heard really positive things about the Pro from,
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:59.600]   having not used them when I reserve judgment until I go on these hot stores that John's talking about.
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:05.840]   The point is that they're finding it at some niches with this thing, but those niches aren't
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.640]   big enough to take them to where they want to be or where they have to be.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.000]   Microsoft found the same niches with the early tablets, remember. They,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.960]   Microsoft for 10 years, flogged tablets, couldn't get anybody to buy them,
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:20.640]   except doctors and a few narrow niches, but they were very successful there.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:25.520]   And then Apple comes along and says, "Well, wait a minute, reinvent it and find a market." I wonder,
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:32.320]   I don't know, I wonder. I feel like we're at a very transitional time.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:40.320]   And getting back to TV, of course, the big time Warner CBS curve-fuffle. Time Warner says CBS
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:48.000]   wanted a 600% increase in LA, Dallas, New York to carry CBS channels. Time Warner said, "No,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:54.560]   we're going to protect our users and our bottom line." And they pull CBS off. Not only that,
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:29:01.520]   to add insult to injury, if you're a time Warner Internet subscriber, you can't go to CBS.com
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:07.280]   and watch full episodes because CBS blocked it. So this is a nasty fight. And to me,
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:12.800]   there's no winners here. There's losers. The losers are the consumer, right?
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:18.240]   Yep. But I think it's the Battle of the Dinosaurs. It's the end of the times for these guys,
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.760]   and they're fighting over the... Well, that's why they went the more money.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:27.440]   It's almost done. Isn't it broadcast almost dead? Isn't it even cable?
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:33.120]   A decade. All right. That's not a long time if you're a broadcaster. We got 10 years left.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:38.640]   Well, it could be 20 years, but I mean, if you look at what's happened with the Boston Globe,
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:43.360]   I think that's one of the more interesting stories of the week where they... So they bought it for
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.440]   1.1 billion and then turned around and sell it for 70 million, which is almost like the joke.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:51.680]   How do you make it? Who do they sell it to? Although they bought it in stock, so the stock also
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:56.000]   depreciated quite a bit in value from that billion. They would have lost the money anyway, in other
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.240]   words. Money disappeared over those years, but it disappeared. So who owns the Boston Globe now?
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:06.240]   Yeah, the guy owns the Red Sox. He needs a paper and promoted his baseball team.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.920]   Well, but see, that's the future. That's what newspapers were created for in the first place.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:17.200]   Vanity Place? And no display ads. They said, look, we know big retailers like Macy's want to buy
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:23.280]   full-page ads. They literally, they broadsheet started printing. Didn't you tell me this?
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:30.640]   Maybe. They started printing in the 19th century as a vehicle that put some crap in between the ads,
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:34.720]   so they could basically get these ads into people's hands. And that's how the newspaper
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:39.120]   business was born. And now it's fine. How the modern business you might say.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:43.840]   Yeah, what the Red Sox original. Ben Franklin wasn't doing that. I know. It was not.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:49.280]   No. By my kite. Yeah. I was telling you this type business. There is the story that Ben Franklin
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:53.440]   wanted to create the Postal Service because he wanted to give his Philadelphia newspapers
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:58.400]   quick access to the news before competitors. I swear to God, I'm not making this up.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:05.920]   It sounds right. I am not making this up. This Ben Franklin guy, he was no, he was no pusho.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:14.160]   He was shady. He created a private Postal Service so he can get the news before the other guy.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:21.680]   I don't know. I'm just saying. That's interesting. To me, it's like this, that owner got the paper
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:26.560]   on the cheap, relatively speaking. And for him, it's not a ton of money. This would be akin to
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:32.400]   Leo Yu or me in the Salt Lake area or anybody who's trying to do media suddenly finding out that
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:38.560]   the station uptown, some small low-band VM station is up on the block. You see the 300 million
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:43.200]   dollar station now, they're giving it to me for 500k. Well, I would probably be interested.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:47.120]   I don't have that kind of cash. But if I did, I'd be interested in picking that up. Why? I don't
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:51.600]   even know. I'd figure a way to make something out of that. But I feel like that's what this is
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:55.040]   for him. Anyway, who knows what his idea is. I got an idea. Let's buy a newspaper, guys.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:59.440]   All right. Just pull our caps. Do a Kickstarter campaign. What do you got in your pocket right now?
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:03.520]   Well, if you wait long enough, that's all you're going to need is what's in your pocket.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:08.480]   There was somebody starting an Indiegogo campaign not so long ago to buy the LA Times.
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:12.160]   Oh, I don't think they quite got the... How much did they say they needed?
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:15.520]   Look about a paper that's gone down the hill. Hundreds of millions.
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:21.120]   Indiegogo. Wow. Get rid of that thing. It's that I should call Dwight.
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:27.040]   Call Dwight. I don't know why. I have to say, although Leo, you've been positive about the MotoX,
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:32.320]   it is waging its own campaign. I don't know what it's doing because I trained it. I trained it
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:37.360]   with a very obscure, you know, goopy dog voice. And for some reason, it seems to respond
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.880]   to everything we're saying. Yeah, it's listening to it. It's actually going right into the archives.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:47.120]   Okay. They were looking to raise $660 million. Yeah, that'll work on Indiegogo.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:52.480]   To buy any... How much do they get? They ended up raising... They ended up getting pledges for
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:56.880]   $210,000. It's not bad. It's not bad. It's not bad. It's not bad. It's not quite six times.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:02.080]   They nestled in between like full music albums and like people's paper mache projects.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:06.560]   I think if they wait two years, they can get the Times for that.
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:10.800]   And considering, yeah, they definitely could because considering the sale price of the Boston
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:16.480]   Globe, $660 million is a wildly optimistic valuation on the LA Times. Yeah, 70 million.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:21.520]   Yeah, I think newspapers will still be around as long as networks and broadcast TV. It's just
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:26.400]   that they're all going to contract. It's going to come down to a few. Well, no, that happened.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:31.760]   That's already happened. Yeah, but it's still contracting. I mean, there, you know,
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:34.400]   there's some point where you disappeared to a little point.
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:39.840]   I had a New York Times subscription. I had to give up on... I just get Sunday only now.
[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:46.800]   Which we went into digital. It's just too much paper. You get piles and piles of paper.
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:52.160]   You just feel bad about the accumulation of recyclables. They sell tablet subscriptions.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:58.400]   But you know, I actually just recently subscribed to the Sunday San Francisco Chronicle
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:02.720]   because I wanted the newspaper. I still... There's something about the newspaper that I still...
[00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:06.720]   I definitely prefer that to reading on a tablet. I hate that. I just don't find that a good way to
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:13.520]   consume news. And I like the agenda setting of newspapers. I like that the layout kind of drives
[00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:18.720]   the perceived importance of the stories. And I like the act of reading it. I think I'm going
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:22.960]   kind of old school in my old age, though. Two years ago. Once a week's nice, right? Once a week is nice.
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:26.160]   Once a week is the way to do it. Every day is crazy. But once a week feels that something
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:30.000]   about that is kind of a special one and it's a weird... It's like sitting down in the sun with
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.400]   your coffee in the morning or something. There's a nice... It's like a lunch style, of course.
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:39.120]   There's enough material on a Sunday, New York Times to carry you for two weeks. I mean,
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:42.800]   there's lots of reading in there. Oh, I love it. But you can read it all online, right? I mean,
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.760]   you don't have to get paper. I know, but there's a lot different because when you get to paper,
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.280]   you can spot things you wouldn't see online and you won't. It makes me sad. Two years ago,
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:54.480]   Arthur Salsberger, who's the chairman and publisher, said, "We will stop printing the New York Times
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:35:00.240]   sometime in the future." Date TBD, but his implication is sooner than later.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:06.480]   Even the guy who's in charge of business at the New York Times realizes there's not a lot.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.520]   Time left. Well, he probably really realizes it. He knows better.
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:15.360]   This is... I don't know if you trust Henry Blodgett, but this is Henry Blodgett. He says,
[00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:21.200]   "We estimate the time spent $200 million a year on its newsroom and generates about 150 million
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:26.080]   online revenue." So there are 50 million in the hole on online alone.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:32.800]   Well, that's the problem is you can't do... I mean, that's actually a lot of money from online.
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:37.840]   That is a... Yeah, that's a great thing. They're one of the glowing success stories in terms of
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:42.400]   turning online... They're digital subscriptions. They were one of the pioneers in that.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:46.880]   And it's been very successful. Yeah, there's some bad news there too, though. The subscriptions on
[00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:52.560]   the paywall are declining. On the digital paywall? Yeah. I just saw that. Let me see if I can find
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:59.040]   the numbers. But you also have to keep in mind that they're still selling newspapers and they...
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:05.600]   The margins on those ads are way higher than digital. So I think it's...
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.400]   They're good for now. I mean, a transitional... I mean, this is what we're talking about.
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:13.200]   They can incorporate other media that makes more money as well. I mean, the New York Times has
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:17.280]   done a really good job of building out video. So they're earning a higher CPM on their online
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:23.440]   advertising. So they're kind of like subsidizing both businesses, if you will. They've done a clever
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:28.240]   job, I think, of working the online angle so that they can keep the newspaper afloat a little bit
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:33.520]   longer. Yeah. I mean, this is the hardest thing for any company to do is to make the transition
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:39.680]   from one business to another without cannibalizing the prior business. And so many companies like Kodak,
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.320]   which had a great digital strategy, have not been able to do it. It's a hard...
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:48.240]   Part of that's because other companies are already kicking your trash doing it. So you're
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:52.160]   trying to transition to a thing that Google's figured out and is raking money hand over fist at.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:56.880]   And you're just trying to keep your one East Coast newspaper alive. It may be venerable. It may have
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:02.000]   been around forever. People may see that name and go, "Wow, that's the name of journalism,
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.960]   ladies and gentlemen. It doesn't matter." They're trying to uproot themselves from this old cemented
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:12.240]   thing into this thing that someone else is already stealing their lunch with. I don't envy any of
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:16.720]   them. It's easy to sit back and pontificate and make fun of them or whatever. But holy crap,
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:23.120]   if you've ever seen an uphill battle, this is it. Meanwhile, Google has changed the
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:28.000]   requirements for people who want to stream live on YouTube. If you have 100 subscribers,
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.800]   that's it. If your family subscribes to your YouTube channel, you can stream live now.
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:39.760]   And that's free. You're now of the capability to broadcast on YouTube for free.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:47.040]   That talk about disseter mediation. I don't know what their business model is. I guess putting ads on
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:52.800]   that stuff. We've been thinking about it. I'm not sure whether we... Maybe you know Chad,
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.760]   Chad Johnson, our producer, because we had this conversation before. And Lamar,
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:00.800]   who starred at Lamar host star this week in YouTube show, said, "Yeah, don't pay any attention to
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.400]   the rules." Because the rules say you can't have embedded ads, which we have, obviously.
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:11.600]   Yeah. The sort of... Lamar said, "Oh, forget it, but I don't know if Lamar really speaks for you."
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:17.440]   Yeah. I'm sure that if YouTube wanted to say, "No, look at our rules, but who's watching? Who's
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:23.760]   moderating?" I've had this situation with the AdWords guys. You can cheat on the rules.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:30.080]   Eventually, they find it. And eventually, somebody gives you a nasty note,
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:33.040]   and you have to change it. Yeah, it's not right away, but it does happen.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:36.240]   Well, we have ads, shows that don't have any ads. We could stream those.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.880]   Right. Usually those that... Yeah. You lose money anyway.
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:41.840]   See what happens. See what happens. Why are they paying for the streaming?
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:45.040]   Right. We're going to take a break, put some ads on here.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.480]   Because this show does have ads. Thank goodness. Molly Wood is here from Always On. What are you
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.720]   doing next? What torture testing? Are you going to torture this Moto X because you can have it?
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:57.120]   Yeah, I'll take it. I'll take it. I'll be happy to take that off your hands for you.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.280]   And the new season launches end of August, so the 13th, it's back, and then the 20th,
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:07.360]   and is a big back-to-school episode. And then after that, we're going to do our first ever TV
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:13.040]   torture test. They're already calling it. I've heard the red wedding. So it's very exciting.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:16.960]   This is going to be a very exciting episode, and I just have to warn you. No spoilers.
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.560]   Law surprises. But there'll be a lot of surprise.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:22.160]   If you've read the book, you know, it's going to be... You know, that's right.
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:26.480]   That's right. It's so hard. You know, I just imagine it exactly like that. That's basically...
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:34.880]   John C. DeVorak from NoAJendishow.com and channeled DeVorak. Mark Millian from Bloomberg Business Week
[00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:41.440]   in Scott Johnson of Frog Pants Industries. Love it. We are brought to you today by our friends at
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:46.880]   carbonite.com online back. I'm back up so important, and I know, I know every time I do these ads,
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.760]   that some of you are listening, sitting there, and you close your ears. See, there's people
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:53.600]   leaving because they don't want to hear. They don't want to hear the truth. Come back.
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:58.880]   Someday you'll lose data and you'll be sorry. I told you about backup. It happens to everybody.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:03.120]   In fact, it doesn't have to be a disaster, a fire, a flood, an earthquake, a tsunami, a giant
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:07.760]   sinkhole right underneath your business. It could just be human error. You push that button that
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:13.280]   erases everything. What did you do? What did you... You pushed the button! Oh, go to carbonite.com
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:19.680]   right now. You could try it out. Not only individuals, and it's $59.99 for an individual per year
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:25.280]   for everything on your computer. I got to make that clear because it's less than $5 a month.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:31.200]   But they also have plans for businesses. I'll tell you, as bad as it is if you lose your family
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:36.640]   pictures or your financial records as an individual, imagine what happens if a business loses everything.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:42.000]   How quickly would you be able to get back in business if a fire destroyed your shop and
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.960]   you lost your accounts receivable, your client list, your supplier list? It'd be pretty hard,
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:50.720]   wouldn't it? Carbonite's great. You don't have to delegate an employee to do it or anything. It's

[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:30.800]   Mac or PC starts at $59.99 a year. Carbonite.com. Give it a try. Today,
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:39.120]   Google, I kind of said, as long as we're talking about Google, Google fiber,
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:47.280]   the gigabit Google, they now say, "Well, you can't really run a server." That net neutrality thing.
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:50.480]   Now that we're in internet service provider, maybe that's not so important after all.
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:58.000]   Broadband reports has an article that says by a Carl Bodie saying, "It's being overblown.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:07.040]   No ISP currently allows you to run a server." On the other hand, many of us are, because if you're
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:10.720]   running a sling box, that's a server. This stuff is terrible, by the way.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:14.720]   Terrible. What are you eating? Crispy apples. No, this is the strawberries and bananas.
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:18.160]   Well, all you do if you don't want it. No, it's terrible. You don't want here.
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.280]   And you know what? Also, it's terrible and the bag is so small.
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:24.560]   Yeah, I get the joke. Yeah, they don't give you enough.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:26.160]   Or we're going to have a snack and a nap. You're a terrible one.
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:29.040]   Apparently, snack time, you want to get a juice box. Go ahead, Molly.
[00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:33.920]   I didn't know I should have run a little snack during the ad.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:38.080]   John does that. He jumps up as soon as I start an ad and he scrounges.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:42.640]   I don't just grow a snorer. Do you know what that is?
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:46.960]   Apparently, I don't because I didn't know it relates to grabbing a fruit pack.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:51.680]   Okay, Google now. That's going to get old real fast. It's already old.
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:55.520]   It's going to get old. It's going to get a future?
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:43:00.640]   Okay, Google now. Now I'm talking like that.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:02.800]   What's a snorer? Yeah, it's too late.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.560]   It's already got the stupid stuff.
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:08.000]   Okay, Google. We back your theory.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.280]   My theory? Well, I don't know. I mean, I feel I think on the one hand,
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:17.680]   Google has been very outspoken that nothing should, you know,
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.520]   affect how you use the internet should be wide open.
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.360]   They should not do it.
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:24.960]   And nevertheless, they're telling people who have Google fiber in
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:28.240]   Kansas City and presumably they'll do this in Austin and Provo.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:31.840]   You can't run a server. Now, Carl Bodie's writing,
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:34.160]   "While this language is very rarely enforced,
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:40.640]   Comcast does it because they don't want you to run a mail server."
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:41.680]   You know what you're writing?
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:43.280]   You're, uh, well.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.200]   And Google does, and this is the other side of it.
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:49.680]   Google like these other guys offers a business class product that does let you run a server.
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.400]   Right, that's the idea.
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.720]   So it's coming to Provo, right? We're the third city.
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:56.400]   I don't live in Provo. I've got 20 minutes north of Provo.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:00.480]   But I have friends in Provo who have plans, and their plans consist of this.
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:03.920]   When Google fiber comes and they get on board,
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.080]   they were going to run a bunch of game servers.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.360]   They're going to launch the company.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:07.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.280]   They were going to go crazy with it.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:13.440]   This news has to make them shake just a tiny little bit, right?
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.920]   I was going to move the entire Twitter operation to Austin.
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:17.360]   Because I'm...
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.160]   Oh, there's also...
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:18.800]   It's all free.
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:24.320]   You know, there's an entire sort of like startup economy that now exists in
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.480]   Kansas City just because of Google fiber.
[00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:28.960]   That presumably is affected by this.
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:29.600]   I mean, it's sort of...
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.520]   It's kind of like if Google considers them in the IS...
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.440]   It themselves to be in the ISP business,
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:38.400]   this is the kind of policy you would assume that they had in place all along.
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:43.520]   If they are in the kind of marketing about Google fiber business,
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.480]   then why are you going to put these kind of restrictions on it?
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:50.000]   Why not just sort of let it breathe, see what kind of changes it allows?
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.320]   Because clearly they can afford to do that because they're like nothing but bandwidth
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:57.680]   if they're going to let people with 100 YouTube subscribers start streaming live.
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.920]   So it feels like a weird reversal.
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.320]   It also feels like it was lazy terms of service writing.
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:07.520]   Like they just cut and pasted terms of service from some other ISP
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:10.080]   and that are having to spend all their time in their own forums saying,
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.680]   "Oh, well, we don't mean commercial.
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:13.360]   We just mean if you're running a commercial server,
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:14.400]   but we don't mean sling box.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:14.960]   We don't mean this.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:15.520]   We don't mean that."
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:16.000]   Come on.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.520]   Google, you guys are smart enough to write your own terms of service that makes them damn sense.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:19.840]   Right.
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:23.680]   And I agree with you, it's a real stimulus to the economy.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:24.640]   If you do this and isn't...
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:25.840]   I mean, what is Google's business?
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:27.200]   What is their model?
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:28.880]   Is it a joke you off?
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.160]   That's the way I do it.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.600]   Sure. Run a server.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:33.120]   We'll choke you off.
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.640]   By the way, the couple just came back.
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:36.640]   Would you tell them about the carbonite ad?
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:40.720]   Don't want you to miss anything.
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:43.840]   It's nice to have friends at high places.
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:53.440]   So apparently the Apple lost a little battle over the iPhone 4.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.560]   This is a very sketchy story.
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:56.240]   Well, it's true.
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:59.680]   I mean, isn't this an international lawsuit or something?
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:02.000]   It's the ITC, the International Trade Commission,
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.640]   banned importation of the iPhone 4, the iPhone 3G,
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:11.360]   S-E-I-PAD 2, and the original 3G iPad, saying it...
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:12.320]   Shut up, Google.
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:12.960]   Just shut up.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:13.840]   I'm not talking to you.
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:20.000]   Because Samsung sued and won a patent.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.080]   You know, this is blowback from Apple suing San winning against Samsung.
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:26.720]   Samsung's Apple counters, Samsung counters who won.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:31.200]   And as of tomorrow, there would have been no importation of these devices.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:35.120]   But fortunately, Apple knows somebody who knows somebody who knows the president.
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:37.760]   So they got Obama to veto.
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:40.480]   It was the only way this could have been done.
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:41.680]   It was veto it.
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:42.720]   How can he veto it?
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:43.520]   What...
[00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:44.720]   He doesn't sit on the commission.
[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.000]   What is the deal with this?
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.880]   Well, it's treaties and, you know, it's complicated.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:49.520]   It's politics stuff.
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:50.320]   You wouldn't understand.
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:50.880]   I guess not.
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.880]   It's complicated.
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:54.400]   No agenda showed.com.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.800]   If John doesn't understand, I never have any hope of understanding.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:01.920]   Because I read the story roughly 75 times and been completely unable to figure out how in the hell
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:04.080]   Obama could veto this.
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:06.240]   Can't figure it out either.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.280]   It's not legislation.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:07.840]   It's not...
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:09.840]   It's like a legal ruling.
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:13.600]   How can he just sort of wade in and be like, "Ooh, you know what though?
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.320]   Peeps really dig their iPhones, so we can't be having that."
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.840]   That's the power of the presidency.
[00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:18.480]   He can over...
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.320]   It was the United States trade agency.
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:25.840]   The only person powerful enough to overrule it as a president and the president can by
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.600]   decree say, "No, we're gonna let him."
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:28.400]   He's a dictator.
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.760]   Well, no agenda.com.
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:34.160]   No agenda show.com.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:34.720]   Oh, sorry.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.000]   No agenda show.com.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:36.880]   Let's get this straight.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:42.800]   Although, SQ freakin' the Tower points out it was an executive agency that made the decision.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:42.800]   Right.
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:46.000]   Was it like a US commission, not a court?
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   It's called the International Trade Commission.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.240]   But that's just words.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.840]   Oh, he means like the World Series.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:53.280]   Exactly.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.800]   It's like the internet.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:56.400]   How for the world is the world's second world.
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:00.480]   It's just so you know, its full name is the United States International Trade Commission.
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.080]   Ah, well that makes sense.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:05.680]   That's a totally be in all those news stories.
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:06.800]   I don't know why they don't.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:10.000]   You know, I mean the fact that Samsung One was interesting as well,
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.040]   given that Apple beat the pants off Samsung and US courts.
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:21.600]   Anyway, you know, you almost feel like the, I could just see a,
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:25.120]   maybe you should draw a cartoon Scott of the iPhone 4 in an electric chair.
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:29.920]   And they're about to pull the switch and the call comes, the word nances of phone and says,
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:31.280]   it's the president on the line.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:34.960]   So, you know, it's very political cartoon.
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:36.880]   Let's keep newspapers alive kind of cartoony.
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:37.120]   That's it.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.960]   Very.
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:40.480]   Where's her block when we need him, right?
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.080]   Right.
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:42.800]   Oh, you got that.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:43.200]   I'm glad.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.320]   I thought it was a pretty mealy.
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:45.600]   I got it.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:46.080]   Of course.
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:49.520]   How long ago was he to get some cartoons from him?
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.840]   Anytime you let me know.
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.040]   Oh, you got it.
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:53.920]   I'm going to record that.
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:55.520]   I'm going to need for a tape.
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:56.640]   It's on tape.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:58.480]   So what, like what would you draw for a John?
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.400]   Uh, I don't know.
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:01.200]   Whatever he wants.
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:03.360]   If John wants, uh, I don't know.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:08.400]   Obama standing on a giant pile of bodies telling the iPhone it can come in.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:09.360]   Whatever you want, man.
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:11.200]   Are you still doing extra life?
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:13.760]   Because it seems like you've become a, like a podcaster.
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:14.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.400]   It's still, I don't know, people always ask.
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.320]   It's about, it's still about half and half of what I do.
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:19.760]   So yeah, if you go to my extra life,
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:20.800]   you're on the comic still there.
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.080]   Guy would draw us all the time.
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:22.880]   You can't stop.
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.720]   Not possible.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:28.080]   Look, I put up a joke on mash, Mashable Ram, one of my strips.
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:32.080]   And it was a, it was a two part comic that said the difference between iOS users
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:32.960]   and Android users.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:35.680]   And it was a cheap joke, but the iOS user said,
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:38.320]   oh, this apps 99 cents done and hits a button.
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:39.360]   Guy over next to him says,
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:41.360]   99 cents, no way in hell and paying for this.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:45.760]   And that thing going crazy over there and created a tribal war like I've never seen.
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:46.480]   Oh, good man.
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:48.640]   On mashable just for this little joke.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.200]   I think that's actually very poignant.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.480]   It's exactly the way it is.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:53.600]   I got Android phone.
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:54.800]   I've never bought an app.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.000]   Ever.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:56.800]   Right.
[00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.760]   You're part of the cloud.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:59.680]   That was kind of my theory.
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:00.560]   By the way, that's.
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.000]   Not even Swift key?
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.360]   Well worth it.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:06.160]   Swift key is like the only app that I've bought on Android.
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:08.720]   But now that they gave me credits, they gave me some free credits.
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:09.840]   I've never used one, a nickel.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:12.320]   Because most of the apps are free.
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:13.280]   Exactly.
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:13.920]   By the way.
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:17.280]   My point is, my point is if John has some controversial content
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.360]   and he's looking for tribal warfare,
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:20.800]   I've got the tools to make it happen.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:21.280]   Apparently.
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:22.240]   Let me know.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.400]   Can I just say that free isn't always free?
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.160]   I bought and played a free game.
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:28.400]   It cost me $300.
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:31.840]   Why don't you say Candy Crush?
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:32.720]   We're all gonna have to hang out.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:33.840]   I'm not playing Candy Crush.
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:35.280]   I'm playing the Simpsons tapped out.
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:37.840]   Our was somebody in the chat room.
[00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:40.000]   He's saying that we should bring this topic up.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.440]   Well, this is a, I'm a little burned by electronic arts.
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.800]   I want you all to do an expose.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.840]   This actually is a really good example of why
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:51.200]   freemium is taking over both Android and Apple marketplace.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:52.160]   Tell us the story.
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.680]   The game is free, right?
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:55.920]   And you build Homer Simpson blew up Springfield.
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:56.640]   I like the Simpsons.
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:57.200]   I like the show.
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:57.840]   I like the characters.
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:58.240]   Okay.
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:58.880]   You blew up Springfield.
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:50:59.680]   You got to rebuild it.
[00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:01.840]   It's like, you know, Farmville or We Rules.
[00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:03.840]   One of those games is no shooting.
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:04.640]   There's no action.
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:05.520]   There's no excitement.
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:09.120]   It's just kind of slowly building up this town and buying stuff.
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:11.360]   Now, unfortunately, you can play free, but unfortunately,
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:14.720]   the really good stuff like the giant Springfield sign cost donuts.
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:15.760]   Okay.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.200]   Well, that's, they give you donuts.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.200]   Every time you level up, you get a donut.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:22.160]   Springfield sign cost 120 donuts.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.160]   So you end up buying donuts.
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:27.680]   I am shamed admit that I have purchased now three boatloads of donuts.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:28.080]   Okay.
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:30.480]   And a hundred dollars each.
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:32.640]   That's over a year.
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:33.280]   Okay.
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:34.800]   But I got all those guys.
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.200]   I have a beautiful Springfield.
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.960]   It's one of the most beautiful spring fields you have ever seen.
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:41.760]   And they just released the Crusty Land edition.
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:45.200]   And I had a Crusty Land and I started building my Crusty Land.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:49.360]   And then now all of a sudden after $300 and uncounted,
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:52.560]   untold hours building a beautiful Springfield.
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:54.800]   Every time I launch it, it crashes.
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.360]   Okay.
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:59.360]   That's well, you want your money back now.
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:00.000]   That's what I would do.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.760]   I just want my three and a half million dollars that I've got in Springfield
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:06.240]   and my 1400 donuts I still have.
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.280]   I just want the donuts.
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:10.480]   Just send me 1400 donuts and we'll call it evil.
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:12.320]   You know, I think you've watched it.
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:15.440]   I find this whole story so endearing because for one thing,
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.960]   I absolutely adore the Simpsons.
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:17.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:19.360]   For all of the things of you,
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:22.560]   for all of the things that you could have gotten ripped off on,
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:24.800]   the fact that it was a Simpsons is really kind of sweet.
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.080]   Have you ever kind of like that?
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.120]   Have you ever played Tapped Out?
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:28.720]   No, I don't.
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:30.640]   I don't play the game on the boat.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:31.520]   It's addictive.
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.160]   How many games are you addicted to?
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:34.960]   Just that one.
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:36.160]   Oh, is that what it was?
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:38.640]   Since August of 2012, it's all I do.
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.320]   Sometimes during Twitch, I'll be playing Tapped Out.
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.520]   You probably noticed.
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:42.480]   So why is it crashing?
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:44.160]   Did they push out an app update or?
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.120]   They push out an app update.
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:46.320]   Overload a dumb thing.
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:48.880]   Well, I think it's my fault, but I don't know.
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:52.560]   I launched it on one device, added, built my Crestiland.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:54.400]   And then I went to another device that I hadn't updated
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.800]   and tried to visit my Crestiland and after that, nothing.
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:57.520]   It blows up.
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:59.440]   If you go visit me, it blows up.
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:00.960]   If you go visit my town, you're--
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:01.920]   Sounds like a bull.
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:03.360]   I would say demand my money back.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:05.520]   Your town at your Simpsons is too awesome, I guess.
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.040]   Your Springfield, you may actually--
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:07.760]   Too rad.
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:09.280]   Exactly what happened.
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:09.920]   It's too good.
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:10.560]   It's unloadable.
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:11.440]   It's too beautiful.
[00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:14.720]   And it's so big and exciting, it can't load it.
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:15.040]   So--
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:15.840]   But the good news is--
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:17.920]   The world of freemium-- this world of freemium games
[00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:21.760]   and this free to play stuff is a topic for our entire show.
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:24.000]   One of these days, we need to come back on here.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.200]   And we need to talk about how that thing in gaming
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.320]   is just utterly--
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:29.200]   What's killing gaming?
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.200]   Fundamentally changing everything about it.
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:32.240]   It's crazy.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:34.560]   Because the truth is, you know--
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:35.680]   It's free.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:37.360]   Why not download it and play it?
[00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:37.680]   Yeah.
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:38.720]   But that's how it--
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:41.040]   Because then you say, well, I could buy it.
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:43.280]   At first, you buy a couple of donuts.
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:45.200]   Then you're buying-- pretty soon, you're buying a dozen.
[00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.000]   A baker's dozen.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.040]   Then you're buying a truckload.
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:48.000]   Then you're buying a carload.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.360]   Then you're buying a boatload.
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:50.080]   It's easy.
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:51.280]   Something's wrong with you.
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:53.040]   Yeah, that's probably true.
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:55.360]   I process something's wrong with a whole lot of people.
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:55.840]   And that's--
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:56.400]   It's very--
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:56.400]   And they're making--
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.360]   Yeah, obviously.
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:58.000]   Un-a-money.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:58.240]   Well--
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.680]   But often the chatroom just pointed out
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:01.840]   that freemium is the reality TV of gaming.
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:03.600]   Because at this point, the game maker is--
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:04.960]   That's just such a great quote.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:06.400]   And at this point, the game makers--
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:08.720]   They put the barest minimum of effort
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:10.960]   into the actual game.
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:13.200]   The first incarnation of it.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:16.880]   And that, I think, is what's changing it so tragically,
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:19.520]   is that you can't even really have a good game experience
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:21.440]   until you start spending money.
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.680]   So you're getting ripped off from the first day.
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:25.360]   I didn't feel that way.
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:26.400]   They have hooks in there.
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:27.280]   So it's not like--
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:28.000]   So the--
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:28.880]   Well, yeah.
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:30.960]   Tapped out's a really interesting example of this.
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.520]   Because tapped out uses the assets, voice assets,
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:35.920]   that's the talent behind the Simpsons.
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:36.880]   Yeah, you got Homer.
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:37.280]   It's an accident.
[00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:39.280]   Every once in a while, Homer will say on my phone,
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:40.800]   "PUSH notification."
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:42.000]   And I love that.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.560]   Yeah, there's great stuff that's actually Simpsons-based.
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:45.600]   So if you're a fan of that stuff,
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:46.560]   they're giving you all you want.
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:47.920]   And there are a few hooks in there--
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:48.520]   I'm speechless.
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:49.920]   That drive you to keep playing it.
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:51.040]   And then you spend your money.
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.360]   So I think Molly's right.
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:54.640]   It has cheapened the entry.
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.280]   And I don't mean cheap, like inexpensive.
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:58.640]   I mean, they've made it kind of a garage sale.
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:01.040]   But it's definitely also--
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.680]   I mean, the interesting thing to me about it
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:04.360]   is how it fundamentally understands
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:06.280]   the psychology of human prediction.
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:07.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:08.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:14.080]   There's an entire PhD paper to be written on the hooks.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:16.360]   It's a great big Skinner box, says Punter Joe.
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:18.160]   And I agree with him.
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.960]   They got me, I'm like the rabbit or whatever,
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:21.800]   pushing the rat, pushing the bar--
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:22.400]   The pigeon.
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:23.040]   The pigeon.
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:27.000]   So Electronic Arts says it's one of their most profitable
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:27.400]   games.
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:30.120]   It is now making more for them than any of their console
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:32.320]   games or $60 console games.
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:37.360]   They made $10 million in the month of June, $50 million
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:39.880]   on this game so far, profit.
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:42.040]   Well, you should be able to get your money back then.
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.000]   And plenty of money.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.120]   But the problem is that they're putting no money into it.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.040]   I mean, the thing crashes all the time.
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:49.520]   If you go on the forums, you see many people on my boat.
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:51.880]   I did get an email from Chingacambi
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:54.520]   of the EA customer experience.
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:58.920]   And I think this is almost like a joke.
[00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:00.520]   Thank you for contacting us.
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:02.920]   I'm sorry to know that your game force closes on any of the
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:05.480]   device you've tried to access after installing the new
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:06.800]   Crusty Land update.
[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:12.560]   Even that sentence alone is worth $300.
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:13.280]   Don't you think?
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:16.200]   If the same issue is happening on all the devices and removing
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:19.000]   reinstalling the application doesn't resolve the issue, it
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   could be a server or an account issue, duh.
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.800]   So now they say, please provide the following information so
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:29.200]   that I may escalate your issue to our higher level of support.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.000]   Yeah, another in the end.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.560]   Now what they want is they want the UDID of every device I've
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:35.000]   played it on.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.120]   Oh, please.
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:37.600]   Oh, come on.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:40.640]   Like that's going to tell them anything at all.
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:41.360]   That's a pain.
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:44.120]   You got to go get UID or UI, whatever it is.
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:46.640]   You got to get apps that even tell you what those numbers
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:46.920]   are.
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:48.040]   They know, you know what they know?
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:49.640]   This is part of the whole thing.
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:51.360]   Most people will just go screw it.
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:53.360]   Yeah, it's too much work.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:55.880]   So I'm going to do it just to show them.
[00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:56.480]   You should.
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:58.040]   I want my donuts, damn it.
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:59.800]   I know that's just for more weird stuff.
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.680]   Oh, yeah, they will.
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:02.000]   This will be an ongoing saga.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:02.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:04.280]   So this is your social security number.
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:04.640]   Yeah.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:05.720]   Driver's license number.
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:07.320]   Yeah, I didn't want to really talk about it.
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:10.240]   You're an American citizen.
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.600]   How was nerd-tacular?
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:12.960]   A great success, I hear.
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:14.040]   It was fantastic.
[00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:16.600]   We had-- people from where you come from.
[00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:17.400]   We had Tom Merritt.
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:19.200]   We had a bunch of people come and visit.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:19.960]   It was awesome.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:21.720]   Both NSFW folks were there.
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:23.320]   We had Brian and Justin there.
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:25.000]   And it was awesome to have them there and kind of have
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.240]   that twit injection of love and support.
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:29.520]   But it went really well.
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:30.600]   And we sold out of tickets.
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:31.480]   Well and bands.
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:33.920]   We filled up a resort and this beautiful mountain
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:36.320]   resort called Snowbird and just filled it up with fans
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:38.760]   and had to stand up and talk in front of all these people.
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:40.960]   And they made me feel at home and it was awesome.
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:42.400]   It's a great fan event.
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:46.520]   People haven't been any fans of remotely of anything I do.
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:48.280]   It is a worthy thing.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:50.120]   And it's one of those conferences that's--
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:50.520]   I don't know.
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:52.080]   I feel like it separates itself a little bit
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:55.360]   because it's more family than fandom.
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:57.720]   It's really just a bunch of great people hanging out.
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:57:59.240]   And it was awesome at a really good time.
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:00.960]   This is a whole thing now.
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:04.440]   Like XOXO, these nerd conferences.
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:06.600]   I mean, I've said it on Twitter the other day,
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:10.440]   I believe there is a nerd themed conference of some sort
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:12.800]   every 8.2 hours every day.
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:13.640]   Yes.
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:16.640]   I think Twitter alone has convinced me of that.
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:19.120]   In fact, I'm always like, where the hell are you people now?
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:22.040]   Who is this-- what is the con of the day?
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:22.640]   It's true.
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:24.040]   I follow all you guys on path.
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:26.320]   And I see them flying hither and thither.
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:28.240]   VidCon was just in LA.
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:31.120]   That's a bit another VidCon before that.
[00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:31.440]   Yeah.
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:34.960]   There's a Gamescom coming up, a new Pax coming up,
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:36.720]   DragonCon, MollyCon, Molly.
[00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:37.760]   That's what we need to call yours.
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:38.240]   Molly--
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:39.240]   Molly--
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:40.840]   Oh, I thought somebody already had it.
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.000]   I thought somebody already had it.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:42.640]   Get it now.
[00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:44.400]   We're where that porn star does.
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:47.440]   She's going to get a lot-- she should pack them in.
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:48.720]   I'm all over there.
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.880]   Yeah, I guess so if you think about it.
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:51.520]   Oh, god.
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:52.200]   I'm so sorry.
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:53.640]   Plus the kids, man, the kids.
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:57.000]   So I'm noticing this big influx of vines.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:57.960]   I sound like an old man here.
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:58:58.960]   But they--
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:00.120]   They keep fighting.
[00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:01.120]   What's just fine?
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:03.720]   All these fine meetups with like quote unquote
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:05.400]   vine celebrities and people who are on--
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.400]   Vine, wait a minute.
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.640]   There are vine celebrities now?
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:11.360]   Yeah, there are people with millions of followers just on vine.
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:12.520]   You go check their Twitter accounts.
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:14.200]   They have like 1,100 people following them.
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:16.000]   But on Vine, they got 1 million people.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.280]   They show up in New York.
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:19.960]   They'll show up at like, I don't know, some central location
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:21.400]   somewhere in some major city.
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:24.720]   And hundreds, maybe thousands come and crowd these people
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:26.520]   and they make videos all afternoon.
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:29.880]   It's insane to me what they're doing.
[00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:31.520]   And I kind of understand it because that's
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:33.160]   what all these other things are to some degree.
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:35.440]   But this one's new and weird and scary.
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:38.400]   Have you guys seen the ball pit meme on Vine?
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:45.040]   There's kids like across America shooting videos on Vine,
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:50.000]   going into Walmart and jumping into the ball pits
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:53.240]   that they carry the bike of vine out of it?
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:55.840]   Yeah, well, people will see one and then repeat it forever.
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:58.240]   And now you can re-vine some people re-vine these videos.
[00:59:58.240 --> 00:59:59.600]   It's anybody who doesn't know.
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:00.440]   This is one.
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:01.280]   This is a woman.
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:02.480]   There you go.
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.600]   That's the video.
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.880]   Basically an intentional fail video is what it is.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:08.960]   So you do a search for ball pit?
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:11.680]   Ball pit vine on Twitter.
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:15.560]   And there's tons of them.
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:18.400]   So Vine, for those who don't know, is a six-- it's an app--
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:20.640]   iPhone and Android app that is--
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:23.120]   Lazarus Court-- nearly six seconds of video.
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.280]   But you can edit it in camera because you can--
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:27.440]   it only records video when you press the screen.
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.760]   So you can do as many as--
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:30.280]   I don't know.
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:33.400]   What's the largest number, like 20 or 30 individual frames?
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:38.200]   I've seen quite a few frames in six seconds.
[01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.920]   Well, there's amazing stop motion art and amazing--
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.920]   people are doing some really creative, interesting things.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:43.920]   And I think Vine is a platform.
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.480]   It's pretty neat when you start hearing about--
[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:47.200]   He's kind of amazing, isn't it?
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.480]   Thousands of girls chasing some dude down the street
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:50.440]   because he's Vine famous.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:52.240]   It's just a weird thing to think about.
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.320]   Who is Vine famous?
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.520]   Do we have his chief vine famous--
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.480]   Is Casey Mariah?
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:58.760]   I'd like to find celebrities.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:01.560]   So there are names like Curtis LePore.
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:03.320]   It's very close to LePore, I thought.
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.320]   I was wondering about that.
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.240]   That's actually my Vine handle.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:08.560]   My Vine soldier ego.
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:11.040]   Oh, I found a list of five of them.
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:12.200]   Are these the ones you know?
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.840]   Matt Swinsky.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:14.400]   Yep.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.360]   Megan Signoli.
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.520]   Yep.
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:18.720]   How long was this?
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:19.520]   Adam Goldberg.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:20.560]   Adam Goldberg.
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:21.920]   Kmart--
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:25.960]   Where bands people for making Vine ball pit videos are Walmart.
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:26.920]   They don't think of something else.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:27.960]   They don't--
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:29.600]   They'll be something different.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.080]   Here's another one.
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:32.960]   So I don't know if this-- this is interesting,
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.520]   I think, from a tech perspective.
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:37.440]   But there are two Viners in particular.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:39.440]   One is named this Chris LePore guy, who--
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.440]   I don't know what he does.
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:42.320]   Something with a band, travels a lot, covered in tattoos.
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:42.760]   Cool guy.
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:43.560]   It does funny videos.
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.040]   The dog's adorable.
[01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:48.320]   He has tons of followers, over a million followers.
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.120]   There's this other girl, I forget her name.
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.320]   They meet through Vine.
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.840]   I mean, just-- I don't know how you do that.
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:53.960]   But you saw each other's videos.
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:54.720]   You liked each other.
[01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:59.280]   So today, they got together in New York, Central Park.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.600]   Everybody else was told about it.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:04.080]   They made out, essentially, for everybody.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:05.680]   And essentially said, now we are--
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.400]   We are now dating.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.480]   Yeah, this is the first time we've met.
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:09.200]   They've been communicating on and off, you know,
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.480]   over across the coast.
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:11.160]   He lives in LA.
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.200]   She lived in New York.
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.240]   They get together today.
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:15.520]   And it was like a wedding with thousands of people clapping
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:16.280]   for them.
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.760]   And people revining it up and down,
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:21.280]   like Vine was smelly with this thing.
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:24.040]   Like all day, all you could get with these re-vines.
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:27.120]   And I just-- at first, you kind of just go,
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.520]   ah, Vine, it's an epic deal, no big deal.
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.840]   I'm starting to wonder, though.
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.520]   Like, that's a lot of people with a lot of interest
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.400]   and a big demographic of--
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.760]   There's got to be some way to sell to these people.
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:37.280]   Yeah.
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.880]   It's super-- it's really interesting, too,
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.880]   because it's people who maybe previously would have been
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:42.880]   on YouTube.
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:45.720]   But it's so hard to stand out on YouTube now
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.120]   and so hard to get any attention.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.240]   Regardless of whether you're doing something creative or not,
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.720]   I mean, I felt like Vimeo was the outlet for people
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:55.480]   who were really doing kind of clever artistic stuff.
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.480]   But now there's this whole new platform
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.160]   that kind of no one was on.
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:00.760]   And nobody knew exactly how to use it.
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:03.920]   So you can create these really attention-grabbing things.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:07.480]   And it's basically just like a new avenue to celebrity
[01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:10.520]   because, honestly, let's admit, YouTube is kind of closed,
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.960]   unless you're actually already famous.
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:15.560]   This has got to be the most transient form of celebrity
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:16.360]   ever, though, right?
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.720]   I mean, sorry.
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:19.200]   It's not even 15 minutes of fame.
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.200]   It's about six seconds.
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:21.960]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:22.920]   No, I mean, I think it's great.
[01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.560]   There's a lot of creativity on Vine.
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:28.440]   And I know both my kids love Vine and do a lot of vining
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.120]   of videos.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.080]   It's easy to do.
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:32.760]   That's probably-- it's like Twitter.
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:34.440]   It doesn't take a lot.
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.160]   Although if you put a lot of energy into it,
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:37.080]   it's amazing.
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.160]   Some of the animations.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.160]   Yeah, it's sort of like blogging when Twitter came along.
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.560]   You know, Twitter, the barrier entry was so much lower.
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:47.440]   It kind of opened this entire new platform for YouTube
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:48.440]   to have money.
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:50.760]   I don't know that they should worry.
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.360]   I mean, some of these people, they're
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:56.640]   parlaying Vine popularity into YouTube popularity.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.480]   So a lot of these guys have started YouTube accounts now.
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:00.720]   And they have respectable followings there,
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:01.680]   and they're growing.
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:02.880]   I don't think it's so much that.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.200]   But what Molly said, I think, is
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.800]   prescient to the whole point, which is there's
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:09.840]   this limited window to grab on to whatever it is.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:12.840]   So I have this eight-year-old World of Warcraft podcast
[01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.440]   that stays number one in that category
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:15.920]   and has since the day we launched it.
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.400]   Well, that was timing, and nobody else was really doing it.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.000]   And now there are dozens and dozens,
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.200]   but we still kind of stay there.
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:24.240]   And I think it's because you got in early,
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.800]   and you got a name for yourself, and now you're kind of sort
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:27.440]   of there.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:28.680]   I think Vine's already hit that.
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:31.400]   There's probably a stable of 12 or so people
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.640]   that are hugely popular on there.
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.280]   And now it is all trash from there.
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.640]   And I think YouTube's kind of in that same boat.
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.680]   It's just, I think, we're getting smaller and smaller
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:41.840]   windows of opportunity.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:43.800]   People have to jump on these platforms quick,
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.840]   hope that they take off, and if they do,
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.840]   that they're one of the ones holding the flag
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:49.040]   at the end of the road.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:51.360]   I think Google should buy these guys out.
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.680]   No, because it's dead already.
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:53.760]   Well, Twitter owns them.
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:54.640]   Yeah, Twitter owns them.
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:54.960]   That's right.
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:55.960]   It's a Twitter-
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:56.320]   Oh, that's right.
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:57.320]   Twitter bought them right away.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:58.160]   No, Twitter was far apart.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.320]   The app even came out.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:04:59.680]   Yeah.
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:00.240]   They bought--
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.600]   They knew what they were working on.
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:03.000]   They bought them.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.080]   You think an Instagram adds 15-second video,
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.760]   but it's Instagram and it's 15-second.
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:08.080]   It's too long.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.520]   Yeah, well, that's the same thing.
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:12.240]   That's why I think Google+ is not as powerful as Twitter.
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:15.000]   I know, you could make a six-second video on Instagram,
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.880]   but for some reason, the fact that there's 15 seconds
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.600]   available killed it.
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:20.600]   All right.
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:21.840]   I don't understand it at all.
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:24.840]   So Scott, you jumped on Vine very early.
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:27.080]   In fact, you have a good-- you have a pretty good Vine channel.
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:28.840]   You do a lot of creative stuff on Vine.
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:29.800]   Yeah, I have some fun on there.
[01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:30.520]   It's a lot of it.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:33.400]   Again, what I end up using it for is kind of when I end up
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.400]   using all these services for, I end up using them
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:37.880]   to do things for the existing base.
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:40.040]   So this is a chance for me to say, all right, well, here's
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:43.080]   a new way I'm putting myself out there for all you people
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.360]   who already are there and support me in whatever.
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:48.720]   This is probably more meaningful content for them.
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:53.640]   But to go viral on Vine requires a lot of crazy acrobatics,
[01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:56.000]   being willing to do things in crowds with strangers
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.240]   you're not willing to do otherwise.
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:01.080]   It's a very-- I think it's a pretty steep wall
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.720]   to get over to get that kind of fame in there.
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:05.840]   So I think it's actually a pretty good tool,
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:08.680]   like most other things like Twitter or Facebook or whatever,
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:11.560]   to connect with your audience, to extend that relationship
[01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:12.560]   just a little bit more.
[01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.440]   And that's how I use it.
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.080]   And I think it's a pretty good tool that way.
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:16.080]   Right.
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:17.280]   A lot of people-- I mean, we've got to say,
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:19.880]   a lot of people like my kids just use Vine,
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:22.680]   because they like Vine and share it with their friends.
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:24.200]   And they're not trying to become celebrities.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:26.760]   You're just posting stuff on Vine.
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:30.320]   YouTube seems a little less interested in that market now, too.
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.880]   Oh, they want big business, right?
[01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:34.160]   They want high production value.
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:38.800]   I mean, they can sell some high value ads next to those videos.
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:39.640]   They can't-- well, yeah.
[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:42.560]   They're not really interested in the next ball pit meme.
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:45.280]   YouTube and Netflix and Amazon and Hulu,
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.120]   we got a stop saying ball pit on the show.
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:50.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:55.120]   Those four, I think, are all vying to become the next NBC,
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:59.160]   CBS, Fox, and ABC.
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.480]   There's one more.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:03.400]   So they're absolutely moving out of casual sharing,
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:04.720]   because it doesn't make money for them.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:08.160]   It doesn't allow them to become the next sort of post broadcast
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:09.040]   network.
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.200]   You could almost argue that they're
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:13.360]   in wildly different businesses.
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.360]   You're showing how to make a bomb.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:16.800]   Well, don't say that out loud.
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.160]   You get to get the--
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.000]   so this is the August best of Vine.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.080]   This is on YouTube.
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:22.840]   In fact, the best way to consume Vine is to--
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:23.680]   Hey, Staggy.
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:24.160]   Look at--
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:27.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:29.320]   A good Vine makes you laugh.
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.120]   So that guy, that's Marcus Johns there.
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.280]   He's very popular.
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:34.760]   Yeah, he's got like $200 million.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:38.040]   By the way, it helps if you're 18 to 24 and totally hot.
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.200]   I'm just putting that out there.
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.240]   That's one thing that will get you famous on Vine.
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:42.880]   That helps in life, really.
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.800]   There are a few good memes, which I like.
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:48.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.800]   What's going on here?
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:55.800]   You're fresh and lazy.
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.400]   Oh, hell no!
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:59.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:00.520]   It's all six seconds.
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:01.800]   That's what's amazing.
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:04.280]   It's good entertainment.
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:06.080]   Yeah, the six second part of it--
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:07.520]   not to belabor it too much.
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.280]   But that part seems to be the magic.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:11.480]   And it's like that one little thing nobody thought
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:14.200]   would be the good part and turned out to be pivotal.
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.720]   Like, that is the most important.
[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:17.680]   It's like saying, I was watching the baseball documentary
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.160]   from Ken Burns, as I've seen three times,
[01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:20.280]   and I freaking love it.
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:22.560]   And they were talking about how, when the decision was made--
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:24.440]   Which is, by the way, about 600 hours.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:25.040]   Oh, it's huge.
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:28.480]   It's two hour innings and like nine innings.
[01:08:28.480 --> 01:08:30.280]   But anyway, it goes-- they were talking
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:32.480]   about the distance between home plate and first base.
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:34.080]   And I forgot the finite number that is.
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:36.880]   But when it was decided to be that, made everything--
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.760]   What is it, like 96 inches?
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:39.600]   It's exactly right.
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:40.920]   It made all the difference in the game,
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:43.920]   because without it, there'd been none of these double outs.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.800]   There'd be none of these like stealing bases.
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:47.720]   None of these exciting moments in baseball
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:48.880]   that have made this part what it is.
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:52.160]   And you just think, man, that one guy with that one decision
[01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:53.200]   made all the difference.
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:55.440]   And I feel like that six second thing is pretty much--
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:08:57.640]   You use the term double out?
[01:08:57.640 --> 01:08:58.800]   Yeah, that's wrong, isn't it?
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:08:59.320]   Yeah.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:00.520]   Double play.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:01.880]   Double play is what I meant.
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:04.440]   But it is amazing that 90 feet was exactly right
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:07.520]   that you still, after 100 years, people
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:11.920]   will make it by half a footstep or not.
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:13.480]   Really, that is kind of amazing.
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:17.960]   I often wonder, maybe, there's the fixes in.
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:18.560]   But I could be wrong.
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:19.600]   The fixes in.
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:22.400]   Doesn't seem possible.
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:24.000]   Wouldn't athletes get better?
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.920]   In every other sport, they get better.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.440]   They're not in baseball.
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:28.920]   Well, they do.
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.920]   They're all roided up.
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:31.280]   I know.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:32.280]   I'm just saying.
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:35.960]   It's not like you have hitters who can run it out
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.400]   every single time.
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:38.400]   It's never--
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:38.920]   Stop.
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:40.080]   You ever go to a game?
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.040]   Never.
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.640]   I've been to a Microsoft store, though.
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:46.040]   No, probably not the best panel for sports analysis.
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:46.560]   Right now.
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:47.880]   Hey, I'm a big sports fan.
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:50.480]   Oh, I will be my own sports analysis panel.
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:51.360]   You guys just let me know.
[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:52.840]   Hey, hey, hey.
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.280]   But you just tell me what you need to do.
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:55.840]   35 days to opening day.
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:57.440]   35 days to opening day.
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:59.520]   I'm just saying, OK.
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:00.840]   Do you call it opening day in football?
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:01.280]   What do you call it?
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.120]   Opening day.
[01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.120]   What do you call that?
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:05.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:07.040]   What do you call it?
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:07.920]   Opening day.
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:08.880]   Kick off.
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:09.640]   Kick off day.
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:10.120]   Kick off day.
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:11.360]   You ever been to a football game?
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:11.860]   Yeah.
[01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:12.800]   Yeah, you go all the time.
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:13.600]   I'm going Thursday.
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:15.760]   You know how you actually understand what's going on in there?
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:16.320]   No.
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:18.160]   But I do have-- and I'm very excited.
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:20.960]   Mexican wrestler mask that's the 49ers.
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:22.560]   I'm going to wear that to the next game.
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:23.560]   I don't think I'll get in trouble.
[01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:25.040]   Actually, I was thinking we're into a Raiders game.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:25.960]   That'd be fun.
[01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:26.880]   Oh.
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:27.680]   You'd fit right in.
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:28.240]   Fit right in.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.200]   Hold on a second.
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:30.080]   We've got to do an ad, and then we'll
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:31.480]   come back with more with this great panel.
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:33.160]   And John's going to tell us about his e-book.
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:36.160]   I'm going to actually-- one of my next e-books is going to be--
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:39.880]   and by the way, you can go to insidetrackbook.com.
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:41.400]   I'll just get a plug in there.
[01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.160]   But I'm going to do a book on how to do an e-book,
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.880]   because there's actually--
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:45.960]   I think all these programs--
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:48.200]   Kawasaki did one called "ape."
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.520]   Author, publisher, e-book or something.
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:51.720]   It's about making e-books.
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:52.920]   You should read that before you write it on.
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.320]   I'm going to read that book and steal the best parts.
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:55.920]   So what is this?
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:58.680]   Inside track 2013, this is like your columns?
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:10:59.180]   Yeah.
[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:00.960]   So you didn't actually have to work to do anything.
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.960]   You have to-- you see actually the work is just--
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:03.560]   Yeah, a bunch of work documents.
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.440]   --page in the other page.
[01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:07.160]   Most of the work is online stuff.
[01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:08.000]   How much is it?
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.360]   It's $9.49.
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:09.800]   Wow.
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:10.840]   Shouldn't it be like a buck?
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:12.160]   It should be, yeah.
[01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.600]   What is the right price for any one?
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:15.960]   This hasn't been fully understood.
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:17.160]   Oh, and you're not doing it on Amazon.
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:18.400]   You're selling it directly.
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:19.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:21.280]   No, Amazon comes up either tomorrow or the next day.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:22.200]   I just haven't--
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:22.200]   Interesting.
[01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.800]   I did this first, because the process now--
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.080]   Because it is Kindle.
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:28.120]   Yeah, well, or also EPUB.
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:31.440]   And the model is currently, according to all the people
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:33.560]   that have been studying it, is that you want to make sure you
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:35.520]   can sell it yourself at the same Amazon price,
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:38.640]   but you can include the EPUB, which Amazon would never do.
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.720]   Right, because that's the open one bad.
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:43.760]   You can put it on your nook or your kobo or your ozo.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.520]   You can put it on an iPad.
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:49.120]   You email it to yourself, open the iPad, the attachment then.
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:49.880]   Save it.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:52.880]   It'll save it as an iBook.
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:54.880]   Right.
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:57.200]   Did you-- well, OK, we're going to take a break.
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:01.120]   We'll talk about pressure cookers in a minute.
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:03.600]   Which was predicted earlier in the day for all you out there
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:04.280]   keeping score.
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:04.920]   We did.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.160]   We knew we would.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.680]   And backpacks.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.560]   But first, by the way--
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:11.120]   The NSA is not listening.
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.160]   God, I should not have said that.
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:15.080]   Can we open the back door so they don't break it down,
[01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.280]   and we'll just let them in?
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:17.240]   OK.
[01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:20.200]   Our show today brought to you by audible.com audio books
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:24.840]   from the best publisher in the world of audio books.
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:27.400]   I agree that physical media might be going away.
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:29.960]   But sometimes it's an e-book, but to me, it's an audiobook.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.520]   I love listening.
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:33.760]   And if you're the kind of person who loves listening,
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.840]   I highly recommend audible.com.
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:39.400]   Visit audible.com and take a look at all the choices--
[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:43.560]   fiction, nonfiction, sexy fiction.
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:44.560]   They've got kids books.
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.640]   They've got grown-up books.
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:46.840]   They've got books of all kind.
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.080]   The butler.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:48.840]   You saw the movie?
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.200]   Or are you going to see the movie?
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.200]   I can't wait to see the movie.
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.040]   But I like to-- with Forrest Whitaker--
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:56.120]   I like to read the book or listen to the book
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.600]   before I see the movie.
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:58.720]   You know, a good example.
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:00.640]   Schindler's List.
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:03.240]   If you ever listened to the book and then saw the movie,
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:04.960]   the book is so much better.
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:05.800]   It's often the case.
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:06.920]   And the movie was great.
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:08.200]   Yeah, the movie was great.
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:09.720]   It's often the case that--
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:12.200]   and Thomas Canily's classic Schindler's List
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:13.600]   is you can get that right now.
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:16.200]   Ben Kingsley narrates it, which you make it great.
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:17.640]   This is a bridge, unfortunately.
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:20.160]   I wonder if they have an unabridged version of it.
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.320]   A lot of the books now are unabridged.
[01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:25.280]   I think they realize that people want to hear every word.
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:26.880]   When books were being put out in cassette,
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:28.080]   that's how this whole thing started.
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:30.040]   They didn't want to give you 50 cassettes.
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:31.560]   So they cut them down.
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:34.920]   But really now, thanks to downloads, automatic digital
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:37.080]   downloads, you don't have to worry about the length of the book.
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.720]   So most of the audible books are unabridged.
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:43.240]   Of course, sometimes the publisher doesn't offer it.
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:44.440]   But here's what I want you to do.
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:45.040]   Browse around.
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:46.880]   Pick a couple of books, not just one.
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:50.280]   Schindler's List to be a great one.
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:51.560]   I don't know.
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:53.240]   Garden of the Beast is a really good one.
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:54.160]   Oh, I haven't read that.
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:54.920]   Now you mentioned that before.
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:55.600]   What's that about?
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:58.800]   It's about the ambassador to Germany
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:01.800]   from the United States during the '30s.
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:05.080]   And his exploits, his nonfiction.
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:08.440]   Oh, Eric Larson, he wrote In the White City, which I love.
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:08.880]   Right.
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:09.880]   This is a great book.
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:12.240]   And then what's really cool about it is his daughter
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.440]   was a real pro Nazi nut.
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:16.280]   And she ended up-- I guess she was a beauty,
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:18.040]   because she was screwing everybody,
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:20.080]   including the head of the Gestapo.
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:22.000]   It's a very intriguing story.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:26.120]   This guy, Eric Larson, specializes in history,
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:27.640]   but finding unusual periods of history
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:29.400]   with some kind of unknown stories.
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:30.400]   It's a really interesting story.
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:31.600]   Love his stuff.
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.520]   Well, there's a couple, because his other book,
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.040]   Devil in the White City, is about the Chicago World's Fair
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:39.600]   and a serial murderer.
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:41.960]   He's also written some others, which I haven't seen.
[01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:43.400]   I have to check it out.
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:43.720]   Look it.
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:44.640]   Go to audible.com.
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:45.560]   Pick two books then.
[01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:49.640]   Go to audible.com/twit2 and get them free,
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:51.360]   because you'll be signing up for the platinum account.
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:54.120]   That's two books a month, but your first month's free.
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:56.080]   Get those two books.
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.120]   Listen to them.
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:14:58.280]   Cancel in the first 30 days.
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:14:59.640]   You'll pay nothing, but I have a feeling
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:01.440]   you're going to stick around audible.
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:03.680]   I've been a member since 2000.
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:04.240]   So I have 500--
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:05.400]   You own the place.
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.280]   I wish I did.
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:07.720]   I wish I did.
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:09.480]   Fortunately, they have 100,000 books.
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:10.840]   I'm not running out.
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.200]   But you know what I just got.
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:15.120]   You're a philosophy fan.
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:16.640]   Becker's denial of death.
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:18.320]   I think that's going to be nice for listening to on the way.
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:21.320]   I was actually a--
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:22.680]   I took Becker's courses.
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:26.320]   He was at the University of California as a lecturer.
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.680]   And he was extremely popular.
[01:15:28.680 --> 01:15:29.840]   I can't wait to read this.
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:30.920]   I'm very excited.
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:33.760]   Also got the new book that blows the lid off Scientology.
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:34.760]   I can't remember the name of that,
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:36.000]   but I'm looking forward to that.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:36.720]   The lid blowing.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:38.560]   The lid blowing.
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:39.560]   Inside Scientology.
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:40.560]   Thank you.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:41.120]   Great stuff.
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.560]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:45.760]   Get your two books today.
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:49.240]   I should run out and get my Mexican wrestlers mask.
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:50.680]   Lucha libre.
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:52.440]   Yeah, I'm like mucho libre.
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:52.800]   Only--
[01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:53.800]   Lucha.
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:54.800]   Lucha.
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:55.640]   Notcho.
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:56.600]   Notcho.
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:57.520]   Lucha.
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:15:58.360]   Lucha libre.
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:15:59.880]   Mucho libre.
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:02.400]   Yeah, mucho.
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:04.960]   I'm not-- I don't kick off.
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:06.960]   It's 35 days off.
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:07.480]   Kick off.
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:07.960]   Kick off.
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:10.480]   Kick off.
[01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:12.200]   Also, Leo, if you want to sound legit,
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:15.160]   just start talking about how excited you are that preseason
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:16.240]   starts this week.
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:18.400]   Yes, I know I'm going to a preseason game on Thursday.
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:19.840]   Oh, how exciting.
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:20.840]   You know that already.
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:21.640]   I'm excited.
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:22.000]   You are.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.360]   Actually, preseason is boring, but I did.
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:27.920]   I have to say last year, we saw Colin Kaepernick break away
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:29.760]   from the crowd and run it in for a touchdown of preseason.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:30.880]   And I said, watch that kid.
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:32.160]   He's good.
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:32.640]   That's all I know.
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:33.160]   Good call.
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:33.680]   Called it.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:34.240]   Turned out.
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:36.360]   And he was doing that scrambling early on as good.
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:37.920]   Is it fun to watch?
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:39.320]   He will be our quarterback this year.
[01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:40.760]   Are you a-- you're a Niners fan, right, Molly?
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:42.280]   You got to be.
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:44.560]   I'm a Packers fan.
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:45.360]   Well, guess what?
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:48.000]   The Niners opening day against the Green Bay Packers.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:48.440]   You got to go.
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:49.360]   Oh, I know.
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:50.720]   I would love to go to that one.
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:52.120]   That would be a great game.
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:55.080]   I play in a fantasy football league
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:57.360]   that would get almost anybody interested in football.
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.320]   It's called the Bad Quarterback League.
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:00.240]   And it is--
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:01.200]   What do you do?
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:02.240]   The best.
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:05.240]   You pick a team based on its terrible quarterback
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:07.360]   or ideally roster of quarterbacks.
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:09.040]   And then the points that you score,
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:12.240]   it's a total shot in Freud, a fantasy football league.
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:13.840]   All the points that you score are related
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:16.720]   to failures on the part of the quarterback.
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:18.920]   Like if it gets arrested, you get a ton of points.
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:19.680]   You do, actually.
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:21.520]   You get all these bonus points if they get arrested.
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:26.440]   You get, like, 1,000 points if the coach has a press conference
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:28.440]   to declare confidence in the quarterback.
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:31.120]   If they kill somebody, like it's pretty--
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:32.440]   I want to be in this league.
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:33.120]   That's great.
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.040]   It is the most fun thing ever.
[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:36.840]   Well, who's your quarterback?
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:39.200]   I haven't-- we haven't drafted yet.
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:40.200]   Who do you look at it?
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:41.320]   Last year, let's see.
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.720]   Last year, I think I had Arizona last year.
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:46.000]   And it was just amazing.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.400]   I was like, wire to wire in first place.
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:51.480]   Because they had just this unbelievable stable of like 10
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:53.360]   awful quarter-mathes.
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:54.000]   What team was this?
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.440]   And then the Raiders are always high on the list.
[01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:59.040]   I think the Jets-- I think the Jets would be a good team.
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:00.040]   The Jets are a good team.
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:00.640]   The Jets are a good team.
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:00.640]   I'm ready.
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:02.400]   You can see this is a great--
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:02.920]   I don't know.
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:03.920]   They always stink.
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:07.760]   So I've read this medium piece, medium.com,
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:09.800]   by Michelle Catalano.
[01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:12.280]   And I was incensed.
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:18.720]   She tells the story of how she got the terrorism task force,
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:20.360]   came to her house, knocked on the door.
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:21.360]   We've researched this.
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:22.400]   This is stories bogus.
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.160]   There's more to it.
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:26.120]   And I'm going to tell you the more to it.
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:28.680]   She said, I'd researched pressure cookers online.
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:31.360]   My husband was looking for a backpack.
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:33.800]   My son was very interested in the Boston bombing.
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:35.200]   So spent a lot-- my 20-year-old son
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:37.160]   spent a lot of time looking at stories.
[01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:39.840]   She presumed that somehow the feds
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:42.080]   have been watching her internet searches.
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:44.520]   And came to her house.
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:45.200]   They were polite.
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:45.640]   They were nice.
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:46.760]   They walked around.
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:48.680]   They said, can we see your son's bedroom?
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:49.880]   She said, well, he's a sleeper.
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:50.680]   And now they said, that's all right.
[01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:51.280]   We don't need to.
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:53.080]   They petted the dog.
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:54.960]   Oh, a lot of warrant, but that's beside me.
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:55.720]   All without a warrant.
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:57.400]   But you know what?
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:00.840]   You know, the federal terrorism task force shows up at the door
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:01.960]   and says, can we look around--
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:02.640]   We have to get a stop bar.
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:03.360]   Are you going to say--
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:03.840]   Kick in the door.
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:04.600]   --where's your warrant?
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:05.320]   Are you going to do that?
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:05.840]   Yeah.
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:06.320]   You would.
[01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:06.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:08.360]   That's when they come back with a warrant.
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:08.840]   Well, fine.
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:09.280]   And the dogs.
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.040]   I'll go through the place and do what they want.
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:11.680]   Shoot my dog.
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:15.000]   They didn't shoot the guy's dog, which I thought was a mistake.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.320]   They do, apparently.
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:17.680]   They love to shoot dogs.
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:18.960]   Well, dogs are dangerous.
[01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:19.280]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:20.400]   Those mean old dogs.
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:21.240]   So you got to shoot them.
[01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:22.120]   A lot of dogs get killed.
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:23.680]   But see, you don't have to investigate that.
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:24.960]   That's just collateral damage.
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:25.880]   It's a dog.
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:28.560]   In any event, there is a clarification on this.
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:31.200]   Turns out it wasn't that they were looking at her internet
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.960]   searches.
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:33.920]   All of this happened.
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:40.960]   But in fact, an employer, her husband's previous job,
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:44.320]   noted that he was doing these searches and turned them in.
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:44.720]   Nark done.
[01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:44.920]   Yeah.
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:47.160]   No, this was a see something, say something moment,
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:49.920]   where they're spying on you at the office with whatever kind
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:52.000]   of software they have installed on the office computer.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:55.640]   And then some busybody jerk off calls the feds on you.
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:58.760]   And the next thing you know, you're surrounded by cops.
[01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:00.360]   This is a horrible situation.
[01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:03.120]   This is actually worse than the other storyline, which
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:04.160]   is all the feds.
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:05.920]   They're listening in on everything you do.
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:08.840]   I think is less fascistic than having your next door neighbor,
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:12.960]   essentially, or your co-worker turn you in because they didn't
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:14.880]   like the way you're searching for stuff.
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:17.560]   It's a very disgusting story.
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:19.720]   I thought some of this was about them putting stuff up
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:20.960]   on their Google+ account.
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:22.240]   Is that not the case?
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:24.440]   I thought there was something about them putting things up
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:27.040]   that were publicly viewable, not private searches,
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:27.560]   or what's house-
[01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:28.240]   Oh, interesting.
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:29.240]   I didn't see that.
[01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:30.640]   But something like that.
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:32.480]   Some of his posts were on Google+
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:33.480]   and that there was this big couple of--
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:36.240]   Is anybody know a good pressure cooker to buy?
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:37.400]   Yeah, I do.
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:40.840]   The Durex-- fantastic products, the one Jack Papan uses.
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:41.840]   I use this.
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:42.840]   The French one.
[01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:43.280]   What's it?
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:44.640]   They make condoms, don't they?
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:45.200]   No, no.
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:46.760]   This is another company.
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:49.440]   This is a Swiss pressure cooker.
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:51.040]   Is D-U-R-E-X, and it's also--
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:52.040]   It's got a long--
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:52.600]   It's a lot of items.
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:53.080]   You're right.
[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:54.320]   No, I do remember this.
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:54.840]   Here it is.
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:56.840]   Trojan makes a good cockpot too.
[01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:59.480]   Yeah, Trojan's Rockpot is amazing.
[01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:00.160]   Yeah.
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:00.960]   I have this one.
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:02.560]   I don't know if I don't know who makes this one,
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:03.680]   but that's the one I have.
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:05.080]   The Magnum Crockpot.
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:06.080]   Isn't that looks serious?
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.240]   It's got the knob on the top.
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:07.800]   Choking giant chicken.
[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:09.000]   Choking little too serious.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.600]   Yeah, well, it can't blow up, but that's what you want.
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:15.160]   Now, see, just this conversation.
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:19.840]   And now if we started talking about backpacks or fertilizer,
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.200]   we could get in trouble.
[01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:22.680]   No, we couldn't.
[01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:29.480]   Well, the latest NSA rev reveal is something called X-KeyScore.
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:34.480]   And according to this slide, also from our friend Edward Snowden,
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:37.240]   he reveals that, in fact, the NSA
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:39.040]   collects everything all the time.
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:40.080]   Yeah.
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:42.560]   I think we've always assumed that.
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:45.360]   That's why they're building that big facility in Utah, which
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.040]   actually works as we speak.
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:51.040]   By the way, that is literally three miles from me.
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:51.560]   Oh.
[01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:51.920]   Not even that.
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:53.000]   How could be it?
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:53.560]   Oh.
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:53.560]   So--
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:53.560]   So--
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:53.560]   So--
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:55.560]   Can you pop on over and recon that for us?
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:55.560]   Yeah.
[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:57.960]   Yeah, I was going to say, if you guys need me to check anything,
[01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:58.960]   I can sit down.
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:02.240]   So this feed and forps have each done their own articles
[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:04.240]   where a reporter goes out to that facility,
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:07.080]   takes pictures, and then they're approached by security
[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:08.360]   and are thrown out.
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:08.560]   Yeah.
[01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:09.360]   Fun.
[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:10.360]   Yeah.
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:11.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:11.880]   Photojournalism.
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:13.280]   What fun.
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:15.520]   That's just kind of fading the bear.
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:17.760]   I know a couple 18-year-old kids that work there literally
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:18.920]   as guys who sweep.
[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:20.480]   Like, that's their job is to sweep--
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:20.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:21.840]   --the other clearance facility or whatever.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:22.800]   They have clearance.
[01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:23.560]   They get in there.
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:25.840]   And that somehow makes me feel better about it,
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.280]   for I don't know why, just because there are a couple
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:28.480]   of schlubs and I know the idiots.
[01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:29.520]   And there they are working.
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:32.640]   And it's not like all just government agents and weird
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:34.720]   guys from alien planets that are here checking us out.
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:38.200]   But it is a massive, massive facility.
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:40.520]   It is very hard not to see it from the road.
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:44.120]   And it seems kind of remote where it's at.
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:45.520]   And I tell friends about it and they're like,
[01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:46.680]   well, does that make us a target?
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:47.520]   I'm like, no, no, no.
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:49.960]   See, I think this actually makes it less of a target
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:51.680]   from, I don't know who, who'd ever target it.
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:54.680]   But having this not on the east coast or the west coast
[01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:57.600]   or somewhere like that probably keeps it a little safer
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:58.120]   or whatever.
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:00.320]   But I just, I want to know what's going on in there.
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:01.760]   I want to see these drive arrays.
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:04.280]   I want to see the guts of this thing.
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:05.880]   And they're not letting anybody in.
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.600]   It'd be funny if there's an old Commodore
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:09.200]   in the middle of the whole thing.
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:13.520]   You know, if you look carefully at these slides,
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:16.080]   what's interesting about them is that they're training slides
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:17.760]   on how to use this tool.
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:20.400]   Yeah, it's actually, it looks like a damn good tool.
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:21.200]   It's a great tool.
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.960]   And it feels like the people who are being trained
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:24.040]   aren't too, aren't too brave.
[01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:24.800]   It's very jolly.
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:27.560]   Like for instance, one of the most common queries
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:30.840]   is you guessed it, an email address query.
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:33.480]   So I just want to, I think Scott, maybe we should record
[01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:35.880]   a training video like McDonald's style.
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:36.840]   Here's another one.
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:39.440]   X-KeyScore parses out everything it thinks
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:40.240]   as an email address.
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:42.720]   So don't be fooled by misfits.
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:44.280]   (laughing)
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:46.920]   Yeah, some guys are comedian writing this stuff.
[01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:48.480]   (grunting)
[01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:50.040]   Unbelievable.
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:51.120]   A lot of the--
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.800]   We'll get some good external shots of the plays
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:53.640]   and put this video to go.
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:55.080]   I think we should do a little training video.
[01:23:55.080 --> 01:23:56.920]   Some of the reporting that came out of this was saying
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:59.240]   that Snowden, for the most part,
[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:02.280]   just took training documents and information,
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:05.680]   which in themselves revealed things that a lot of us
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:10.280]   don't know, but this was like the lowest of the low level stuff.
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:11.560]   You just started the NSA.
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:12.840]   Here's how it works.
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:13.680]   Right.
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:14.680]   Yeah, that's what it looks like.
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:16.280]   Welcome to the NSA.
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:17.480]   So you're new at the NSA.
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:20.520]   Here's how to gather information to an extent
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:23.000]   that will astonish even you on average.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000]   Panelists can monitor Facebook chats.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:26.640]   All you have to do is enter the Facebook's username
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:29.160]   and the date range into a simple search screen.
[01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:30.520]   And there it is.
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:33.760]   I mean, you can search for internet browsing activities.
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:34.960]   They're collecting it all.
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:36.080]   Yeah, obviously.
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:38.960]   And then you've got access to this database.
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:39.800]   You can just search through it.
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:41.160]   It's got to be a ball.
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:44.960]   If you're a blackmailer, fantastic product.
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:47.320]   Why are we interested in HTTP?
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:50.720]   Well, because nearly everything a typical user does
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:52.760]   on the internet uses HTTP.
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:55.320]   Like visit myspace.com.
[01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:56.960]   Or email.
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:58.400]   Dot are you?
[01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.520]   Wow.
[01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:02.120]   Do you think it's a little weird, though, that I have neighbors
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:04.680]   who think they're more at risk for their data being sniffed
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.200]   because they live in those structures?
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:07.200]   Well, they're closer.
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.000]   Yeah, it's close.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.240]   Yeah, because the data pumps, you don't need the big ones.
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:14.200]   You can just a small fish tank data pump.
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:15.880]   We'll get it right into the NSA.
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:17.520]   It makes them so much more interesting
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:19.280]   because they're right next door.
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.320]   How about this one?
[01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:24.320]   The FBI is apparently using malware to spy on you.
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:25.760]   That's been going on forever.
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:26.720]   Yeah, well, why not?
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:30.120]   It's another fabulous tool in the federal arsenal.
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:31.560]   Key logging.
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:32.400]   Absolutely.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:36.200]   Or turning on the microphone in your phone
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:39.760]   using Google's Android software to record conversations.
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:44.080]   Turn on microphones and laptops without the user knowing.
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:45.800]   Are you one of those people that routinely
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.800]   tapes over the camera on your computer?
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:50.560]   Yeah, I have a usually with gaffers tape
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:52.800]   because I think that's classy.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:53.600]   Because it comes off easy.
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:54.400]   It doesn't get all sticky.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:55.680]   Right.
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:56.120]   Yeah.
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:59.960]   Since 2005, the FBI has been using web bugs.
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:01.720]   They can gather a computer's internet address list
[01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:04.440]   of programs running and other data.
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:08.800]   I mean, we've got to get Chris to going in on, actually.
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:09.840]   We've been trying to get him.
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:13.000]   He's a technologist at the ACLU.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000]   And he says, people should understand local cops
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.200]   are going to be hacking into surveillance targets.
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:19.960]   Everybody's doing this.
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:21.760]   A lot of this is coming out of DEF CON, which is going--
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:23.440]   are just completed in Las Vegas.
[01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:27.800]   What's scary is how widespread.
[01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:28.880]   It's not just the FBI.
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:32.760]   Maybe you trust the FBI more than you might.
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:33.840]   The local mall cop.
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:37.280]   That one guy that-- I can't remember his name off him,
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:40.800]   but one of the NSA previous whistleblowers,
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:43.440]   he said, if anything, you don't trust the FBI.
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:44.720]   He says, that was the biggest mistake he missed.
[01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:45.680]   Are they the worst?
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:47.520]   Well, according to him.
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:49.560]   Actually, in an interesting anecdote
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:50.760]   about how much things have changed,
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:53.240]   my neighborhood was going to do a neighborhood watch
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:54.600]   camera installation, because we've
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:56.080]   had a bunch of break-ins up here.
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:27:00.400]   And they were going to put the head of the neighborhood watch
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:04.080]   in charge of just keep funneling in the footage
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:05.360]   and watching it.
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:06.920]   And then they went ahead and canceled.
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:08.760]   They decided that they didn't want to do that,
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:10.880]   because it turns out that the head of our neighborhood watch
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:13.560]   is a retired FBI agent.
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:14.560]   Whoa.
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:15.760]   You'll be good at it.
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:16.760]   You'll be good at it.
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:18.360]   But that's what's so amazing.
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:22.160]   To me, it was a sign of how completely and forever things
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:24.560]   have changed, that the neighborhood watch was like,
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:27.760]   ooh, we can't have that guy in our poll.
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:29.040]   Like, really?
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:30.880]   I mean, 20 or 30 years ago, you would have thought
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:34.000]   that a guy who was a retired FBI agent, the neighborhood,
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.600]   would be like, oh, thank goodness.
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:36.360]   That's perfect.
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:38.960]   He's the perfect guy to watch the video and look for that guy.
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:41.040]   I'm surprised that your neighborhood after the Trayvon
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:43.600]   Martin case wants a neighborhood watch.
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:45.680]   Well, yeah, we might be over that.
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:47.280]   I think we're just over that as a neighborhood.
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:50.160]   You really want somebody paranoid walking around looking
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:51.240]   for--
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:52.040]   Somebody in.
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:52.560]   Shoot.
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:53.360]   Shoot.
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:54.160]   Yeah.
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:55.160]   Crikey.
[01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:56.120]   Well, this is for--
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:57.120]   Well, this is for--
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:58.280]   This is like Northern California, though.
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:00.000]   We don't have a lot of-- we have a lot of hoodies,
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.760]   but not a lot of guns.
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:02.120]   Right.
[01:28:02.120 --> 01:28:03.280]   There are a lot of hoodies.
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:03.880]   It's even worse.
[01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:04.680]   Throw a smoothie.
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:07.240]   Eat more guns.
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:07.920]   Let's take a break.
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:10.760]   Your old pal, Tom, by the way, when you were on TNT last week,
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:12.000]   boy, that was fun.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.040]   Oh, it was wonderful.
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:14.400]   Oh, man.
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:16.600]   I'm having like a little twit week.
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:17.280]   I know.
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:18.880]   And we should just get you in here.
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:20.040]   You screw that CBS.
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:20.840]   You come here.
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:22.440]   You come work for us.
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:23.000]   Tom, Mary.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:23.840]   What the hell with them?
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:24.440]   There's five more stars.
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.080]   The hell with them and they're millions of dollars.
[01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:28.600]   What do you need money for anyway, Molly?
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:29.400]   The helicopter.
[01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.000]   The satisfactory helicopter.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.120]   Who needs that?
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:33.440]   I'll throw you out of a plane.
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:36.560]   If that's what you need, that's what you want.
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:39.280]   Oh, Leo, you say that's what you need.
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:41.840]   You just strap-- I'll just strap out of your back,
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:43.520]   and we could jump out of a plane together.
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:44.040]   Made it.
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:46.320]   You'll have to use your German accent.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:49.320]   I would take care of your shoes.
[01:28:49.320 --> 01:28:52.320]   Let's see what Tom, Mary, has to say about the week ahead.
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:52.720]   Tommy?
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:53.040]   And thanks.
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:55.360]   Here's a look at what we'll be keeping an eye on for Tech
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:57.000]   News today in the week ahead.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.360]   Of course, today kicked off Geek Week on YouTube,
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:02.960]   spotlighting some nerdy geeky content all week there.
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:06.720]   Wednesday, August 7th, Groupon has their earnings.
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:08.800]   AOL has their earnings.
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:11.760]   LG hosts an event in New York City.
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:16.760]   And Google+ local for iOS will go away.
[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:20.560]   Friday, August 9th, Google is retiring its latitude location
[01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:21.240]   service.
[01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:24.200]   So another Google product also goes away.
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:25.560]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:26.800]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:30.240]   Previously on Twitter, iPad today.
[01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.920]   The full knock on the iPad mini in the first place,
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:35.640]   and the reason why I don't use it as my everyday iPad
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:38.120]   is specifically non-retnac.
[01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:40.960]   So I'm so used to my record screen on my full size iPad
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:43.720]   that I'm just like, that's just what I care about the most.
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:45.120]   To it, live specials.
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:46.040]   Is it always on?
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:47.600]   Is it always listening to me?
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:48.520]   Two problems with that.
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:49.760]   One is, of course, privacy.
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:50.880]   The other is battery life.
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:53.960]   It's not trying to listen to you to figure out what you're doing.
[01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:56.400]   It's only keyed off that little phrase there.
[01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:58.720]   In a sense, it's like clicking on a button
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:29:59.920]   and turning it on, right?
[01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:01.280]   Ham Nation.
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:04.360]   This was also the past weekend of the San Bernardino
[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:06.240]   Microwave Society, where they brought out
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:10.000]   all of their dish antennas, and were ready for the big Microwave
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.600]   10 gigahertz and up.
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:13.280]   Test down.
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:16.040]   Gizwiz.
[01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:17.440]   Making that ice cream?
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:23.280]   I can't spell off.
[01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:24.280]   It's--
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:27.400]   You're so damn slow.
[01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:28.920]   Oh my god.
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:31.480]   To it, John is now going to say something cranky
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:34.720]   after this promo.
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:36.360]   I'm supposed to say something cranky.
[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:38.720]   Hey, you must have known you were going to be here.
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:39.880]   Can you see it?
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:40.960]   Wow.
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:41.800]   I think this is--
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:42.920]   I'm macho Libre.
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:45.360]   I think we found the Rio Leo.
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:46.200]   It was a nice green ice.
[01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:47.200]   Look at that.
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:47.700]   Yeah.
[01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:48.200]   Yeah.
[01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:48.700]   So can I--
[01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:49.840]   You think I should wear this to the game?
[01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:51.480]   Yes, definitely.
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:52.920]   I think you're wearing it all the time.
[01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:54.720]   How's your peripheral vision and stuff?
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:56.560]   Can you see?
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:57.360]   Well, let's put it this way.
[01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:59.880]   You can sneak up behind me with a knife.
[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:01.360]   You got none from what I can tell.
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:02.880]   But fortunately, I have a Moto X.
[01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:04.440]   It's not just a ton of the radiance.
[01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:05.440]   It's your face.
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:07.120]   It'll alert you of something any minute now.
[01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:08.000]   Can you turn it up in the back?
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:08.360]   You can't.
[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:09.440]   I haven't tightened the laces.
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:10.280]   Let me do that.
[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:11.120]   No.
[01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:13.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:15.240]   Don't go to a Raiders game with no peripheral vision.
[01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:16.560]   Isn't that cool?
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:17.120]   That's true.
[01:31:17.120 --> 01:31:18.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:21.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:21.800]   Yeah.
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:23.520]   That's really cool.
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:24.920]   I wish I had one.
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:26.120]   Oh, well, John, don't take it.
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:27.880]   That's mine.
[01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:29.160]   Not for you.
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:33.120]   What else was I going to do?
[01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:35.680]   Oh, the Chinese hacking team that took over the fake water
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:36.880]   plant.
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:37.560]   It's not just us.
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:38.520]   Everybody's doing it.
[01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:39.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:40.040]   Yeah.
[01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:40.960]   It's a trend.
[01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:41.960]   OK.
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:43.760]   Let me just say it again.
[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:46.440]   Aren't you glad the NSA is out there protecting us?
[01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:47.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:48.400]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:49.480]   I think they need to do this.
[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:49.880]   I think they need to do this.
[01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:52.240]   Spying on every American, for sure,
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:54.040]   because God knows what's going on.
[01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:57.840]   It's about time somebody cracked down.
[01:31:57.840 --> 01:31:59.680]   There you have it.
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:00.680]   I like this one.
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:03.800]   Somebody went into the Edward Snowden Wikipedia page
[01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:06.440]   and changed the entry to say he was a traitor.
[01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:08.440]   But what they didn't realize is that whenever
[01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:11.520]   you modify a Wikipedia page, your IP address is recorded
[01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:14.880]   and publicly visible turned out, somebody from the US Senate.
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:16.240]   Nah.
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:17.080]   No.
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:17.600]   Yeah.
[01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:18.600]   Who was it?
[01:32:18.600 --> 01:32:20.320]   Well, you can't say exactly.
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:21.840]   Well, you can plug it into that machine there.
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:22.440]   I'll tell you.
[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:24.720]   Well, you could say what machine they were using maybe.
[01:32:24.720 --> 01:32:26.000]   No, I think there's probably-- the Senate
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.440]   has one IP address and then uses NAT to--
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:29.560]   Maybe.
[01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:31.120]   It was probably a staffer.
[01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:31.960]   Probably, yeah.
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:33.120]   I doubt it was a senator.
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:34.320]   I don't think they even had a humor.
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:36.720]   Schumer just said that on the--
[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:37.920]   Chuck Schumer maybe just said--
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:39.560]   Yeah, he's already said it in public.
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:41.080]   Yeah.
[01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:42.880]   I'm certain that the feds are going
[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:44.200]   to be knocking on my door any minute now
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:46.760]   because during that break, I went to Amazon
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:48.320]   and ordered myself some gaffers tape.
[01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:50.440]   And then that made me realize that I'm also out
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:52.600]   of packaging tape, so I ordered that too.
[01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:55.640]   And then I realized that that is just a weirdly suspicious
[01:32:55.640 --> 01:32:56.280]   order that I just--
[01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:57.880]   Did you add a pressure cooker to your car?
[01:32:57.880 --> 01:32:58.240]   No.
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:32:58.840]   What else could you--
[01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:00.120]   I even remember all these suspicions.
[01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:01.520]   You need restraints?
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:04.240]   Well, you should have ordered the book on either the Amazon.
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:05.200]   The book won't be on Amazon.
[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:06.920]   Some rope would be good.
[01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:09.320]   But anyway, I'm telling you guys that out loud right now,
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:10.120]   just so that anything--
[01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:11.320]   Because you're paranoid.
[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:13.920]   Well, welcome to the new United States of America,
[01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:16.360]   where Molly can't even buy some tape
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:17.600]   without getting paranoid.
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:18.600]   And knock you away yourself.
[01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:20.840]   But that's sitting here like, did that tape take a little bit weird?
[01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:22.000]   Oh my god, what am I doing?
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.640]   I've looked at tape and a pressure cooker.
[01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:26.440]   And by the way, the direct one is fantastic.
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:30.320]   I looked on the Sweet Home Review site for Best Pressure
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:31.080]   Cooker.
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:32.240]   It's over.
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:33.800]   It's a good thing I don't have a dog.
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:36.480]   Can we do like, ants and grasshoppers with this
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:38.280]   and just everybody go search for these things?
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:39.760]   And then we've got nothing then.
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:42.520]   I think the whole chat room should go search for pressure cookers.
[01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:44.840]   Yeah, then the whole chat room will be arrested.
[01:33:44.840 --> 01:33:48.000]   How are they going to find them all?
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.040]   That's the point, like, that's just overwhelming.
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:50.720]   Yeah, no.
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:51.600]   What is that called?
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:53.160]   Ants and grasshoppers?
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:54.160]   It's like the whole--
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:56.160]   Everything I ever learned comes from Bug's Life.
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:57.720]   OK.
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:33:59.840]   It's important to remember, if you're the ants,
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:01.080]   they're less grasshoppers.
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:02.160]   They look scary and big.
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:04.360]   We just need to get up and take over the ants.
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:05.360]   Ah.
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:10.440]   So I'm not asking for open rebellion or like full-on revolution
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:10.960]   here.
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:11.680]   I'm just saying.
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:13.200]   It came to that.
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:14.000]   Just remember.
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:17.120]   Just Google bombing, not real bombs.
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:18.360]   Just Google bombs.
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:19.360]   Right.
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:19.760]   Right.
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:22.120]   So Yahoo bought another--
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:23.360]   Yeah, wow.
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:25.880]   Rock, but he running rock, Mel, on there.
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:27.680]   I was in the horrible--
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:30.080]   It came out like five years ago.
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:32.280]   I downloaded it immediately and installed it
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:33.880]   because it was a social browser.
[01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:34.320]   And it--
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:35.240]   Yeah, we all did.
[01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:36.240]   Yeah.
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:36.760]   And hooked up.
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:38.280]   But I didn't even know they were still--
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:39.120]   I didn't know that either.
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:40.560]   They bought a business in six months.
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:41.360]   That's what I thought.
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:41.880]   Because nobody--
[01:34:41.880 --> 01:34:42.400]   Well, I remember.
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:44.520]   So I installed it and then stopped using it--
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:44.520]   immediately.
[01:34:44.520 --> 01:34:45.880]   --like six hours later.
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:49.160]   And then I got an email, I think maybe a year later,
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:51.480]   saying that they'd had some huge update.
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:52.360]   Yes, that's right.
[01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:53.480]   And then I was like, oh my god.
[01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:54.160]   There's a new here.
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:55.480]   And I just had to download the update.
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:57.000]   And then six hours later, I stopped using that.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.160]   And that was the last I heard it.
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:00.040]   I thought, yeah, we went in bottom.
[01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:00.760]   Why wouldn't they?
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:02.920]   So I just want to point out, when I go to the rock, Mel,
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:03.360]   page--
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:05.120]   I use the word bestest.
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:08.480]   Bestest, cutest, freshest, weirdest, bestest stuff.
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:09.080]   Bestest.
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:13.360]   To look, see Sarah Lane and I and 37 other friends use rock, Mel.
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:15.720]   All my friends use rock, Mel.
[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:17.680]   Apparently, they're--
[01:35:17.680 --> 01:35:18.320]   That's what happened.
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:20.120]   Marissa went to rock, Mel, and she saw that her--
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:21.960]   She saw that her and 1,000 other friends use rock.
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:23.200]   Oh my god, let's buy it.
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:23.760]   How much?
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:26.040]   $70 million?
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:27.400]   Come on.
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:28.800]   If nothing else, she bought some favors.
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:31.840]   She could have bought the Boston Globe.
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:33.720]   Good point.
[01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:34.440]   Is that number right?
[01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:35.280]   Did I get that wrong?
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:38.000]   You notice Yahoo's moving into newspaper buildings
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:38.840]   in every city.
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:39.520]   They're taking over the--
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:40.480]   They are in the Chronicle building.
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:41.480]   They're in the Chronicle building.
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:42.480]   They knew they were doing the--
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:44.000]   I'm just wearing a New York.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.160]   They think that's humorous.
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:46.680]   They want to be the new media of old Mel.
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:47.920]   It's ironic.
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:48.800]   Yeah, well, that's--
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:51.640]   Because they're already the old media, ironically.
[01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:53.480]   No, rock, Mel had already pivoted.
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:54.440]   I did not know that.
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:55.000]   Mobile first.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.760]   They had pivoted.
[01:35:56.760 --> 01:35:58.200]   Best tops, the second.
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:35:59.080]   They've pivoted.
[01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:01.120]   What was the buying price?
[01:36:01.120 --> 01:36:02.440]   I don't see it in this story.
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:05.640]   All Things D reports that it was 60 to 70 million.
[01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:06.440]   Yahoo.
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:08.960]   Which I am enraged by because, honestly, I'm
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:12.160]   certain that I, myself, with my one semester of Java
[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:14.280]   under my belt could frickin' build something that would be worth
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:15.600]   $70 million to Yahoo.
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:16.040]   Yeah, just like--
[01:36:16.040 --> 01:36:16.520]   Why is this?
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:18.000]   Because I have to work on that.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000]   It's like $2,000 all of a sudden.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.120]   That's what this feels like.
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:22.120]   What you guys are describing.
[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:24.000]   Why are we not all writing mobile software?
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.760]   Where did we go wrong?
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:26.800]   I don't know.
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:28.600]   I'm wasting my time.
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:29.040]   It's too--
[01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:30.320]   I gotta go, you guys.
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:31.000]   Go quickly.
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.520]   Learn iOS development.
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:37.680]   I'm going to take a break while Molly goes to write an iOS app.
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:38.180]   Come out.
[01:36:38.180 --> 01:36:39.560]   She should be done in about a half hour.
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:41.120]   It's not hard.
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:42.680]   Not hard at all.
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:43.400]   Yeah, I just--
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:45.040]   but she needs some buzzwords.
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:45.960]   Social.
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:46.960]   Yeah.
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:47.200]   Yeah.
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:47.560]   Bestest.
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:47.960]   Mobile.
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:48.520]   Mobile.
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:48.840]   Mobile.
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:49.320]   Which is--
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:49.880]   --geol-o-kating.
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:50.400]   --geol-o-kating.
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:50.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:52.720]   And I need some hipster bad grammar.
[01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:53.200]   Yeah.
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:53.800]   Bestest.
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:58.200]   And it's like a proto-Julesburn, a tired mascot guy.
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:36:59.280]   It's the Wu-stein punk.
[01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:00.480]   And a little steampunk might be useful.
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:02.000]   Like co-founder.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:03.080]   Drop of Val and that.
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:04.160]   Here's an angle.
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:05.920]   It's made of wood.
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:07.360]   Molly wood.
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:08.800]   It could all be--
[01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:10.640]   by the way, that's one of the selling points of the Moto X.
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:13.880]   I bet you want this, Molly, that you have a wooden back.
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:15.160]   It's beautiful.
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:16.400]   It is actually quite beautiful.
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:17.640]   I really was intrigued by that.
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:18.480]   I want that.
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:19.040]   You want that.
[01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:20.600]   We all want wood.
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:22.360]   Yes, that's what they say.
[01:37:22.360 --> 01:37:25.160]   Our show today brought to you by go-to-meeting.com
[01:37:25.160 --> 01:37:28.280]   by Citrix, the great folks who do literally
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:33.280]   the world's number one best-selling, most used online meeting
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:34.600]   tool, and there's a good reason.
[01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:37.320]   But they don't sit on their laurels.
[01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:38.160]   Duffs.
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:39.880]   Don't, sir, ree.
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:41.560]   I love Citrix because they're always improving,
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:42.280]   always innovating.
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:44.640]   They added HD video conferencing.
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:45.600]   So now you see--
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:46.880]   it's always been screen sharing.
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:48.000]   So you see the page.
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.160]   But you can also see the people you're meeting with.
[01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:52.320]   I'll tell you, it's in many ways better than meeting in person.
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:53.840]   It's more effective.
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:56.160]   It's-- and get this.
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:57.920]   It works on mobile devices.
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:01.360]   So you can go to a meeting on your iPhone, your iPad,
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:02.080]   your Android device.
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:04.080]   You can even present from an iPad.
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:07.400]   So you can be anywhere getting the job done.
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:11.640]   And with summertime and people on vacation and that--
[01:38:11.640 --> 01:38:13.200]   nobody wants to be at the office.
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:16.080]   Go down to the pool with the kids, bring your iPad,
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:17.080]   and still get work done.
[01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:18.240]   Go to meeting.com.
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:20.080]   You could try this free, by the way.
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:22.680]   When you use our offer code TWIT, you get 30 days free.
[01:38:22.680 --> 01:38:26.160]   And all the apps are free, which is, I think, really nice.
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:27.760]   They could try to make money on that.
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:28.360]   But they don't.
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:29.520]   They give those apps away.
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:30.640]   Unbelievable.
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:32.440]   And it's also very easy.
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:34.680]   If you're not-- if you're attending a go to meeting
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:36.880]   like you're a client, say you want to pitch a client,
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:38.240]   you don't want to make them jump through hoops.
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:38.740]   It's very easy.
[01:38:38.740 --> 01:38:40.080]   You send them a link in the email.
[01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:40.600]   They click the link.
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:42.480]   If the software's not installed, it installs literally
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:43.560]   within 30 seconds.
[01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:44.560]   It's running.
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:48.800]   Your client will be kind of blown away by your savvy sophistication.
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:49.560]   And they're seeing you.
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:50.600]   You're seeing them.
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:51.200]   Looks great.
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:52.040]   Works great.
[01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:53.440]   You know, you're not even reading this.
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:54.360]   You're just talking--
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:55.280]   I use it every day.
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:56.000]   And that's how I know.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:56.360]   I don't--
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:57.960]   I had to use that word amazing, but I did.
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:58.920]   It is amazing.
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:00.680]   It's the bestest.
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:01.280]   Bestest is better.
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:01.800]   Out there.
[01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:02.560]   It's social.
[01:39:02.560 --> 01:39:03.520]   It's mobile.
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:04.200]   It's go to meeting.
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:04.720]   Try it free.
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:05.560]   Go to meeting.com.
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:07.360]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:09.640]   No, I don't ever-- you know, they give me copy for all of these.
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:10.800]   You don't read copy.
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:11.720]   I don't need to.
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:15.800]   I'm a little insight baseball here when Leo was at Tech TV
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:16.440]   and whatever--
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:17.680]   I just make stuff up.
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:18.960]   They had a prompter.
[01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:20.320]   And you'd go on the prompter.
[01:39:20.320 --> 01:39:22.440]   And then you'd start reading from the prompter about three
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:22.760]   lines.
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:25.360]   And then you'd go way off the prompter, which drives
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:26.240]   prompter people crazy.
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:27.120]   Well, they hate it, but I don't care.
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:29.480]   And then you would ramble about one thing or another
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:31.520]   just going completely off the prompter.
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:33.600]   And then you'd jump back on the prompter.
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:35.040]   It was funny that you watched it.
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:36.520]   It was very, very smooth.
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:37.040]   Smooth.
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:37.520]   It was smooth.
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:38.200]   You're slick.
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:40.840]   And that's why I'm not working at KTVU.
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:41.640]   You wouldn't stand up.
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:42.280]   You wouldn't stand up.
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:42.960]   Something ting-long.
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:43.800]   Can you believe that?
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:44.800]   Some ting-long.
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:46.400]   Get that out of many.
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:47.440]   So channel two--
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:48.200]   I covered that in the morning.
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:50.040]   They, by the way, they fired everybody involved,
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:51.840]   except for the one person they should have fired,
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:53.680]   which is a person who read it out loud.
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:54.160]   The woman.
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:54.680]   Yeah.
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:55.520]   The news reader.
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:56.440]   So it was the new news.
[01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:58.200]   And I don't know where they got this,
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:39:59.720]   but it was really offensive.
[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:02.360]   I think they're being sued by the Asian-American ones.
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:03.240]   I think they actually--
[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:04.680]   They're dropping the law suit.
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:06.560]   The airline said they were going to sue.
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:08.320]   The airline was going to sue.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:09.840]   The airline was suing, and they stopped.
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:10.160]   I think no one was suing.
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:11.600]   They stopped sue.
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:13.720]   Did you-- you heard their apology, I assume.
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:14.880]   That was the worst thing ever.
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:16.280]   That was worse than the original airing.
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:16.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:17.680]   It was just bad.
[01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:21.280]   Saying things like, we are sorry, which is fine.
[01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:22.360]   But then they went on to say--
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:23.600]   What we called the--
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:25.000]   The first problem we made is we never
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.520]   sounded these out with our mouths,
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:29.320]   and we should have done that before we did the thing.
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:30.000]   I'm like, really?
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.520]   You couldn't read those things.
[01:40:31.520 --> 01:40:33.320]   And I mean, I looked at it on the page
[01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:34.120]   before I even heard it on YouTube.
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:35.120]   I knew where it was going.
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:35.800]   Right away.
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:37.960]   Come on, man.
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:39.800]   The weird thing is--
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:40.560]   But this is why--
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:41.080]   I agree with that.
[01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:41.960]   This is why I don't like prompter.
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:44.000]   You turn your brain off.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:44.720]   And so--
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:46.400]   Yeah, that's so easy to just read from the prompter.
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:47.320]   It's so easy.
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:51.920]   And so I really blame the anchor, because as soon as she said--
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:53.600]   So they're reading the names of the pilots.
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:54.560]   And it's--
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:55.600]   I don't know where they got it.
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.960]   But it said, Captain Sum Ting Wong.
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:40:58.720]   Yeah.
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:00.000]   We too low.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:00.840]   And it's ridiculous.
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:02.600]   These names are not Chinese or anything.
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:02.920]   They're just--
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:03.120]   Holy--
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:04.120]   --fook.
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:05.200]   It's ridiculous.
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:07.800]   And she didn't catch it, because she was in the zone.
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:10.040]   Sum Ting Wong.
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:11.840]   We too low.
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:12.680]   Holy--
[01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:15.000]   --fook and bang dang out.
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:17.600]   Now on.
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:20.120]   You have to be completely zoned out.
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:21.440]   She's thinking about lunch.
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:23.200]   She's thinking about her laundry.
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:25.200]   You can't read those and not--
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:26.680]   Well, it's sad.
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:27.600]   Oh, I'm so sorry.
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:28.880]   This is clearly an error.
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:32.040]   After the first one, she should have said, wait a minute.
[01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:32.960]   Yeah.
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:34.920]   Someone should have been-- because that woman is wearing
[01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:36.240]   an IFP like--
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:39.680]   even if she's a freaking robot with her brain sucked out,
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:43.000]   a producer in the bathroom should have been screaming at her
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.000]   to stop talking.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:44.640]   It was a new news.
[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:45.920]   That whole thing is just--
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:47.880]   Yeah, but you guys, they had turkey.
[01:41:47.880 --> 01:41:49.280]   They had Chipotle.
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:50.320]   They were a little sleepy.
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:53.400]   There's a moment-- Molly, you'd have to come on.
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:54.200]   You're in there.
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:57.440]   You see this disaster waiting to happen.
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:41:58.760]   And she goes for it.
[01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:00.720]   You're not going to say anything in the IFP.
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:04.600]   You're going to go, oh, this is the good one.
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:06.040]   Let's see if she does it.
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:07.720]   It's a run.
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:08.960]   What is the anchorman?
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:09.480]   Run.
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:10.480]   Run burgundy.
[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:12.600]   Run burgundy moment.
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:15.560]   To be fair, in their apology, they
[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:19.320]   claim that they talk to the NTSB, which
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:20.880]   is the flight authority.
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:24.040]   And someone on the phone there confirmed the spellings
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:24.320]   that they have.
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:25.600]   A summer intern.
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:26.160]   An intern.
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:27.240]   Yeah, an intern.
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:28.720]   That is another joke.
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:32.520]   That's the guy who went, yeah, that's wrong.
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:33.960]   He's going to-- yeah.
[01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:36.400]   Yeah, and he's going to go, I'm going to get fired for this,
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:38.160]   but it's worth it.
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:40.520]   And then he goes, quick, turn on channel 2.
[01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:41.600]   Quick.
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:43.080]   This is going to be good.
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:44.920]   Yeah, that's their names.
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:50.120]   Apparently, a Korean news agency,
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:52.960]   after landing gear failure to Southwest flight and loss
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:56.800]   in LaGuardia, put up a graphic with the pilot's names,
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:58.160]   Kent Parker Wright.
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:04.760]   And co-captain Wyatt Wooden Workman.
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:06.120]   Workman.
[01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:07.800]   Wyatt Wooden Workman.
[01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:08.600]   Look it right here.
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:10.800]   Kent Parker Wright.
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:17.120]   So and Captain Wyatt Wooden Workman blames no-scare failure.
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:17.920]   So they got back.
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:19.280]   They got even.
[01:43:19.280 --> 01:43:20.520]   I love it.
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:22.440]   I think it's our turn.
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:23.640]   Let's go after him.
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:24.320]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:26.440]   Shooting war with Korea.
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:27.680]   Maybe I shouldn't say that a lot.
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:28.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:29.680]   Yeah.
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:30.920]   I'm going to say listen to them.
[01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:33.080]   This episode's getting banned in several countries.
[01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:34.520]   So as long as we're going to go down,
[01:43:34.520 --> 01:43:35.520]   let's go down to flames.
[01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:38.360]   Bradley Manning.
[01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:41.920]   Equitted of what, being a traitor.
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:43.120]   What was he equated on?
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:44.280]   Espionage.
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:46.040]   No, no, no, he was equated on Espionage.
[01:43:46.040 --> 01:43:47.680]   He was equated of--
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:48.840]   No, he was equated on Espionage.
[01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:49.360]   Oh, that right.
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:49.880]   Eating the enemy.
[01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:50.520]   Providing and aiding the enemy.
[01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:52.680]   He didn't aid the enemy, but he definitely spied on us.
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:54.000]   And he was guilty of everything else.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:54.600]   Guilty of everything.
[01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:56.200]   And he's probably gone to jail for life.
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:58.360]   But at least it's no longer a capital crime.
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:00.040]   If you aid the enemy, they can chop your head off
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:02.240]   or whatever it is they do.
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:03.200]   And I shouldn't make a lie to him.
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:05.800]   Well, one of the things he got found guilty of is
[01:44:05.800 --> 01:44:09.200]   wanton publishing, which is the most interesting one.
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:10.320]   That's a crime?
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:12.640]   Apparently it isn't, but they just created it
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:14.560]   with a two-year minimum sentence.
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:15.560]   Wanton publishing.
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:19.080]   And wanton publishing is really bad news for the news media.
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:20.080]   Well, and this is the point.
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:21.440]   It's probably like a book company, doesn't it?
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:22.960]   Private Manning, of course.
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:24.440]   That's a great idea for a book company.
[01:44:24.440 --> 01:44:25.360]   Wanton publishing?
[01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:27.240]   Yeah, somebody at the URL.
[01:44:27.240 --> 01:44:28.440]   Might be sign fine novel.
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:30.160]   Ting away on the content.
[01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:33.640]   Wanton publishing.
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:36.600]   Private Manning turned over a lot, a big pile
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:39.520]   of secret documents to WikiLeaks, including some stuff
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:44.240]   that really needed to be shown into the light, the case
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:48.240]   of the helicopter pilots shooting missiles at journalists
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:49.240]   and so forth.
[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:50.680]   And kind of--
[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:51.200]   Yeah.
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:52.200]   And lastly--
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:53.400]   And lastly about it.
[01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:57.760]   In any event, Dan Gilmore writes a good piece in The Guardian
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:00.880]   in which he says, really, this is the Obama's administration
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:05.680]   war on leaks and by extension the war on investigative reporters
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:08.080]   who dared to challenge the most secretive government
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:09.680]   in our lifetime.
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:11.360]   And he says it has a chilling effect
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:15.040]   on journalism and on investigative journalism.
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:16.960]   President Obama has prosecuted more people
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:19.280]   over the Espionage Act, which was written in 1917,
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:22.520]   than every president before him combined.
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:25.360]   But he's also nasty against anyone who's a whistleblower.
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:29.120]   And whistleblowing is that not critical to--
[01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:29.760]   No?
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:30.680]   He doesn't think so.
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:31.760]   Apparently not.
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:33.720]   I mean, that's what this country was founded on.
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:34.220]   Yes.
[01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:38.000]   Before the state exists because the founding fathers wanted
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.520]   to have whistleblowers and someone
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:40.640]   to keep the government in check.
[01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:45.840]   Without a strong press, government can practice unchecked.
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:47.800]   That's the job of the press.
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:49.160]   It's very disappointing.
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:53.600]   Yeah, but our press is a wad of 24-hour networks
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:54.560]   who suck.
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:55.640]   I agree.
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:57.200]   That's why when something really is being done--
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:01.320]   That's the fact that we went from the sum-ting-long story
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:03.200]   to this story tells you almost all you
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:05.640]   need to know about the chilling effect on the press, for sure.
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:08.360]   There's a really good-- and I thought surprisingly strongly
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:11.960]   worded editorial at the start of this week's economist
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:14.160]   talking about liberty's lost decade.
[01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:17.720]   And that basically the last 10 years in America
[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:21.000]   have been the liberty's lost decade
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.240]   and that the Snowden and Manning cases in particular
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:28.080]   that while there may be reasonable debate on both side
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:29.800]   about the right or wrong of the action,
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:34.000]   the reactions should make all of America sit up
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.960]   and start talking seriously about what this country still
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:37.560]   stands for.
[01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:39.200]   I agree.
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:41.360]   I hate to end on such a depressing note.
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:43.120]   What can we say that's happy and sure?
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:43.480]   I know.
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:44.480]   Did you see?
[01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:45.880]   You shouldn't buy a full-- you shouldn't buy a full--
[01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:46.400]   Ball pit.
[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:47.840]   --of the wood back because we're supposed
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:49.160]   to be dumb enough to be more fizzing.
[01:46:49.160 --> 01:46:50.720]   Ball pit is good.
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:51.240]   Ball pit?
[01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:52.040]   All solo.
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:52.960]   It's now good.
[01:46:52.960 --> 01:46:55.200]   It's insidetrackbook.com.
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:56.080]   There you go.
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:56.840]   Plug.
[01:46:56.840 --> 01:46:57.360]   Plug.
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:03.640]   Hey, can we Chad build our own ball pit?
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:05.240]   I'm sure you've already got one here.
[01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:07.080]   It's PVC in elastic, right?
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:08.520]   And just a bunch of balls and they're where they're
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:09.040]   bucket each.
[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:11.600]   I mean, they would be very confused when we go to Walmart
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:12.920]   and buy their ball pit.
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:13.880]   Don't you buy balls.
[01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:15.640]   How much for the ball pit?
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:16.400]   What you want to ball?
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:18.360]   No, I want the whole pit.
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:19.640]   Oh, the whole thing.
[01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:21.320]   You want to like the pit like at McDonald's,
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:22.080]   that ball pit, right?
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:23.680]   No, that's disgusting.
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:24.880]   That's gotta be disgusting.
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:26.000]   That's a tall display.
[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.040]   Have you ever been in that pit?
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:31.080]   No, I know there's a company who, a local company, who
[01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:34.040]   gets contracted to clean the ball pits at the play places.
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:36.520]   And those guys have stories that keep me up at night.
[01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:38.080]   I hope they're wearing like yuck.
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:39.600]   They must wear hazmat uniforms.
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:40.400]   Yeah, yeah, hold back.
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:42.120]   Do you let him in those things?
[01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:42.800]   God, no.
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:45.320]   No, I don't know.
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:46.520]   I want him to--
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:47.920]   Are you telling me there's a bunch of--
[01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:50.160]   I don't want him to get syphilis at McDonald's.
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:51.520]   You know what I like to do?
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:54.600]   I like to dig in real low right underneath it
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:55.320]   so they can't see it.
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:57.800]   And then when they jump in, I go, ah!
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:01.160]   You should have that mask on.
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:02.600]   No, I don't do that, actually.
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:04.200]   But those things are disgusting.
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:05.560]   No, I don't mean that kind of ball pit.
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:06.640]   I want a Walmart ball pit.
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:08.120]   Those are much cleaner.
[01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:09.800]   Sometimes you find teenagers at the bottom of--
[01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:10.800]   Well, they were.
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:13.440]   All those little binder started jumping in them.
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:15.760]   This is the strangest meme ever.
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:17.200]   It's got a vinaereal disease.
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:18.600]   Ooh.
[01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:20.240]   Now that's the one we don't want.
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:21.760]   Fine vinaereal?
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:22.600]   Fine eereal.
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:23.120]   Funny.
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:23.840]   Funny eereal disease.
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:25.080]   I'm going to go write that down.
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:27.240]   That guy is Scott Johnson, frog pants.
[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:29.720]   You wake up in the morning to him four days a weekend.
[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:30.920]   You'll never forget it.
[01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:31.640]   That's true.
[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:32.280]   The morning stream.
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:33.000]   Thanks for having me on.
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:34.160]   Lots of stuff going on right now.
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:36.840]   People should-- if they are interested in what we do
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:38.320]   for the morning stream, they should check it out.
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:39.600]   Monday through Thursday.
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:41.920]   It's me and it's Brian Ebbitt from Coverville
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:42.720]   doing a morning show.
[01:48:42.720 --> 01:48:44.160]   By the way, happy birthday, Brian.
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:45.080]   He just had his birthday.
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:46.000]   Did you sell it?
[01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:47.400]   He's old like me now.
[01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:48.640]   Same age, actually, which is funny.
[01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:50.320]   But anyway, he and I love that show.
[01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:52.160]   I think other people might enjoy it if you haven't heard it.
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:55.200]   And you can find that and a billion other projects
[01:48:55.200 --> 01:48:57.320]   over at frogpants.com.
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:48:59.520]   And of course, Scott and Tom Merritt host frame rate
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:02.520]   every week on our network, right here.
[01:49:02.520 --> 01:49:03.360]   What day is it?
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:04.080]   No?
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:06.200]   It's Tuesday's, but I come on and I come on,
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:07.200]   guest occasionally, but it's even more--
[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:08.040]   Oh, you're not on a brush.
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:08.800]   It's that other guy.
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:10.560]   I confused you as Schwood.
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:12.680]   It's a guy Schwood and I get confused.
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:13.640]   That's funny you say that.
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:15.080]   They kind of look the same.
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:18.680]   The pictures of us from Nerdtacular 2013 this year,
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:20.120]   it's sitting next to each other.
[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:21.440]   I look like his older brother.
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:22.640]   It is really, really weird.
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:24.000]   I was actually thinking of forecast,
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:25.640]   which you get it with Tom, which was a great show.
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:26.080]   But he's--
[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:27.080]   Yeah, we still missed that.
[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:30.400]   Tom comes on Wednesdays though and does a little tech segment
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:32.560]   on Wednesdays on the Morning Stream right before TNT.
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:33.680]   It's always fun to have him.
[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:35.480]   Very good.
[01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:36.640]   Yeah, not frame, right?
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:37.720]   I was thinking of forecasts.
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:38.320]   I apologize.
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:41.200]   Schwood and Tom do that though, and it's a great show.
[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:43.280]   Chad's going like this.
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:44.480]   Actually, a video of that.
[01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:46.200]   Guess why he's got that red hair, because he's
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:50.000]   very noticeable when he gets activated back there.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:51.880]   Now, that's why I think why he dyed his hair red
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:53.400]   so that I wouldn't miss the signals.
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:54.080]   No, really red.
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:55.160]   What color is that anyway?
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:55.680]   It's red.
[01:49:55.680 --> 01:49:57.000]   What's the name of it though?
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:57.880]   Fire engine red.
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:02.040]   This is a nuclear red and blood red mixed together.
[01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:03.000]   Blood red.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.880]   Oh, that's red wedding too much.
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:07.960]   I have a video though.
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:10.120]   This is what Chad was doing.
[01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:11.120]   Where's the video of this?
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:14.120]   I thought I had a video of you doing this earlier.
[01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:17.840]   These are from the Moto X.
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:20.240]   I'm by the way going to do a good review of the Moto X
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:22.200]   on Tuesday and before you buy anybody wants to see it.
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:24.320]   This is what Chad was doing earlier.
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:26.800]   No, he's not on frame.
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:30.800]   No, he's not on frame rate.
[01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:31.760]   That's a meme.
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:33.040]   That could be a meme.
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:35.440]   That's what those KTV you guys should have been doing.
[01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:39.040]   Yeah, something wrong.
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:41.800]   No.
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:43.520]   Mark Millian writes at Bloomberg Business Week
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:45.120]   is always a pleasure to have you, Mark.
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:46.080]   What's up these days?
[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:46.640]   What you up to?
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:48.200]   Anything you want to call it?
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:50.240]   I get a piece coming out tomorrow morning
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:53.960]   about how Google's unveiling of the Moto X
[01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:55.640]   kind of blew up in their face a little bit
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:58.200]   because it's only coming to America.
[01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:01.240]   So they built up a lot of hype for this phone.
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:02.520]   It's an American phone.
[01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:03.640]   And, you're in Asia where--
[01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:05.360]   They're an American company.
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:07.520]   They're an American company.
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:10.120]   But when you do these types of launches,
[01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:11.840]   like the Samsung and the Apple launches,
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:13.680]   people expect a global phone.
[01:51:13.680 --> 01:51:14.920]   If you're going to build global buzz,
[01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:15.600]   they want a global phone.
[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:17.120]   I didn't really do this story.
[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:18.560]   We should have because what was interesting
[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:22.400]   when the Moto X was announced is how upset people were.
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:24.320]   That's a mid-range phone.
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:26.240]   And they're charging $200 for it.
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:27.960]   Yeah, there's a lot of complaining about the price.
[01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:28.360]   Oh, very upset.
[01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:30.560]   And then, of course, if you're in Australia or England
[01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:33.680]   or Asia where you might want it, you can't get it.
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:35.760]   Motorola's even said, no, we're not going to sell it there.
[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:38.400]   We don't care.
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:40.000]   But why not do you think?
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.920]   Well, I talked to Motorola.
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:45.360]   They said they're going to have a portfolio of devices coming out.
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:47.520]   And this is the first in a new family.
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:50.760]   But one of the things you have to consider
[01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:53.960]   is, as I was saying, when you're doing these types of blowout
[01:51:53.960 --> 01:52:00.040]   sort of media blitzes that reach across the entire world,
[01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:04.160]   you need a device that you can sell around the world.
[01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:05.720]   Do you think they made a mistake?
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:07.240]   I don't know if they promoted it as heavily.
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:10.800]   I think a lot of this was leaks, and people excited about it.
[01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:11.600]   There were a lot of leaks.
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:12.440]   And then--
[01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:15.080]   They are going to spend half a billion dollars advertising,
[01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:15.800]   which is--
[01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:18.280]   Yeah, they started the hype machine in May
[01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:19.480]   with some advertisements.
[01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:22.880]   And they did a big media blitz on Thursday.
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:25.600]   And it wasn't entirely clear when all of that broke
[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:28.920]   that it is only coming to the Americas.
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:30.960]   The only thing really that's, to me, interesting--
[01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:33.280]   and I think it's very interesting-- is the always on,
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:34.600]   always listening capability.
[01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:35.640]   Always listening.
[01:52:35.640 --> 01:52:37.160]   But don't the other-- don't the droids do that?
[01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:38.480]   They announced last week as well.
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:41.440]   I think they have more than one phone that does that.
[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:41.800]   Anyway--
[01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:43.680]   Yeah, I think that's in the new operating system.
[01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:45.080]   Yeah, I love it.
[01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:46.800]   I am a big fan, and I like the phone.
[01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:48.720]   But I'll have a full review on Tuesday for you.
[01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:51.840]   And no, you don't get my HTC One, John C. de Vorac.
[01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:54.000]   So this is the other really nice phone, though.
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.040]   I really like this.
[01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:56.160]   You have some other phones.
[01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:56.840]   You have--
[01:52:56.840 --> 01:53:00.600]   The Galaxy S4, I'm less excited about too much junk on it.
[01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:01.480]   Is that what you use, Molly?
[01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:03.000]   The Galaxy S4.
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.960]   I use the iPhone 5 and the Galaxy S4, yes.
[01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:08.280]   I feel like Bota-- I mean, Samsung's kind of gone down
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:10.080]   a bad road of--
[01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:13.120]   You know, I just went to the S4 from the GS4
[01:53:13.120 --> 01:53:16.560]   from the Nexus 4, just out of kind of curiosity.
[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:18.280]   I just want to know what it was all about.
[01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:20.280]   And I'm not that wild about it.
[01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:22.840]   I think it's possibly that I've just ODed on Samsung's
[01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:23.960]   overlay and bloatware.
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:25.560]   Yes.
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:27.560]   Yeah, I think the Google experience, Galaxy S4,
[01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:29.280]   is probably a better choice.
[01:53:29.280 --> 01:53:29.760]   But you should--
[01:53:29.760 --> 01:53:30.280]   I honestly--
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:30.800]   I'm going to--
[01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:31.800]   I love this.
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:32.400]   It's what the--
[01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:33.040]   Thank you, one, two, one.
[01:53:33.040 --> 01:53:33.520]   --is 4.1.
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:34.020]   What?
[01:53:34.020 --> 01:53:35.480]   This is also 4.2.2.
[01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:38.000]   But if you get the Google experience one,
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.680]   they're pushing up for three already.
[01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:40.720]   Well, that's what you should get.
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:42.120]   So get the Google experience one.
[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:44.480]   I don't know, because there's stuff in sense,
[01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:48.760]   like the camera and the Zoes that I really like.
[01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:51.080]   I'm not sure I'd want to give that up.
[01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:52.040]   So there, I've rooted this.
[01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:54.080]   It's got a different ROM on it, but it's actually
[01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:55.680]   a sense-based ROM with 4.2.
[01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:56.880]   I'm about to start testing--
[01:53:56.880 --> 01:53:57.280]   You're a nerd.
[01:53:57.280 --> 01:53:59.600]   I'm going to test out the Windows phone, actually.
[01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:00.080]   Good for you.
[01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:00.680]   The 1120.
[01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:01.480]   I'm going to live with it.
[01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:02.480]   Oh, the 1020.
[01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:03.280]   Yeah, the 1020.
[01:54:03.280 --> 01:54:04.400]   Oh, good for you.
[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:05.560]   Andy's got one.
[01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:06.760]   Paul Therat's got one.
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:09.120]   Andy and I go from Mac quickly, Paul Therat for Windows Weekly.
[01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:11.320]   And they're taking amazing pictures.
[01:54:11.320 --> 01:54:12.360]   They're loving it.
[01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:13.880]   Yeah, no, I'm excited about that.
[01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:16.520]   I can't believe it doesn't have Instagram.
[01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:18.560]   And I think that whole weird Instagram thing,
[01:54:18.560 --> 01:54:19.960]   I don't know what the hell they're doing.
[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:22.600]   And I wish they would stop being such a pain in the ass
[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:23.960]   about Windows Phone.
[01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:24.960]   But other than that, I think I'll
[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:26.560]   be able to live with it just fine.
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:28.000]   I'll tell you exactly what's going on.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.240]   Behind the scenes, Microsoft and Facebook
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:31.480]   are going back and forth.
[01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:32.000]   It's got, yeah.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:33.560]   How much are you going to pay us, Microsoft?
[01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:35.440]   Microsoft's a part owner of that company.
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:36.720]   There shouldn't be this going on back.
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:37.840]   Yeah, they want a million bucks.
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:39.440]   And Microsoft said, we'll give you half a million.
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:40.640]   I don't believe this.
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:41.600]   I bet you.
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:43.960]   Because you know Microsoft's paying other companies
[01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:47.440]   to make four square, et cetera, four Windows Phone.
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:48.280]   The fact--
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:49.200]   That's what they are.
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:49.720]   Yeah.
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:50.120]   Yeah.
[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:53.440]   And so you know they went to Instagram immediately and said,
[01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:54.440]   how much?
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:56.120]   And Instagram gave them a number, and they choked.
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:54:57.840]   And it's not buying that story.
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:54:58.400]   You don't think so?
[01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:00.240]   Well, what did you dig into it?
[01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:02.720]   Investigate a reporter, John C. Devorek, channeldevorek.com.
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:04.600]   I really care to be honest about this one.
[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:05.600]   I'm making these one.
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:07.000]   I don't care.
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:07.720]   I don't care.
[01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:08.240]   Fine.
[01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:09.160]   I'll look into it.
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:10.160]   Thank you, Molly Wood.
[01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:11.520]   Investigate a reporter.
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:12.240]   I'm mad.
[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:13.600]   Yeah, of the Wood Company.
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:14.600]   Wood-- Wood--
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:17.160]   The chat room is totally named it, guys.
[01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:17.960]   Woodster.
[01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:18.760]   Woodster.
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:20.120]   No, Woodster.
[01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:21.480]   Woodster.
[01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:24.360]   @mollywood on the Twitter and path and everywhere else.
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:25.800]   And of course, no, you don't do on path,
[01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:27.400]   because nobody does path.
[01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:27.960]   It's private.
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:29.960]   You know, I stopped doing path, and then a friend alerted me
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:32.680]   that my fuel band was still updating to path.
[01:55:32.680 --> 01:55:33.200]   Every day.
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:35.480]   I thought, boy, that Molly Wood's running a lot.
[01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:35.920]   I don't know.
[01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:37.960]   She goes, nobody's on path except your fuel band.
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:39.040]   I'm like, oh, for god's sake.
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:39.720]   And then I tried to--
[01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:42.400]   I think I maybe disconnected it, but I'm not totally sure.
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:42.840]   I don't know.
[01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:44.520]   Veronica and I have really been wondering
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:46.560]   where you've been, OK?
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:48.240]   Molly Wood is always on.
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:49.760]   And the new season launches next month.
[01:55:49.760 --> 01:55:50.880]   It's exciting.
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:52.000]   It starts August 20.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.720]   I did a great interview with Sal Khan from Khan Academy,
[01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:57.680]   because we did a whole good package on e-learning.
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:55:59.680]   And it's really--
[01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:00.880]   He's amazing.
[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:03.800]   He deserves all the praise in the world.
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:06.280]   At least 40 amazing came out of this show, at least.
[01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:06.880]   Maybe 50.
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:08.400]   It's amazing.
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:09.720]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:11.000]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon.
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.240]   Hey, you ever signed me off?
[01:56:13.240 --> 01:56:14.600]   I said channeled of work.
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:15.760]   I said no agenda show.
[01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:16.880]   No, I was out of it.
[01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:18.080]   I was reading from the chat room.
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:19.080]   I was in the chat room.
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:19.800]   You know what?
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:20.280]   You know what?
[01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:22.720]   I forgot to mention the e-book.
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:24.840]   Insidetrackbook.com.
[01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:25.240]   That one.
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:26.560]   Well, if we're doing plugs, I'm throwing in
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:28.880]   at Bloomberg.com/globaltech.
[01:56:28.880 --> 01:56:29.680]   There you go.
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:30.180]   Yeah.
[01:56:30.180 --> 01:56:31.180]   I'm going to come on that, sir.
[01:56:31.180 --> 01:56:32.180]   I'm going to come on that, sir.
[01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:34.180]   Is there direct income from you throwing that plug in?
[01:56:34.180 --> 01:56:34.680]   No.
[01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:36.680]   I get a salary.
[01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:38.600]   It's trying to contain the dollars.
[01:56:38.600 --> 01:56:39.620]   And $0.49.
[01:56:39.620 --> 01:56:39.960]   That's pretty bad.
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:41.600]   Every time somebody goes and buys that.
[01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:42.520]   Yes, that's so much.
[01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:43.720]   You don't get 100% of that?
[01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:44.480]   Yeah.
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:45.720]   OK.
[01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:46.600]   Well, how much does it cost?
[01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:48.780]   What's the cost of that?
[01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:49.220]   A what?
[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:49.960]   A book.
[01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:51.040]   It costs whatever it costs.
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:52.240]   $9.49.
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:55.440]   Yes, but then PayPal takes a huge piece of that.
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:56.560]   Oh, you're going through PayPal.
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:56:56.920]   Yeah.
[01:56:56.920 --> 01:56:58.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:56:58.400 --> 01:56:59.760]   They take, like, 15 cents.
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:00.760]   Scott Johnson on Twitter.
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:01.260]   There's my book.
[01:57:01.260 --> 01:57:01.760]   Scott Johnson.
[01:57:01.760 --> 01:57:02.260]   That's Scott Johnson.
[01:57:02.260 --> 01:57:02.760]   That's seriously.
[01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:03.260]   That's Scott Johnson.
