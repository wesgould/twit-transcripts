[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.320]   Oh, we have a good panel for your Florence Ions here
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.560]   from all about Android.
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.280]   Matt cuts the acting administrator

[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.880]   at Navigate Research and our car guy.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.880]   We are gonna talk about the anniversary, the IBM PC,
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.720]   the Galaxy Note 9, and oh, I don't know,
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.720]   maybe a scary robot that'll sort your socks.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.320]   It's all coming up next on "Twit."
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.880]   (electronic music)
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.960]   - Netcast, you love.

[00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.440]   It's time for "Twit" this week at Tech the Show
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.040]   where we cover the week's Tech News
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.920]   with a distinguished panel of Tech News experts.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.440]   Actually, I am kind of liking the mix on this panel.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.120]   This will be fun starting with all the way to my right.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.000]   Sam Aboule-Samid, who is at Karguru,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.240]   senior analyst at Navigant Research.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.240]   He brought us a hydrogen fuel cell powered
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.200]   Honda this week.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.640]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.440]   Record a segment with Megan earlier.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.120]   They'll be on screen savers next week.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.080]   Nice.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.040]   What do you think? You like it?
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.720]   It's a nice little car.
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.720]   It's basically an electric car,
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.080]   but instead of battery charging,
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.920]   you have to put a hydrogen.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.080]   Instead of plugging it into a wall,
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.000]   you plug it into a hydrogen pump
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.720]   and fills up in about five minutes
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.400]   and then you're on your way again.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.520]   That's an advantage.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.600]   Fills up in five minutes.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.440]   That's nice.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.280]   You can find a hydrogen station.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.120]   Oh, that.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.720]   There is that little detail.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.440]   You said there's 13 in California.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.360]   There's about three dozen right now.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.280]   Oh, all right.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.560]   Yeah, wow, that's a lot.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.080]   So you still have 30 miles to Mel Valley
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.280]   to fill the closest one here.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.200]   That's not bad.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.200]   Get your gas.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.200]   We used up half of it.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.160]   Pick up, I don't know what you get in Mel Valley,
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.000]   but you know, that's good.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.840]   Get lunch.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.680]   So, the balance is fine.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.280]   This is her third or fourth show of the week.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.760]   Host of all about Androids.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.360]   She was here on Tuesday for the Note 9 reveal.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.360]   Galaxy unloaded, unplugged.
[00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.160]   Galaxy Note 9.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.080]   Unpacked.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.080]   Unpacked.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.080]   Unpacked.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.080]   Unloaded.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.080]   I knew it was unsumthing.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.080]   Good to have you.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.080]   Uncovered.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.080]   Thank you for having me.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.960]   And back from Washington, D.C., the nation's capital,
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.560]   Mr. Mack Cuts, acting administrator
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.640]   of the United States Digital Service.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.480]   Can we play ruffles and flourishes when Mack comes in?
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.640]   No need, no need, no need.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.480]   Just, wait.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.480]   That's church.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.480]   This is my man.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.640]   This is my pitfall running mature.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.200]   Oh, it's pitfall, of course it is.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.240]   No, no flag slash.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.920]   You know, big red red blue this time.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.360]   No, this is good.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.360]   Great to see you, Mack.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.360]   Good to see you.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.360]   And you're still in D.C.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.360]   This is still ongoing.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.360]   I do.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.360]   But I just can't stay away.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.360]   Well, you come out here a lot.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.360]   I know you got to recruit for the Digital Service.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.680]   You got to talk to Silicon Valley.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.520]   Tell them how much the country needs.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.520]   Help.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.520]   Yeah.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.520]   Good.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.520]   Certainly does.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.520]   I'm glad to be here.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.520]   Yeah, there's a lot to do.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.520]   The Digital Service turned around the VA website.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.680]   So, originally started, and, correct me if I'm wrong, I think it was originally started
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.200]   when the ACA, the Obamacare website, was such a mess.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.800]   They went out to private industry.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.440]   We charged them an arm and a leg to make just an unusable site.
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.680]   And Silicon Valley said, "Let us help."
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.680]   Great.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.760]   Silicon Valley can help.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.840]   And now, we celebrated our fourth birthday yesterday.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:36.840]   Wow.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.840]   How crazy is that?
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.960]   We had a birthday cake with binary on it.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.440]   It was a lot of fun.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.440]   Happy birthday.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.760]   You know what else's birthday it is today?
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.800]   On this date, in 1981, the IBM PC came out.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.680]   We were just looking before the show at some of the ads for IBM PCs.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.600]   Do you remember that it was Charlie Chaplin?
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.680]   That the original IBM ads?
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.520]   Here you go.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.080]   If you're thinking of buying a personal computer and all the signs say it's time to take the
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.080]   first step, a few questions may still be holding you back.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.320]   When your PC had the power of the phone rings.
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.320]   We've come a long way.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.440]   Now, this wasn't the first personal computer.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.240]   Obviously, Apple had been there.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.440]   But like that car, there were steam power.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.400]   I believe you have four or five years earlier in 1977.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.000]   Tari made computers, Commodore made computers.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.720]   In fact, remember Apple very famously took out a full-page ad.
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.080]   I think it was in the Wall Street Journal that said, "Welcome IBM.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.080]   Seriously."
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.920]   And that they later regretted, I'm sure.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.920]   Look at that.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.920]   Dot matrix printers.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.920]   Software.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.920]   And today, prices are better than you.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.920]   Lotus 123.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:49.920]   There you go.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:50.920]   Yep.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.840]   Once you take the first step, the rest can easily.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.120]   IBM personal computers can see them in a store near you or corner IBM.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.720]   See them at a store near you.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.560]   Yeah, you don't hear that much anymore.
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.480]   It's good luck finding a computer in a store anymore.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.280]   Actually, a enterprise.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.840]   I went to fries last weekend.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.840]   There's still computers there.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.840]   There's still fries.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.840]   That actually used to be hoping that.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.840]   And there's still best buys too.
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.120]   They sell refrigerators and washing machines though.
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.840]   And security cameras.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.840]   Yeah.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.960]   Fries on the other hand sells geeky stuff.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.960]   Everything.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.960]   They also sell water.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.600]   They do also sell Slim Jims.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:30.240]   I mean, if you're on road trip, chips and chips.
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.840]   No, this fries also had air fresheners and candles.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.680]   Oh, you mean the Slim Jims you eat?
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.680]   I thought you met the skinny ones that you had.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.080]   You opened up hard doors?
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.080]   Maybe.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.720]   That's a sad.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.240]   So the Galaxy Note 9.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.240]   Yes.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.640]   This really shows actually it's great.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:52.200]   When you think back to 1981 when the IBM PC came out and how limited that power wise
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.560]   that was a 4 megahertz 8088, they came with a cassette adapter for storage because nobody
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.560]   could afford floppies.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.160]   Although you could get a floppy drive with a hard drive.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.000]   Yeah, but what it was, it 5 megabytes, 10 megabytes.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.920]   It wasn't very big megabytes, not gigabytes kids.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.520]   And then you look at the Galaxy Note 9, which if you're willing to pay through the nose,
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.320]   has a terabyte of storage as much as.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.320]   As much as.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.160]   So there's a couple of things I found interesting.
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.440]   You were there for the announcement so you could tell me more flow.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.520]   The base unit, the base model, the cheapest one you get, $9.99.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.600]   And that's for six gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage, which is probably enough for anybody.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.600]   Probably.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:44.640]   Then there's a $1,250 version with eight gigs of RAM and a 512 gig storage.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.400]   500, that's half a terabyte.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.200]   And then you put you, Samsung says we're going to make 512 megabyte micro SD cards.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.760]   You can add to that for a full terabyte.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.120]   You're going to actually, I know that those slots take up to two terabytes.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.960]   If you can, if you get the S, the stand disk makes a two terabyte.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:00.960]   Does stand disk make?
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.960]   How much is a two terabyte?
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.120]   I think Jason and I looked it up.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.600]   I think it was around like $80 or extra or something like that.
[00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.440]   No, no, no.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.440]   You got to be more than that.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.680]   No, you looked up something else.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.040]   It's got the double days ago.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.840]   Micro, maybe the prices have gone down.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.840]   Micro SD card.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:21.200]   Let's see what the sand disk ultra 128 is.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.080]   Okay, not bad.
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.080]   All right.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.760]   So I definitely overshot it a little bit.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:27.760]   Let me see.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.760]   Don't forget the liquid cooling.
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:29.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:30.760]   Just like a Power Mac G5.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:31.760]   Here's a Samsung's.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.960]   This is the one I use.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.960]   This is the 256 gig Evo.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:37.960]   That's 100 bucks.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:43.040]   I mean, I guess the point is why would anybody need more than that?
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.400]   Dex, Samsung Dux.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.400]   What?
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.400]   You're kidding me.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.840]   I mean, if you want to use your phone as a desktop replacement.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.840]   Well, you need some cable now.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.840]   You don't even need it.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.160]   So I still have my Dex puck.
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.160]   Can I use that?
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.160]   I still have that too.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.840]   Can I use that with a new Galaxy Note 9?
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:00.840]   I have.
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.840]   I mean, I would assume so.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.640]   It's got the same USB-C plug.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.640]   Well, apparently I think you don't actually need the dock anymore.
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:09.320]   I think you can just plug it in directly to a monitor now.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.200]   Sounds like a just-
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.840]   It's a USB-C to an HDMI cable.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.840]   Okay.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.840]   That's not so bad.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.840]   And then how do you do the keyboard and mouse?
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.840]   The monitor has a-
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.840]   Bluetooth.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.840]   Bluetooth.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.840]   Bluetooth.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.840]   No USB.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.520]   But it's running Android on a big screen.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.920]   Most of the time what you're going to run is special Samsung apps.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.120]   At least that's how it was with the S8.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.120]   I guess it was.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.120]   It's about the same.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.120]   It's about the same.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.120]   It's about the same.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.120]   Specialized apps.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.120]   And there are some like apps that work.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.120]   Google Docs.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.080]   Google Docs stretch to fill the screen.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.080]   It does.
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.080]   Okay.
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.080]   Because of the Chromebook.
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.760]   Yeah, but this is Android.
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.680]   Yeah, but that all translates over.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.680]   Okay.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.680]   It's all one big code base right now.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.680]   That's completely unified.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.680]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.720]   I just meant for the experience of Google Docs.
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.720]   Right.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.680]   They're made for to be expanded and trunk and expanded and trunk.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.680]   So it would work fine.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.680]   Chromebooks can run and run and run.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.680]   Yeah.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.240]   It's interesting though that there isn't a lot of new stuff in the Note 9.
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.240]   In fact, there's really nothing.
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.240]   Just specs.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.240]   Just spec bumps.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.240]   It's faster.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.240]   It's going to be 845.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.600]   The S Pen is a camera remote.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.600]   Okay.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.720]   Now that's a good and bad thing.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.720]   So that means the S Pen has Bluetooth LED.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.200]   It does.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.560]   And that means you have to charge the S Pen and has a super...
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.560]   Take 30 seconds.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.560]   Super capacitor in there.
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.560]   Yes.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.560]   So it's hard just very fast.
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.560]   Yes.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.560]   But how long does it run on a 30 second charge?
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.560]   Half an hour, they said.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.560]   Okay.
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:30.560]   So fine if you're just taking a picture.
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.560]   Yes.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.880]   Less fine if you're sketching.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.680]   Really less fine if you're taking notes to them.
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.920]   You can sketch but half an hour later does it still sketch?
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:39.920]   Yes.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.080]   So you can still use the S Pen portion.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.320]   It's just the button Bluetooth remote portion does not work.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.320]   Oh, that's fine.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.160]   So is it a Wacom type of technology with the S Pen?
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.160]   I think so.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.160]   Yes.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.160]   Wacomish.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.960]   So it doesn't... that doesn't actually need separate powers just detecting.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.960]   No, yeah.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.040]   But they're highlighting stuff like...
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:04.680]   And if you get the lavender phone, you get the lavender pen that draws in lavender ink
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.680]   on the screen.
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.680]   Ooh, you can unlock the solar...
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:07.680]   I do love purple.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.680]   But the yellow pen does look pretty cool.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:15.080]   If you get the blue phone, it gets the yellow pen and writes in yellow ink on the lock screen.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.080]   Oh man.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.120]   Can you imagine if you have to buy each pen in a different color to use that color?
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.360]   I actually would love to be able to choose my own S Pen.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.960]   Like the old days when we had pens that had like four color ink.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:25.960]   Yeah, four color ink.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:26.960]   I don't know about you.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:27.960]   I still have pens like that.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:28.960]   It just feels like we...
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:29.960]   It's still by them.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.200]   If this is the feature set we're talking about, we've really come to a plateau.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.200]   Stagnation.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.920]   Stagnation in the development of smartphones.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.440]   Did they spend a lot of time on the camera?
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.440]   Yes.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.880]   But not a huge amount because it's pretty much the same as the S9, I would imagine.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:46.880]   Yes.
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.080]   I mean, I know there's some new selfie modes.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.080]   Again.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.080]   Which is always...
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.080]   They still have...
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.080]   I mean, over the camera...
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.080]   Two cameras still?
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.080]   It's two cameras.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.080]   And they have...
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.280]   Scene optimizer modes, which is just all fun marketing spiel.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.280]   You know, I just want to point and click on this.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.280]   Oh.
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.280]   There's twin ones.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.280]   You have pens.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.120]   You can have any color you want as long as it's red, green, blue, you can.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.120]   That's pretty great.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.120]   You both can.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.120]   I don't have one.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.120]   I'm fine.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.120]   No, it's cool.
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.120]   I want to see this in the White House.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.920]   Hi, there you can take me off.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:17.920]   I am curious.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.160]   When you get a half hour of pen, is that a half hour of button pushing a pen or is that
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.160]   a half hour of...
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.320]   No, but pushing on a regular pen...
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.320]   Oh, the S pen?
[00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.280]   I think that's forever pushing.
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.280]   Okay.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.280]   Because you know it doesn't pop up.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.280]   That's the key.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.960]   Because yeah, if you were taking notes in a meeting you could say, "Well, the meeting's over.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.400]   I ran out of battery in my pen."
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.400]   That's not really good.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.400]   So...
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.520]   Actually, if you've ever worked at a place where you've spent a lot of time in meetings,
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.520]   that's actually a pretty good thing.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.520]   Actually, it's good.
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.520]   Excuse.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:44.520]   I think there's...
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:45.520]   It's time to stop the meeting.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.200]   Once my S pen runs out of battery, I'm out of here.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.800]   This is another example of re-reached plateau 516 pixels per inch.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.760]   Well, as you like to say, Leo, we're in the tail fin era of smartphones.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.760]   Tail fins.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.240]   You don't need more than three...
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.160]   I don't think you could see more than 300 dots per inch.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.960]   Probably don't need more than 250.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.960]   516...
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.440]   I'm still fine with it.
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.960]   It is a little bigger, isn't it though, than the last note?
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.960]   It's 6.4 inches across.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:14.960]   Oh, did you see?
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.960]   Super AMOLED.
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.600]   Let me see if I can get that animation.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.600]   No, not.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.600]   Because it shows you...
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:22.400]   When you look at the Samsung page, it shows you the difference.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:23.520]   Let me refresh the page.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:29.520]   So you can all see what a big difference 6.3 is to 6.4 as this page takes forever to
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.520]   load.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.520]   All right, watch.
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.520]   Here we go.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.520]   As I scroll up...
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.320]   Oh, man, it's still loading.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.320]   Okay.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.320]   You know, I apologize.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.920]   It's clearly not running on a note 9.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.840]   We only have 10 gigabit internet here.
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.880]   It's just not able to keep up with this page.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.480]   Maybe it's flash.
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.480]   Let's see.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.480]   S-pin.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.480]   Isn't this...
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:55.360]   They have the little as tiny as little bump as it gets slightly bigger.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.360]   Let's tiny...
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.360]   Look at this.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.360]   It's still loading.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.360]   A vast canvas.
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.360]   How much bigger?
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:05.160]   That was like a quarter of an inch.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.160]   That's bigger.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.160]   6.4.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.840]   It's actually a tenth of an inch.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:10.840]   Bigger.
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.000]   Diagonally.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.880]   What is a lot bigger, 700 milliamp hours bigger is the battery.
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:18.880]   That's true.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:19.880]   It's a 4000 milliamp hour battery.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:20.880]   4000 milliamps.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.880]   One of the biggest mainstream Android phones.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.360]   Only Huawei has reached that.
[00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.480]   Yeah, but they're not here in the US, so...
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.480]   But that raises the question.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.480]   It's really interesting.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.440]   It was only two notes ago that they had the exploding note.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.440]   It was only the note...
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.840]   You're not the first person to say that this week.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.720]   A lot of people have noted.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:39.720]   Big battery.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.720]   They skipped the note 7.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.200]   That's why they had to add the extra tenth of an inch.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.760]   So you had a capacity for more battery.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:45.760]   It is a bigger battery.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.360]   It's for the water cooling.
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.200]   Well, this is the interesting thing.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.200]   They have water cooling.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.200]   They do now.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:54.000]   So they're like a little pump in there that circulates the...
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   How does that work?
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   Does it just pass it?
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   You put lights in it.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.160]   It's not quite like that, but they did show this little panel, I don't know if it's vapor,
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.920]   water cooling or something.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:04.920]   But there is...
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.920]   Wow.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:06.920]   Vapors come out of it.
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.920]   I do think that a bigger battery...
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.920]   I mean...
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:11.920]   Get out of the plane.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.920]   What's interesting is that I think this is one of the things...
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.880]   That's why they had to keep the headphone jack so they could have a vent.
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.880]   Yes, exactly.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.360]   It's actually a vent.
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:25.000]   People do want more battery life.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   They do.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   It's the biggest thing.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.360]   I'm charging my phone right behind me right now on a battery pack because this little
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.760]   pixel you use when making it all day.
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.760]   Because you're millennial.
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:35.960]   That's what millennials do.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.120]   They plug in their phone wherever they get.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.120]   I mean, I use mine for Android Auto.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.120]   Oh, all right.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.960]   So, I need my dash when I get home.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:48.120]   I would buy this for the 4,000 milliamp hour battery because I presume that's going to be
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:50.800]   like more than a day, right?
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.800]   We don't know.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.800]   That's all...
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.000]   You get almost 6 and 1/2 inches of screen there.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Super AMOLED 2K display.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   I hear that.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   And these are typically brighter than the pixel phones.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   They always have brighter...
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   So you're saying it needs 6 to 8 gigabytes of RAM to not hurt you?
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   You're playing Fortnite all day because it comes with your phone.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   So, that should be good for what, about 20 minutes?
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   Yes.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   TechCrunch said that they were getting 22 hours.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Really?
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   That's not bad.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   18 is my mill's mode.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Just put it down, put it face down.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   No, no, no, they actually stand by mode.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   It was great.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   It's a good one in heavy use.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   It also has a headphone jack, which to me is...
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   I know it sounds old fashioned, but that seems to be something you ought to have in a phone.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Especially one that big.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   There's some tablets now that don't come with headphone jacks in the other world.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   I bet you the next iPad won't have a headphone jack.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Oh, yeah, definitely.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   That is, that is.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   And Google followed with a pixel which baffles me.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Apple's excuse me is, oh, there's just not enough room in the phone.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Dad, Google.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   We had to give up a little space.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   It's not coming back.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   And...
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   It just comes back.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Yeah, the Pixel 3 will not have a headphone jack.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Well, Pixel 4, I'm looking at you because...
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   That's not a Pixel 4.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   I don't want you to get where it goes.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   No, no, but for the Pixel 4.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   What is it?
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   This is the Pixel 2.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Pixel.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   But I go running in the rain and now I can't charge unless I turn the thing the right way.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Oh, yeah, I love it when I'm on Android Auto and it's dying, but I still want to listen to music and I can't.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Give us a headphone jack and battery.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   I think that you could say that Apple's lying when it says we need the space because Samsung,
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   even on the smaller S9, has found the space for all this stuff and the headphone jack.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   They've got Face ID and it's actually...
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   The iPad.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   I mean, seriously, if you don't have space for iPhone jack, they're going to take it out of the iPad.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   They didn't take it out of the new MacBooks.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   I don't think they're going to take it out of the iPad.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   I hope not.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   They're taking them out of Android tablets, so that's why.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Are they?
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   It's the latest Huawei tablet that I was looking at, doesn't have one.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   I have to use a special adapter to listen with my headphones.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Does anybody think Bluetooth headphones are better or even as good as wired headphones?
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   I either convene in because you're not getting tangled in them, but I prefer having a wire.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   I do.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Yeah, I don't want a Type C headphone or a lightning headphone.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   That's not a solution.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   No.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   There is an existing solution called a headphone jack.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   It works.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   It's worked for many decades.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   I just sound like an old man.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Is there anything else to talk about with this new Note 9?
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   Do you think it's going to be a good selling?
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   This is a really popular line of phones, not to mention that this is totally a variable
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   workhorse.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   People who want this phone want it because it does everything.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Even students love this phone because it's just so versatile.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Samsung's claiming a 53% faster CPU in the 845.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   That's a significant jump.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   By the way, Sam, this thing here, this orange thing, that's whatever the water cooling is.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   Oh.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   So we have to find a phone, take it apart after spending time on the phone.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   I'm sure I fix it as a tear down.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   I'm sure they do.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   Are these out yet?
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   They're out at the end of this month.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   Okay.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   So you could pre-order now.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   Which one did you pre-order?
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   I didn't pre-order.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   I'm just going to...
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   Jason pre-order.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Which one did he pre-order?
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Because I'm paying for it, which means he probably ordered the expensive one.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   They have an exclusive on Fortnite, not forever, not even for a month.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   I think a few days, right?
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   It's in the Galaxy App Store, so it's for all Galaxy phones.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Right.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   Eventually we'll make it to the Play Store.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   No.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   No.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   No.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   Epic has said they have no additional...
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Well, that's right.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Epic's going to sideload it.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   Which is really a bad idea.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   I know.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   Because Google's going to take too much money.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Within a couple hours after they release it, you know there will be versions all over the web.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Oh, it's already all over.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   It's already--
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   It's already flying.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   It's already flying.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Love with fake versions of Fortnite.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   So if you're going to get it, kids, go to the epic site and you still--
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Or just don't get it.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   No, you're never going to get it.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   Really?
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   Is that the way to protest this?
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   No.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Don't sideload.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Absolutely.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   So you can do it.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   I mean, I sideload from apps like Humble Bundle, but I'm supporting Humble Bundle, which--
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   sideload responsibly.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Yeah, it precisely.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   That should be a t-shirt.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   I think that goes with the help.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   So you go to security and location and you have to go to advanced.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Where do you-- I can't even find it.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   There's a place.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   I'm sure Fortnite can tell you.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   Is it still under security?
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   It should be--
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   Yeah, it should be--
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   It's a developer option, I hope not.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   But you have to turn off--
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   I'm looking at Android Pie and I think--
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   But the nice thing is, at least in recent versions of Android, at least on the Google
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   devices, every time you do that, every time you enable sideloading, after you load the
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   app, it reverts back to being locked against.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   Smart.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   So you have to do it every time.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   I agree.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   That's a good thing.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   But still, if you download something that's loaded with malware and you sideload it, you're
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   still going to be in trouble.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   I also just upgraded to me today.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   It's all hidden.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   So now I'm trying to remember--
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   All the people who are doing nudges and dark patterns are like, "You can't find the
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   sideload mode."
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Yeah, I don't remember where it was.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.300]   I honor Google and Android for doing it because unlike the iPhone, you can at least have the
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:22.000]   option of getting software from third parties, not Google.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   But if you want to participate in the community and test beta software and things like that,
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   it's great for that.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   Sure.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   And I've used it for a lot of stuff over the years.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Epic clearly just doesn't want to pay the 30% to Google.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   They do not want to give that 30% up to Google.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.600]   I think their CEO said in some interviews that he didn't want to pay the 30%.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:49.320]   I think you guys were talking-- you and Andy were talking about it on material that I
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.640]   guess the cost of developing for Android is so much more than they don't want to pay
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.640]   it.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:55.640]   Well, because they've got a--
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:57.120]   Do you know how much they make on the Apple store?
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.120]   I know.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.120]   But they've--
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.120]   By the way, this is his argument.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.120]   This is a free program.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.120]   Because you have so much--
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:07.960]   People are buying dance moves and skins, and they're spending $150 million a day on the
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:08.960]   iOS store.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.440]   People are buying dance moves and skins.
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.200]   For $150 million a day.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.760]   That means Apple's getting $50 million.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.960]   But it's not like Epic's $100 million a day.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.800]   I mean, come on, that's plenty.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.800]   I'm not arguing.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.800]   I'm just telling you what Sweeney's saying is that it costs them more because they've
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:25.800]   got to support all these different kinds of--
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.440]   Yeah, but you're risking your users' safety.
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.440]   Absolutely.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.440]   I totally agree.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:35.160]   Of course, it's because Samsung has put a big chunk of change in their bank account.
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:37.240]   I would be sure that they did.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:41.040]   Yeah, well, Samsung surely is not taking a cut of what of the virtual--
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:45.080]   No, they're probably paying Epic to have the exclusive.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.840]   They used to give away a lot of free stuff.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.480]   A couple of phone launches ago.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.080]   Show of hands, chatroom.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:55.240]   How many of you will buy a Note 9 just because you can get Fortnite on it?
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.240]   Nobody.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.240]   Nobody.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.760]   He's going to buy a Note 9.
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:03.040]   A $1,000 phone because they get a three-day exclusive--
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:04.440]   There's a lot of fans out there.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.440]   It's a lot of big fans.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:09.160]   I wouldn't pay $1,000 for a phone anyway, regardless of whether it could pay for that.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.160]   Yeah, me either.
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.160]   That's way too much.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.400]   For a loaded pixel, I would pay $1,000.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.400]   Would you?
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.400]   Yeah, I might too.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.400]   But--
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.400]   I mean, I guess I would, but I'd be happy about it.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.400]   I did pay it for a while.
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.400]   It's a blast for a while.
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.480]   It might take me a while to pay it off, but you know, it's being real.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:28.720]   Clearly, Samsung's looking at Apple and saying, well, people spend $1,000 on an iPhone
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:30.720]   10, they must be willing to do it too.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.720]   We're going to do it too.
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:32.720]   Give us $1,000.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:37.160]   Can I just say, companies stop looking at Apple, period?
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.640]   Do you have a thing?
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.720]   Google's new phone's going to have a notch.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.480]   Stop looking at Apple, period.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.000]   At least Samsung has the cahontas.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.040]   I would rather have a slim bezel at the top and no notch.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:53.440]   The Google notch is because of the-- I would say it's because of the rest of the Android
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.200]   industry because everybody--
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.200]   A bunch of OEMs started putting notches on their phone.
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.200]   The Google is supposed to be showing the way, not following the rest of the industry.
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:04.440]   Yeah, but when you have Chinese OEMs, we're putting out Android with a bunch of notches.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.440]   What the--
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.440]   Let them put a notch in there.
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.440]   Sometimes you have--
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.440]   Do it the way you think is right.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.400]   You're saying it shouldn't be on the pixel?
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.280]   I am saying it shouldn't be on any phone.
[00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:17.560]   The only question in my mind is there a technical requirement to have to have a notch.
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:18.560]   No.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.800]   Apple put the notch here because they have three different sensors up there and they
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:26.640]   wanted to make room for them without shrinking the screen.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.640]   But you only get the ears.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:33.120]   But if you look at the total area, usable area of the screen, if you put a slim bezel
[00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:37.200]   at the top, instead of going right to the edge, if you put a slim bezel, you could fit
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:43.200]   those sensors in there within a slim bezel area and then have-- just have-- nice clean
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.200]   rectangle.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.840]   No notch.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:49.840]   And no nonsense for developers working around a notch and all this other stuff.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.360]   What's the limit you'd pay for a smartphone?
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.360]   Well--
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.360]   Let's say-- let's assume you're going to get two years out of it.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.960]   So you're amortizing that cost over two years.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.680]   $500 a year, $1,000 a year.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.480]   Would you go that high?
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.480]   No.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:08.920]   How much do you pay for your laptop?
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:13.360]   Well, Google was very nice to let me borrow this one.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.480]   Now that's a pixel book, which is really nice.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.480]   It starts at $800.
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.440]   Would you get an $800 pixel book?
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.120]   Yes, I would now that I've used this.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.120]   And I see--
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.600]   That's less than a smartphone, actually.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.600]   It's less than--
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.600]   Yes, but I use this for everything.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.600]   This is my work.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:26.600]   I file my work on this.
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.600]   This makes money for me.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.080]   A lot of people that note nine is their work.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.240]   Is their computer, right?
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.640]   That's very also very true.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.600]   Like my father, who was a contractor for a very long time, his phone was his work.
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.120]   That's how he got his work and ran his business.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.000]   OK, there's another question.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:46.520]   Do you need a tablet or a laptop or a desktop if you've got a note nine?
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.000]   These keyboards are awfully nice.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   I like these keyboards.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   I love having these keyboards.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   Yeah, it's the somebody who gets paid for the stuff I write.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.240]   I want a real keyboard.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.760]   If you're a writer, that's obviously because that's your tool.
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.520]   I don't write.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.920]   I write, I edit photos, I put together graphics.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:04.920]   I do the--
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.920]   I put the right demographic for this question.
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:08.920]   You're all writers.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.520]   I think there's a lot of people that can get by--
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.520]   Right.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.560]   --with a tablet or even a high end phone.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.520]   But I think probably for all of us at this table, we couldn't do that.
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:21.520]   Six kinds.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.520]   You wouldn't want to.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.440]   Six kinds of authentication on the note nine.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:30.000]   Irish scan, which actually the note-- the S9 does pretty well.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.040]   Pattern recognition, which is, of course, not the first choice anybody should have drawing
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.520]   that little pattern.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.520]   You're looking at me like you do that, Matt.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.400]   I like fingerprint first, but I fall back on a pattern.
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.720]   I also fall back on a pattern.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.080]   But before there was fingerprint, I used a pattern.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:46.320]   But we know it's not very secure.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:50.400]   Devorex was always trying to get into my phone, but looking where the grease was.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.400]   On the phone.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.800]   You need to get grease all over it.
[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:54.800]   Nobody can tell.
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.200]   If you use your phone enough, there's so much grease.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.400]   Nobody wants to even touch it.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.840]   I think actually that did stymie him.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.160]   Face recognition.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.960]   It's not as good as apples, but it's fast.
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:06.960]   It's pretty fast.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.960]   Yeah, it is.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.720]   Fingerprint, which everybody I think thinks is the best way Apple is.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:15.560]   Yes, but this phone is so big and the fingerprint on this is so high up.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.120]   They put it better.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.560]   They put it instead of next to the camera.
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.920]   Let me see if I can find a back of the screen.
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.240]   This phone is just so big.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.240]   I'm just imagining me.
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.400]   It still seems like it would be a long reach.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.840]   Yeah, you get little hands.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:33.520]   I've got a Pixel XL and a Sam right now.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.480]   My hands are not that big.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.480]   I can just reach the sensor on my Pixel XL.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.960]   That's only a five and a half.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:45.960]   The graphics are very important part for me, especially because I use Android Auto, because
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:48.280]   I touch it to turn on the display.
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:51.480]   So when your phone is in the dock and the fingerprint is in the back, that's not an
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.080]   ideal position for it, is it?
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.400]   Can you get to it?
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:28:00.520]   Oh, no, I put the phone like this, and then this part sticks out, a little fingerprint,
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.440]   and then I just go.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:09.840]   You can also, when I'm driving cars that don't have Android Auto support, I use the smart
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.240]   lock and use Bluetooth when it's connected to the device.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.240]   Yes, Bluetooth is in the car.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.240]   It keeps the phone on line.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.240]   That's good.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:17.440]   And then you have password and pin.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:23.360]   And of course, if you really want to be secure, you want to use a long, strong password, because
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:29.520]   that, at least for now, the courts say, cannot be extracted from you by border patrol or
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.400]   somebody if you want to keep your phone private.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.400]   Interesting feature.
[00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:34.400]   Not officially.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.400]   Android Pie.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:36.400]   Yeah, not officially.
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.400]   They could still stay.
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.920]   You're going to stay at the airport jail for a little while.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.000]   Nobody wants to be an airport jail.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.160]   Is this Android Pie or Oreo?
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.160]   It's Oreo, isn't it?
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.160]   I think it's Oreo.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.160]   It's Oreo.
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.160]   It's last.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.160]   What?
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.160]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.560]   This is, I think this is Android Pie.
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.160]   This is actually, that's a great.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.080]   I doubt it because I doubt it.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.080]   I think it's Oreo.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:00.600]   Samsung has never released a phone with the latest version.
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.080]   Actually, yeah, I think it's coming with Oreo.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.640]   And you know why you don't know because Samsung doesn't say.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.800]   Samsung doesn't even like the A word.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.200]   It's got the Samsung experience.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.200]   It's not.
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.440]   There's no A word.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.440]   What A what?
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.440]   And Hoid?
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:13.440]   What?
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.600]   What are you talking about?
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.600]   I think it's Oreo.
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:22.360]   Let me show you a nice feature though of Pie, which I really like that is designed for this
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.120]   scenario where you have a fingerprint.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.240]   I can unlock my phone with my fingerprint.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.920]   But let's say I'm getting off an airplane and I don't want border patrol.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.280]   There's a new feature called Lockdown.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:36.200]   So I pressed and hold the, you have to turn this on, but I press and held the on/off button.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:40.280]   And now when I press Lockdown before I get off the airplane, not only is it locked the
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:43.560]   phone, but the fingerprint reader doesn't unlock it.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:45.120]   Face recognition doesn't unlock it.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.720]   The only thing that unlocks it is your long strong password.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.720]   Oh, that's going to be great for runs.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.720]   Right.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.720]   If you lose your phone, whatever.
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.720]   Well, just I did not know that was there.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.720]   It's turned on in your pocket.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:57.520]   You found security setting.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.640]   Well, that's the other thing I like about recent versions of last couple versions of Android
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:03.600]   is they have the search in settings.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.600]   Right.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.600]   So I just search for Lockdown.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.600]   You'll find it.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.240]   It is off by default, but I think that is a nice feature.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.240]   That's fantastic.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.480]   I've been one like often when you go for a run, the phone will turn on in your pocket and
[00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:16.000]   then you have like a bunch of purple pictures.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.680]   And then you start to feel the heat in your little little backpack and you're like, why
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:20.680]   is this burning?
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:22.600]   Oh, my phone display is on.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.600]   Or your flashlight.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.600]   You know what?
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.600]   Yes.
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.080]   I've been really wondering why I have so many purple pictures.
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:29.160]   Now I think I know.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:32.640]   You just install the purple picture eater app.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.320]   Hot dog or not?
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.320]   Purple picture or not?
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.320]   That's what we need.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.320]   I could write that.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.320]   I could write that.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.800]   I'm very proud of myself.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.840]   I wrote a Sudoku solver in racket this week.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.920]   It only took me two weeks.
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.720]   Well, it's part of this class I took.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:49.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.720]   I don't know why I'm mentioning it.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:54.400]   I'm very, I feel like I'm telling you, man, it feels good to do things.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.400]   It does feel good to do things.
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:57.560]   Yeah, to be learning new stuff all the time.
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.520]   It makes me feel a bit about myself.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:00.520]   When you enter, you can enter in it.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:05.760]   I have to do now the UI so that you can enter it in a nice way instead of typing all
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:07.960]   the numbers, but you can enter in a Sudoku puzzle.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:11.160]   I even did the hardest Sudoku puzzle out there.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:15.880]   So a normal hard one, it takes a second, but the hardest one out there I found on the
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:19.640]   Sudoku Wiki took 25 minutes, but it solved it.
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.640]   Wow.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.200]   So the machine took 25 minutes to solve it.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.200]   Is that on?
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.200]   I'm at pro.
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.200]   On an I'm at pro.
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.200]   Interesting.
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.200]   It got really hot.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.200]   I can't mind a Bitcoin.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.200]   Yeah, especially in this summer.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.360]   It's a brute force solver.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:38.840]   So the way it's the way that you understand everything.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:43.320]   But literally the way it does it builds a tree of all the possible solutions.
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:47.680]   Now it's smart enough to eliminate invalid positions right away.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.000]   So you don't have to build if you get an invalid position, you're not going to build
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   the tree that.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   That's pretty good.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   That's pretty good.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.200]   It's a little smart.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.400]   So it, you know, it looks at the position.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.160]   It comes up with nine next positions, eliminates the invalid ones.
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.600]   Then for each of those nine comes up with nine.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:07.680]   So on this, on a normal puzzle, it pretty much goes through that tree fast, but on a
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.680]   hard puzzle.
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:13.600]   It's like tens of millions of positions still faster than us.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.600]   It was the hardest.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:20.200]   It was literally say they said the hardest to local puzzle ever designed.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.600]   I'm just proud of it.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.600]   Good job, Leo.
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.600]   I use no way.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.800]   I don't even I don't even have any.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:26.800]   No way.
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:27.800]   That's like that's.
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:28.800]   Is that allowed anymore?
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:30.720]   I'm going to ask Matt cuts.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.520]   You're here in studio with us.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:36.160]   Finally somebody who can legitimately answer this question because you see the phrase
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.160]   AI.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.160]   It's like blockchain now.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:41.200]   It's applied as a marketing term to everything.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.640]   Everything has artificial intelligence.
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:49.520]   And I think as an antidote to that, we need a real definition so that we know if something
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.040]   really does have artificial intelligence.
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:57.040]   And I think a lot of things are just it's just like that's a doku solver looks intelligent,
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.960]   but it's just a computer program.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:02.880]   That's not clearly not a that's only a very broad definition.
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.360]   We should mention Matt work for Google.
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:08.120]   One of the early employees who worked at Google for years knows a lot about this stuff.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.880]   What makes something AI?
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:10.880]   Oh man.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:15.840]   You know, AI is such a laden term that they didn't teach it when I went to grad school
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:19.400]   because at the time they were like artificial intelligence is a complete waste of time.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.960]   You go into grad school in the winter, the A.I.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:22.960]   Winter.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:26.480]   And we were all excited about A.I. back in the 60s.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.480]   Right.
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.520]   When everybody thought all computers are going to be smart, we've got lists now everything
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.520]   will be.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.560]   And it turned out it was really hard.
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:34.560]   And so there was an A.I.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:35.920]   Winter and that's when you were in school.
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.960]   And so it's interesting a lot of people have rebranded it as machine learning.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.640]   They're like Google prefers that.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.600]   Yeah, they're like we don't want to have the baggage of AI.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.120]   And you know, machine learning is you know, define machine learning.
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:50.080]   Well, maybe you have a data set and then you're able to extrapolate into new situations.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:53.800]   And so maybe it takes a lot of time to train, but when you're done, you can do a human-like
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:56.560]   task that you would not expect a computer to be able to do.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:01.800]   I kind of characterize it that no human told it how to do it.
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:07.280]   But the computer in effect wrote its own program, figured out up to a point.
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:12.920]   There has to be human involvement in setting up the initial model and human involvement
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:13.920]   in tuning it.
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:17.400]   I've spent a lot of time in the last couple of years talking with a lot of people working
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.600]   on autonomous vehicles.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.000]   And there's a lot of especially deep neural nets.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.840]   And there's a lot of different flavors of machine learning.
[00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:30.120]   And the one that's most commonly used for things like object recognition are deep neural
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.200]   nets.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:36.320]   And the thing that has made it practical that you couldn't have done this 20 or 30 years
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:44.040]   ago is these highly parallelized GPUs, where you've got hundreds of cores running in parallel,
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.680]   tackling the problem.
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:49.640]   And you know, the power, and in fact, it's funny, I was just working on a column the
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.640]   other day.
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:56.280]   And I was talking to Brian Silesky, who's the CEO of Argo AI.
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:01.560]   And he led the software side of the team that won the DARPA Urban Challenge in 2008 from
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.560]   Carnegie Mellon.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.800]   Back in those days, it was a self-driving vehicle, autonomous vehicle challenge.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:06.800]   Yes.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.800]   Yes.
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.800]   Yes.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:13.800]   And so, you know, I asked them, you know, what was the computing power of the system that
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.800]   they had in there?
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.680]   And this was a Chevy Tahoe that had a rack of servers in the back.
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:22.360]   And you remember the early days of the ARPA grand challenge, where the car would go 10
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.920]   feet and drive off the road.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.120]   And I would just fall over immediately.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.920]   So they had, it's a hard thing.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:33.500]   So they had, they had 10 blade computers in there with each one with a 2.1 gigahertz
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.320]   core 2 duo in there.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.360]   And I was looking up some benchmarks on that chip.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.200]   It was about 180 MIPS on the wet stone.
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:43.840]   So 180 million instructions per second for each of them, for each of them.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:48.080]   So roughly, you know, depending on what you were doing, how it was configured.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.280]   One, no, 1.8 billion instructions.
[00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.280]   Oh, giga flops.
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.280]   Yeah.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:36:00.880]   So today, Nvidia, their latest chip that they're shipping to customers now for automated
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.240]   driving tasks is called Xavier.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.240]   It does 30 teraflops.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.720]   Oh, it's a huge difference.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.000]   The next generation one, but they just started sampling.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.920]   So it's 30,000, we're 15,000 better than that old system.
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:19.120]   The next one that they just started shipping samples about a month and a half ago, it's
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.920]   called Drive Pegasus.
[00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:23.120]   It's 320 teraflops.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.120]   Wow.
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:26.320]   And a board about the size of the laptop.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.320]   Wow.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.720]   You could probably cook an egg on it.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:29.720]   Right.
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:30.800]   Yeah, it's about 400 lots.
[00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:31.800]   So that's drive that.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:32.800]   So it's really processing.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.200]   Well, it's also a big memory, right?
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.320]   Because you have big data sets that you need to analyze.
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.320]   Yeah.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.360]   Well, and there's also a distinction, at least in machine learning, about supervised versus
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.600]   unsupervised data.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:45.000]   So supervised is stuff that has been labeled so that you can learn.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.280]   Oh, here are all the cats.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:49.960]   Whereas unsupervised is just you sort of let it free on YouTube or wherever.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:55.440]   So that's the example, the difference between deep blue, which learned to become the best
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.760]   chess playing computer in the world by in a supervised form.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.800]   They gave it games.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:06.280]   And AlphaGo, which was the Google intelligence that learned to play Go by playing itself.
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.280]   Right.
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.440]   Well, and that's the perfect example because there's one called AlphaGo Zero.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.480]   That's another generation that basically didn't have anything.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.480]   They didn't tell anything.
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.480]   It's the way.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:16.480]   That's right.
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.120]   You're just like, boom, go to town and see what you figure out.
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.360]   Just playing better than any human alive.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.680]   It is and better than the previous versions of AlphaGo.
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:23.760]   And Go is very hard.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.400]   Go is a pattern recognition problem.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:31.240]   There's extremely, if you think Sudoku's solving is hard, Go is really hard.
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.840]   And so that's very impressive that.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:37.600]   So I would definitely say that's not merely machine learning.
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.760]   That's artificial intelligence.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:39.760]   Yes.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:40.760]   If something can play.
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.760]   It's still a constrained problem set though.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.920]   Well, of course, it's not general artificial intelligence.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.080]   So that's the next step up.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:53.800]   So there's domain specific artificial intelligence like AlphaGo Zero, which is learning a very
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:38:01.000]   limited problem versus how far off is general AI.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.040]   That is long way off.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.040]   It's kind of like fusion.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:06.360]   It's always been 20 years down the road.
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:13.120]   Of course, in 2008, when they were doing the DARPA grand challenge, did they probably,
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.400]   I doubt they anticipated anything they could do.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.400]   What did you say?
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.400]   They anticipated that in 10 years.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:25.920]   Well, and whether something is considered artificial intelligence or machine learning,
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:31.280]   the fact is now you can have best in class speech recognition, amazing speech synthesis
[00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.920]   where people can't tell whether it's a human or not.
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.600]   Like recognition tasks that are pretty phenomenal.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:42.280]   Like things you would not have considered doable 10 years ago are in the realm of possibility
[00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:43.280]   now.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:48.280]   So I ended up yesterday, I was reading an article, I think it was from the New York Times about
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:51.560]   or maybe it's the Wall Street Journal about Watson.
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:56.280]   You remember back in 2011, IBM announced that they were going to use Watson for oncology
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.280]   for cancer research?
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.280]   Everything, yeah.
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:02.800]   Well, they spent six years and spent billions of dollars on this.
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.040]   And it's been a total flop.
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.080]   There's been no improvement in outcomes for the patients.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:10.640]   It's fact-it misdiagnosed a number of situations that could have killed a real patient.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:11.640]   Yeah.
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:15.240]   I hope they had a real oncologist doing the work as well.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:16.440]   But yeah, isn't it?
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.440]   It's hard, isn't it?
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.440]   It's hard.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:19.440]   It's super hard.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.240]   And not everybody always knows the principled way to make things better.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:26.600]   Like you can think about how are you going to design a machine learning algorithm to play
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.600]   a video game.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.240]   But some of that is heuristic, some of that is hacks.
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:33.520]   To do it from first principles is really difficult.
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.520]   Very difficult.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:35.520]   And self-driving cars, that's very difficult.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.520]   Yeah.
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:42.040]   The stuff is still as much progress as we've made on it in the last 10 years.
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:48.120]   These systems are still actually pretty brittle in terms of being able to try and understand
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.240]   things that they've never seen before.
[00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:54.800]   They still have a hard time with that to go beyond what they've been trained on.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:58.960]   And when you're talking about automated driving systems, out in the real world and driving,
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:03.400]   you encounter stuff that you've never seen before all the time.
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.080]   And those are the ones that cause the accidents.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.360]   We're going to take a break when we come back there.
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:12.200]   We're a couple of other things Samsung announced at their note nine event, a new watch and
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.640]   a new Bixby home assistant.
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.480]   I mean, I mean, the Cauldron.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.480]   Yes.
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.480]   Cauldron.
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:24.480]   But before we do that, let's talk about our sponsor, Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:30.400]   Rocket Mortgage is the best, simplest, fastest way to apply for a mortgage.
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:34.440]   And Sam, I hope you don't, Mom, and I'm going to mention what you told me before the show,
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:37.520]   because you were going to, you were, you just bought a house, right?
[00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:42.080]   Yeah, last year we bought a house and to give you an idea of how simple it was, I was
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.080]   out of town and business.
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:47.880]   My wife called me and said, Hey, can you check and see what would the payments be on this?
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.920]   And so I was just going into check.
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:54.640]   And like within five minutes, I had what the payment would be, you know, before I even
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.880]   had a chance to put in the Twit promo code.
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:57.880]   Okay.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:01.640]   So kids, you know, I had, I was already had a more, I was looking at a mortgage approval
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:02.640]   letter.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.640]   Isn't that awesome?
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:07.180]   So Rocket Mortgage, not only fast, it is the best way to buy a home.
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:10.640]   One of the things that's challenging about home purchase, it's probably the largest purchase
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:11.960]   you'll ever make.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.920]   You're writing a massive check and it's scary.
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:20.880]   It's anxiety and just basically in the, in the, in the nature of it, it's an anxious process.
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:24.200]   But now that interest rates are starting to go up, it's even more anxious because now
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:28.160]   there's pressure to get it done fast before rates go up even more.
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:31.680]   So the folks at Quicken Loans have come up with a really good solution.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.360]   They call it the power buying process.
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.600]   And this is what Sam was talking about.
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:42.280]   You go to rocketmortgage.com/twit2, rocketmortgage.com/twit and the number two and you get the account
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:43.280]   set up.
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.280]   And this is very quick.
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:51.200]   The, the initial pre-qualification takes maybe 10 minutes at most.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.720]   It's called pre-qualified approval.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.480]   What you do is you answer a few simple questions.
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.480]   You don't have to get paperwork.
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:42:01.640]   You don't have to find out what your bank statements were from 2018 or 2012 or 23 or
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:02.640]   whatever.
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.160]   You just go to the website, answer a couple of questions.
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:08.200]   They have trusted relationships with all the financial institutions.
[00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:12.600]   Once you give them permission, they get the information they need to verify your income,
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.600]   your assets and credit.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.760]   They give you pre-qualified approval.
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.320]   That's within a few minutes.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:22.840]   The next step is a loan officer comes in, reviews it and gives you within 24 hours verified
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:23.840]   approval.
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:28.160]   Now you've got a letter in your hand that is essentially saying they've got the loan.
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.360]   That gives you the strength of a cash buyer.
[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:34.400]   This is important when you're buying a house, when the seller sees your offer, if you've
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:38.800]   got this verified approval, the seller treats you like a cash buyer.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.440]   Put you right at the front of the line.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:43.000]   If somebody else is saying, "Well, I'm going to get the loan.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.600]   I pre-approved," they're going to still say, "Oh no, that's fine, but I don't want any
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:49.600]   contingencies.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.040]   I want the verified approval guy."
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:56.200]   Then, then once you're verified, you get the next step, which is called rate shield approval.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.600]   And this is the thing that really takes the anxiety out of it.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.600]   They lock your rate up.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.080]   They're up to three months while you shop.
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.600]   It cannot go up.
[00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:06.080]   I don't care if the rates in the real world go up.
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:07.080]   Yours won't.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:10.000]   If the real world rates go down, your rate will go down.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   But they cannot go up.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   You win either way.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:17.040]   This is exactly what you'd expect from a customer-focused company, America's largest
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.400]   mortgage lender for a reason.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:22.800]   The best number one in customer satisfaction, eight years in a row, according to JD Power,
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.000]   quick and loans and rocket mortgage.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.040]   It's easy to get started.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:32.440]   Sam, if you just go to rocketmortgage.com/twit2, it doesn't matter if you use anything else.
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:33.640]   They'll know you saw it here.
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:35.040]   That's all it matters.
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.040]   Rocketmortgage.com/twit2.
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.140]   Now some legalese.
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:41.560]   Rate shield approvals only valid on certain 30-year purchase transactions.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:44.320]   Additional conditions or exclusions may apply.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:48.920]   Based on quick and loans data in comparison to public data records, equal housing lender.
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.120]   That one's pretty important.
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:54.520]   Licensed in all 50 states and MLSconsumeraccess.org number 30.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.480]   Here's what you need to remember.
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.480]   Here's what you need to do.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:04.000]   Go to rocketmortgage.com/twit2 and begin the process and get the anxiety out of home
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   buying.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   Make it actually fun.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   Did you get a nice house?
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   We did.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   We got a great house.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   See?
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   1957, mid-century modern.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.240]   That's the fun of it.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:13.240]   Once it's fun.
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:15.880]   And it cost a tiny fraction of what a comparable house in around this area would be.
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:17.040]   Oh, where'd you buy?
[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.040]   In Michigan.
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.040]   Oh.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.880]   Well, 2,100 square feet, 220 grand.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:22.880]   Michigan's beautiful.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:23.880]   Oh, it is.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:24.880]   Except in the winter.
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:30.520]   At least we don't have fires and earthquakes and mud.
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:33.560]   So I'm again going to call in front of you on the brown coast.
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:34.960]   I was driving up here.
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:38.960]   I did not want to get up at 8 in the morning or whatever it was to watch the Samsung event
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:39.960]   on Tuesday.
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.240]   Thank you and Jason Howell for doing that for me.
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.240]   I did that for you.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:48.080]   I actually think my Samsung Galaxy S3 Frontier watch is a really nice smart watch.
[00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:49.080]   Yes.
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.240]   A lot of people really like the gear watches.
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:51.440]   They're really popular.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:56.320]   I think just from my own eyes, I would think they were a little more popular than the Android
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:57.320]   Wear watches.
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.080]   It's a round face like Android Wear but it's not.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.840]   They're not Android with exactly.
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:02.840]   They're Tizen.
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:03.840]   They have some other apps though.
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:04.840]   Some apps.
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:09.360]   They have apps but they don't have all the apps that an Android Wear watch would have.
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:10.800]   But it does the notifications thing.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.200]   It has a very nice bezel that turns.
[00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:15.760]   Did they keep the bezel control on here?
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:16.760]   I'm not sure.
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.240]   You don't know because we get one.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:25.320]   I was told we had Sheerland Lowe on yesterday from Engadget and I think she said it does.
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.320]   Actually, it's unclear when nobody has it yet.
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:33.400]   They are claiming this is a big difference six-day battery life.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.640]   These watches will now have LTE built in.
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:40.000]   The problem with LTE in a watch is it can't make the watch very bulky.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.920]   Although Apple's series three is smart.
[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:44.760]   Please don't look a little bulky.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:45.760]   Do they?
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:46.760]   Do they?
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:48.760]   Do you get the six days with the LTE or is it six days around?
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:51.000]   Oh, that's a good question.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.160]   So there's two sizes.
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:55.080]   There's a 46 millimeter watch.
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:56.080]   That's the one with six days.
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:57.600]   But that's a big answer.
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:58.600]   That's the one with six days.
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.600]   Of course that's the one with six days.
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:01.960]   That has the room for that.
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:08.200]   42 millimeters which is the size of the large Apple watch is four days on standard usage.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.200]   And you're right.
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.680]   I bet you LTE cuts that down considerably.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:15.840]   The advantage of LTE is if your phone is not nearby you still can see that somebody's
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:16.840]   called.
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.480]   You still can get data, stuff like that.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:22.000]   Does this have one of the new Qualcomm processors that they've got?
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   That's what it's like.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.560]   And don't forget you're going to have to pay for it.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:30.320]   I pay 10 bucks extra a month to see mobile for LTE on my iPhone.
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.160]   That's pretty standard with most carriers.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:34.640]   It's like five to ten dollars for an extra accessory.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:35.840]   Right.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:40.920]   So not a huge bunch of stuff in the new gear.
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:43.120]   They call it the Galaxy Watch now.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:44.120]   Does it have Bixby?
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:46.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:47.720]   OK.
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:54.360]   So in Samsung's defense they have made Bixby a lot more conversational or at least that's
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:47:00.360]   what is being reported is that Bixby is more of the experiential assistant whereas, you
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:07.000]   know, in the past, Bixby was merely designed to automate your phone basically.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   Yes.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   Do stuff for you.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   Do stuff on the phone.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   It's still doing that.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.480]   But now it can do more than that.
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:14.480]   Yes.
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:15.480]   Sure.
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.800]   They have a voice control interface.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:18.800]   Exactly.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:19.800]   It was close to an assistant.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:22.120]   It wasn't like now it actually has some assistant.
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:27.440]   So they incorporated, what was it?
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:31.200]   The guys that originally did Siri, their new company, the Samsung bought Viv.
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.200]   Viv.
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.200]   Yes.
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:34.200]   They went and started Viv and sent some bottom.
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:35.680]   So I guess this is Viv.
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:37.640]   I guess Viv must be now.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:41.080]   Samsung had made contradictory statements about Viv.
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:44.000]   For a while we thought Viv would be a separate product from Bixby.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:51.640]   But it only makes sense to put Bixby do everything that Google Assistant can do plus automate
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:54.680]   the phone.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:58.520]   They have apparently added more conversational features but nobody has it yet.
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:47:59.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.520]   So we don't know yet.
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:01.520]   They also announced.
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:03.480]   With Viv built in?
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:04.920]   Now with Viv.
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:05.920]   Viv-ed.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:06.920]   Viv-ed.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:07.920]   Viv-ed.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.840]   No, please, no.
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:14.440]   They also announced something no one will buy which is the Cauldron.
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:16.080]   We don't know that yet.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:20.440]   The Galaxy Home Speaker with Viv-ed.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:21.960]   The Galaxy Home Cauldron.
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:26.720]   I've just seen a picture over the first time you had seen it before.
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:27.720]   Right.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:28.720]   Oh man.
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:29.720]   It looks like a long way.
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:30.720]   It looks like a long way.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.720]   It looks supposed to compete with the HomePod.
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:34.960]   This is supposed to compete with the HomePod and the Google Home Max.
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:35.960]   Okay.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:36.960]   It's about music.
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:39.760]   It's a Cauldron speaker that also has Viv-ed.
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:41.320]   How big is Spotify?
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.040]   Look, they brought Daniel X on stage.
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:44.920]   Does it have Viv?
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:45.920]   We don't know.
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:46.920]   They're not talking about Viv.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:51.200]   In fact, they're not really talking much about it so we know that it'll be between like two
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:55.560]   and three or three and four hundred dollars which is what about the HomePod.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:56.560]   I'm just...
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:58.200]   Samsung owns Harmon Carden though.
[00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.600]   No, I'm going to start laughing.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:01.120]   Samsung has some speakers.
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.120]   No, yeah.
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:04.120]   There was a friend called Viv.
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:06.560]   They've got a bunch of brands that do some really good audio.
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:10.200]   But then why not just bring something like this out under one of those brands?
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:13.200]   I mean, Samsung owns JBL and Harmon Carden.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.200]   Right.
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:15.200]   Very big brands.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:16.200]   Okay.
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:17.200]   Harmon's got Ravel and JBL.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:21.800]   Yeah, those are the best speakers you can get.
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.680]   I mean, there are many mixing studios.
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:28.120]   But I don't think this is going to be the Galaxy Home Rebel.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.960]   It's supposed to do spatial sound like the HomePod and the Google Home Max.
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:35.920]   It's supposed to adjust to the acoustics in the room.
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:36.920]   It's such a me too.
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:37.920]   We all know it works so very well.
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.000]   It's such a me too product.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.720]   But ultimately people will say, "Well, okay, fine, but I can get Siri in my HomePod and
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:45.920]   I can get Google Assistant in my Google Home Max.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:47.280]   I don't want Bixby.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.040]   What has Bixby ever done for me?
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.200]   Bixby done for me later.
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:52.240]   You know what they're going to do with this product.
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:54.600]   So apparently they're not going to talk more...
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:58.080]   They're not going to talk much about it until November, according to the Verge.
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:01.600]   They said they'll talk more about it in November at their developers conference.
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:06.200]   But I'm betting that they're going to just give this out as a free accessory when you
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:10.960]   buy a Galaxy phone to just immediately put it into your household.
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:13.320]   Kind of like Google did with the Home Mini.
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:15.320]   I'm probably far reaches.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:18.960]   If you look at the Google Store page, you get a free Home Mini.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:19.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:20.960]   I mean, it's not as cheap as the Mini.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:21.960]   I mean, those minis are...
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:22.960]   No.
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:23.960]   It's a race.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:24.960]   It's a race.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:25.960]   But yeah, it is a race.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:30.800]   A race to which, frankly, Samsung is a late entry and Apple is...
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.800]   Extremely, tardy to the party.
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:35.120]   And Apple's falling behind.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:39.160]   It's really, in my opinion, a two-horse race between Amazon and Google.
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:40.160]   I agree.
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:41.160]   As far as the assistance go.
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:43.160]   As far as speakers go.
[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:49.680]   I mean, you've got a lot of capabilities with those two systems between Amazon and
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:50.680]   the Google stuff.
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:56.560]   You've got a lot of capabilities with skills and whatever Google calls there as I forget
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:57.560]   now.
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:02.280]   But the ability to do all kinds of different functionality and tie it into other devices.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:06.640]   You've got a whole developer ecosystem on those two platforms, Amazon and Google.
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:07.640]   And now HomeKit too.
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:09.480]   But then again, Samsung's got smart things.
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:10.480]   So maybe if they integrate that in there.
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:14.960]   They do have smart things, which is a very big part, which is going to also be a very
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:15.960]   big part of this.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:16.960]   A big speed?
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:17.960]   A big push, I would imagine.
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:18.960]   Yes.
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:22.160]   Because everything's got smart things on it.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:26.080]   I mean, you've got security systems and you've got sensors of all sorts that you can hook
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:29.920]   up and you've got all these third party devices that you can hook up.
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:34.320]   I mean, I am actually surprised that this is not a smart home controller with Zigbee
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:35.560]   and Z-Wave built in.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:38.960]   So you could just go ahead and have it be like the universal portal to your house, the
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:39.960]   Samsung portal.
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:40.960]   It's going to be a beautiful.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.200]   They actually said that it wasn't going to be.
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.200]   We don't know exactly.
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:45.200]   Because it may turn out.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.200]   That is what we find out in November, right?
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.440]   Maybe it will open a portal in your house.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:52.000]   It looks like a cold room.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   You know, you reach in and you pull out a doof night.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   It doesn't look something from the video game portal.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   It's magical.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.240]   And it has leg pegs, peg legs.
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:01.240]   Peg legs.
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:02.240]   Peg legs.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:07.200]   I'm starting to think, maybe it's just me, that there's starting to be a backlash against
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:12.520]   these voice enabled assistants, that I was all high on the Echo.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.480]   It's been out for three years now.
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:19.120]   But eventually you kind of get to the end of the line where you go, that's nice, but
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:22.360]   I'm not going to memorize 2,000 tasks.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:23.360]   No.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:24.360]   No one skills.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:25.360]   It's too much work.
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:27.640]   That's why you get the Google Assistant.
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:28.640]   Same problem.
[00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:29.640]   And then you don't need to memorize tasks.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:30.640]   So, too much work.
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:31.880]   So I will, there's one use case.
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:34.560]   I did not use my Google Home for a long time.
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:38.680]   And I found one good one, which is I take my phone and I no longer have it in my bedroom.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:41.280]   I don't use it for my alarm, which is what I used to do.
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:44.680]   So now when I go to bed, I say, "All right, set my alarm for whatever."
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.400]   Do you ask you to play classical music?
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.800]   Because that's how I wake up every morning.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:49.080]   No, how do you change the alarm?
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:53.520]   All you have to say is play classical music, wake me up at whatever.
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:54.520]   Yeah.
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:56.880]   And it'll do it for you based on whatever your default is.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:57.880]   That's nice.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:58.880]   Prote it for everyone else.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:52:59.880]   That is actually something you can't do with the X.
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:01.880]   Is that the sort of thing you can learn about watching KnowHow?
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.440]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:05.960]   Every Thursday at 11 AM here on the Twitter network.
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:07.720]   Me and Bing are ready.
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:10.880]   I guess I should remind people plugging shows that are on my network.
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.160]   I've been plugging that show also on my other podcast.
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:14.160]   Thank you for plugging it.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.160]   I'm very proud of it.
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:16.160]   I'm very proud of it.
[00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:17.160]   Thank you for tuning in.
[00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:18.320]   It is a very good show.
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:22.040]   So you're kind of the IoT expert, thanks to that.
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.040]   Ish.
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:24.040]   Do you feel like you've brought it to the rest of the world?
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.640]   I feel like I'm burned out.
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:28.640]   I don't have any smart stuff other than I have it everywhere.
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:32.520]   But all I ever use it to do is set alarms, set timers, play music.
[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:35.160]   What's the weather maybe?
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:36.160]   And play podcasts.
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:37.160]   I do use it for that.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:40.040]   And I love that because I think that's the best thing that ever happened to podcasts.
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:41.040]   But that's about it.
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:43.040]   I use it for everything.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:44.040]   My whole house is not me.
[00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:45.040]   Do you ask it factual questions?
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:47.040]   You do.
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:48.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:49.280]   If my husband needs help in the kitchen, he'll ask for a quick little recipe check.
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:53.440]   And now that we have the Lenovo smart display, he can actually cook along with the Lenovo
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:58.400]   smart display in the new assistant the way it is integrated there.
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:00.080]   I think you're an outlier.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:02.160]   So, and I agree.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.160]   So last night I had--
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:04.160]   She does this for her job.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.160]   I totally agree.
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:10.920]   Because frankly, when I see, even on KnowHow, people trying to talk to their smart devices,
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:11.920]   it's mostly like an exercise in frustration.
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:14.240]   Leo's watched all the B-roll from KnowHow.
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.400]   It's like so frustrating.
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:17.400]   Of Megan and I.
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:18.400]   Nothing ever works.
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:23.400]   Trying to get stuff to work in the studio, which is why it's not always a live show.
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:24.400]   Yeah, but that's why.
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:26.040]   Yeah, but I don't want you to fool people either.
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:27.680]   If the stuff doesn't work, we don't edit out over.
[00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:29.360]   No, we're very honest about it.
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:31.800]   I think the truth is people know it.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:36.000]   And it's like home automation has also been a big disappointment.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:41.240]   So last night I had my friends over to-- we went to the Apple Festival yesterday in
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:42.240]   Spastful, which was lovely.
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:44.040]   By the way, that's not Macintosh's.
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:45.040]   No, no, no, no.
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:48.320]   It's Gravenstein's apples, which are grown in Spastful.
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:50.320]   And they spent the night last night.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.840]   And I have a Google home in there, of course.
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.720]   I told them how to turn off the lights.
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:58.600]   I said, just say turn off the guest room lights, because that's-- and I heard my friends say
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:00.560]   it no less than seven times last night.
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:01.560]   Like just trying.
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:03.240]   He's like, hey, G, do this.
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.400]   And he was like, I'm sorry.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:05.720]   I can't understand you right now.
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:07.000]   Hey, G, do this.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   And I was just sitting downstairs hearing this.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.880]   And I just felt like the worst post.
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:17.720]   And I told I said, if it makes you uncomfortable, here's the mute button.
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:18.720]   There's no cameras.
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:20.560]   And then I have all of them.
[00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:21.560]   Yeah.
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:23.960]   And then I said, hey, G, turn off the lights.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:25.160]   G did.
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:28.560]   But the Amazon, for reasons I have no-- I don't know why.
[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:30.840]   I just said, I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:33.560]   And you feel like there are--
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:37.440]   it's just-- there are stupid things in your house.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.640]   My friend, I don't know why.
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:43.440]   I had to shut off Alexa last night, my friend, because my friend kept triggering it by accident
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:45.360]   because I'm testing the security system with it built in.
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:46.360]   All the time, I get to--
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:48.680]   And she's like, can you please turn that off?
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:52.560]   Because it kept interrupting our conversation.
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:53.560]   So there's some useful things.
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:57.480]   And I have to say, I am one of the people who uses my Amazon Echoes for shopping.
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:02.320]   I will say, when I'm shaving and I'm out of shaving cream, Amazon buy more shaving cream.
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:06.160]   It's a little bit of a rigmarole, but it's a lot easier than going to this computer and
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:07.160]   doing all that.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:09.120]   And it does eventually buy it.
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:17.240]   It turns out, information had a article based on-- I don't know where it got this information.
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:24.080]   But based on their own leaks, I guess, that only about 2% of the people with devices that
[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:29.080]   use Amazon Echo have made a purchase in 2018.
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:32.760]   This is according to two people, briefly look up at these internal figures.
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:39.560]   The Amazon has sold 50 million devices, so 2% is not shabby.
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:42.520]   But it's not anywhere near the level you would expect.
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:45.280]   Is that a failure for the Amazon Echo?
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:51.680]   Considering that they are probably selling nothing at or near cost, they probably don't
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:55.680]   have a whole lot of margin on those devices, especially for the dots, which are the ones
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:57.640]   that probably have the most volume.
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:03.120]   Yeah, they were probably counting on generating a lot more sales as a result of it.
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:06.840]   I wonder how Google does with its Google shopping, because it actually does--
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:07.840]   You can shop on Google?
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:08.840]   Yes, you can.
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:09.840]   You can set it up to Google.
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:10.840]   That's how it does, right there.
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:11.840]   You can shop on Google.
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:12.840]   But you get Walmart, Target.
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:16.560]   But you get Walmart, Target.
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:18.720]   You need Toilebier from Costco, you can order it.
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:21.960]   But here's the thing, I've never ordered anything through the Google Home.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:22.960]   Because--
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:23.960]   I'm afraid.
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:25.800]   Yeah, I'm so-- I have my ways.
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:27.520]   It's just going to show up somewhere now.
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:29.280]   What if it sends me the wrong brand?
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:30.600]   I'm so brand loyal.
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:31.920]   No, but that's one thing--
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:32.920]   Charmin versus--
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:33.920]   Amazon does.
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:36.640]   It says, well, in your purchase history, you've bought a lot of Charmin.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:39.320]   Would you like me to buy some more of that?
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:42.280]   And then you can say yes or no.
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:44.040]   And you have the Lenovo.
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:46.200]   It'll show you on the screen what your purchases are.
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:47.800]   Which is very helpful.
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:48.800]   I like that visual.
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:49.960]   But how do you set it up?
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:50.960]   I mean, that's the problem.
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:51.960]   Reason I use the Google one.
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:52.960]   Yeah, the phone.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:53.960]   How does it know?
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:55.920]   Does it buy it from Target or Walmart or Walgreens?
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:56.920]   How does it know?
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:57.920]   You set that up.
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:57:58.920]   You tell it.
[00:57:58.920 --> 00:57:59.920]   I had a time.
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:03.680]   It says, if you ask it for something and it goes, oh, I found this here at Target for $4.99.
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:04.680]   Hmm.
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:05.680]   And so--
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:07.600]   Now I want to try this when I get home.
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:09.720]   You know what works without fail?
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:11.960]   Getting up and just flipping the light switch off.
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:12.960]   Buy me a pony.
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:14.960]   100% of the time.
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:17.040]   Never once fails me.
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:18.040]   Oh, no.
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.040]   I said buy me a pony.
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:20.800]   It said, I found this video spider bait.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:22.480]   Buy me a pony on YouTube.
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:23.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.000]   OK, so let's see what else.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.240]   Shop for toilet paper.
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:27.240]   Oh, shop.
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:28.240]   Oh, shop.
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.240]   Oh, OK.
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:34.280]   So here's what I found on Google Express for delivery to my house, which you're not going
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:36.240]   to show on the camera because this is my address.
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:39.160]   But first, do you want a quick run through of how this works?
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:40.160]   Yes.
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:42.160]   Sure.
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:44.160]   [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:45.160]   [END PLAYBACK]
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:46.160]   Great.
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:50.880]   You can buy snacks, beverages, household supplies, and more from stores like Walmart,
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:53.360]   Costco, and Target on Google Express.
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:56.560]   The more you shop, the more personalized your product results will be.
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:57.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:00.360]   Now, most merchants offer free delivery of orders over $35.
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:01.360]   Nice.
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:02.360]   OK.
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:03.360]   When your order qualifies for free delivery, I'll let you know.
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:05.240]   But you can check out whenever you want.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:07.440]   I'm checked out now.
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:09.440]   Continue shopping.
[00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:11.440]   [END PLAYBACK]

[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:14.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:15.440]   Glad you like it.
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:16.440]   [LAUGHTER]

[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:19.440]   Huh.
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:20.440]   OK.
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:21.440]   That was really-- yeah.
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:22.440]   Nothing expensive.
[00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:23.440]   It does work.
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:24.440]   It does work.
[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:25.440]   I have to set it up, I guess.
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:31.440]   Unfortunately, this Scott Comfort Plus toilet tissue is not available in my area.
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:32.440]   Don't buy Charmin.
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:33.440]   It's old growth forest.
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:34.440]   They chop down a bit.
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:35.440]   It is?
[00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:36.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:41.240]   The Kirkland Signature Costco $13 lasts half a year.
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:42.920]   You know what we did?
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:45.080]   We bought toilets at washer but for you.
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:47.080]   Oh, the French way.
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:48.080]   The Japanese way.
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:49.080]   The Japanese way.
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:50.080]   All sorts of ways.
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:52.080]   We got the totos.
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:53.080]   You're right, but days are French.
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:54.080]   Yeah, we got the-- well, it's like a bidet.
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.080]   It's a Japanese version of a bidet.
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:57.680]   But I don't know why I brought that up.
[00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:58.680]   Anyway, OK.
[00:59:58.680 --> 00:59:59.680]   It's a wonderful luxury.
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:00.680]   You never need to buy toilet paper.
[01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:01.680]   It's a wonderful--
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:02.680]   It's a wonderful paper.
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:03.680]   And it's always full.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:04.680]   It does.
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:05.680]   You know what?
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.800]   It's really cut down on the toilet paper.
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:10.560]   You still might want to use it because your butt's wet.
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:11.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:12.560]   So--
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:13.560]   See the logic in that?
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:14.560]   Yeah.
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.560]   So you still might want to--
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:16.560]   But you don't need as much.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.560]   You use it for blotting.
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:18.560]   Yes.
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:19.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:22.800]   Today, I'll list weekend toilets.
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.880]   But the other thing is, OK, now if you're using less toilet paper, you don't actually
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.480]   have to buy it as frequently.
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.600]   So why not just go to the store a couple times a year?
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:30.600]   Right.
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:31.600]   Get out of the house.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:32.600]   Get some fresh air.
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:33.600]   That's why I love Costco.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.600]   You get samples.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:35.600]   No.
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.600]   You don't need a assistant to shop.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.600]   Yeah.
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:38.600]   I just want to get stuff.
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.600]   Yeah, see, I love to show you.
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:40.600]   Amazon has launched--
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:45.040]   And I don't understand this because I saw this is also, I think, a Weymo thing.
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:51.440]   Weymo in Phoenix, you call the store or you order online.
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.440]   And then a Weymo comes to you--
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:53.440]   With Walmart.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.120]   --takes you to the Walmart.
[01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:58.400]   You pick up the groceries and the Weymo takes you back.
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.880]   Why not just have the car go to the Walmart?
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:01.880]   Why not?
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:02.880]   Why not have the--
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:03.880]   It's the cart.
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.320]   Why do I have to go?
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:07.200]   Amazon has launched the same thing.
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:10.520]   Grocery pickup at Whole Foods for prime members.
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.960]   You have to go, though, and get it.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:17.000]   So I guess it's for places where they don't do delivery.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   Prime members can order groceries.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.320]   Or if you're in a hurry, you're on your way home.
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.600]   I mean, that one I can understand.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:22.600]   That one makes sense.
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:23.600]   But you're on your way home.
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.600]   Yeah.
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:25.600]   You want to just pop in, grab your order and continue.
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:29.840]   Maybe the Weymo, you have the Weymo pick you up at work, pick up the Walmart stuff.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:32.320]   Yeah, that's actually the scenario that could work.
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.480]   I would love to have that in the city.
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.960]   Take me up at Whole Foods in the city.
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:38.360]   Take me to the BART station so I could get back home to the suburbs.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:39.360]   There you go.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.360]   Or just forget the BART.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:41.360]   Take me home.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.600]   That would be very expensive for me.
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:50.400]   One of the other stranger deals that Weymo announced the other week, though, along with
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.840]   the Walmart deal was with Avis.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:59.160]   Now, they already had a deal with Avis to have Avis do the service and maintenance on
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:00.600]   their fleet of autonomous vehicles.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.600]   Interesting.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:02.600]   Great idea.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.800]   But somebody's got to maintain those vehicles.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:11.280]   But they're also doing, if you want to rent, if you're going to rent a car from Avis, Weymo
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.560]   car will come and pick you up.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:13.560]   This is the way Avis office.
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.560]   I love it.
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:17.480]   But if you're in a Weymo vehicle, why do you need to rent a car from Avis?
[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:19.320]   Why not just take the Weymo vehicle?
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.320]   Because the Weymo isn't available to take you that car.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.240]   They don't want you to go on long rides.
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.560]   They don't want to be the live, live, live, live, for kids.
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:26.560]   It's pretty clear.
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:28.320]   And this is only available in Arizona where Weymo is testing.
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:29.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:30.800]   Well, that's where they're planning to launch by the end of this year.
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:31.800]   Right.
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.360]   And the real point of this, and we know Google does this all the time, is to get together
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.360]   data.
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:38.080]   They're giving you free rides.
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:42.640]   And I think not an insignificant benefit of this is just to get people used to it.
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:43.640]   Yeah.
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:49.920]   But did you see that they're also taking people to Metro or like mass transportation or rail?
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:54.520]   And that's something that all these companies are going to have to figure out how to do.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.920]   It's public relations as much as the else, right?
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:01.000]   Well, it's public relations, but it's also, I mean, cities need to do this, you know, working
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.320]   with all these different companies that are developing automated vehicles to coordinate
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:10.680]   these services so that you use the right ride for every trip.
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:11.680]   Right.
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:15.200]   So you utilize mass transit on the high density routes, you know, where there's a lot of people
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:18.000]   going, it makes the most economic sense there.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.120]   And then, you know, you have the autonomous vehicles acting as first mile, last mile,
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:25.480]   feeding into that and taking you on to other destinations.
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:31.520]   And also for these other kinds of applications like delivering food and whatever else, for
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:36.800]   the economics to work for these services, they need to have these vehicles running 24
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:40.640]   hours a day generating revenue, doing something all the time.
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:41.920]   You don't want them sitting around.
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:45.760]   It's just like an airplane, airliner, where it doesn't make money when it's sitting on
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:46.760]   the tarmac.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.440]   It makes money when it's flying between destinations.
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:49.440]   Wait, what?
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:51.760]   Tens of thousands of these Chrysler Pacific vans, right?
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.920]   Yeah, they've ordered up to 62,000 of them over the next three years.
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.640]   Now they're going to buy the Jaguar and their eyepace.
[01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:00.480]   Yeah, and 20,000 Jaguars and 60,000.
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.280]   That's 80,000 vehicles.
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.320]   Where are these going to be?
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:08.640]   Well, the Jaguars will be for a more premium service.
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:10.120]   And it's their electric.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:11.120]   Yeah.
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:16.040]   So the Pacifica's will be for more, you know, for the more mainstream service.
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:19.760]   And because it's a mini van, you know, you can fold down some of the seats or take seats
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:20.760]   out.
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:23.920]   It sounds like they're really close to having Waymo be public.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:24.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:25.760]   So it's not ours.
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:29.440]   They said they're going to launch in Phoenix in the Phoenix area before the end of this
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:32.680]   year, expanded into California next year.
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:33.680]   Wow.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.160]   And then a few other cities over the next couple years.
[01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:37.120]   You know, we're in California.
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.600]   Probably the Bay Area first.
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:39.600]   So it's coming.
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.600]   Here we go.
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:41.600]   Coming.
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:46.360]   Will these cars be the ones that don't have safety drivers?
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:47.360]   That's the plan.
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:48.360]   Yeah.
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:49.360]   They'll just you'll get it in the empty vehicle.
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.360]   So weird.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:54.720]   They've been testing them that way in Chandler, Arizona for several months.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.080]   They take the steering wheel break and no, they're not going to take those out.
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:01.840]   No, they're not modifying the vehicles to that extent at this time.
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:06.000]   They're probably disabled because otherwise I might be tempted to get in the car and drive
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   away.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.240]   But it knows where you go.
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.240]   Yeah.
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:14.040]   Well, they're still mechanically connected.
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:18.280]   But if someone tries to get into the driver's seat, then the system will shut the vehicle
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.280]   down.
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.800]   Like if some without authorization.
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:24.680]   So if a passenger climbs up into the driver's seat, then yeah, then they're going to go
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:26.560]   then they'll bring the vehicle to a safe safe.
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.920]   You're in a Johnny cab.
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:29.920]   That's the one I hear.
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.880]   So if I get into a way more vehicle, I'm having a bad day.
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:33.600]   Could I just go driver, keep going?
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.600]   Like sure.
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.120]   Just keep the meter running.
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:37.120]   Just tell it.
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.120]   Tell it where you just keep telling it.
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:39.120]   Just driving circles around.
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:40.120]   Just do some loops.
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.120]   Yeah.
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.120]   Yeah.
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:46.160]   Just I wonder how people are going to react when this car with nobody in it pulls up.
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:50.760]   And apparently so far in Phoenix, it's been pretty good.
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:51.760]   You know, they've they've.
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:52.760]   Would you jump in?
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:53.760]   I have.
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:54.760]   I'm going with what you know.
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:55.760]   Would you jump in?
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:56.760]   In Phoenix where it's hot?
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:57.760]   Yes, there's air conditioning in which.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:58.760]   What the heck?
[01:05:58.760 --> 01:05:59.760]   Yeah.
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.480]   It depends on the situation and where it is.
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:04.760]   I mean, there's a lot of places where I would not trust the technology yet.
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.840]   It's raining or snowing.
[01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:09.200]   Yeah, I mean, if it's bad weather.
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.280]   Yeah, raining and snowing out.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:16.920]   You know, even even in a place like San Francisco, I'm not sure that I would yet trust any of
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:19.040]   these systems without having a safety driver.
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:21.200]   There's too many variables in the city like San Francisco.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:24.200]   Even riding even riding around Mountain View in one of the way.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.200]   You know what I get it?
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.200]   A couple months ago.
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:29.440]   If they did have a man, there were still times when it's with a little driver cabin and said
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:30.440]   turn around in there.
[01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:32.120]   You're in a Johnny cab.
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:33.640]   I would actually get in there.
[01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:37.040]   They could they could have like that as an Easter egg like one out of every 100 will be
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.040]   a Johnny cab.
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.040]   Then I would get in.
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.740]   Wait, what about that game show where you go into the cab and then you have to answer
[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:42.740]   questions until you get.
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:47.200]   Actually, I can't confessions all kinds or they or they or the Uber driver, Uber lift
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:48.920]   driver who was secretly recording.
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:49.920]   Oh my God.
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:50.920]   You're missing it on YouTube.
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:51.920]   Yeah.
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:54.200]   Well, this is another thing about these vehicles.
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:55.200]   They're going to be cameras.
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:57.200]   There will be cameras inside all these vehicles.
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:01.000]   They will be monitoring what's going on because they first of all, they need to know who's
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.120]   in the vehicle to prove to bill.
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:05.320]   But also they need to watch the inside of the vehicle.
[01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:08.720]   You know, if it needs to be cleaned, if somebody gets sick and throws up in there, they need
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:11.200]   to bring it back to the depot to get it cleaned up or some.
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.200]   Oh, does it know?
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:15.440]   Well, you got to have this got to be some some with some mechanism.
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:17.600]   You have to put smell sensors in the car.
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.880]   Well, actually that's this is this is one of the things.
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:23.480]   One of the things these companies are looking at last week or a couple weeks ago is at a
[01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:29.480]   conference in Michigan and talking to a company that does interiors or actually with no is
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:32.640]   ride sell, which is a company that does a lot of the back end services for some of the
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.800]   car sharing companies.
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:38.360]   And one of the things that they're looking at having installed in their vehicles is smoke
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:43.960]   detectors because if somebody somebody lights up a cigarette inside the car, then they need
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:46.840]   before they send it out to somebody over and say, get out.
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.280]   Or somebody hot boxes it.
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:49.280]   Yeah.
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.280]   This is for car sharing.
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.280]   This is a call for a guy.
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:55.280]   They need to do remediation on the car.
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.280]   That's like 400 bucks.
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.280]   Well, Waymo.
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.280]   I mean, come on.
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:00.200]   A car drives you around and you.
[01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:02.280]   We have some video from the near future.
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:07.280]   Oh, you don't have the audio turned on.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.280]   Hello.
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:11.280]   It's kind of Johnny Cat.
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:13.880]   Where can I take you tonight?
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:15.280]   Oh, that's creepy.
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:16.280]   Drive.
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:17.280]   Drive.
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:19.080]   Would you please repeat the destination?
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:21.080]   No, anyway, I just go go.
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:23.080]   Please stay in the street and number.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:26.080]   I'm not familiar with that address.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.080]   Would you please repeat the address?
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:31.080]   Oh, yes, he's Johnny Cat about.
[01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:35.080]   See, this is what you don't want somebody doing in a Raimo, right?
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.080]   Yeah, right.
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:37.080]   Yeah, right.
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:38.080]   Hey, it was.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.080]   Hey, it was.
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.080]   It was.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.080]   Arnold Schwartz and Edgar could do that.
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:46.320]   By the way, side note, but according to electric stolen Tesla vehicles in the US, there have
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:53.960]   been 115 stolen, 112 returned because they're also watching what you're doing.
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:55.640]   You can't get away with a Tesla.
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:58.680]   Yeah, in modern vehicles, you will have no privacy anymore.
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:03.080]   Yeah, but teenagers will still call away mode to make out.
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:04.080]   Let's be honest.
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:07.120]   Oh, the way I'm going to take them to the make out spot.
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.960]   They'll go go drive us away.
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.360]   Waymo is the make out spot.
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:11.360]   Yeah.
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:12.360]   Right.
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:13.360]   Get out in a way, Mo.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:14.360]   There's cameras in there.
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:15.360]   I could see.
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:16.360]   I won't care.
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:19.200]   That's Kendrick Lamar's next song.
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:20.200]   Waymo would chill.
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:21.200]   Waymo would chill.
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.200]   Yes.
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.200]   Waymo would chill.
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:24.200]   Yes.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.200]   Waymo would chill.
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.200]   Yes.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:27.200]   Waymo would chill.
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:28.200]   Yes.
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:29.200]   Waking out in a waymo.
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:31.800]   But just, you know, just to give you some perspective on this a couple of weeks ago, John
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:36.600]   Kraft checks the CEO of Waymo was speaking at the National Governor's Association.
[01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:39.440]   And one of the governors asked the question during the Q&A.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:43.520]   So what should we be spending our money on, you know, in terms of investing in infrastructure
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:45.080]   to support these things?
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:47.600]   And John Kraft check, he's the CEO of Waymo.
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:52.120]   He said, this is going to take a lot longer than you think.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:57.720]   Don't spend, don't waste your money because of regulatory hurdles, regulatory and technical
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:58.720]   issues.
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:09:59.720]   Yeah.
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:03.880]   Said don't waste your money right now on things specifically for automation.
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:06.600]   Just focus on, you know, getting your core infrastructure.
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:07.600]   Public transportation.
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:11.160]   Picture roads, picture, public transportation, lane marking signals, signage.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.160]   That's probably good advice.
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:13.160]   You know, focus on that stuff.
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:14.160]   Don't defer the pothole meetings.
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:16.680]   I really don't know if that's what that was his answer.
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.680]   I'm really good advice.
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:18.680]   No, it was, it was great.
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:19.680]   It was a great answer.
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:24.120]   And it was, you know, I mean, I've known John for more than 10 years and, you know, it was
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:28.520]   good to hear him get up in front of a group of governors and tell them, you know, that
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.320]   this is not going to be an overnight change.
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.320]   This is going to take a long time.
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:35.440]   You can lift an Uber or saying otherwise, at least from what I'm hearing, you know,
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:37.840]   that they're saying like, you know, self-driving is the future.
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:38.840]   We want to bring this.
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:39.840]   We need.
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:42.400]   The future is just not necessarily next year.
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:47.720]   Why would Waymo buy, why would Google buy 80,000 vehicles now if it didn't think that's
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.640]   going to, those are going to be in use in the next year?
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:50.640]   There's no point.
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:52.400]   Well, it's not, but they're not all coming now.
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:53.880]   They're over the next three years.
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:54.960]   Oh, say that again.
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:58.560]   So the next three years, those 82,000 vehicles.
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:10:59.560]   Yes.
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:00.560]   Okay.
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:01.560]   But that's there are 60,000.
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.560]   Still 20,000 of like that's a.
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:07.640]   Well, I mean, if you think about supporting, you know, supporting a place like San Francisco
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:12.360]   or Phoenix, you know, you need, you need 10 to 20,000 vehicles in a big city.
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:16.160]   It took the Waymo to the levy, but the levy was dry.
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:20.560]   So the Waymo drove me home and I picked up some groceries on the way.
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:22.760]   And Whole Foods, which I pre-ordered.
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:24.400]   It's a jeffrey ordered.
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.360]   No, Waymo's got Walmart.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:28.240]   You got to get the Amazon car to take you to hold.
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:30.080]   There is no Amazon car.
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:33.640]   Is there of all the companies doing these self-driving vehicles?
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:35.800]   Careful, Bezos might hear you.
[01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:37.480]   Jeff, what's the matter, Jeff?
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:38.480]   We just haven't heard about it.
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:40.240]   Self-driving UPS vehicles.
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:41.640]   Or you haven't heard about it yet.
[01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:43.680]   He's going to deliver by drones.
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:47.480]   Maybe you can pick it up on the way.
[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:48.480]   Just a little flinting.
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.560]   They just pick you up.
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:50.880]   Pick you up by their bell.
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:52.880]   Give it a slide belt, carry you around.
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:56.440]   He's going to have little blue origin rockets to take you to Whole Foods.
[01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:58.480]   Our show today brought to you by Zip Recruiter.
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:01.080]   We had a great experience at Zip Recruiter not so long ago.
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:04.480]   Our accounting manager, Quit, gave us two weeks notice.
[01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.800]   And poor Lisa, this is always the case, right?
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:13.520]   If you're in HR, the worst time to find new employees when the employee quits and now
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:17.920]   you're down and Lisa's working double time trying to keep the books and stuff and she's
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:19.640]   got to find somebody to replace it.
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:23.160]   And I said, Lisa, let's try Zip Recruiter.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.120]   I mean, they've been a sponsor for years.
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:26.880]   They're the easiest way to hire.
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:29.880]   She said, all right, this was at breakfast.
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:30.880]   She posted on Zip Recruiter.
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:35.680]   And one of the things Zip Recruiter does immediately is post 100 plus of all the job
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:37.320]   sites out there, including Twitter and Facebook.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:41.840]   So it's really putting it, casting a very wide net, which means you have a much higher
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:44.240]   chance of reaching that perfect person.
[01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:50.840]   But the other thing that they do that is really interesting, they actually will immediately
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:57.160]   start matching your opening to millions of resumes that they have on hand to find the
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:58.160]   people with the right experience.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:12:59.880]   And then they invite those people to apply.
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:01.880]   And this was the thing that blew me away.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:04.720]   I figured, well, it's going to be on those job boards the next day or two.
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:07.280]   We're going to start getting applications.
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:11.000]   And by the way, they all go into the Zip Recruiter inbox.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.880]   They format the resume, so they're easy to read.
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:14.080]   You can have screening questions.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.080]   Makes it very easy.
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:19.200]   But what I didn't count on is how fast we would start getting applications thanks to
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:22.680]   Zip Recruiter going out there and getting people.
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:25.520]   Like we were eating breakfast.
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:31.240]   Like an hour later, oh my God, I just got another, I got another, within, before lunch,
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:33.680]   we had five really good candidates.
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:35.560]   Lisa was walking on the clouds.
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:42.120]   She was so happy because instead of having to take weeks to find this right person, Zip
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:45.160]   Recruiter just served him up.
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:49.840]   They're so effective that 80% of employers who post on Zip Recruiter get a quality candidate
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:52.760]   through Zip Recruiter within the first day.
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:55.640]   It's almost like they're head hunting for you.
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:58.760]   No wonder Zip Recruiter is the highest rated hiring site in America.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.960]   It really works.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:02.280]   We were thrilled.
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:05.360]   It made our life much, much easier.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:10.320]   By the way, you can do this right now for free at ziprecruiter.com/twit.
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:13.760]   If you've got an opening or maybe you don't right now, but maybe tomorrow you're going
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:17.200]   to go into work, somebody's going to quit, ziprecruiter.com/twit.
[01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:21.960]   Just keep that handy because I can personally say, I can vouch for it.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:25.680]   We got great candidates before lunch.
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:37.080]   Zip Recruiter.com/twit, it really works.
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:38.080]   Let's see.
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.880]   Here's some of the things that happened this week on Twit.
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:42.400]   Previously on Twit.
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:46.440]   We brought Robert here because we needed his help.
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:54.080]   We have a 100-inch Ultra HD 4K Smart Laser TV.
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:58.120]   Already produced by Jerry, has given up on the show and is watching penguins.
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.480]   It's a distraction.
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:01.920]   Triangulation.
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:04.080]   Sal Saguayan is here.
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:06.920]   The king of Apple automation.
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:10.200]   He stood up and said, "No, you're wrong to Steve Jobs."
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.200]   Yeah.
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:13.800]   My first words to Steve were, "No, you're wrong."
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:14.800]   I'm Sal Saguayan.
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.400]   I'm the Apple Script product manager.
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:17.400]   No, you're wrong.
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:20.360]   My technology's many times better than Windows.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:21.840]   The new screensabers.
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:24.520]   My sense really has taken the market by storm.
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.320]   They showed this at CES.
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:29.520]   This is their 100-inch projection TV.
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:30.520]   Laser.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:31.520]   Short throw.
[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:36.320]   I have to say, there's a little bit of a sacrifice because it's projection, but it is the best-looking
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:37.680]   projection I've ever seen.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:44.880]   If you can live with a price of $9,000, this high sense, 100-inch 4K Ultra HD Smart Laser
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:48.560]   TV is really sweet.
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.960]   I want this for the Super Bowl.
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.560]   It handles rooms with light, pretty damn well.
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:53.560]   Yeah, to it.
[01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:55.760]   Technology for your eyes and ear holes.
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:56.760]   No flow.
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:57.760]   Sorry, I'm here.
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:58.760]   I was counting.
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:15:59.760]   Could you do this?
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:00.760]   Show me the weather.
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:01.760]   Currently in Petaloo's--
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:04.760]   A 100-inch is a weather, baby!
[01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:09.280]   That's the biggest weather forecast you ever got.
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:11.520]   Okay, that was useful.
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:12.920]   It has Echo built into it.
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:13.920]   Yes.
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:14.920]   I want to see that some flow.
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:19.080]   I want to see flow screaming at the Amazon Echo.
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:20.280]   You got to put that B-roll out.
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:23.320]   I bet you that would be more popular than know-how.
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:25.120]   Just people's--
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:29.160]   Megan and flow screaming at the echoes.
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:30.400]   Burks vouching for it.
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:31.400]   Burks there when it happens.
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:33.400]   It gets very stressful.
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:35.400]   We get stressful on Sunday.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:39.400]   They always said never work with animals or kids or voice assistants.
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:40.400]   Yes.
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.400]   It's all right.
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:42.400]   Someone's got a wrangle on.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:47.840]   So we saved the more thorny issue for the middle of the show, and we're going to talk
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:49.840]   about Infowars now.
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:55.520]   You know, Matt Cuts, I think your experience fighting spam at Google probably will be helpful
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:57.480]   in this.
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:07.120]   Infowars, Alex Jones, kind of conspiracy, laden, radio show podcast, has been around for years.
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:10.480]   When I first heard about it, and was Twitter fans who told me about it, I thought it was
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:12.000]   like a comedy site.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.400]   It was like weekly world news.
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:16.880]   I was abducted by aliens.
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:22.240]   But in the Trump era, it's become more--because apparently the president listens to Infowars,
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:26.240]   it's become more and more of a mainstream source of information.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:31.360]   And at this point, Alex is being sued, for instance, by Sandy Hook parents because he's
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:33.760]   been saying their kids weren't shot at Sandy Hook.
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:38.320]   Their actors, that's got to be the ultimate insult to somebody who lost a child.
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:39.320]   They're being harassed.
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:40.320]   They get harassed by his followers.
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:44.520]   As a result, his Infowars army goes after them.
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:48.360]   So he's been pulled from a lot of places.
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:51.160]   He's been pulled--I hope he pulled the podcast from iTunes.
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:54.400]   So you can still get the app though on the app store, interestingly.
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:55.880]   Spotify pulled the podcast.
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:58.520]   Marco Arman was the first one to pull him from his directory on Overcast.
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:00.880]   Good for you, Marco, from Overcast.
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:03.240]   So there has been some reaction.
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:05.200]   Twitter won't.
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:10.840]   And there was a really long article in the New York Times that Twitter invited the New
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:14.440]   York Times reporters, two reporters to comment.
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:15.440]   We do know his.
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.440]   Oh boy.
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:17.440]   Oh boy.
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:18.440]   There's this name.
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:19.440]   I got a ban on Twitch.
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:22.440]   He gets in there, doesn't he?
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:23.640]   He sneaks in.
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:27.920]   So really, I thought an interesting article in the New York Times where they basically
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:34.060]   went into the meeting at Twitter last Friday just a couple of days ago where they were
[01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:37.000]   trying to decide what to do about Infowars.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:44.320]   Now CNN claims that they found seven tweets where Infowars did violate specifically
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:52.600]   violate Apple's rules, or Twitter's rules rather, but Twitter has decided and they said
[01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:59.160]   it's a very tough decision for now leave Infowars despite the fact that they apparently did
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:01.920]   break Twitter's rules to leave them on.
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:06.200]   Jack tweeted yesterday, "We didn't suspend Alec Jones or Infowars.
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.240]   We know it's hard for many, but the reason is simple.
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:09.840]   He hasn't violated our rules.
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:14.640]   Well, enforce if he does and will continue to promote a healthy conversational environment
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:16.960]   by ensuring tweets aren't artificially amplified."
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:20.480]   Now, I really actually believe it or not have mixed feelings about this.
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:23.000]   And I thought Mike Masnick, a tech dirt.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:28.520]   Mike is often very, very sharp about this kind of stuff, wrote a really interesting and
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.480]   very long piece.
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.480]   He actually was so long.
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:33.840]   He summarized it right at the beginning.
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:37.120]   And I'll read this summary because I think it's interesting.
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:40.680]   He says, "Internet sites have every right in the world to kick people off their platforms.
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:42.760]   There's no legal or ethical problem with that.
[01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:46.560]   No one's free speech is being censored."
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:50.160]   That said, and this is what concerns me, we should be at least a bit concerned about
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:55.440]   the idea that giant internet platforms get to be some sort of arbiter in what speech
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:20:02.400]   is okay and what speech is not and how that can impact society more generally."
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:07.200]   So he goes on to say, "There are possible solutions to this, even if none are perfect,
[01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:12.000]   some may be difficult to implement, and we should explore those more thoroughly rather
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.120]   than getting to screaming fights over who should and shouldn't be allowed to use various
[01:20:15.120 --> 01:20:16.120]   internet platforms."
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:21.080]   And the reason I think of U-MAT cuts is because I'm sure you had similar issues, similar debates
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:22.720]   inside of Google when you were there.
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:24.360]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:30.360]   It's really tricky because you can go by rules or values or principles, but it's hard
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:32.520]   to go back and fix those things.
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:34.640]   It's better to encode that in the DNA early.
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:40.760]   So for example, I worked on the first version of Safe Search, which was our family filter.
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:46.560]   And so the question is, what should be allowed or not allowed in Safe Search?
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:47.840]   And it's really tricky.
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:51.560]   Like even finding pornography is hard by itself because sometimes it's imagery, sometimes
[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:52.560]   it's words.
[01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:54.400]   Well, there's a famous Facebook problem.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:56.080]   Do you show breastfeeding women?
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:57.080]   Is that pornography?
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.080]   Right.
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:20:59.080]   For a long time, Facebook did not.
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:03.680]   And the famous quote is, "I know pornography when I see it," as opposed to a hard and fast
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:04.680]   definition.
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:05.680]   Do they know?
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:08.160]   Still, I think there was a big protest and they've kind of loosened those rules, but maybe
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:09.160]   I'm wrong.
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:10.160]   Anyway.
[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:14.840]   So for a long time, we had people who would come and say, "I don't like X. I think Safe
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:17.160]   Search should exclude X."
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:21.400]   And I ended up writing like a canned thing that was like, "Okay, you might not like the
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:27.120]   anarchist cookbook or bomb making, but then that leads to pro-anorexia sites, which leads
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:29.480]   to wickensites, which leads to..."
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:32.200]   And you're literally, "Here's your slippery slope.
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:34.600]   Where would you like to draw it along that line?"
[01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:39.040]   So in my point of view, I was like, "Okay, make something upfront and clear and say,
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:40.480]   this is what it is."
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.640]   And from that point forward, you can at least defend that line.
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:43.640]   What is that rule?
[01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:45.320]   I mean, that's the hard thing.
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:49.920]   Google's really in this position because even though the internet exists outside of
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:55.400]   Google, because of its position as the default search engine for everybody, if it's not
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:57.480]   on Google, it doesn't exist kind of.
[01:21:57.480 --> 01:22:02.360]   Well, and I do think everybody that I worked with at Google is very thoughtful in trying
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:03.360]   to figure out how to...
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:07.360]   You want to be comprehensive, but at the same time, a long time ago, we were saying,
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:10.360]   "Well, you just want to reflect the web adequately."
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:13.880]   So for example, you want to have an accurate reflection of what's on the web, but that's
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:19.280]   even a problem because all the people who think pick vaccines, they're like, "Oh, vaccines
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.280]   are terrible.
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.920]   There's a lot of people who say that.
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:26.240]   There's fewer people who get really passionate and say, "No, scientific consensus and data
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:27.520]   says that vaccines work."
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:32.440]   And so if you were only a reflection of the web, you're still might might not adequately
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:33.440]   reflect the world.
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:36.360]   And Google's been bit by that in the past because the search engine does value stuff
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:37.360]   with more links.
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:38.360]   Right.
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:41.440]   And in fact, any vaccine is a very good example.
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:43.160]   But Google fixes it.
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:44.960]   It seems like on an ad hoc basis.
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:49.920]   Well, it's interesting because you'd see people trying to go back and put principles
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:51.120]   underneath of it.
[01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:53.200]   Like, "Well, why don't you allow this ad?"
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.840]   Okay, well, let's figure out the general case.
[01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:58.480]   Maybe the general case is we allow proactive ads, but not anti-ass.
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:00.200]   A very engineering way to sell.
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:01.200]   Oh, it absolutely is.
[01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:04.840]   But what's interesting is every company can have their own personal philosophy.
[01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:10.200]   Twitter historically is calling themselves the free speech wing of the free speech party.
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:16.040]   And so I can understand why their DNA makes them a little more loath to take action on
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:17.040]   this.
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.040]   Right.
[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:19.040]   Also how money.
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:20.840]   I mean...
[01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:21.840]   On info worlds?
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:24.200]   I mean, well, no, I'm talking about the users.
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:25.200]   Yeah.
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:26.800]   They don't want to ban too many users.
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:27.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:27.800 --> 01:23:28.800]   Wall Street had punished them a little bit.
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:29.800]   They banned a million bots.
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:30.800]   Wall Street punished them.
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:34.640]   But it does feel like the people that I talked to in the tech industry have realized,
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:39.280]   "Okay, if we don't get this trust and credibility problem under control, that's more of a problem."
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.280]   That's more of a problem.
[01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:45.520]   So, like, you definitely saw, you know, monthly active users take a hit with a couple different
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:46.520]   platforms.
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:47.520]   Facebook, anyway.
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:48.520]   Right.
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:49.520]   And they're like, "Okay, yeah.
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:52.560]   Facebook's $120 billion drop."
[01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:57.840]   But I would rather have them have realistic true users rather than bots or something deceptive
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:58.840]   or misleading.
[01:23:58.840 --> 01:23:59.840]   Yeah.
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:01.000]   I agree.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.320]   It's very difficult.
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:07.080]   Like, I don't even know where you draw the line, really.
[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:11.880]   Well, my solution is to put the control in the hands of the users.
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:17.840]   So he's saying platforms have to get serious about moving real power out to the ends of
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:22.520]   the network so that anyone can set up systems for themselves or look to third parties for
[01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:24.360]   kill filters, basically.
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:27.440]   He says, "In the old days in Usenet, there were kill files.
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:30.560]   Emails got swamped with spam, but there were a variety of anti-spam filters you could plug
[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:32.520]   in to filter out most of it."
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:34.800]   Well, and we did use that at Google.
[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:38.760]   We allowed people to report and ban sites themselves.
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:41.360]   And we actually had a Chrome extension where you could block sites.
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:43.200]   It was just for you or was for the group.
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:45.360]   It was just for you, but then we used that data.
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:46.360]   A signal.
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:48.280]   Okay, that's a signal to potential use.
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:53.280]   It is incredibly difficult to come up with a one-size-fits-all solution.
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:54.280]   Yeah.
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:59.040]   Well, and I think that's where you see different companies coming up with different approaches,
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:01.240]   some of which are more or less effective as well.
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:03.160]   I don't think a company is going to fix any of this.
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:07.560]   I think this is a social problem, and I think tech is trying to find an answer for it,
[01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:09.160]   and I don't think the answer is there.
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:11.400]   Would you be in a full world?
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:13.400]   Would I be in a full world?
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:18.320]   I don't know.
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:19.840]   I really don't know.
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:20.840]   I don't know.
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:26.120]   I want it banned because I think it's awful that this stuff is being spread as truth.
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:28.240]   I mean, let's not forget things like pizza gate and the sort.
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:30.360]   Like that was all because of this thing.
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:33.480]   Yeah, the guy actually walked into a pizza joint and lost in DC.
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:34.480]   Exactly.
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:36.320]   Which is, it is dangerous.
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:40.960]   That's the one argument that to me carries water with Twitter, which is Twitter, as
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:45.320]   always said, we are not going to allow so much free speech that is endangering people.
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:46.960]   That is the line we will draw.
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:48.240]   And frankly, the law draws.
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:52.640]   If there is a threat, if there is danger, if you shout fire in a crowded theater, you
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:56.120]   are not protected at that point because you're in danger.
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:26:01.680]   And Alex Jones has cried fire in a crowded theater and people have responded and it has
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:04.120]   put people's lives at risk.
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:06.480]   And for that, he should be banned, period.
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:07.480]   Yeah.
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:13.960]   I mean, I understand that the whole slippery slope argument, I hate the idea of censoring
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:20.520]   anyone, but this is clearly an example of where he is spreading absolute untruths.
[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:21.520]   He's riled up.
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:29.520]   And he's getting people riled up around these untruths and that is more dangerous than the
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:32.160]   risk of censorship.
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:37.200]   Isn't there an argument to be made though that if you bury stuff like that, it's in
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:43.840]   the long run more dangerous than if it doesn't sunlight disinfect, that if people see this
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:44.840]   stuff.
[01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:46.960]   The answer to bad speech is more speech.
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:47.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:48.960]   Right.
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:51.840]   I think that's been the argument for a long time and based on what we've seen over the
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:58.080]   last several years, the last five, 10 years, increasingly, I think that I'm no longer convinced
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:26:59.560]   that that's true.
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:07.400]   The vaccines, what Google decided to do is they still show any Vaxxer sites, but they
[01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:13.600]   put up a sidebar of scientific factual information.
[01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:16.160]   They try to show both sides, I guess.
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:22.720]   Well, you can imagine reliable sources that you can find, but I think the Google philosophy
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:29.120]   is also try to think about signals that give you some idea about reputation.
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:33.240]   And so, you know, a reputable site is then therefore more likely to rank.
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:37.120]   And I suspect, you know, you could probably come up with a lot of different ways to say,
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:41.880]   oh, maybe articles on this site are reshared without people actually looking at them, you
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:42.880]   know?
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:44.800]   And so you say, oh, they just right to click Beatty Headline.
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:46.480]   That sounds like a rationalization.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:48.560]   That is very, it's a very engineering driven solution.
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:51.160]   I think that's what a lot of Silicon Valley is doing right now.
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:52.840]   They're always going to do because they're engineers.
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:55.400]   It is also the case that there are offline solutions.
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:59.640]   So if somebody does libel or slander, then you can go to the correction that way.
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:00.640]   Yeah.
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:04.240]   And in fact, that's what's happening to Alex Jones.
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:06.080]   It's why this is a challenging one, isn't it?
[01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:10.640]   And this is just one small bit of a much larger challenging conversation that's going
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:11.640]   on.
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:15.600]   That's why it's really difficult because that's why I say it's a societal thing because I
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:21.560]   this is how I feel about this is how I feel about when, I mean, personally, when there
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:26.800]   is increased police presence on things like Bart, I'm kind of against it because I think
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:30.480]   that that's not actually solving the problem of like why robberies are happening because
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:32.080]   of great income disparity.
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:36.880]   So to this point, I say this is not actually solving the problem of why you want to get
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:37.880]   the root of the problem.
[01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:38.880]   I want to get to the root of the problem.
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:44.120]   I mean, we have a problem and it does, but we keep focusing on tech and talking about
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:47.120]   tech and what the tech companies are doing, but like they're not doing anything for us.
[01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:49.040]   They're doing everything for their own gain.
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:51.200]   This has nothing to do with the users.
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:54.880]   They're going to acquiesce us so that we keep buying their products and using their services,
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:58.480]   but it has nothing to do with like actually helping humanity.
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:00.720]   We have to solve this problem ourselves offline.
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:02.400]   We have to change it.
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:07.240]   I think a lot of people can and should take all kinds of actions, but I do know a lot
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:11.760]   of people at tech companies who genuinely feel like, okay, this is a problem.
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:15.720]   Maybe they were trying to get heard before, but it does feel like now the tech companies
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:19.680]   understand they need to be part of the solution and figure out, you know, you can't just allow
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:23.360]   bots, you know, to make your user growth look good.
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:27.320]   It does feel like that moment of reckoning has arrived and at least the tech companies
[01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:30.200]   realize, okay, how are we responsible?
[01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:33.200]   What is our ethical obligation and how do we put that in place?
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:34.800]   And there's some ethical requirements.
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:39.560]   I think there's ethical needs in all forms of engineering, not just in what Silicon Valley
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:45.120]   does, but across the board, autonomous vehicles being a prime example of that.
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:50.080]   The engineers need to think about the human factor in any kind of product that they're
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:55.320]   creating the way people are going to use that product needs to be considered in the development
[01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:58.040]   of that product.
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:00.000]   But propaganda is in the by of the beholder.
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:06.920]   I mean, you can't decide, you know, propaganda is only stuff you don't agree with.
[01:30:06.920 --> 01:30:13.520]   So Jones has been removed from Apple, Facebook, YouTube.
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:18.480]   Jones Infowars apps still are in the Google Play Store and the App Store and still on
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:21.720]   Twitter, even though Twitter now agrees with CNN.
[01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:23.640]   Yeah, he violated our policies.
[01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:24.640]   That's another problem.
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:26.480]   If you make a policy, you need to be consistent.
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:27.480]   You need to be consistent.
[01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:28.480]   Follow it.
[01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:29.480]   That's like with children.
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:30.480]   You got to discipline them.
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:31.480]   The reason we'll learn.
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:32.480]   Yeah.
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:35.160]   So really, it's such a challenge for Twitter.
[01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:40.120]   And I'm going to give them the benefit of that and say it's not a financial decision.
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:42.120]   Certainly not in for worse.
[01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:46.120]   But I think Twitter is trying to do the right thing, but I think they're struggling as everybody
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:47.360]   is with what is the right thing.
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:52.000]   And I have misgivings about censoring anybody, even if it's speech I disagree with because
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:55.600]   it could be you next time.
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:56.600]   You don't.
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:31:02.320]   Yeah, you don't want Twitter to be given the role in society of deciding who's who's
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:03.320]   good and who's not.
[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:04.320]   It shouldn't be in their hands.
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:05.320]   It shouldn't be in their hands.
[01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:06.320]   It should not be in there.
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:08.640]   We shouldn't give them that kind of power.
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:11.800]   On the other hand, I can easily see the point of view that, well, you don't want to let
[01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:17.560]   somebody spew something that's actively dangerous to people.
[01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:21.400]   It's really challenging because we have a president who's actively spewing things that
[01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:22.400]   are dangerous.
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:27.280]   Pursuing the media in ways that the media is starting to see is dangerous.
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:31.720]   They're going to be editorials this week in all the big newspapers.
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:33.280]   I think the globe is starting this.
[01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:37.120]   I think it was 100 papers that are committed to saying, you know, got to stop attacking
[01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:41.080]   the media because somebody's going to get hurt.
[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:42.680]   But on the other hand, I already have.
[01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:43.680]   And Baltimore?
[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:46.560]   And the fires that are, I guess not.
[01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:50.680]   On the other hand, it's crazies that are doing this, right?
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:52.560]   And so there's one thing.
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:57.320]   Do you blame the guy who's inflaming the crazies or the crazies?
[01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:01.960]   Maybe the guy who's inflaming them is saying something he honestly believes is deeply true.
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:04.560]   I think he is.
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:07.280]   It's not his responsibility that somebody takes it to the...
[01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:11.120]   Well, maybe if society were better to him, he wouldn't feel the need to have that.
[01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:12.520]   I mean, it'd be nicer.
[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:13.520]   Yeah.
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:16.720]   I mean, he's feeling slighted by these people that he needs to go out and work with a...
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:20.840]   We'll talk with Jeff Jarvis about this on Wednesday on Twig.
[01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:28.920]   But he's written an interesting opinion piece for the Atlantic in which he's pretty positive.
[01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:32.920]   He says that what you're seeing at this point is a sign of...
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:36.840]   Major sign of process, the process is beginning to work.
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:39.320]   Civilization is winning at last.
[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:43.800]   Now, I'd be very interested what Jeff says about Twitter.
[01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:48.480]   But he says, "Alex Jones went too far and the public empowered by the same tools of social
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:56.040]   media, Jones exploited, told the platforms his behavior is unacceptable and a civil society.
[01:32:56.040 --> 01:33:02.440]   The platforms like media and like regulators might prefer to start, as you say, Matt, with
[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:07.280]   a set of rules that can be enforced by government, by social media managers or algorithms.
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:10.400]   But really in the real world, that's not how we negotiate our standards.
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:12.560]   The breach makes the rule.
[01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:16.680]   You can't necessarily know ahead of time what's going to be a problem.
[01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:20.520]   We know pornography, propaganda, trolling and spamming when we see it.
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:24.200]   And then we write the rules to prevent it.
[01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:29.440]   Jeff writes, "The progress always seems to take too long, but it is prudent that we ban
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:31.880]   what we see rather than everything we might fear."
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:34.480]   He's talking about prior restraint.
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:35.480]   That's a big issue too.
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:36.480]   I mean, techno panic.
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:37.480]   Right.
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:40.120]   And the First Amendment is very much protective of...
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:41.600]   You cannot use prior restraint.
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:44.560]   You can't stop a newspaper from publishing something.
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:45.560]   You think they're going to publish.
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:46.920]   You have to wait until they publish it.
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:52.240]   And then, although the interesting history of the First Amendment, if you start to read
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:56.600]   it is that almost immediately after the First Amendment was added to the Constitution,
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:34:01.440]   it was violated by a federal government that didn't like the speech that it was getting.
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:02.880]   I can't remember what the subject was.
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:03.880]   Oh boy.
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:05.680]   So it was almost immediately violated.
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:06.680]   So maybe we should discuss this next.
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:08.520]   Well, then the Alien Sedition Act, I think...
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:09.520]   Yeah.
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:10.520]   Perfect example.
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:11.520]   The Alien Sedition Act.
[01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:12.520]   In fact, maybe that was it.
[01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:13.520]   Yeah.
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:14.520]   Yeah.
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:19.680]   And as Flo said, I think we do need to attack the root causes of why people are feeling
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:20.680]   this way.
[01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:21.680]   Yeah.
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:25.040]   I mean, that's a process that's going to take a lot longer and there's no simple solution
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:26.040]   to that.
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:33.520]   But the inequality that increasingly see here and elsewhere is, I think, the fundamental
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:34.760]   problem.
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:40.920]   And until that is addressed and dealt with...
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:42.680]   All the other stuff is going to continue to happen.
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:43.680]   Internet's just a platform.
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:44.680]   You're just going to be playing...
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:48.480]   You're going to be playing these somewhat reassuring to know, though, that right after
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:51.040]   the Bill of Rights was passed.
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:56.920]   In 1798, the United States government passed the Alien and Sedition Act, which a series
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:35:02.480]   of laws, which include new powers to get this, to port foreigners as well as making it harder
[01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:05.760]   for new immigrants to vote.
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:12.640]   And in fact, one of the most controversial of the new laws, the Sedition Act, a prohibited
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:16.040]   public opposition to the government.
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:19.920]   As an imprisonment could be used against those who write, print, utter, or publish any false
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:21.840]   scandalous or malicious writing.
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:26.160]   1798 signed a law by John Adams.
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:32.200]   So under the terms of this law, 20 Republican newspaper editors were arrested and some were
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:34.640]   imprisoned.
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:36.480]   This has been going on for as long as...
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:38.680]   This is why democracy is hard, right?
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:43.200]   It is why democracy is hard, but the beauty is that this is kind of a wake-up call that
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:46.960]   everybody needs to think about how they feel about it and participate.
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:47.960]   Participate and...
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:48.960]   Thank you.
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:53.680]   We need to do that now before we end up living in Gilead.
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:54.680]   Right.
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:55.680]   Participate now.
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:56.680]   Yeah.
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:59.440]   I didn't know I watched that show.
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:00.440]   It is pretty gloomy.
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:01.440]   I'm not going down now.
[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:03.720]   Yeah, you know, I tried to watch.
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:04.720]   He's talking about...
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:05.720]   I tried to.
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:09.280]   He's talking about the Hulu show Handmaid's Tale.
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:10.280]   I watched the first episode.
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:12.280]   I couldn't watch the first five minutes.
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:13.280]   It was hard.
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:14.280]   It was hard.
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:17.920]   You still need to make time for the Rick and Morty or the Parks and Recreation on that
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:18.920]   time.
[01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:19.920]   That's okay.
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:20.920]   But also participate.
[01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:21.920]   Archer.
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:22.920]   Yeah.
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:25.560]   You've got to get your archer to balance your inmates.
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:26.560]   Park.
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:28.720]   This is a big conversation.
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:32.520]   It's going to go on for a lot more time, I know.
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:33.520]   Thank you, fruit.
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:36.280]   You did a very responsible and intelligent job with that.
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:37.280]   That's good.
[01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:38.280]   Go panel.
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:40.360]   We're going to talk about voting machines and hackers.
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:41.360]   Oh boy.
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:45.080]   When we come back, our show today brought to you by Ring.
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:47.040]   It's a smarter way to protect your home.
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:49.360]   Ring, we've talked about the Ring Video doorbell forever.
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:50.360]   I have one.
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:51.880]   I've had one since they came out.
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:52.880]   Installed it myself.
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:53.880]   I'm very proud.
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:54.880]   It's awesome.
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:58.840]   In fact, you've probably heard sometimes I forget to mute my phone and you hear it go
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:02.000]   "dwding" when somebody walks up the front path.
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.000]   When somebody rings the doorbell goes "dwong, dwong, dwong."
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.000]   I know.
[01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:10.240]   And I can immediately talk to them, see them, find out what's going on at my front door.
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:11.240]   I love it.
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:16.280]   Now they've reinvented the home alarm system.
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:17.280]   Ring alarm.
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:20.960]   I am so excited about this.
[01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:22.720]   We've been waiting for this for months.
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:23.720]   It's now out.
[01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:27.120]   It's an easy to install affordable home security system.
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:28.480]   No long-term contracts.
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:33.960]   You can build a system that's right for your home, have it up and running in minutes.
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:37.240]   You can install this very easily.
[01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:38.600]   Get ready for this.
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:40.800]   You get professional monitoring.
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:41.800]   24/7.
[01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:46.880]   So, if somebody breaks in, it notifies the center.
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:49.680]   How much does the other alarm companies charge for that?
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:51.320]   Well, first of all, you've got to bring a guy out.
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:53.160]   He's got to install all this stuff.
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:54.880]   Charges you through the nose for that.
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:38:00.120]   And then they typically charge you $45 or more dollars a month for this stuff.
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:01.120]   Ring.
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:02.800]   Protect plus.
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:04.000]   Professional monitoring.
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.000]   Get ready.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:06.920]   $10 a month.
[01:38:06.920 --> 01:38:07.640]   $10.
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:10.160]   No long-term contracts.
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:12.720]   No moving costs.
[01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:14.280]   No cancellation fees.
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:16.400]   Just $10 a month.
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:18.520]   You'd be crazy to buy anything else.
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:22.760]   We've come to Trust Ring with everything now.
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:26.240]   The Ring Alarm Security Kit is available at Ring.com.
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:27.560]   Go to Ring.com/Twit.
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:28.560]   You can learn more.
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:29.560]   Get the base station.
[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:31.720]   Get the keypad.
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:33.320]   The sensors.
[01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:34.800]   The motion detectors.
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:39.680]   They've even got range extenders that extend the signal from your base station so you can
[01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:42.800]   cover a very large area.
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:45.760]   And there's a lot more Ring.com/Twit.
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:48.480]   A smarter way to protect your entire home.
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:53.040]   Only $10 a month for that professional 24/7 monitoring.
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:55.040]   Wow.
[01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:56.040]   I love it.
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:59.760]   Classic Skype lives to see another day.
[01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:00.760]   Thank you, Microsoft.
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:03.600]   Microsoft's listening.
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:05.120]   They were going to kill Skype.
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:06.120]   Classic Skype.
[01:39:06.120 --> 01:39:07.400]   We rely on Skype, as you know.
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:10.520]   In fact, I'm not using Skype for the first time in weeks.
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:11.440]   You guys are all here.
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:12.440]   I love that.
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:13.440]   We're real people.
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:14.440]   Yeah.
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:16.440]   I mean, everybody's real.
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:17.440]   Look.
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:18.440]   We're tangible.
[01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:19.440]   Look, she's there.
[01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:20.440]   We're not but.
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:22.440]   If you burn us, we burn.
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:23.440]   Oh, I won't burn you.
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:24.920]   I promise.
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:28.800]   But I was really worried because we were so reliant on Skype and Microsoft seems to be
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:32.040]   degrading the program every time they put another release out.
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:33.040]   Yeah.
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:35.040]   Just finding basic settings like, you know, where to set the camera.
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:37.640]   They take it out, they put it back, they take it out.
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:41.760]   So we had been keeping a link to the classic Skype hoping that we wouldn't have to pull
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:45.840]   the trigger, but needing it in case they took out something we need.
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:48.880]   And everybody's freaked out when Microsoft said, "No, we're going to stop allowing you
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:49.880]   to download."
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:52.680]   Thank you, Brad Sams, for bringing us to bringing this to our attention.
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:54.760]   Skype lives to see another day.
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:40:00.480]   We don't know for how long, but Microsoft has backtracked a little bit about that.
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:03.440]   Buzzfeed reporting on Defcon.
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:04.440]   Defcon?
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:05.440]   Do you ever go to Defcon?
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:07.480]   I have wanted to go to Defcon so much.
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:09.080]   You may not be allowed.
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:10.600]   I just leave all my phones at home.
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:15.560]   As the chief of the US Digital Service, Matt cuts, actually the FBI goes.
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:20.600]   So can I tell you that we have a team at the Defense Digital Service, which is our wing
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:25.240]   over at the Pentagon, and they are sending folks, and we're doing a hackathon, like a
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:30.120]   literal hackathon, a bug bounty, called Hack the Marines.
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:31.640]   So yes, that's right.
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:32.640]   They did hack the Navy.
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:33.640]   They don't have to.
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:34.640]   They do hack the Navy.
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:37.240]   So this is their sixth bug bounty.
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:41.600]   They had never, the federal government had never done a bug bounty before 2016 when the
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:43.400]   US Digital Service did hack the Pentagon.
[01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:44.400]   So that was you.
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:48.400]   Well, I did the, I helped with the second one, but yes, the US Digital Service helped
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:49.400]   with that.
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:51.120]   And that's what I mean by you.
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:53.680]   The collective you didn't bring like all the ethernet cable.
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:57.520]   It was a wonderful person named Lisa, who was really the driver on that.
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:01.760]   But it's pretty incredible because everybody was incredibly scared of doing this.
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:05.240]   It turns out bug bounties have been done since 1995 with Netscape.
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:07.000]   So it's not really scary.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.040]   They've turned the crank so many times that now people are like, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh, Ooh.
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:11.880]   Can you test our system out?
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:15.920]   It was, I remember that when the first hack the Pentagon happened, there was a lot.
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:16.920]   Congress was like, what?
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:17.920]   Yeah.
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:18.920]   What's going on here?
[01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:19.920]   It doesn't seem like a good idea.
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:21.560]   And the word hack is so loaded now.
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:25.720]   Well, the story is somebody was like, well, you can, all right, you can do your bug bounty,
[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:28.600]   but you can't call it, you know, like hack the Pentagon.
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:33.640]   And then the guy at the Pentagon was like, Oh, we're totally calling it a hack.
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:36.680]   Because we, the guy there likes to pick fights and win fights.
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:38.400]   And he's also great marketing.
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:39.400]   It's really good marketing.
[01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:40.640]   Get people's attention.
[01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:43.640]   So they're literally doing hack the Marines with over 50 different Marines.
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:44.640]   That's going to be huge.
[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:45.640]   Stop mill websites and defcon.
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:46.640]   That's going to be huge.
[01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:49.400]   Now, tell us for people who are saying, well, why would you want to do that?
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:51.200]   What is the benefit of this kind of thing?
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:54.520]   So I mean, first off, you can earn money, like money is cool.
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:55.920]   You can help secure.
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:57.240]   If you're good at this, you could.
[01:41:57.240 --> 01:41:58.240]   You have to be good at it.
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:02.280]   So we, there is a, there is a person who just graduated high school.
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:04.040]   His name is Jack Cable.
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:05.800]   He's going to Stanford in the fall.
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:10.440]   He's one of the top, like in the top five, according to hacker one of all the hackers.
[01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:14.880]   He's doing an internship with DDS and finding all these security holes.
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:19.840]   And the point is now this person is doing it because they just want to like improve the
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:24.720]   security of websites so that bad people don't get in, bad actors don't get in.
[01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:26.360]   So it's a win across the board.
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:30.600]   You get better security at a cheaper price, industry best standard.
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:32.360]   You know, it's, it's the right way to do it.
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:35.160]   I love this tweet from the Defense Digital Service.
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:41.080]   Excited to have Jack H Cable come join the Rebel Alliance, DDS in just a couple of weeks.
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:43.280]   He's still going to Stanford, but he's going to work with DDS.
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:45.280]   Yeah, he's been a hero over the summer.
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:46.280]   And so cool.
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:47.280]   It's really great.
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:51.920]   And hacker one is one of the companies that runs the responsible disclosure programs for
[01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:52.920]   a lot of companies.
[01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:59.240]   I think they do GMs, John Motors bug bounty, bug bounty program and it's another one.
[01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:02.840]   So the benefit I understand to Jack Cable what the benefit is.
[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:07.080]   What's the benefit to the Marines or the Pentagon or GM?
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:08.760]   Why would they want somebody to hack them?
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:14.800]   Your systems get more secure, but previously people would pay for penetration testing, right?
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:19.440]   And they were paying something like $13,000 for every security vulnerability that they
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:20.440]   found.
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:24.160]   So you hack the Pentagon, the cost went to $1,086.
[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:25.160]   Wow.
[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:30.040]   So in order of magnitude cheaper, you find more security holes, you fix them faster.
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:32.200]   The white hats find them instead of the black hats.
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:34.800]   Like it's just across the board a great idea.
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:35.800]   It's a win all round.
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:36.800]   Yeah.
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:37.800]   Better faster cheaper.
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:38.800]   Interesting.
[01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:39.800]   Nice.
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:44.240]   And for automakers, same thing.
[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:45.880]   Yeah, they're they're finding a lot of stuff.
[01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:48.360]   You'd rather find these bug before a real hacker.
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:52.680]   Especially before we start getting autonomous vehicles on the road, you want to find those
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:57.480]   problems before somebody can take control of a fleet of a million autonomous vehicles
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:43:58.480]   and tell them all to the left.
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:00.640]   I could be the next die hard plot line.
[01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:05.880]   So there is one industry that has not ever done a bug bounty or a hackathon.
[01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:07.360]   It's the voting machine industry.
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:08.360]   Oh, really?
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:09.360]   Not fans.
[01:44:09.360 --> 01:44:16.000]   Not really fans of people showing how insecure they are.
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:21.080]   Nevertheless, Defcon this year had a running like Excel 98.
[01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:27.800]   Defcon going on this weekend in Las Vegas had for the second year running a voting village.
[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:34.160]   Organizers set up decommissioned election equipment, invited the hackers to find, according
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:38.800]   to BuzzFeed, creative and alarming ways to break in.
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:45.400]   Last year, conference attendees found new vulnerabilities in all five voting machines.
[01:44:45.400 --> 01:44:52.200]   This year in a room set aside for kid hackers, an 11 year old girl hacked a replica of the
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:57.480]   Florida Secretary of State's website within 10 minutes and changed the voting results.
[01:44:57.480 --> 01:44:58.480]   Wow.
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:01.040]   An 11 year old changed.
[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:03.520]   No, that was a bad word.
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:05.320]   We're not the real site.
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:11.160]   But you know, if an 11 year old can do it, I think the Russians probably could too.
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:12.880]   Oh, much quickly.
[01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:16.440]   Did you see the XKCD about voting?
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:18.680]   It's like 2030, I think.
[01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:23.160]   And it talks about, okay, if you ask a person who is an engineer for airplanes, I remember
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:24.160]   this one.
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:25.160]   How do you improve security?
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:27.080]   They're like, well, we iterate and things get a lot better.
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:28.320]   And then they say, how about elevators?
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:29.720]   Oh, there's multiple fail-safes.
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:32.520]   Basically, it's impossible for an elevator to fall now.
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:35.040]   And then they start to talk about voting systems.
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:38.000]   And they're like, oh, no, no, that's terrifying.
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:39.840]   You should not trust anything we do.
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:41.840]   It's a wonder no one dies.
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:48.040]   And then I don't know how to tell you this as the software engineer, but our entire field
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:49.840]   is bad at what we do.
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:53.360]   And if you rely on us, everyone will die.
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:56.720]   Well, they say they fixed it with something called blockchain.
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:59.640]   Ah, whatever they sold you, don't touch it.
[01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:02.280]   Barry, the desert, we're gloves.
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:08.360]   Did you see the West Virginia company that's going to use mobile voting?
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:10.120]   Mobile voting for overseas voters.
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:11.120]   These service members.
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:12.640]   But no paper trail.
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:14.680]   In fact, more and more, it's interesting.
[01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:19.120]   You wouldn't expect computer scientists to say this, security guys, digital folks to
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:20.120]   say this.
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:25.640]   But almost all of them now say the only way to Safeway to vote is on paper ballots.
[01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:26.640]   Yeah.
[01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:27.640]   Paper ballots.
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:28.640]   Paper and pens.
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:30.280]   Failing that, at least you need a paper trail.
[01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:32.200]   Yeah, at least backed by paper.
[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:35.600]   In fact, they're auditing now voting machines that they've given them.
[01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:36.600]   What was it?
[01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:40.520]   The district in Ohio that had 200 percent voter turnout?
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:41.520]   Georgia.
[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:42.520]   Georgia.
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:43.520]   That's right.
[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:44.520]   Two hundred percent.
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:47.840]   They really care about voting down there.
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:54.280]   In the United States, you know, if it gets over 30 percent, there's something wrong.
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:55.680]   Yeah, it's like what?
[01:46:55.680 --> 01:46:58.320]   243 percent voter turnout is between.
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:00.200]   Oh, two hundred forty three percent.
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:04.800]   Problem is these machines are the ones no one should use have no paper trail.
[01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:06.800]   So these are debold.
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:07.800]   Wow.
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:08.800]   Die bold.
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:09.800]   Die bold.
[01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:10.800]   Die bold.
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:12.800]   They wrote to us and told us how to pronounce it.
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:13.800]   I think it's debold.
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:14.800]   Die bold.
[01:47:14.800 --> 01:47:15.800]   Die bold.
[01:47:15.800 --> 01:47:19.920]   Machines that don't have a paper trail, you got to have at least an audit trail.
[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:21.760]   So there's going to be very difficult to audit.
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:23.520]   Show the receipts.
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:27.120]   And this is from the state primary election in May, one precinct.
[01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:30.120]   Well, did you see the Twitter?
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:34.120]   The 176 registered voters in Mud Creek.
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:36.120]   670 votes cast.
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:40.200]   They just vote early and often.
[01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:45.320]   Did you see the Twitter thread sort of deconstructing the votes website?
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:47.360]   They're the blockchain voting system?
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:48.360]   No.
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:50.000]   Let me see if I can find it.
[01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.120]   Who's Kevin Beaumont?
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:53.120]   Okay.
[01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:55.920]   So, and so he looks at the website.
[01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:58.920]   He's like out of date, SSH, Apache, PHP.
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:47:59.920]   Oh, I remember this.
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:01.840]   Pop three, plask.
[01:48:01.840 --> 01:48:03.840]   And then he just keeps going through.
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:05.480]   Please, really, plask.
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:06.480]   Yeah.
[01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:09.840]   At some point, votes comes in and is like, no, you don't understand.
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:13.800]   And then he's like, oh, don't understand where you left your source code on GitHub with hard
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:15.640]   coded usernames and passwords.
[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:19.920]   And it's a pretty bad cell phone.
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:20.920]   So.
[01:48:20.920 --> 01:48:23.040]   Lots of good actually information.
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:30.880]   Here's Rachel Tobac at the Defcon Hacking Conference learning how to gain physical, can get access,
[01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:36.880]   admin access to a voting machine requires no tools, takes under two minutes.
[01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:37.880]   What?
[01:48:37.880 --> 01:48:39.960]   It's used in 18 states this system.
[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:40.960]   What?
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:41.960]   You just press a button and it open.
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:42.960]   Yeah.
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:43.960]   Wait a minute.
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:44.960]   Let me just show you this.
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:45.960]   You can turn on my audio.
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:46.960]   Yeah.
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:47.960]   This is Rachel.
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:51.200]   The machine is used in 18 different states and it's extremely easy to get admin access
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:52.200]   on this machine.
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:53.600]   So let me show you how quick it is.
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:55.440]   It's about a little under two minutes.
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:57.880]   So by the way, this is the voting machine in the book.
[01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:01.120]   All of the students that actor would be to open up this machine by pressing this button
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:02.120]   right here.
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:06.720]   When it's off, removing the card reader.
[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:10.440]   Removing this, you don't need any tools to do this.
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:12.920]   Unplugging this, again, you don't need any tools to do this.
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:13.920]   Oh, wow.
[01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:15.920]   It goes the hard though.
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:20.320]   Turning it on, all you have to do is pick this lock here with a ballpoint pen.
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:21.320]   What?
[01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:24.000]   Press the red button.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:29.360]   And we're going to let it boot up here.
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:32.840]   And then I'll show you the admin access.
[01:49:32.840 --> 01:49:34.560]   This is a premier voting system.
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:36.400]   It's used in 18 states, kids.
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:37.400]   18 states.
[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:38.400]   Wow.
[01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:39.400]   This is not okay.
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:40.400]   Yeah.
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:41.400]   Rachel is great.
[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:42.400]   We actually interviewed her about social engineering.
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:45.400]   She's a very, very talented actor.
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:49.640]   So it's loading with what they call a security release.
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:50.640]   Looks like windows C.
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:51.640]   You see that?
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:56.800]   The problem is a lot of this stuff came up following the 2000 election.
[01:49:56.800 --> 01:49:59.800]   This is copyright 2003 to 2008.
[01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:00.800]   Yeah.
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:01.800]   This software running.
[01:50:01.800 --> 01:50:07.000]   There was a big push to update voting systems to get rid of hanging chats and all that.
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:10.520]   You're already going to see a couple of messages and all you have to do to bypass those error
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:15.360]   messages is just click cancel and okay.
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:17.360]   And now I have.
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:18.360]   You've got root.
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:19.360]   You've got root.
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:25.160]   All you had to do is really pull the hard drive and boot up to the front.
[01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:27.120]   Yeah, that's the boss you did.
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:33.720]   Does this make any, does anybody want to now start a voting booth company that would like
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:35.720]   have cameras in it?
[01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:36.720]   Oh, yes.
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:37.720]   No code that's open source.
[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:42.120]   Why should, why should voting be proprietary voting voting systems?
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:43.720]   Why should it be proprietary?
[01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:45.480]   Why should, why is it not open source?
[01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:49.240]   By the way, one of the few strengths we have in all this is that every county uses
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:50.720]   a different system.
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:53.760]   So it is, it's a little harder to have a monoculture.
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:55.680]   Yeah, there's not a monoculture, but you're right.
[01:50:55.680 --> 01:50:58.480]   This should be open source for one thing.
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:06.000]   We got to look at companies like Debold that don't really seem to care.
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:07.000]   It's depressing.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:08.800]   Anyway, it's going on right now at Def Con.
[01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:11.400]   I'm sure there'll be more like that to Rachel.
[01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:14.400]   Look, what else can be hacked?
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:16.800]   Everything can be hacked and everything.
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:19.000]   I still haven't been able to get pizzas for free though.
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:20.960]   Here's the good news.
[01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:24.560]   If it's going to be a world where everybody's hacking us, at least we're going to hack them
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:25.560]   right back.
[01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:26.560]   Sure.
[01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:32.280]   The Pentagon is building, this is from Wired, a dream team of tech savvy soldiers.
[01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:36.920]   This happened, and I'm sure Matt, you're aware of this a couple of months ago, when
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:42.720]   the US Army Cyber Command was given a given parody with all the other branches.
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:46.080]   It's basically a branch of the Pentagon.
[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:48.520]   And I have mixed feelings about this.
[01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:52.080]   I think we should have a defensive force.
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:57.000]   I worry about us creating which this is an offensive force.
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:01.400]   It's interesting because that article is about the team at the Defense Digital Service.
[01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:06.680]   Chris Lynch and that picture of the person that I have worked with.
[01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:11.880]   The idea is if you can figure out ways where you can do these defensive things, and there
[01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:13.720]   are lots of talented people in government.
[01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:18.400]   If you can find them and empower them and try to cut some of the red tape and improve
[01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:23.960]   the training, you can actually defend the country much, much better.
[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:28.960]   I worry though, and I know that Chris and everybody, these guys are going to be defensive.
[01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:32.320]   These guys are going to be responsible.
[01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:38.720]   I also know that the Pentagon is building an offensive arm, and I worry that we are going
[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:40.760]   to escalate this.
[01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:42.880]   We're not involved in any on the offensive stuff.
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:46.480]   We're just trying to figure out how can you do defensive stuff better.
[01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:50.000]   The name is Defense, so that's good.
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:54.440]   FCC says, "Yeah, we weren't hacked."
[01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:56.840]   No, really?
[01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:58.480]   No.
[01:52:58.480 --> 01:52:59.480]   But it wasn't our fault.
[01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:02.600]   It was that Obama guy.
[01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:09.920]   Adjut Pai said it was the former CIO at the FCC and Obama Administration Pointee who provided
[01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:14.480]   inaccurate information about this incident to me, my office, Congress, and the American
[01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:15.480]   people.
[01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:22.720]   The problem was the FCC was de-dossed by actual legitimate comments on their anti-net neutrality
[01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:23.720]   stance.
[01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:29.080]   The system, the comment system, once again, it's broken before, same subject actually.
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:30.600]   But it wasn't a malicious de-doss.
[01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:35.440]   It was people just trying to use the system as intended and overwhelmed it because they
[01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:37.560]   did something that was so ridiculous.
[01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:44.640]   Now the office of the inspector general, the FCC's own investigators have put out a report
[01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:54.920]   saying, "Basically, you're clueless at best untruthful at worst for more than a year.
[01:53:54.920 --> 01:54:00.520]   There isn't a conspiracy and you basically, we were never hacked."
[01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:01.520]   Okay.
[01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:02.920]   It never happened.
[01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:04.880]   Never happened.
[01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:08.720]   The real question is, was it de-dossed and down?
[01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:10.160]   Or was it de-dossed down?
[01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:13.160]   And then they kept it down because they didn't like the tenor of the comments.
[01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:14.160]   That's the real question.
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:15.600]   I don't know if the OIG has addressed that.
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:18.680]   I think that would be an interesting question.
[01:54:18.680 --> 01:54:22.680]   Did they intentionally keep it down because it wasn't going their way?
[01:54:22.680 --> 01:54:23.680]   Mr. Pai would never do that.
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:28.480]   We know there were a lot of phony comments, some from members of Congress that weren't
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:29.880]   really from the members of Congress.
[01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:32.720]   That irritated Congress a little bit.
[01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:33.720]   SnapChat source code.
[01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:35.760]   This is the annals of hacking.
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:38.760]   SnapChat source code has been leaked.
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:41.120]   It was briefly published on GitHub.
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:43.680]   It was the iOS version.
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:45.120]   It was pulled down immediately.
[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:48.400]   Seasoned to cyst.
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:51.400]   GitHub pulled down the whole thing.
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:55.880]   Nevertheless, I'm sure people got a copy of it.
[01:54:55.880 --> 01:55:03.480]   In fact, according to Motherboard, some people are actively trading the SnapChat source code.
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:05.280]   That usually ends up badly.
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:06.960]   They're not doing well.
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:07.960]   They're falling.
[01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:09.720]   They said they lost users.
[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:12.960]   I'm still using it.
[01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:13.960]   Good news.
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:17.800]   The Pentagon has now restricted the use of fitness trackers in secure facilities.
[01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:19.760]   Well, there goes your pajama.
[01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:21.960]   Much from a Fitbit step.
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:25.400]   This was a problem with Strava.
[01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:29.600]   People were able to figure out where a secret Pentagon Defense Department installations
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:33.320]   were because it turns out soldiers like to stay fit.
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:36.400]   A lot of them have Fitbit running around the perimeter of their bases.
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:40.400]   They could actually map it pretty well.
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:41.400]   It's about time.
[01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:43.200]   I think one general said, "What?"
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:45.600]   We're going to see if I can find the quote.
[01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:47.120]   I read it somewhere.
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:51.560]   You mean people are, "What?"
[01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:53.640]   He said, "I thought it was banned."
[01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:57.440]   They immediately put out a memo banning it.
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:01.680]   U.S. military troops and other defense personnel at sensitive bases or certain high risk war
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:06.480]   zone areas will not be allowed to use features on fitness trackers or cell phone apps that
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:08.160]   reveal their location.
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:11.240]   A new Pentagon order.
[01:56:11.240 --> 01:56:12.720]   Whoops.
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:14.480]   Are they even allowed to carry cell phones?
[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:17.080]   Because in some cases, not both carry or not.
[01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:20.840]   When you go with a Pentagon, do you have to like, you can carry a cell phone, but then
[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:26.520]   if you go to a SCIF, a secure compartmental information, then you would leave your phone
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:27.520]   outside.
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:28.520]   They have a bin that everybody likes.
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:29.520]   Is it like an umbrella bin?
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:32.520]   No, it's usually like a little post office body one.
[01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:33.520]   It's got to.
[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:34.520]   Here's a cubby.
[01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:35.520]   Get your little key.
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:36.520]   At least think of your little cubby.
[01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:37.520]   Oh, you get an individual cubby.
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:38.520]   You don't just all throw it like this.
[01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:39.520]   That's nice.
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:40.520]   No, no.
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:41.520]   Otherwise, how can you tell they all look the same?
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:42.520]   They all look the same.
[01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:43.520]   They all look the same.
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:44.520]   They all look the same.
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:45.520]   Oh, it has those phones.
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:46.520]   That's fine.
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:52.320]   Let's take a little break and we'll wrap things up in the minute.
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:53.320]   Great panel, man.
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:57.080]   It's so nice to have Sam Abul-Samanid, who writes for Navigate Research.
[01:56:57.080 --> 01:57:00.440]   He's a senior analyst there and is always bringing us interesting cars.
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:05.160]   This time a new Honda with a hydrogen fuel cell engine.
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:07.400]   It's an electric car, but it's powered not by batteries.
[01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:08.880]   Well, it has a little battery.
[01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:13.880]   It has a little hybrid battery for it to get regenerative braking and help the fuel
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:14.880]   cell out.
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:21.360]   But most of the time runs the wheels, the front wheel drive motor, electric motor is running
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:23.360]   off of hydrogen.
[01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:24.360]   Yeah, finally.
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:27.880]   I have an oxygen go into the fuel cell stack.
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:30.360]   It's turned into water and a flow of electrons.
[01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:32.360]   You know what I want to make it to do?
[01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:33.360]   She did a test drive.
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:34.800]   We'll have it on Saturday on the new screen.
[01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:39.240]   I wanted her to just lie under the exhaust pipe and drink.
[01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:40.800]   I've done that.
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:41.800]   Oh.
[01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:42.800]   Yeah.
[01:57:42.800 --> 01:57:43.800]   It's very dramatic.
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:48.000]   When I first started writing about cars, the very first car that I ever did a review of
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:51.840]   was a prototype Ford Focus Fuel Cell Vehicle.
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:54.800]   And you collected water from the tailpipe.
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:55.800]   Drink it.
[01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:57.120]   It's actually very pure.
[01:57:57.120 --> 01:57:58.960]   It's about as pure as you're going to get anywhere.
[01:57:58.960 --> 01:57:59.960]   Wow.
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:00.960]   Yeah.
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:03.000]   Or as some of us call us, die hydrosoxide.
[01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.000]   Yes.
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.720]   Be careful of the die hydrosoxide.
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:08.560]   You drank it straight out of the exhaust pipe.
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:10.760]   You're a bull man, Sam.
[01:58:10.760 --> 01:58:11.760]   Somebody's got to do it.
[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:12.760]   In the name of sign.
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:13.760]   Exactly.
[01:58:13.760 --> 01:58:17.160]   Florence Ayan, who has been here man more than anybody this week.
[01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:20.600]   You were here more than me practically all about Android host on Tuesdays.
[01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:26.280]   She came in early on Tuesday to do the note nine unveiling with Jason.
[01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:29.080]   Know how every Thursday you skipped this week though, right?
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:30.080]   No, we did this week.
[01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:31.080]   You did know how to.
[01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:32.080]   You skipped all about Android this week.
[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:33.080]   Oh, you skipped.
[01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:34.080]   Okay.
[01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:35.080]   You get some time off.
[01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:36.080]   It's great to have you.
[01:58:36.080 --> 01:58:38.040]   And where can we find your right deal?
[01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:39.040]   Yes.
[01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:41.080]   I'm wearing my Android shirt today, by the way.
[01:58:41.080 --> 01:58:42.080]   There's no pie on it though.
[01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:43.720]   Oh, you've got cupcake.
[01:58:43.720 --> 01:58:49.560]   So the other day I was trying to go through all of the desserts.
[01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:50.880]   So I starts with cupcake.
[01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:53.160]   That was the first public release, right?
[01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:54.960]   What were A and B?
[01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:57.680]   Well, cupcake was 1.5, I think, right?
[01:58:57.680 --> 01:59:00.400]   There was an A and B, Android A and Android B.
[01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:01.840]   I could have sworn there was.
[01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:12.000]   It was in the cupcake, donut, eclair, froyo, gingerbread, honeycomb, ice cream, jelly bean,
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:17.000]   Kit Kat, lollipop, marshmallow, nuke, Oreo.
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:20.000]   Cupcake was the first one to come out on the G1.
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:23.120]   So 1.0 and 1.1 were not named.
[01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:24.120]   They weren't named.
[01:59:24.120 --> 01:59:27.200]   There was an Android 1.1 and Android 1.0.
[01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:29.600]   So pie is the new one.
[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:31.080]   Interesting choice.
[01:59:31.080 --> 01:59:32.080]   It's a one syllable.
[01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:33.080]   Yes.
[01:59:33.080 --> 01:59:34.080]   Mm-hmm.
[01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:35.080]   Short of the nice cream sandwich.
[01:59:35.080 --> 01:59:36.080]   Yes.
[01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:37.080]   What do we do with Q?
[01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:39.440]   Well, there's a problem.
[01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:41.160]   I see a problem ahead.
[01:59:41.160 --> 01:59:42.160]   It's cute desserts.
[01:59:42.160 --> 01:59:43.160]   I think there are no cute--
[01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:46.240]   Resurts that start with Q.
[01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:47.240]   They're very few.
[01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:48.240]   Kish?
[01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:49.240]   No, that's not a dessert.
[01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:50.240]   That's not a cute one.
[01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:52.720]   The nice thing about pie though is it could be Kish or pizza.
[01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:53.720]   Vanilla Kish.
[01:59:53.720 --> 01:59:54.720]   Yeah, it could be anything.
[01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:55.720]   It doesn't have to be a dessert.
[01:59:55.720 --> 01:59:57.280]   Pie could be anything.
[01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:59.160]   Some people really hate the name pie.
[01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:00.160]   What?
[02:00:00.160 --> 02:00:03.720]   But it's better than P, which we were saying for a long time.
[02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:05.320]   Android P is not a good name.
[02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:10.720]   So I agree maybe pie isn't the best name, but it's better than P.
[02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:11.720]   Right?
[02:00:11.720 --> 02:00:15.960]   Speaking of Android though, that is Honda also running on KitKat.
[02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:16.960]   What?
[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:18.960]   The infotainment system is built on--
[02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:19.960]   No, there's a KitKat.
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:20.960]   KitKat.
[02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:21.960]   Android on there.
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:22.960]   That's ancient.
[02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:23.960]   Huh?
[02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:24.960]   They didn't put Android on there.
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:25.960]   Oh, it does have Android on there.
[02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:27.960]   But the base operating system was interesting.
[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:28.960]   It's interesting.
[02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:30.480]   Because most aren't mostly--
[02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:32.480]   Most of them running on QNX?
[02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:33.480]   QNX?
[02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:36.640]   That's the most popular one, but there's a bunch of cars out there that are running
[02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:37.640]   Android.
[02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:38.640]   Yeah, that's true.
[02:00:38.640 --> 02:00:39.640]   That's true.
[02:00:39.640 --> 02:00:40.640]   OK.
[02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:41.640]   Q like runs on Android.
[02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:42.640]   The chat is having a different phone.
[02:00:42.640 --> 02:00:44.640]   No, they're still on QNX, but they're switching on.
[02:00:44.640 --> 02:00:45.640]   OK.
[02:00:45.640 --> 02:00:47.760]   Somebody suggested I think they're right.
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:48.760]   Android quinoa.
[02:00:48.760 --> 02:00:51.280]   Quinoa quinoa quinoa quinoa quinoa quinoa quinoa quinoa quinoa quinoa quinoa quinoa.
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:53.640]   I really think Android quince jam would be good.
[02:00:53.640 --> 02:00:55.440]   They could also just skip it.
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:57.040]   They might just skip Q to write to R.
[02:00:57.040 --> 02:00:58.040]   Like it's just skip Q.
[02:00:58.040 --> 02:01:02.360]   It's like Q wasn't on the phone number pad for such a long time.
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:03.360]   Right?
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:04.360]   Oh, you're right.
[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:05.360]   Yeah.
[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:08.000]   That's all they say is that we're using the foam pad alphabet.
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.480]   Then you then you always have to explain it.
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:12.680]   Like, why is there no windows nine?
[02:01:12.680 --> 02:01:13.680]   Why is there no 14?
[02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:14.680]   Why is there no way?
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:16.680]   It's more like a storey build-up.
[02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:17.680]   That's all.
[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:18.680]   Oh.
[02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:21.400]   Our show today brought to you by WordPress.
[02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:23.280]   My blog is brought to you by WordPress.
[02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:24.280]   It has been for years.
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:25.360]   I love WordPress.
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:33.760]   I started using WordPress on a self-hosted site at great expense and a lot of hair loss
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:36.520]   in the early 2000s, Matt Mullenweg's.
[02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:38.320]   And then I realized, oh, I don't have to host it.
[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:39.320]   I could let them host it.
[02:01:39.320 --> 02:01:41.040]   WordPress.com.
[02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:44.760]   They take care of the hosting, the security, the software updates.
[02:01:44.760 --> 02:01:47.200]   This was kind of like a breath of fresh air for me.
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:48.640]   No longer do I have to worry about that.
[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:51.200]   I could focus on the content, the site.
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:55.840]   That's a really good thing because if you don't have a website, you don't own a place
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:58.560]   on the web, your Facebook page, that's not yours.
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:01:59.960]   That's Mark's.
[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:01.400]   Your Twitter account, that's not yours.
[02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:02.800]   That's Jack's.
[02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:05.320]   It's only your own web page that you really own.
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:08.400]   The best way to do it is at WordPress.com/twit.
[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:09.400]   No limits.
[02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:12.840]   Create the ultimate online presence that is uniquely yours.
[02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:16.960]   They have hundreds of templates so you could choose a style that fits yours.
[02:02:16.960 --> 02:02:18.520]   Put your good stuff up there.
[02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:25.920]   In fact, honestly, parents, if you're listening, when you have a baby, get your baby's name
[02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:27.560]   as .com registered.
[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:31.960]   And then as the kid gets older, get them a website because I got to tell you, if you
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:37.120]   don't have the website, if that's not the first thing that shows up when somebody searches
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:41.440]   for your name, you're not controlling your presence on the web.
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:42.440]   Somebody else controls it.
[02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:47.920]   Somebody else could post that picture of you looking terrible.
[02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:49.560]   Plus WordPress makes it so easy.
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:51.240]   It's your site, your home, your content.
[02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:55.840]   You can grow your audience and reach new customers with built-in search engine optimization.
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:59.280]   Mr. Webmaster Tools right here knows all about that.
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:06.840]   Social media features that make it possible for your fans, your readers, your community
[02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:11.280]   to publicize your site using their Facebook page and their Twitter feed.
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:12.720]   Great marketing tools too.
[02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:16.760]   The WordPress app on iOS and Android makes it very easy not only to post to your site
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:17.840]   but manage comments.
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:18.840]   I always do that.
[02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:19.840]   I love that.
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:21.360]   They have the best comment engine.
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:28.560]   And by the way, the Achismet spam plug-in is kingofthehill@wordpress.com.
[02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:32.040]   You can launch your website with confidence knowing that if there's any question at any
[02:03:32.040 --> 02:03:35.880]   time, they've got 24/7 support when you need it.
[02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:41.640]   And WordPress plans, it costs me more to host my own site just for the hosting alone than
[02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:43.640]   it would cost to go to WordPress.com.
[02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:46.120]   They started $4 a month.
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:50.520]   31% of all websites in the world run on WordPress.
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:57.480]   Shouldn't you get 15% off any new plan purchase right now, WordPress.com/twit.
[02:03:57.480 --> 02:04:13.040]   Any tips on how not to get recorded in the White House situation room?
[02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:15.040]   Anybody want to share that?
[02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:18.040]   I'm not done.
[02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:21.040]   I'm done doing work.
[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:24.040]   And don't it Sam?
[02:04:24.040 --> 02:04:25.040]   I see you have always been recorded.
[02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:26.040]   Wow.
[02:04:26.040 --> 02:04:28.040]   You've never been in the situation room?
[02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:29.600]   No, he's drinking water.
[02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:31.400]   He's drinking water.
[02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:33.240]   There seems like that wouldn't be possible.
[02:04:33.240 --> 02:04:34.240]   I don't know.
[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:35.240]   I'm just saying.
[02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:37.880]   All right, just moving on.
[02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:42.920]   You would think people in high office will also be using phones that were secured.
[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:45.520]   That's another issue.
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:49.640]   Are you going to buy a spot mini robot from Boston Dynamics?
[02:04:49.640 --> 02:04:55.120]   Boston Dynamics, the company that gave you the killer robot dog, right?
[02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:57.200]   It hasn't killed anybody or anything yet.
[02:04:57.200 --> 02:04:58.200]   We know of.
[02:04:58.200 --> 02:05:00.920]   They're getting ready to produce according to high school.
[02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:02.680]   Blackberry was a documentary.
[02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:03.680]   Yeah.
[02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:06.960]   Lots of spot minis.
[02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:13.520]   These are the robot dogs that they say they're going to sell to the consumers.
[02:05:13.520 --> 02:05:20.400]   Now, again, going back to the question of as an engineer, thinking about ethics of what
[02:05:20.400 --> 02:05:21.920]   are you going to do with this thing?
[02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:23.800]   Use it as an end table.
[02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:27.160]   Like it could follow you with a drink on top.
[02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:32.920]   You know what was a very popular device for a long time, especially overseas?
[02:05:32.920 --> 02:05:33.920]   Ibo.
[02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:34.920]   Ibo.
[02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:36.960]   And in fact, it's still so popular.
[02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:42.920]   There are people who trade old parts and things to keep theirs running because they love
[02:05:42.920 --> 02:05:44.960]   the companionship they get from these dogs.
[02:05:44.960 --> 02:05:46.600]   Well, Sony's bringing the Ibo back.
[02:05:46.600 --> 02:05:47.600]   Yeah, that's right.
[02:05:47.600 --> 02:05:48.600]   Wow.
[02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:52.120]   But I'm imagining something like this to be advertised for consumers would just be the
[02:05:52.120 --> 02:05:53.760]   dog that does not smell.
[02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:54.760]   What is this slide?
[02:05:54.760 --> 02:05:59.040]   I'm just slide from a boss and dynamic actual dog.
[02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:01.240]   I let yeah, my cat is spot.
[02:06:01.240 --> 02:06:04.480]   Many is the Android of robots.
[02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:09.440]   It's a robot platform that can do anything.
[02:06:09.440 --> 02:06:10.440]   Construction?
[02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:11.440]   Construction?
[02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:12.440]   I don't know what it's delivering here.
[02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:13.440]   What is it?
[02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:16.040]   It's delivering a positive destruction.
[02:06:16.040 --> 02:06:17.040]   Construction?
[02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:18.960]   Security, I believe, right?
[02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:20.280]   You see that coming to the door.
[02:06:20.280 --> 02:06:22.920]   You're not going to see a diamond.
[02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:23.920]   It's almost system.
[02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:24.920]   What is this doing?
[02:06:24.920 --> 02:06:25.920]   It's a laundry bag.
[02:06:25.920 --> 02:06:26.920]   It's sorting socks.
[02:06:26.920 --> 02:06:27.920]   It's carrying the laundry.
[02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:30.400]   Okay, I want this just for that alone.
[02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:33.000]   It looks like a bad Photoshop job on the home assistant.
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:34.000]   A little.
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000]   Don't get my laundry out of the dryer.
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.040]   And fold it and kill someone on the way back.
[02:06:38.040 --> 02:06:40.000]   It's pretty funny, but that's the point of the spot.
[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:41.840]   Many is you can add arms and.
[02:06:41.840 --> 02:06:45.400]   Okay, I admit my dog will not get the laundry for me.
[02:06:45.400 --> 02:06:47.680]   This is quite a lot.
[02:06:47.680 --> 02:06:51.920]   It's up to all of you to think of the application where you could get a basic spot.
[02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:55.680]   And either work with us or with others to build hardware and software that runs on that
[02:06:55.680 --> 02:06:56.680]   the subject.
[02:06:56.680 --> 02:06:57.720]   I would like to terrorize my neighbor.
[02:06:57.720 --> 02:06:59.520]   It's a platform.
[02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:00.520]   Okay.
[02:07:00.520 --> 02:07:02.720]   How do I do that?
[02:07:02.720 --> 02:07:04.320]   It's a platform.
[02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:09.600]   Actually, all joking aside, that kind of makes sense.
[02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:15.400]   Because we know platforms, the whole point of a platform, Microsoft Windows platform is
[02:07:15.400 --> 02:07:19.680]   that it's a stable place for developers to build upon.
[02:07:19.680 --> 02:07:22.040]   And we don't have a robot platform.
[02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:25.200]   And as we've seen from the videos over the last several years, this has gotten to be
[02:07:25.200 --> 02:07:27.040]   increasingly more stable.
[02:07:27.040 --> 02:07:30.040]   You know, you kick it now and it will stay up right now.
[02:07:30.040 --> 02:07:31.040]   Really?
[02:07:31.040 --> 02:07:32.040]   Yeah.
[02:07:32.040 --> 02:07:33.040]   Exactly.
[02:07:33.040 --> 02:07:34.040]   Literally a stable.
[02:07:34.040 --> 02:07:35.040]   Yeah.
[02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:36.040]   That's why it works for laundry basket.
[02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:37.040]   Exactly.
[02:07:37.040 --> 02:07:40.080]   Let's take a platform a little too literally in my mind.
[02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:41.240]   Here is and you tell me.
[02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:42.320]   They use the word.
[02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:47.040]   You know, you tell me how you feel about this.
[02:07:47.040 --> 02:07:50.800]   Oh my God, it's terrifying.
[02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:51.800]   It's terrifying.
[02:07:51.800 --> 02:07:54.360]   Now play the clip from that episode of Black Mirror.
[02:07:54.360 --> 02:07:56.560]   Now what if it wants to sort your socks?
[02:07:56.560 --> 02:07:57.560]   Yeah.
[02:07:57.560 --> 02:07:58.560]   I'd say take the socks.
[02:07:58.560 --> 02:07:59.560]   Please.
[02:07:59.560 --> 02:08:01.560]   It's going to let you take the socks.
[02:08:01.560 --> 02:08:04.720]   I don't know how I would feel about it with my delegates though.
[02:08:04.720 --> 02:08:05.720]   I'm sorry.
[02:08:05.720 --> 02:08:10.600]   I just don't think it has quite the touch.
[02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:12.320]   That is not how you dry.
[02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:15.640]   I think we should just wrap this up.
[02:08:15.640 --> 02:08:17.640]   Sock-sirting robot.
[02:08:17.640 --> 02:08:18.720]   What could go wrong?
[02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:20.720]   What could possibly go wrong?
[02:08:20.720 --> 02:08:24.120]   Oh look, it left a thumb drive in the lawn.
[02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:26.360]   Hold on a second.
[02:08:26.360 --> 02:08:31.280]   Make sure you'll plug it into all your computers and see if it'll read it.
[02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:35.280]   Let's get a big plug for the US digital service everybody.
[02:08:35.280 --> 02:08:42.440]   If you want to be instrumental in making the world, the government work better, this
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:43.960]   is a way to do it, right?
[02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:45.320]   It is.
[02:08:45.320 --> 02:08:48.560]   I would love to share one quick story.
[02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:51.480]   I went for a run and it was nearby.
[02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:55.080]   I don't know if you've heard of the Bodega Volunteer Fire Department.
[02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:56.080]   Oh yeah.
[02:08:56.080 --> 02:08:57.080]   Right?
[02:08:57.080 --> 02:08:58.080]   This is Santa Rosa.
[02:08:58.080 --> 02:08:59.080]   Yeah.
[02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:00.520]   There's a grant through FEMA.
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:03.640]   It's called the Assistance for Firefighters Grant.
[02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:10.400]   In the last full year gave out over $66 million to California, Volunteer and other fire
[02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:11.400]   departments.
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:12.400]   Oh, that's neat.
[02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:14.200]   The system is really hard to use.
[02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:19.240]   People who are up until 3 AM and need the system to be really simple and really robust
[02:09:19.240 --> 02:09:21.840]   can have a hard time applying for this.
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:27.280]   There are firefighting people using equipment right now that came via this grant.
[02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:30.960]   If the system's not good to use, if it's not up, if it's not robust, if it doesn't
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:36.280]   help with all of these complex rules, then people, communities might not have equipment,
[02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:38.360]   training and vehicles.
[02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:41.560]   That is literally a system that we are helping to improve right now.
[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:45.200]   Bodega Volunteer Fire Department got over a quarter of a million dollars through one
[02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:46.200]   of these grants.
[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:47.680]   That's a good thing.
[02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:53.320]   And yeah, and so if you've been following all of the stuff that's been happening with
[02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:55.880]   the Mnuchinia complex fires and all sorts of stuff like that.
[02:09:55.880 --> 02:09:56.880]   The way up?
[02:09:56.880 --> 02:09:57.880]   Yeah.
[02:09:57.880 --> 02:09:58.880]   It's not just firefighters.
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:01.480]   It is farmers, small businesses, it's doctors.
[02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:03.080]   You can help make this easier.
[02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:05.120]   By the way, they need a better looking website.
[02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:10.920]   It looks like comics sands in blue on a bright line green background.
[02:10:10.920 --> 02:10:12.160]   That is that specific fire department.
[02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:18.200]   But the point is, these are people who don't have time or maybe the expertise to really
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:19.200]   do this.
[02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:20.680]   And so it needs to be easy and simple for them.
[02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:24.040]   And if you don't think Bodega needs a good fire department, then you don't remember the
[02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:28.320]   movie The Birds, which took place in Bodega.
[02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:30.320]   And do you remember what happened?
[02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:34.400]   When the birds attacked the gas station in Bodega Bay?
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:36.720]   Do you remember what happened?
[02:10:36.720 --> 02:10:40.120]   This is why you need the US Digital Service.
[02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:45.720]   This is why you got to have a good volunteer fire department in Bodega.
[02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:47.560]   I wonder if they use this for their recruiting.
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:48.560]   It's quite a good opportunity.
[02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:49.560]   They're recruiting video.
[02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:51.520]   It's actually a beautiful area.
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:53.120]   Everybody's running in the gas station.
[02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:58.120]   Did you happen to see the picture that popped up the other day of all the birds in Bodega
[02:10:58.120 --> 02:10:59.120]   or somewhere?
[02:10:59.120 --> 02:11:05.720]   I think it was an updated version of The Birds, a new version of The Birds with scooters everywhere.
[02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:07.520]   Yes, bird scooters.
[02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:10.160]   Bird scooters are electric, thankfully.
[02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:12.880]   So this will never happen.
[02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:13.880]   Put away that cigarette.
[02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:14.880]   No, no, sir.
[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:15.880]   Oh, no.
[02:11:15.880 --> 02:11:18.000]   Don't throw that cigarette out the window.
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:19.000]   Oh, no.
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:20.000]   Oh, no.
[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:21.000]   Oh, no.
[02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.840]   This is going to end badly.
[02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:26.800]   This movie was hard to watch when I was a kid.
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:27.800]   Yeah.
[02:11:27.800 --> 02:11:29.800]   It was-- I did not sleep.
[02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:30.800]   It's gone.
[02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:31.800]   I saw it.
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:32.800]   Oh, man.
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:33.800]   It's out.
[02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:34.800]   Watch out.
[02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:35.800]   Oh, man.
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:36.800]   Oh, man.
[02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:37.800]   It's so awful.
[02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:38.800]   It's awful.
[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:39.800]   It's awful.
[02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:40.800]   It's awful.
[02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:41.800]   It's awful.
[02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:42.800]   It's awful.
[02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:43.800]   It's awful.
[02:11:43.800 --> 02:11:47.800]   The government systems are not always that literally dramatic, but--
[02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:48.800]   Oh, my gosh.
[02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:49.800]   --that's got to hurt.
[02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:50.800]   We still need help.
[02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:51.800]   We still need help.
[02:11:51.800 --> 02:11:55.120]   We're looking for engineers, designers, and product managers.
[02:11:55.120 --> 02:11:56.960]   You can do a short tour of duty.
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:11:58.960]   You do not have to worry about literal tire fire.
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:11:59.960]   No.
[02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:00.960]   I figured not why.
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:01.960]   Hitchcock is gone.
[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:02.960]   It's fine.
[02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:03.960]   We don't have to worry about any of that.
[02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:06.960]   It's usds.gov, the United States Digital Service.
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:09.960]   And if you click the Join Us link on the right there.
[02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:11.960]   What's your dress code?
[02:12:11.960 --> 02:12:13.960]   Our dress code is you have to wear clothes.
[02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:14.960]   I have worn this.
[02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:15.960]   I have worn this.
[02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:16.960]   I mean, I--
[02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:17.960]   Don't worry.
[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:19.960]   Most days you can dress like you are at any other startup.
[02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:20.960]   Okay.
[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:22.960]   In other words, shower flip flops and hoodies.
[02:12:22.960 --> 02:12:23.960]   Okay.
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:25.960]   So the team at the Pentagon wears hoodies.
[02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:28.960]   I have seen Chris Lynch, the guy that she saw a picture of.
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:29.960]   Really?
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:31.960]   And by the former Secretary of Defense wearing a hoodie.
[02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:32.960]   Oh, that's pretty cool.
[02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:33.960]   Wow.
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:35.960]   You can help your country and not have to wear a suit.
[02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:37.960]   Wait for Queen Elizabeth to do the first night.
[02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:38.960]   Matt.
[02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:39.960]   This is so nice to see you.
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:40.960]   It's good to see you too.
[02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:41.960]   We love you.
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:43.960]   We appreciate all your good work for us.
[02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:46.960]   And if any time you want to be here, we love having you.
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:47.960]   Thank you so much for having me on.
[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:48.960]   Matt cuts everybody.
[02:12:48.960 --> 02:12:49.960]   The greatest, right?
[02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:51.960]   Webmaster Tools for Years.
[02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:54.960]   He taught us how to do websites, how to get--
[02:12:54.960 --> 02:12:56.960]   ranked on Google.
[02:12:56.960 --> 02:13:00.960]   And now he's changing the country at usds.gov.
[02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:01.960]   Thank you, Matt.
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:04.960]   Florence Ion already gave you the plug.
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:05.960]   All the places she shows up.
[02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:06.960]   FlorenceIon.com.
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:07.960]   She's dynamic.
[02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:08.960]   She's wonderful.
[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:09.960]   FlorenceIon.com.
[02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:11.960]   Oh, that flow on the Twitter.
[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:15.960]   Oh, H-T-H-A-T-F-L-O on the Twitter.
[02:13:15.960 --> 02:13:16.960]   Sam, what's your Twitter handle?
[02:13:16.960 --> 02:13:17.960]   Sam Abul.
[02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:18.960]   Sam Abul.
[02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:19.960]   Sam-Ed.
[02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:20.960]   And you can find all the--
[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:21.960]   Wait a minute.
[02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:23.960]   You can't just say Sam Abul.
[02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:26.960]   Sam, and then expect people to find you.
[02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:27.960]   Ab-- wait a minute.
[02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:28.960]   Let me see if I can do it.
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:29.960]   Okay.
[02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:31.960]   Sam Abuel.
[02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:32.960]   Samid.
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:33.960]   Absolutely correct.
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:34.960]   Abul.
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:35.960]   Samid.
[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:36.960]   It's not that hard.
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:37.960]   No, just like it sounds.
[02:13:37.960 --> 02:13:38.960]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:40.960]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:42.960]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m.
[02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:43.960]   Pacific, 6 p.m.
[02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:45.960]   Eastern, 2200 UTC.
[02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:48.960]   It's always nice to have you here if you can watch live.
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:50.960]   You can do that on the stream at twit.tv/live.
[02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:53.960]   You've got a choice of video and audio streams.
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:57.960]   If you are watching live or listening live, please join us in the chatroom.
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:13:58.960]   IRc.twit.tv.
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:03.960]   That's a great place to hang out with the rest of the kids in the back of the class who are watching the show.
[02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:05.960]   You can also be here in studio.
[02:14:05.960 --> 02:14:06.960]   We had a nice studio audience today.
[02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:07.960]   You guys are very welcome.
[02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:08.960]   Thank you for coming by.
[02:14:08.960 --> 02:14:09.960]   Your family left, huh?
[02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:10.960]   They couldn't take it.
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:12.960]   They said, "Enough of that."
[02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:14.960]   We had a family in here at one point.
[02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:17.960]   Anyway, email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:19.960]   We have toys for the kids.
[02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:21.960]   They can drive my little mini Tesla.
[02:14:21.960 --> 02:14:23.960]   Have an energy bar.
[02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:25.960]   All the candy they can eat.
[02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:26.960]   You can have coffee.
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:27.960]   All the candy I can eat.
[02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:28.960]   Yeah.
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:29.960]   And she can eat a lot.
[02:14:29.960 --> 02:14:30.960]   I take a lot of candy home.
[02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:32.960]   Every time you're here, I notice there's a difference.
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:33.960]   I know everybody notices that.
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:34.960]   You know what?
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:36.960]   Being paid in candy is not a bad gift.
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:38.960]   And I say own it.
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:39.960]   Take some candy.
[02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:42.960]   I have been for the last nearly 3 years.
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:44.960]   Speaking candy after every show.
[02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:46.960]   I say that in part because I'm going to take some candy.
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:47.960]   You know what?
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:49.960]   It's a one hour drive for me home.
[02:14:49.960 --> 02:14:51.960]   You're all welcome to take all the candy you want.
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:53.960]   I give you permission.
[02:14:53.960 --> 02:14:54.960]   It's nice that you do that.
[02:14:54.960 --> 02:14:55.960]   Well, I appreciate the candy.
[02:14:55.960 --> 02:14:57.960]   If you'd like to take some candy and watch the show,
[02:14:57.960 --> 02:14:59.960]   email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:04.960]   We'll put some candy in the bowl for you before flow gets here.
[02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:05.960]   You can also--
[02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:06.960]   A bowl on each seat.
[02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:08.960]   What we could do that, sure.
[02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:12.960]   It's like working for Willy Wonka, isn't it?
[02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:13.960]   Yeah.
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:14.960]   Come on in.
[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:15.960]   I've got to go in and take it.
[02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:17.960]   Yeah.
[02:15:17.960 --> 02:15:20.960]   You can also watch "On Demand."
[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:22.960]   We make audio and video versions of the show available.
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:25.960]   In fact, all our shows at Twit.tv
[02:15:25.960 --> 02:15:28.960]   or subscribe in your favorite podcast application.
[02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:31.960]   So far, not banned by Marco Arment.
[02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:35.960]   You can go overcast, stitcher, slacker, iTunes,
[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:37.960]   wherever you get your podcast subscribed.
[02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:39.960]   You can even ask your favorite voice assistant.
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:43.960]   You could say, "Echo, listen to Twit."
[02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:44.960]   And it'll play it.
[02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:47.960]   I think you might-- if you want the podcast, say this week in tech,
[02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:50.960]   if you want Twit Live, most of the assistants will play the livestream, too.
[02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:51.960]   Listen to Twit Live.
[02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:54.960]   And when you're done listening to all those, you can listen to wheel bearings.
[02:15:54.960 --> 02:15:57.960]   Ah! That's Sam's podcast, Wheel Beringz.
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:15:59.960]   Where is that? Where's the network?
[02:15:59.960 --> 02:16:00.960]   Wheelberingz.media.
[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:04.960]   No network. It's just me and Dan Roth every week turn on the Skype
[02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:08.960]   and jabber on for an hour, hour and a half or so and talk about cars
[02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:12.960]   and transportation and all the fun stuff that's going on.
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:15.960]   So, Blow also has her own podcast on the relay network.
[02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:16.960]   We do.
[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:17.960]   We do.
[02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:18.960]   We do.
[02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:19.960]   We do.
[02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:20.960]   It's called Material.
[02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:21.960]   Andy and Nucco.
[02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:22.960]   Hey!
[02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:25.960]   We talk about Google very indefinitely, very passionately.
[02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:26.960]   And do you have a podcast?
[02:16:26.960 --> 02:16:27.960]   I don't.
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:28.960]   I feel like I need a podcast now.
[02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:29.960]   You just got a podcast.
[02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:30.960]   You've got the t-shirt.
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:31.960]   Now get the podcast.
[02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:32.960]   I'm not interesting enough.
[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:33.960]   It's a lot of work, by the way.
[02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:34.960]   It's a lot of work.
[02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:35.960]   It is a lot of work.
[02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:37.960]   Just come here whenever you feel like podcasting.
[02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:38.960]   I thought about that.
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:39.960]   And when I retire, that's what I'm going to do.
[02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:41.960]   I'm going to appear on other people's podcasts.
[02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:42.960]   I'm going to be in my audience.
[02:16:42.960 --> 02:16:43.960]   We got it.
[02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:44.960]   Yeah!
[02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:45.960]   I don't need all this.
[02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:46.960]   I can just be on your show.
[02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:47.960]   Yeah.
[02:16:47.960 --> 02:16:48.960]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:49.960]   I'm going to stay here for a while though.
[02:16:49.960 --> 02:16:50.960]   Don't worry.
[02:16:50.960 --> 02:16:51.960]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:16:51.960 --> 02:16:52.960]   We'll see you next time.
[02:16:52.960 --> 02:16:53.960]   Another Twitch is in the can.
[02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:54.960]   Easy.
[02:16:54.960 --> 02:17:01.960]   [music]
[02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:03.880]   It's a twin. Alright. Do it in the twin.
