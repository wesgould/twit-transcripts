[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.040]   It's time for Twit this weekend tech.
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.600]   Show where we cover the latest tech news.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.360]   This is the millennial edition.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.600]   I don't know if we did that on purpose.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.400]   I think we did.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.160]   Because everybody here is young, except from Waugh.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.080]   Alex, you're the old man of the group.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.440]   At 26, if that's true, I'm going to find a nice bridge
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.080]   on the way home and fling my carcass on it.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.080]   But yeah, yeah, I'm kind of--
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.400]   I'm more than twice your age.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.680]   And you're twice as cool.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.560]   No.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.720]   Well, although Lauren Hockenson says,
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.960]   you're an old man in the young man's body.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.360]   I don't endorse that comment.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.560]   That's her personal conjecture.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.640]   Lauren is with the next web.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.600]   Nice to have you.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.320]   Alex, was it TechCrunch?
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.160]   Where are you going?
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.400]   I'm still TechCrunch to the end of the year.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.840]   So I'm not--
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.120]   I'm not much longer.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.400]   I want to go for a walk.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.480]   I'm joining a company called Mattermark.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.240]   There's Mattermark.com if you want to look it up.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.960]   They do a lot of data on private startups.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.880]   And I'm going to join as their editor in chief.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.120]   And I'm going to be doing a lot of analysis
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.880]   and research on that.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.680]   So I'm going to be doing a lot of analysis.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.120]   I'm going to be doing a lot of analysis.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.760]   I'm going to be doing a lot of analysis.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.000]   I'm going to be doing a lot of analysis.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.960]   I'm going to be doing a lot of analysis.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.400]   I'm going to be doing a lot of analysis.
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.800]   I'm going to be doing a lot of analysis.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.240]   I'm going to be doing a lot of analysis.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.640]   I'm going to be doing a lot of analysis.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.160]   I'm going to be doing a lot of analysis.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.600]   I'm going to be doing a lot of analysis.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.040]   I'm going to be doing a lot of analysis.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.080]   I'm going to be doing a lot of analysis.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.440]   I'm going to be doing a lot of analysis.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.600]   I'm going to be doing a lot of analysis.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.040]   I'm going to be doing a lot of analysis.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.600]   So their mission is different, but are you going to be for investors or are you going to be a public face?
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.280]   I think more on public face, I'm definitely going to be writing for a general broad audience.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.760]   I don't think any restrictions on what I can or can do.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.360]   I think this will come on the show.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.480]   Sounds like a great gig.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.280]   I'm very excited.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.160]   I'm really happy for you.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.200]   Congratulations.
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.320]   Also with this, and this is her first time, and I'm really thrilled.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.040]   In fact, I only met her last week, and she's only heard twice, but I was so impressed.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.440]   I said, "You're coming back Liberty Madison."
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.560]   Thank you so much, will you?
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.120]   libertymedicine.com/tag that tech girl.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.000]   That's me.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.840]   #thattechgirl.
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.520]   And so nice to have you.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.240]   You cover, it says, "You're the startup life for the millennial."
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.040]   That's correct.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.640]   And you're absolutely right.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.960]   Last week was my first time actually singing to it.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.280]   And thank you so much for inviting me back.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.480]   This is a baptism by fire because welcome, because it isn't...
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.760]   It's an unusual round table, but I've already told you the ground rules,
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.680]   which is just inject yourself at any point.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.600]   And if possible, that's not all talk at once.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.400]   And that's about it, right?
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.360]   Right.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.360]   And I think you'll all have opinions about most of these stories.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.160]   There's a...
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.880]   This is normally kind of a slow week, to be honest, as we get the run up to Christmas.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.480]   But there was a lot of news this week.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.720]   Next week, I should just mention a programming note.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.480]   We are going to do our traditional holiday gathering.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.440]   And Paul and Storm will join us, O-Dokta, the GizWiz musical performance from the Deena Hollicks.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.960]   You should enjoy them.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.440]   And it's fun.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.520]   And it's going to be kind of more comedy less news,
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.760]   because really, two days after Christmas is more comedy.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.360]   More comedy, no news.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.400]   No news.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.120]   No news.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.760]   It's pretty bad.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.560]   No news.
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.120]   But it's awesome.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.680]   Go into it.
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.960]   And then the following week will be our best of.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.120]   And I think it's too late now.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.560]   At this point, it's pretty locked.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.040]   Although I suppose you could submit some last-minute things,
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.640]   because I do have a few more moments to pick.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.760]   But we're almost there.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.880]   Fit.tv/bestoff for last-minute submissions.
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.640]   And of great note, this is Jason Howell's last time running the board for this week in tech.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.720]   We've moved him upstairs to full-time hosting.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.920]   He and Megan Maroney are going to host our new TNT,
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.520]   which will be at a new time.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.080]   We're moving it from 10 in the morning to 4 in the afternoon,
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.720]   Pacific 4th, Pacific 7 p.m. Eastern.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.840]   That's right at midnight UTC.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.600]   And the idea is that we want to get capture all the tech news of the day
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.840]   and have a show ready for you in the morning on your commute.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.440]   So I think that's a good time.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.640]   I would agree.
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.560]   Hangouts message from somewhere.
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.120]   I'm not really.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.920]   Is that you or me?
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.120]   I think that might be you.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.560]   Well, I don't want people to hang out messaging me right now, that's for sure.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.480]   I'm thinking.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.760]   I'm thinking some type of phone.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.320]   No, it's not.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.960]   No, it's me.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.200]   It was loud enough that it's probably coming from my computer.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.160]   So.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.080]   Anyway, thank you, Jason, for really--
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.040]   How long have you been doing this?
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.600]   Two years?
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.040]   Well, not actually not even.
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.320]   I think it started.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.400]   It was like September or October of last year.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.880]   So.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.240]   Yeah, more than a year.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.280]   Yeah, a little more than a year.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.280]   Placing Chad Johnson, oh, I'm just Chad.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.000]   But you know, nobody really lasts long.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.960]   Because I'm a son of a gun.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.360]   But you did a great job and you're moving to all about Android,
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.000]   you'll continue to do.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.280]   You'll do TN2.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.440]   Actually, TNT is kind of folding into it.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.320]   And looking forward to your daily take.
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.080]   Of course, you were for many years, the producer and board on
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.120]   First Buzz Out Loud and then the original TNT.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.360]   So you've always been a big contributor to our new software.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:57.440]   I kind of have tech news on a daily scale in my blood at this point with 10 years
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.880]   behind me.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.680]   Now comes the hard part of stepping out from behind
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:06.880]   all of the technology and actually talking somewhat smartly about it.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.080]   It's going to be fun to see how it goes.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.200]   You know what?
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.080]   I'm looking forward to it.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.560]   It is good.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.760]   I think you're going to have a great time.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.240]   Thank you.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.320]   And we thank you for your work here.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.040]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.560]   We're promoting a guy into your position,
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.160]   who's been around for a while.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.280]   We found him in the chat room.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.000]   He was effing done.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.520]   And there still is effing done in the chat room.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.360]   He's Jason Clanthes.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.080]   He is moving into the role that you have,
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.760]   which is my regular producer and technical director.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.680]   So welcome, Jason Clanthes.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.040]   It's going to be easy for me.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.560]   I called Eileen Elaine for about a year.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.600]   So we've decided now that we should only have people with the same name.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.120]   Name the board.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.400]   Jason's forever moving forward.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.360]   I like that.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.080]   That's the only thing that can happen.
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:08:00.320]   So bad old Congress, they snuck Sissa into the appropriations bill and passed it.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:00.960]   And you know what?
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.920]   It's going to become law, regardless.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.960]   So this was a bill that many of us tried to fight against.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.760]   I thought it was a bad idea.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.000]   The Electronic Frontier Foundation thought it was a bad idea.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.160]   It's the Cyber Security Information Sharing Act of 2015.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.560]   And I think a lot of tech companies had mixed feelings about it.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.800]   Mixed to bad, I think, was the general gist.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.960]   I mean, there's a lot of privacy concerns.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.200]   There's too much legal indemnity for companies that share information with the government.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.520]   And there were amendments made to Sissa throughout the year.
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.400]   It didn't pass.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.680]   And a lot of those amendments, by the way, that would protect our privacy have been
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.640]   eliminated.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.320]   So this is the worst version of the bill that's not in push as part of a budget.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.680]   It's kind of a disgrace, actually.
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.320]   I don't know what to do.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.360]   But this is for those of you not in the US.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.600]   This is how the American political system works.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:53.040]   It's very common for little writers and things to sneak in the bigger bills,
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.160]   earmarks, things like that.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.680]   And this is not at all unusual.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.440]   The problem is, without this appropriations bill, the government would shut down.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.720]   So you can't not pass it.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.840]   Therefore, it's going to be in there.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.720]   So now we're all sunk.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:02.880]   And there is--
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.480]   And the work we did was moot.
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.520]   And there is no in the United States ability to line in a veto individual parts of a bill.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.360]   You approve it or you disapprove it.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.520]   The president will undoubtedly sign it.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.800]   It's his bill, basically.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.840]   It's his compromise bill.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.800]   So along with Paul Ryan.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.880]   So I think we're getting Sissa.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.080]   Now, the reason I say that tech companies might have had a mixed opinion about this,
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.080]   Facebook, Apple, Google, also, it's a terrible idea.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.640]   But apparently Facebook behind the scenes was lobbying to pass it because it gets them off the
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.360]   hook.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.440]   They can no longer be sued for giving up your private information.
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.120]   I find that to be too much wiggle room for the corporations.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.400]   I think it's too broad to move.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.040]   It's bad to move.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:43.520]   It's bad to move.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.400]   No liability.
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.720]   And by the way, there doesn't have to be a warrant.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:54.960]   They can just say, hey, you know, this guy, Alex Wilhelm, he's been
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.680]   painting the butt.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.120]   So would you go arrest him?
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:57.760]   And they can.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:02.160]   And even if they arrested you and it was false pretenses and you sued the government,
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.640]   and you can't sue the government, you can't sue this company.
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.680]   Well, that wouldn't be true before, but not coding to Facebook as part of the bargain.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.160]   Right.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.200]   I just find it really sad that we worked on this in Congress and in the media,
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.040]   in public sphere for a couple of years now.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:13.520]   Kind of show.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.080]   And instead of that, all that stuff we did to try to make it better and
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.280]   add our privacy protections, we're passing it in this really, really disgraceful way.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.560]   I mean, this is Congress at its worst, which is saying a lot.
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.600]   I know it's a big statement.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.640]   So it's usually pretty far down to the tree already, but this is really sad.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.560]   So what do you think that means for the average American learning about this bill,
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.680]   possibly for the first time?
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.760]   How is this affecting their interaction with privacy?
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.000]   Because obviously everyone here knows what's going on.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.880]   And what is that?
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.840]   What, how is that going to affect them?
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.280]   But what is the average person?
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.320]   How is that going to affect their daily life?
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.840]   What do you tell mom about Facebook?
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.120]   I mean, day to day, it's not.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.960]   I mean, people are going to still be using Facebook and all of these different social
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.880]   media organizations, the way that they've always done.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.080]   The platform isn't going to change.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.520]   People aren't going to suddenly decide to not do it because it affects their privacy.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.560]   Only people who really care about it are really going to jump ship.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.600]   And it's also important, I think, now looking forward to see how this is going to affect how
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.760]   platforms report on warrants for police search and for surveillance.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.160]   Because obviously as a part of transparency measures, they do release yearly reports.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:19.600]   And I mean, the US has always been far and away the country with the most warrants for
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.840]   search on these sorts of platforms, especially on Facebook.
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.080]   It's like far and away.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.280]   Always the US has the most.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.880]   So I think that what we're going to see here is, you know, I think that it's going to mean
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:34.560]   that there are going to be more opportunities for the local law enforcement and for the
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.200]   government to tap into these sorts of stores of information.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.880]   This isn't about local law enforcement.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.640]   This is about broader cyber security, right?
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:46.120]   This is a much different kind of bill than bills used to bring local law enforcement information
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.120]   about us.
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.480]   Well, yes and no, right?
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:52.720]   So you still have to have local, you still have to have a law enforcement body enacted
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.280]   for SSA to be enforced.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.280]   Oh, certainly, but not local.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.280]   Yes, local.
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.120]   You're pleased to borrow some more than your cyber security.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.120]   I just local.
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.520]   No, because it's, you know, because that's the thing.
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.800]   It says it's cyber security, but it's really data sharing.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:10.720]   So it means that any law, any government organization, not even necessarily law enforcement, can
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.520]   go to Facebook and say, we'd like some information about this.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:17.200]   The thing is Facebook could still resist, but there's no legal incentive for them to
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.200]   resist.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.840]   They're no longer liable if they hand it over.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.320]   And this is my fear is that they just going to say fine.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.760]   You know, maybe not because we're people who are paying attention.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.240]   That's why they do these transparency reports now is because people were paying attention.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.760]   Apple maybe will continue to fight that fight.
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.160]   Twitter's been very good about fighting that fight, but I also feel like there's let they
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.400]   don't have the, the, the stick.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.520]   They have the care up, not the stick to make them fight for our privacy.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.960]   I think the, I think to answer your question, Liberty, it's really people should just, it
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.160]   just reinforces what we've said all along.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.160]   If you put it on the internet, it's public.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.200]   That's why exactly.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.840]   Do they have the opportunity to say, Hey, we can make your information private and are
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.800]   they who was going to uphold them to that?
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:58.800]   They don't, they don't have it.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.640]   Once you put it out there, it's, it's kind of public.
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.640]   Right.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.080]   So even if, you know, Facebook says, well, no, this is your private and they're all kind
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.640]   of it's in there.
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:13.080]   If I'm going to be fair, we should mention that the San Bernardino shooters posted in
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:19.280]   private direct messages, private Facebook messages, their intent, or at least their allegiance
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.960]   to ISIS, but that wasn't something the government could see.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.960]   In fact, people who the New York Times wrote an article saying it's a shocking thing that
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:32.340]   our intelligence didn't know this when in fact they've, their, their own internal ombudsman
[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:33.600]   spanked them over this.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:36.360]   Margaret Sullivan said that no, that's, that's shameful.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:40.120]   That was bad reporting because there was no way the government could have seen these private
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.120]   messages.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.120]   Well, guess what?
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.120]   I don't know.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.520]   Well, to a certain extent, I don't want to over blow how much information Sharon's going
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.440]   to happen as part of SISA, but may not you're saying well, it's going to be a lot, but
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.880]   it's not going to be, I think, centered around individual communications and things can be
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:58.120]   more dumps regarding to cyber intrusion, cyber attacks, that sort of thing.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.120]   So it's not just going to be like prison monsteroids going back to the NSA program, but instead
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.400]   more of a way just to get more of a way to get more into the government without legal
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.320]   safe protections for us because we can't sue.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.320]   Right.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.320]   That's the scary part.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.240]   I think it's a lot of a larger broken, not sex security position that we're in.
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.240]   It makes me sad.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.000]   It's not this, you know, panopticon they're bringing down upon our social media profiles
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   in the short term.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.640]   I think it definitely sets the precedent.
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:19.640]   So you can.
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:20.640]   The negative precedent.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:21.640]   Of course.
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.640]   Oh, we'll make the biggest point though.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.140]   The average American is politically as political activists in a box of cornflakes, but I don't
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.120]   really think they don't really care much.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:30.080]   They just want to look at cat gifts on Facebook.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.080]   See, I worry, but you said the word data done, but that worries me because that means
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.240]   that law enforcement, my Facebook can't get in trouble for doing this, whether they do
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.240]   it or not.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:43.880]   But they could say, well, you know, we noticed the word Islam used in 10,000 posts.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.880]   Here they are.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.040]   And giving that to the federal government with with no risk for them.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.040]   That could happen.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.360]   I don't know if Facebook would do that, but that could happen, right?
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:54.240]   That I don't mind understanding that could happen.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.480]   I doubt that it would given the cybersecurity folks of the bill, but I again, let's very
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.480]   much hope not.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.280]   That would be a really sad turn on.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.680]   Again, I think the lesson everybody should learn every time we hear about data breaches
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:10.840]   and now SISA is if you're putting it on the internet, you might assume that others might
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.280]   see this, including law enforcement.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.280]   I think that's the takeaway.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.280]   Think happens for encryption.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.280]   Don't snapchat your comments.
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.280]   Well, we'll handle that later.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.680]   That'll be another budget bill next year, right?
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:20.680]   We'll ruin that.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.680]   Q2 16.
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.680]   Scary.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:28.760]   And, you know, I have to say probably terrorists have long known this.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.120]   This is not news to bad guys.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:32.120]   Don't post it on Facebook.
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.120]   Right?
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.120]   Oh, they found my Facebook.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.120]   It's only stupid.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.680]   What are you doing?
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:40.640]   How many times have bad guys been caught because they posted pictures of them, you know, holding
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.640]   the money?
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:42.840]   Like I said, don't snapchat your crimes.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.440]   That happens all the time.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.440]   Don't.
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.440]   You got a bumper sticker for that?
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.440]   Just like hand them out.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.440]   Don't snapchat schools.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.880]   I think this should we should add a sticker to Lauren Hockinson's laptop here says don't
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.760]   snapchat that crime, bro.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:55.760]   Thank you, but no vacancy.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:56.760]   Sorry.
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:57.760]   I'll fake it.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.400]   No, there's layers.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.400]   You can go layers.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.560]   You could have another layer.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.640]   So Lauren is far too cool for Snapchat.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.800]   So no, you.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.840]   By that, I don't.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.800]   I'm, I'm really bad at it.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.800]   I'll be honest.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.240]   I brought you kids here because you're.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.240]   I'm not.
[00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.240]   Snapchat with your who loops.
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.240]   All right.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.680]   Yeah, your hula hoops and your skateboards and your snaps.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.680]   Young kids.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.200]   Your steps to at Leel a port.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.200]   I should have trapped.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.160]   Actually, this is a sure sign that Snapchat is over.
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.880]   I snapchat.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:25.880]   So that's a sure sign.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.360]   There's no Snapchat happening in the younger people.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.440]   They'll find something where their dad isn't snapchatting.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.840]   What would you freak out if your mom's snapchatted you?
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.280]   No, because it would probably be some kind of dark hallway.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.280]   My mom being like, it's a snap.
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.720]   Look, you know, just not.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.720]   It's there, but it's not clear.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.720]   Oh, the limity snapchatting right now.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.720]   Hashtag that tech girl.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.720]   Snail and.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.720]   Let's get that trendy.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.720]   There we go.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.720]   Let's get it.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.480]   What does that mean, by the way?
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.480]   Why do you have a hashtag?
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.480]   I don't have a hashtag.
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.480]   Why don't you have a hashtag?
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.480]   Let's talk about that.
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.480]   I'm not so good at watching.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.480]   You should have a hashtag.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.480]   Why don't you have a hashtag?
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.480]   Well, lower be hashtag.
[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.360]   We Leo would be hashtag curmudgeon.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.720]   And I don't know what I'm not a curmudgeon.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.720]   You're a curmudgeon.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.720]   I'm pleasant and happy like a warm sunrise.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.000]   This is an open door.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.320]   I can't walk into.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.840]   So I'm going to safely remove myself from this conversation because I've got a list of hashtags.
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.440]   I can really work for you.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:19.720]   I have a hashtag because I was unfortunate enough to get at Liberty.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.720]   You've got at Alex.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.360]   Oh, yeah, he paid for that.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.360]   You've got that.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.360]   You bought at Alex $60.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.360]   That's amazing.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.800]   I should have just got my name.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.800]   I would have been smart at Liberty Madison.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.400]   At Liberty would have been awesome.
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.200]   Except that then Isis would target you.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.680]   I think they do now.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.680]   Liberty Madison.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.680]   Liberty Madison.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.680]   I think people confuse you with Ashley Madison.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.680]   Exactly.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.680]   That has happened so many times.
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.120]   It actually has Ashley Madison.
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:45.120]   I get some of that traffic.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.960]   So I'm a pleasure for that.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.960]   So thank you.
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.320]   And I asked you this when I met you.
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.320]   This is your real name.
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.680]   This is not some fanciful.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.680]   It happens to be a fantastic name.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.680]   Your parents have a great.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.680]   Really?
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.000]   You know, I tell parents that.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.720]   I say if you're going to name your kid nowadays, you want to check the URL.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.720]   Make sure it's available.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:02.720]   Definitely.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:03.720]   Check the Twitter handle.
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.920]   Register it if it's so you need.
[00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:09.720]   If you don't name a kid, John Smith now, you have to name a Josephus.
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.280]   Josephus, you know, something make it up so that it's unique because you need.
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:15.520]   Don't you think Josephus Smith will burger nozzle?
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.520]   Yeah.
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:17.520]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.520]   That's fine.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.520]   I think that's a trap.
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.520]   I don't know.
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.520]   But I come with a naturally SEO.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.520]   Yeah.
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.520]   Unfriendly or friendly?
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.520]   Depending on who you are.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.960]   You only learn how to do it in the world.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.600]   Liberty Madison is awesome.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.600]   But you definitely have to.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.560]   And I say if you're going to name a child, you have to check to see if other people have
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.560]   the URLs.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.560]   Like you said, I agree.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:39.840]   If check the major sites, Instagram, Twitter, and if not, register if they already have
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.520]   that name, you kind of changed that kid's name.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.120]   I got I got I got it.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:44.120]   It's different direction.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.120]   I got it.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.120]   It's Instagram first.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:48.480]   When my kids were born, I got Abby Laporte dot com and Henry Laporte dot com.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.640]   And I registered it for 20 years.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:52.000]   I figured if in 20 years, they don't want it.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Well, yeah, you can.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.840]   And I said if 20 years, they don't want it well then.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.840]   There you go.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:01.400]   No, I just actually talked to the CEO whose wife is actually due to give birth any day
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.400]   now.
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:08.440]   And he said, by the way, I have registered all of my baby's social properties already.
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.440]   You should.
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.880]   He's like Twitter handle, Instagram handle, Facebook, website.
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:14.880]   There you go.
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.480]   And he was just like, well, you know, yeah, if it's awful and they don't want it, cool.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.480]   But I already did the leg work for them.
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.560]   Too bad you can't register hashtags.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.560]   There's I mean, but you own that tech girl.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:32.280]   Yes, but some people actually spell out the word hashtag in their hand.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.760]   And that's your mom.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:34.760]   That's your mom.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.040]   I called you a pound sign that tech girl.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.440]   Well, you know, that would be a 40 plus crowd.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.440]   Plus.
[00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.440]   Yeah, I'm fine.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.440]   That tech girl.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.080]   No, but every TV show has a hashtag and puts it in their lower thirds.
[00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.080]   Yes.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:51.240]   And this is by the way, the universally accepted gang sign for hashtags.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.240]   Am I right?
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.240]   And slack logo.
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.240]   No, I've never seen anyone do it in real life.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.800]   Besides right now, don't people do that on Instagram and stuff?
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.680]   Is that my doing that wrong?
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:05.280]   You wait like that or both fingers facing out.
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.280]   Watch the intern.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.600]   This looks like I'm getting this looks like I don't want to get acid thrown in my eyes
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.160]   more like a hashtag hashtag.
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.640]   Okay, those those.
[00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.640]   All right.
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.640]   I am not my hashtag.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.640]   Who is not strong?
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.640]   It's okay.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:23.000]   So wait, back to the point, like 10 minutes ago, why do you have a hashtag?
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.360]   Why don't you have a hashtag?
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.360]   That's not right.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.360]   It's not right.
[00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:27.360]   It's right.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.360]   And she just nailed you.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.680]   We're going to get you a hashtag.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.680]   What is a hashtag though?
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:37.080]   Let's really get down to it because I by the way, I happen to know the guy who invented
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:38.080]   them.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.080]   Wow.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.080]   Just Christina.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.080]   Oh, sure.
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.680]   And Chris said Chris proposed on Twitter.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.960]   In 2008, probably around 2007 to 2008, you know, we really ought to have some way of indicating
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.400]   that this is a topic and so that you can organize it.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.160]   And really what a hashtag is is a search term.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.160]   Exactly.
[00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:00.040]   So on Twitter, it has become that when you click the hashtag, you actually do a search
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.040]   for all of that.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.160]   But it's, but I think that's that came later.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.280]   I think really that's though that's the idea is this is a canned search.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.880]   Hashtag just really cultivates your conversation and lets you actually build the story and see
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:16.840]   who is involved in the story, who wants to talk with you and add their input without
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.920]   having to at you all the time.
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:24.640]   So here is the official ASL hashtag sign.
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.640]   And it's exact.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.440]   It's kind of what we were talking about.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:32.440]   So you have your front hand with the back of your fingers facing out, your back hand with
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.200]   the back of your face facing in.
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:38.840]   So you're touching the insides of your fingers and you tap the backhand twice hashtag.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:39.840]   Hashtag.
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.680]   Hashtag that tech girl.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.680]   Hashtag twit.
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.680]   I have to it already.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.680]   Hashtag.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:54.520]   I think though I have to say that it's certainly a good marketing idea to have a hashtag.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.600]   But really the idea is it's supposed to be kind of organic that hashtags emerge, you
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:03.080]   know, as as a subject becomes a big subject.
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:07.320]   And it's actually interesting to watch the fight over what the official hashtag will
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.320]   be, you know.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.120]   Thing is you can't own a hashtag.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:13.040]   You just have to dominate a hashtag.
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.560]   You could say your hashtag that tech girl, but it's really not up to you to decide it's
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.880]   up to the community to say, no, no, she is that tech girl.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:24.520]   And you've seen we've seen with different, you know, Ferguson, Black Lives Matter, we've
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.040]   seen hashtags emerge and become accepted.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:31.920]   I mean, there's no question Black Lives Matter is that is it there is no other hashtag.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:32.920]   That's the hashtag, right?
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.920]   Yes.
[00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.960]   Also TCOT, which is popular among conservatives.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:37.960]   TCOT.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:38.960]   TCOT.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:39.960]   TCOT.
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:41.960]   What is TCOT?
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:42.960]   Top conservative on Twitter?
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:43.960]   Yes.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.480]   If you want to have a really fun time on Twitter that day, read that search.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.480]   It's the whole kettle of fish.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.480]   Wait a minute.
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.720]   I understand who is so is somebody become every day a different day?
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.720]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:54.720]   free postage, 55 bucks, you get the scale, you do have to pay a shipping and handling,
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:57.720]   that's about five bucks, so they give you a five dollar supply kit too.
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:59.720]   So this is a great deal.
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:04.720]   Stamps.com, honestly, this is the time to sign up.
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:08.720]   Stamps.com, you never need to go to the post office again.
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:13.720]   Look, look, on Alex Wilhelm's Instagram, there's a picture of Alex and a beautiful,
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:15.720]   oh, it's you.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:16.720]   That's it.
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:18.720]   And I like the choice of black and white.
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:21.720]   I'm not even a filter because I have no artistic expression whatsoever.
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.720]   So I think though, I'm like in monochrome a lot.
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:27.720]   I use a lot of black, I like black and white, especially for faces, because then you just
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:32.720]   focus on features, expressions, that's a, that's actually, did you take that?
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:33.720]   You took that, didn't you, Liberty?
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:34.720]   He didn't take that.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:35.720]   Actually, I did.
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:36.720]   He did?
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:37.720]   Really?
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:38.720]   Alex, you got some food.
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:42.720]   You know, blind dog finds duck once in a while, you know, log to gram food.
[00:52:42.720 --> 00:52:45.720]   Did you see Star Wars?
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:46.720]   Yes.
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:47.720]   Yes.
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:49.600]   Now, no, not yet.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:50.720]   Do you want to see Star Wars?
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:51.720]   Of course.
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:52.720]   Okay.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:54.000]   You, you, not yet, but you're going.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.720]   I'm the moment my girlfriend gets back from Virginia.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:57.720]   Oh, isn't that romantic?
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:00.720]   You won't go see it without your girlfriend.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:03.720]   She had a nice, you know, it's kind of a forced agreement, but yeah.
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:07.720]   So I, I'm, is this your imaginary girlfriend or your real girlfriend?
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:08.720]   I have two.
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.720]   I don't think I can handle two.
[00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:11.720]   Sometimes I think they're one and the same.
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:13.720]   Oh man, that's, that's some shade right there.
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:15.720]   I'm really excited about it.
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:16.720]   I just haven't seen it yet.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.720]   So we can't say anything about it.
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:20.720]   You don't want to spoil it for anybody.
[00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:21.720]   I guess so.
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:23.720]   I will say that I had a really pleasurable moving leg experience.
[00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:24.720]   I did too.
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:28.720]   I went to the new theater in the mission that's run by Alamo draft house, which was.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:29.720]   Oh, oh, I'm so jealous.
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:30.720]   I know.
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:31.720]   I love Alamo draft house in Austin.
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:33.720]   You can have beer and tacos with your film.
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:34.720]   I had, yeah.
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:39.720]   I mean, so you go in and you have to be 18 and over and there's no cell phones and you can
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:43.720]   tell people to be quiet through the manager and if they're not quiet, they get to leave.
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.720]   And then they give you snacks and drinks to your table.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:50.720]   So I basically watched Star Wars the way that God intended and it was really good.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:51.720]   It was so good though.
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:52.720]   Was it 3D or regular?
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:53.720]   It was regular.
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:54.720]   It was regular.
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:56.720]   We don't do 3D because they're smart.
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:01.720]   Actually, they have a 3D, they have a 3D theater, the new one in the one in mission.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:06.720]   But so I just went and it was really lovely and I got some commemorative pint glasses,
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:09.720]   Star Wars pint glasses that they are doing only for the premiere.
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:11.720]   So I got those.
[00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:12.720]   Nice.
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:15.720]   I really liked it and also I want like 70 BB-8s.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:17.720]   I want just like a tiny army of BB-8s.
[00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:18.720]   Is it BB-8 awesome?
[00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:20.720]   Like I want them to follow me around like little ducklings.
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:24.720]   BB-8 is the new robot and really awesome but no spoilers, I promise.
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:25.720]   You know that.
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:26.720]   I'm not telling anyone.
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:28.720]   You're not spoiling news flash.
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:29.720]   BB-8s were all cute.
[00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.720]   I mean, I thought Walley was the cute robot and now you're going to have a BB-8.
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:35.720]   Where does that put Walley on the cute robot scale?
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:41.720]   So Alamo draft test is famous for not tolerating annoying moviegoers so much so that they have
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:42.720]   a video.
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:47.680]   This was an actual voicemail they received from a moviegoer who was thrown out of the Alamo
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:48.680]   draft house.
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:49.680]   Have you heard this yet?
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:50.680]   No.
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:51.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:52.680]   But I'm not surprised.
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:53.680]   They're serious about it.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:54.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:57.680]   This is what follows an actual voicemail.
[00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:01.680]   I was wondering if you guys actually enjoy reading your document there.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:02.680]   There's a bad word there.
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:03.680]   Like a piece of the shit.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:07.720]   Because that's how I felt when I went to the Alamo draft house.
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:08.720]   Okay.
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:10.120]   You know what?
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:14.120]   I didn't know that I wasn't supposed to text in your little crappy ass theater.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:15.120]   Oh.
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:16.120]   Oh.
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:21.120]   I was using my phone as a flash flash.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:24.120]   Get to my phone.
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:25.120]   Oh.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:27.120]   By the way, there'd be some profanity in this.
[00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:29.120]   I'm not in States of America.
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:31.120]   We're in the United States of America.
[00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:33.120]   He text in a theater.
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:37.120]   I was not aware that I couldn't text in your theater.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:42.120]   All right.
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:45.120]   I was doing my phone.
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.120]   And there was no silent.
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:48.120]   It wasn't loud.
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:50.120]   It wasn't bothering anybody.
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:52.120]   You guys, obviously, were being...
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:55.120]   And I'm sure that's what you do.
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:57.120]   You know, to rip people off.
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:56:00.120]   You take my money and then you throw me out.
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:02.120]   You know, I will never be.
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:07.080]   And then they make a YouTube video of your voicemail and play it and shame you.
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:08.080]   You're on the Internet.
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:09.080]   They actually also play them.
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:11.080]   They play these sorts of things before the movie.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:13.080]   I'll just call with these from.
[00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:14.080]   Yeah, this is from them.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:17.080]   Yeah, just to remind you that you're not supposed to use a cell phone or talk.
[00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:18.080]   That's great shaming.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:19.080]   Isn't that?
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:20.080]   I would.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:21.080]   Excellent.
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:22.080]   I mean, please have her on Twitch.
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:25.080]   That'll be the magnitude of the House of America.
[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:26.080]   Her magnetic seats from America.
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.080]   Elmo Draftas girl.
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:30.080]   Apple part lady and Steve Colvak or something.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:31.080]   It'd be awesome.
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:33.080]   Steve was supposed to be here today.
[00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:34.080]   He apologize.
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:35.080]   Why couldn't he make it?
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:38.080]   Because Liberty Madison is much more attractive.
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:42.080]   Someone's playing tag him on Twitter for that.
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:43.080]   He failed.
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:45.080]   I think he went home for the holidays or something like that.
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:46.080]   He'd be bailed.
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:47.080]   But he'll be back.
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:50.080]   So you guys know, did you like want Steve to be part of this group?
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:53.080]   He's part of our little Twitter, Twitter cabal.
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:57.080]   It's like the twenties, the thirties, journalists.
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:58.080]   Why you shake your head, Lauren?
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:00.080]   What's the issue?
[00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:05.080]   I feel like there's stuff going on behind the screen.
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:09.080]   No, it's just that Steve unfollowed me on Twitter.
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:10.080]   He unfollowed you.
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:12.080]   That's like a modern day like burn.
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:13.080]   You're from, what did you do?
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:15.080]   See, I'm talking about kids.
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:19.080]   Oh, no, he didn't.
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:20.080]   That's all.
[00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:21.080]   Stop.
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:22.080]   Stop.
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:23.080]   He don't do that anymore.
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:25.080]   No, just no, Leo.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.080]   Oh, no, he didn't.
[00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:29.080]   Well, as long as he didn't unfriend you on Facebook, that's amazing.
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:30.080]   That's the ultimate.
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:32.080]   No, that's the thing.
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.080]   Unfollowing you.
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:34.080]   I don't know.
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:35.080]   What does that mean?
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:36.080]   I'm sprinting you as the, wow.
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:38.080]   Like you can't even talk to him in real life.
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:40.080]   My friend is like breaking up.
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:41.080]   Yeah, that's the worst.
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:43.080]   But I'm just, so unfollowing is not.
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:44.080]   It's more, what does that mean?
[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:45.080]   I'm going kind of hurts.
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:46.080]   But it's not as much as I'm doing.
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:49.080]   Is it more like you just talk too much and I don't want to hear what you have to say?
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:50.080]   Kind of thing.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:51.080]   I could put it on that.
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:52.080]   Maybe that, yeah.
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:53.080]   No?
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:54.080]   I don't know.
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:56.080]   Why did he unfollow, can somebody tweet him?
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:58.080]   What is this handle?
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:00.080]   It's @steemcovac for me, not this.
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:01.080]   It's @steemcovac for me, not this.
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:02.080]   I don't know much.
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:03.080]   We have one to know.
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:04.080]   Oh yeah, everybody tweet him.
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:05.080]   That'll break him crazy.
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:06.080]   That's like a really bad idea.
[00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:07.080]   But he couldn't mute you now, right?
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:08.080]   They have mute.
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:09.080]   And the mute is invisible to the muti.
[00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:12.080]   It could be for an indefinite period or a short period of time.
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:13.080]   Mute is like the kind unfollow.
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:15.080]   You don't want to hurt someone's feelings.
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:20.080]   If you, if you get muted, are you an M-ute E?
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:21.080]   Sorry.
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:22.080]   It's terrible.
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:23.080]   No.
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:24.080]   Wow.
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:26.080]   You got a really fast out.
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.080]   No, you didn't.
[00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:28.080]   That's appropriate.
[00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:29.080]   Wow.
[00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:30.080]   I'll take that one.
[00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:31.080]   Sorry.
[00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:35.080]   Copyright tribunal slaps Pandora.
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:39.080]   This is why I think it's not a good thing to be in the streaming music industry these
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:40.080]   days.
[00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:46.080]   Pandora, as you know, picked up the assets of RDO when RDO went as belly up and hopes to do
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:47.080]   streaming music.
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:55.080]   But the amount of money that one of these companies pays in royalties is set by a thing
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:59:01.080]   called the copyright tribunal, which in and of itself sounds almost, you know, dystopian.
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.080]   dystopian.
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:10.080]   Oh, the copyright tribunal has decided that Pandora, by the way, wanted a to lower its
[00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:11.080]   rates.
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:16.080]   Pandora currently pays 14 cents per 100 songs played.
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:18.080]   So it's very low.
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:23.080]   It's .0014 cents, dollars per song.
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:29.080]   But they now are raised to 17 cents per 100 songs play, which is a 20% increase.
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:34.080]   Doesn't sound like a lot, but remember that Pandora is hovering on the virtue, I think,
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:36.080]   of bankruptcy as it is.
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:38.080]   They pay more than a billion dollars a year.
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:42.080]   They wanted it to get down to 11 cents per 100 songs.
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:47.080]   And by the way, the music industry, which uses sound exchange to enforce its copyrights,
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:49.080]   wanted a bigger increase.
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:51.080]   They wanted 25 cents per 100 songs.
[00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:53.080]   That would have killed Pandora, I think.
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:54.080]   Yeah, it's very close.
[00:59:54.080 --> 01:00:00.080]   And it just shows you that companies like Spotify and Pandora, like Artio, are really
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:04.080]   exist only because the music industry lets them at this point, right?
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:10.080]   The glorious common room says that the OPEC of music, which I really enjoyed the analogy.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:14.080]   But Pandora's stock following the announcement actually shot up about 13%.
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:16.080]   I think people were enthused that it wasn't a higher increase.
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:17.080]   As bad as it could have been.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.080]   Right.
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:19.080]   So it was priced in, or did the share price.
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:23.080]   So the good news was good news of a sort, not great news given the cost increase.
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:25.080]   But I think Pandora will persist and stay on.
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.080]   So that's really what I care about.
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:29.080]   It's long-term viability of their unit economics.
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:35.080]   Yeah, and I'm sure that this is tough for Pandora because, but you're right, the stock
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:39.080]   market, I guess, figures well, it could have only could have been worse.
[01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:43.080]   They bought the assets of Artio for 75 million.
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:48.080]   In October, they bought Ticketfly, which is a ticket sales organization for 450 million.
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:50.080]   Just buy a show of hands.
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.080]   Who actually uses Pandora?
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:56.080]   Because it only old folks and you, you and me.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:59.080]   You know, it's funny because we talk a lot about Pandora and Macbreak Weekly.
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.080]   They seem to like it a lot, but you don't use it.
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.080]   No.
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.080]   Spotify.
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.080]   Definitely.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:05.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.080]   Spotify.
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:07.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.080]   Oldtimeradio.com.
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:15.080]   I have my little phonograph and I sit there and I start turning it hand crank it.
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:19.080]   And then when I do is I go and program my ghost piano to play.
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:19.080]   Oh, ring, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest, chest

[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.080]   Sounds.
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:43.080]   No, no, sound cloud is the up and comer.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:50.080]   I'm not sure.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:58.080]   I'm not sure.
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:01.080]   I'm not sure.
