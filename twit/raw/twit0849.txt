[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.920]   I gotta tell you, this is gonna be fun
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.200]   because we've got two of my favorite people.
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.520]   Amy Webb is here, she's a futurist.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.440]   Got a new book she's gonna tell us about.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.120]   From the information, Paris, Martyn O.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.000]   She's gonna give us a little tour of her apartment later.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.080]   You're gonna enjoy that.
[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.520]   We'll talk about the new Twitter Blue subscription service.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.680]   Is it worth three bucks a month?
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.840]   The Golem Network and the Genesis Machine.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.080]   Do I have more electric bikes than phones?
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.200]   Find out?
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.920]   Well, we'll also talk about why you want to be careful
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.040]   about what you put in your ear.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.840]   It's all coming up next.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.800]   Plus a whole lot more on Twit.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.960]   Podcasts you love.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.440]   From people you trust.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.160]   This is Twit.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:54.920]   This is Twit, this week in Tech.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.760]   Episode 849, recorded Sunday, November 14th, 2021.

[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.800]   It's time for Twit this week at Tech.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.680]   The show we cover the week's Tech News.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.720]   And apparently, I think there'll be some citrus news today.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.720]   This is going to be a lot of fun.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.720]   When we got these two guests on the show,
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.560]   we said, that's it.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.560]   Stop.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.840]   No need for a fourth.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.080]   It's so great to have Amy Webb here.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.880]   Amy has been missing in action as she took a little time off.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.320]   CEO of the Futures Today Institute, you've wrapped up your book.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.000]   I have.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.960]   I've got the hot off the presses, the galley right here.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.560]   It's called the Genesis Machine.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.560]   And it's about the futures of synthetic biology.
[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.840]   And I will make sure you get a copy.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.160]   Oh, very excited.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.480]   OK, good.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.960]   I'm going to order it if you don't see that.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.080]   You can pre-order it now.
[00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.040]   I think I will.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.840]   I'll just get it because I'm very interested in that.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.000]   Amy is, besides being a futurist,
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.040]   one of the smartest people we know, especially on matters
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.120]   having to do with Asia, having lived there for some time.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.480]   Also with us from the information,
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.760]   the wonderful Paris Martino.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.560]   See what I'm saying?
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.080]   I only need these two, and I'm done.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.680]   Paris, I--
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.400]   Well, actually, the third guest is the Buddha's hand
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.520]   to Amy.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.560]   Oh, yeah, let's see that.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.560]   Show that.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.480]   What the hell?
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.520]   It's some weird citrus fruit, Amy's.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.960]   Oh, my--
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.840]   It is.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.080]   It is not what I think--
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.200]   So let me-- for those of you who are listening,
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.360]   picture, if you will, a bunch of limes
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.960]   that somebody sort of squeezes out to a point
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.480]   and then attaches them all at a base.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.400]   It's called a booty.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.360]   But there's yellow.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.280]   It's all-- oh, sorry.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.920]   Sorry, not a line of limes.
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.440]   One of the aliens from the--
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.840]   I think this third season of Star Trek, I believe.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.560]   But I might be wrong.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.600]   It also-- yeah, it kind of looks like a dahlia
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.200]   if you hold it straight out.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.000]   Yeah, it's pretty.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.720]   But it's like the greatest smelling thing you've ever smelled.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.840]   So you just have it sitting there just to smell good.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.840]   And just-- listen, I have a frustrating job.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.000]   I need something to get through my day.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.240]   And it's not going to be Adderall.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.360]   So I sit next to this thing and I smell it.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.200]   Who needs Adderall?
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.680]   I've got booty's hand.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.960]   And Paris, we also, as we begin the show,
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.920]   wanted to wish your good friend Ryan a happy birthday
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.160]   on Monday.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.800]   So I'll make sure--
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.760]   Happy birthday, Ryan.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.800]   Happy birthday, Ryan.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.640]   Apparently, he's the only person in your circle of friends
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.920]   who actually listens to this show.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.720]   So that's good.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.280]   I don't know.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.720]   I've heard that other people do.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.960]   But I'm not going to be wrong.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.320]   I've heard people listen to it.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:48.800]   I've heard that.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.000]   Anyway, I'm thrilled to have both of you here.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.840]   I don't know exactly where to start this week.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.880]   It's kind of a grab bag.
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.440]   Let's start with Twitter because they launched their first--
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.160]   maybe no, not their first paid product,
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.640]   but their first widely available paid product--
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.160]   the Twitter blue subscription service.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.840]   And of course, being the Twitter flunky that I am,
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.120]   I immediately paid, even though I have no idea what I'm getting.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.880]   I did too.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.520]   You did too.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.360]   I remember reading about it in Casey Newton's newsletter
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.520]   platformer, and I paused, got up, don't know why,
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.600]   and then subscribed to Twitter blue.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.320]   I don't know.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.000]   I use Twitter so much that, frankly, I
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.200]   should be paying a little bit more.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.840]   That's kind of what I felt like.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.360]   But also, I really enjoy the functionality of Nuzzle,
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.440]   which is a app company that Twitter ended up buying.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.160]   That allows you to see what your friends and people
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.440]   in your network on Twitter, what links they are tweeting
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.560]   or commenting on, and do they have put that feature
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.760]   in Twitter blue, where on the browser,
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.760]   you can see the top articles in your network.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.280]   And frankly, that, to me, alone, is worth $2.99 a month.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.800]   That was--
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.440]   Yeah, they jumped it down.
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:10.120]   They did.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.480]   It's not Nuzzle.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.160]   But it's funny you said that, because it's exactly the thing
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.560]   that got me to subscribe.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.320]   I was so mad when Twitter bought Nuzzle,
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.880]   and unceremoniously, within a week, just pulled the plug.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.120]   Absolutely ridiculous.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.600]   So Jonathan Abrams, who founded Nuzzle, and I think is--
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.560]   Friendster?
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.000]   He was also--
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.920]   One of the most brilliant guys out there in tech.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.920]   He's just slightly too early on a lot of different things.
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.880]   So yeah, he was Friendster, pre-Mise-based,
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.600]   pre-Facebook.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.000]   He had launched Nuzzle, and originally,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.040]   it was an intelligence tool.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.840]   And again, I think it was just slightly too early.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.600]   And Twitter should have seen this functionality.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.240]   And they should have done something with it much earlier.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.680]   They didn't.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.960]   And the way that I used it was that I created a whole bunch--
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.600]   I had hundreds of Twitter lists that I had made that
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.200]   are all private.
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.480]   Because I didn't want to follow those accounts.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.120]   Instead, I used it as an intelligence gathering tool.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.880]   And so I had one that was just having you with robots.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.720]   And I had another one that was specifically
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.160]   about an area of drones.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.000]   And I had Nuzzle set up to ping me--
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.720]   because you used to be able to set a threshold.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.160]   So you could set it as like five, three, or two
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.920]   for how many people shared that same article
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.680]   or were talking about the same thing.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.480]   So basically, what I got was a curated view
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.720]   across individual topics all day long on the app.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.800]   And it was like the most amazing thing.
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.440]   Then yeah, it got bought by Scroll, got bought by--
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.000]   which then got bought by Twitter.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.920]   They shut it down.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.560]   It's back.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.400]   But I don't find it super useful now,
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.160]   because if you follow a lot of people,
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.160]   you basically wind up with the Echo Chamber versus--
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.320]   You don't have all the settings that we had.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.160]   This is the new Twitter page.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.560]   There's a new little flame icon that says Top Articles.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.640]   And this is their version of Nuzzle.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.280]   The one thing I do like if you click it--
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.160]   It's only available in browser, too.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.800]   No, no, no, it's available on the app.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:09.800]   You can't.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.640]   It is on iOS.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.640]   But not on Android.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.140]   It is.
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:13.840]   It is on Android.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.720]   I think it-- no, no.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.080]   I think it's on Android, but not iOS.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.280]   Oh.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.760]   Let me look at my iOS.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.560]   So the one thing I do like, which
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.920]   is it's a little bit better functionality than Nuzzle.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.480]   Nuzzle would have a list of all the people who tweeted it.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.960]   And you could click their names.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.480]   Now, when you click on the article,
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.320]   you'll see on the right the conversation,
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.520]   all the tweets about it.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.640]   I do like that a little bit better.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.000]   But Amy, if you have one forte,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.080]   it's advanced usage of online tools.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.960]   Because I never did any of that tweaking to Nuzzle.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.840]   I liked it well enough.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.280]   None of that--
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.760]   I'm Twitter tweaking.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.760]   No, the Twitter tweaking.
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.480]   So this is my second job.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.800]   In my very, very, very long ago career,
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.040]   when I was starting out, I was a journalist.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.560]   And my feeling was I needed to automate as much as I could,
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.280]   because there's only so many hours in the day to do reporting.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.240]   And I was looking for stuff that nobody else had.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.000]   So over--
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.240]   I've figured out ways to cobble together automated systems.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.240]   And I do now as well.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.400]   But that feature on Nuzzle--
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.920]   listen, I would have happily paid Twitter years ago.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.640]   And I'm paying them now.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.640]   But I think that they really, multiple times,
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.160]   have missed opportunities to monetize in a thoughtful way,
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.480]   to improve tools.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.840]   Because the other thing that comes with Blue
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.880]   is technically you can edit, but there's a window.
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.520]   So if you like drunk tweet and you recognize what's happening,
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.920]   or you can see the tweet, you can pull the plug on it.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.280]   I think that you have a minute.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.280]   Yeah, it's just--
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.800]   It's kind of like the undo send feature in Google.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.720]   It's not really editing.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.000]   It's like they don't send it.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.520]   Yeah.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.160]   It just gives you a minute to think about it.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.440]   But it also doesn't show-- it doesn't reveal to you
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.760]   the tweet immediately.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.280]   So you kind of-- there's a couple of steps involved.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.000]   Again, it just seems like--
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.880]   It's the take a breath feature.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.080]   Like before you tweet.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:04.960]   So you're right here.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.680]   So I'm looking at an iOS version of Twitter Blue.
[00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.960]   And I see that I have Twitter blue too and on,
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.880]   but there is no corresponding top articles.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.200]   So I guess it's only on Android right now.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.960]   This rolled out-- initially, I think,
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.480]   in Australia and a couple of countries, not the US,
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.600]   it just rolled out this week in the US.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.640]   It'll be interesting to see if they can make money.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.480]   What I'm hoping happens from this is that, yeah, basically,
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.960]   I don't know if you guys got this option also when you signed up.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:32.080]   But when I signed up for Twitter Blue,
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:35.720]   it asked me to do some survey specifically selecting
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:38.720]   what features about Twitter Blue were you most interested in?
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.560]   What would you like to see more development in?
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.880]   And I specifically selected the top articles feature.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.680]   But I hope that survey and the whole existence of Twitter Blue
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.080]   generally means that there's maybe
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:54.320]   going to be more energy and kind of development focus
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.680]   on products like this.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.080]   Because Twitter, historically, had not really
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.840]   been the app that would--
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.800]   I don't know.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.080]   I have as much leeway in regards to developing stuff.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.880]   They generally kind of kept things the same.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.760]   But I'm hoping that the advent of spaces and now Twitter Blue
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.360]   means that maybe at some point, we
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.280]   could get some of our nozzle features back.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:17.080]   I think part of the issue-- so Biz, Stone, and I,
[00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:17.520]   know each other.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.600]   We're both fellows at an Oxford University program.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.080]   And we were both on this thing a couple of weeks ago.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.600]   And he was-- the way that Twitter--
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.160]   He's--
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.840]   by the way, the creator of Twitter, but no longer associated
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.280]   with it, right?
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.680]   He's probably still got a lot of stock.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:34.200]   Who Biz?
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.040]   Or Jack?
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:35.640]   Or Ev?
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.640]   Jack was it.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.300]   Ev?
[00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.240]   Evan Biz are kind of off.
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.200]   So Ev brought Biz on when they were at--
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.040]   before Blogger, I guess, Odeo.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.760]   Or they were Blogger than they went to Odeo.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:53.520]   Anyhow, in those early days of the continual fail-will,
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.240]   I don't think they had a really long-term roadmap.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.800]   And they were kind of just building as they went.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.840]   And so it was kind of a clued together system
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.720]   to begin with.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.360]   And people started using it in ways
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.280]   they really hadn't imagined.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.560]   And the problem is you get so far down the road.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.240]   And you wind up with a system that--
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:18.560]   it's challenging to do pre-testing and to sort out
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.920]   product features.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.040]   And I think they just don't have a culture of longer-term mapping.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.120]   So it doesn't surprise me that they acquired--
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.320]   tried to roll out some features and not sure what to do.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.680]   I think that that's a really good description of Twitter
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.480]   even today.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.360]   It's completely ad hoc.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.520]   Whatever the hell, let's try something.
[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.080]   Jack Dorsey, who's running it these days,
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:45.880]   has talked about some sort of federated open source
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.000]   version of Twitter.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.440]   I think they're spending money on that.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.560]   They just hired somebody to run Twitter's Bitcoin initiative,
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.200]   whatever that is.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:54.960]   I still feel like--
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.160]   Quitcoin?
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.920]   No, they better not call it that.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:58.600]   But I think--
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.680]   You've got to get on it.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.480]   They better not call it that they can call it anything they
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.920]   want, but Twitcoin.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:08.280]   But I think that in a way, that's the term of Twitter.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.960]   I also have to say that probably 90% of the people listening
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.480]   to this show even couldn't care less what happens to Twitter.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.040]   And then the general public, even less so.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:22.200]   Twitter is very much an inside Silicon Valley thing, I think.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:22.880]   Am I wrong?
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:25.320]   And yeah, I still look on Valley and media.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.160]   And politics.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:35.520]   But it does matter because Facebook could go away tomorrow.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:39.880]   And I would argue that it wouldn't matter to most people
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:40.920]   that I know.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:45.400]   But there are small businesses that now use those tools
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.680]   and rely on them in some cases.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:50.120]   And then there's the rest of the ecosystem, right?
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.160]   Twitter doesn't really operate that way.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.440]   And if Twitter went away tomorrow,
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.200]   it would be sad for those of us who use it still.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.280]   But it's not an essential technology.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:03.040]   So I think they're going to have to make a decision at some point
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.600]   about how they become essential.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:08.440]   Now, outside of a political cycle, there's this concentrated--
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.440]   there's like a concentration of attention, which
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.280]   then has a spillover effect.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.160]   And what winds up on Twitter eventually
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.320]   winds up as part of the looping that
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.800]   happens in the political cycles.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.360]   And so there is a certain amount of power there.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.320]   That's because of the media connection, though, right?
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.680]   Because the media picks up.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.760]   And it really was the case during President Trump's incumbency.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:29.260]   Right.
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:32.800]   Which is why if this nuzzle feature had existed during that cycle,
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.560]   I would not have used-- it would have been a maddening.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.200]   Because it just would have been everybody's serenity--
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.600]   Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump, Trump.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.120]   It still is, by the way.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.000]   Let me see here.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.880]   Top articles, memo from Trump attorney,
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.800]   emails reveal new details of Trump White House.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.600]   It might say more about who you're following, the only other than
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.440]   I've announced.
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.120]   I don't know.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.120]   Let's see.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.240]   What's on the top of your news feed?
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:59.920]   Top of my feed is--
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.320]   You're right.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.760]   This is kind of--
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.000]   I'm showing a little bit of a peek behind the site.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.320]   I don't know.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.520]   I've got the same issue.
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.000]   I've got the memo from Trump.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.320]   I've got the Biden polls.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.000]   I got that.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.920]   I've got Trump.
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:13.920]   I've got polls.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.520]   I've got-- and I did not know this, but Petro Mayor--
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.520]   I know.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.600]   I'm sad to see that.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.600]   I have radically different ones, guys.
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.160]   My top article is one from Wired,
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.000]   with the title of "Black Woman Invented Home Security."
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.080]   Why did it go so wrong?
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.400]   Wow.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.520]   I don't even see that.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.440]   It's one of the daily beast story
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.080]   about how Fox News--
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.920]   Fox News story disappeared over a critique of White Nationalists.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.600]   Third one is "New York Times" story about Portugal--
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.600]   I don't have any of those.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.640]   --of companies from contracting employees off.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.600]   Who the hell are you following?
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.600]   Um--
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.320]   Amy, is this not that many politics people?
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.320]   This is--
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.720]   Well, I just skipped over some--
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.920]   This is the new Tinder.
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:53.920]   --I've got a bunch of Sin Biosa.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:53.920]   Maybe.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:54.420]   Maybe.
[00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:54.920]   Maybe.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.760]   You could say, what are your top five articles on Twitter?
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.760]   What are your top five articles on-- are you a Moderna?
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.240]   Or are you a Biontec?
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.640]   Moderna or Biontec?
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:05.640]   Yes.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.480]   All right, anyway--
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.720]   And what's your maiden name?
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.400]   I'm leading off with a story that I have just said nobody
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:11.920]   cares about.
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:12.920]   But you're right.
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.040]   It has some importance in media and politics.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.280]   There are some areas that it matters.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:23.280]   And I guess it's the big tech story of the week.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.920]   So there--
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:25.920]   I don't know.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:27.920]   Well, I do think it matters more broadly speaking,
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.520]   because I think it's my observation
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.880]   that you've got the enormous companies that
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:38.240]   are potentially dealing with regulatory action,
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.720]   or at least calls for regulatory action.
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.080]   Twitter's been largely absent from a lot of that.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:43.580]   Yeah.
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.000]   They're going to have problems on the street at some point.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.360]   They're public, and are people throwing ad dollars at Twitter?
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.000]   Are they finding other ways to engage digital audiences?
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   Well--
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   That kind of thing.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.280]   I think from a business standpoint,
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:16:59.800]   I kind of think it does matter.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.160]   It could be a measure of how little Twitter matters,
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.480]   that they are not scooped up with this big anti--
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.160]   the tech lash, I guess we should call it.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.000]   Microsoft and Twitter seem to be mostly unscathed.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.760]   Meanwhile, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:16.600]   are getting--
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:20.120]   I mean, Microsoft had already been scathed, I suppose.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:25.240]   They're unscathed only because their period of scrutiny
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.080]   has passed.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.840]   What scathed twice shy, I guess.
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.000]   So, yeah.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.520]   So actually, we should maybe mention Google
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.520]   and the state attorneys general.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.920]   We've talked a lot about this.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:47.920]   There is more information in this antitrust complaint
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.400]   against Google, including the revelation that Google had
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.240]   something called Project Bernanke, which is a strange name.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.080]   Wasn't he the chairman of the Fed at this time?
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.640]   I don't understand what this had to do with him.
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.720]   It was according to the lawsuit.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.400]   And again, this is-- Google hasn't responded.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.400]   This is a lawsuit by the state of Texas
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.200]   and I think about 20 other states.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.720]   The lawsuit highlights Google's use of a secret program dubbed
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:18.480]   Project Bernanke in 2013.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.720]   They used bidding data to give its own ad buying and advantage.
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.720]   And this is kind of the central to the claim
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:29.720]   is that Google both was the house and the gambler in its online
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:31.320]   ad sales.
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.880]   For example, according to Reuters in 2015,
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.240]   Google allegedly dropped the second highest bids
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.800]   from publisher's auctions, dropped them,
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.560]   accumulated money into a pool, then spent that money to inflate
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:48.000]   only the bids belonging to advertisers who use Google ads.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.280]   They otherwise would have lost the auctions.
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.800]   So that's a clear example of self-dealing.
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:58.680]   Alphabet has not responded to this.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.320]   Google also this week lost an appeal in the European Union,
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.000]   which sued it saying it favored its own Google shopping
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.120]   results in the search results.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:15.160]   They have to pay now $2.8 billion to the EU, which now we're
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.160]   talking some real money.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.360]   It's not maybe enough to chase in Google,
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.800]   but it's a significant amount of money.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.320]   I mean, the thing that I think sticks out to me
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.640]   when we're looking at these specific cases
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.720]   is the resemblance, clearly, to the cases that are currently
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.600]   being talked about or brought in the US against Amazon,
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:39.600]   in that they are also at their core about the owner
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:43.880]   and controller of a powerful platform or marketplace,
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.360]   also being a participant in that and giving themselves
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.080]   an unfair advantage, which I feel like is clearly
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:53.560]   kind of the through line in this tech
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.240]   clash that we're seeing.
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:20:01.880]   It seems like there's no way to ethically be both the dealer
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:06.120]   and the person putting their cards in.
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.720]   Amy, you wrote the big nine two years ago
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.400]   how the tech titans and their thinking machines could warp
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.440]   humanity.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.200]   This was more about AI, but does this
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.600]   fit in with your thesis on the book,
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:24.440]   the way that these companies are manipulating the markets?
[00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:24.920]   It does.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.200]   So the book was about AI, but it was also
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.680]   about the business implications and governing
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.080]   implications and regulatory implications related to AI.
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:39.480]   And the idea is that there are six companies in the US, three
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.920]   in China.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.720]   The Chinese companies are obvious.
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.520]   Baidu Alibaba Tencent in the US.
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:50.280]   It's Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, IBM,
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.000]   and who am I forgetting?
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.240]   Amazon.
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.000]   Amazon.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.280]   And listen, the problem is that we
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.680]   didn't have any regulatory--
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:10.800]   the Sherman Act, which gets brought up all the time,
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.800]   is probably not applicable because at least
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.560]   in the case of Amazon, you would
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.400]   have to bring a very, very narrow case.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.440]   And as it relates to e-commerce in Amazon--
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.920]   so it's just as Paris mentioned, right?
[00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.880]   You've got a company that has all the data.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.360]   And has a sense of what people are
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:34.960]   searching for algorithms that can determine what probability
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.440]   people will purchase based on the proximity of where
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:43.000]   they see the item at what time and at what price point.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.680]   So I get all of that, except that there
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.240]   are grocery stores who do the exact same thing
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.440]   in the physical world.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.040]   And it's not automating.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.040]   Right.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:55.600]   That is, in fact, the argument that Amazon has always
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.120]   brought us.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.800]   And I'm not trying to be an apologist for Amazon,
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.560]   trying to be pragmatic here.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:06.600]   But I bought the Buddhist hand at Wegmans today.
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.160]   And at Wegmans, which is a grocery store on the East Coast--
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.400]   it's a grocery store chain--
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:17.240]   they have a habit of selling a wide array of products,
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.280]   looking to see what's doing well.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:23.720]   And then they will completely copy the products that
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.720]   are best selling.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.160]   My guess is you're not going to see a house label,
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.280]   Buddha's Hand, at Wegmans.
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.640]   No, but my friend, Cara Golden, started a company called
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.000]   Hintwater.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.560]   And she sweat equity, built this business,
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.280]   and did an amazing, amazing job of it,
[00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.240]   and has a tremendous product.
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.720]   It was cool after she launched to see
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.840]   Hintwater in Wegmans stores.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.000]   And it was super popular.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.600]   And within a year, Wegmans was now
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:57.040]   selling the exact same product, the same weird shaped
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.600]   bottle with the labeling and everything.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.880]   Oh, that's hysterical.
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.360]   And that's not what you've done.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.400]   Now, since time immemorials, the CPA and P.
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.560]   Exactly.
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.920]   So the question is, why do we come down on Amazon
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.920]   for this practice?
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.760]   Which, to be fair, you can automate more.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.880]   But we do not make the same legal arguments
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:19.720]   at some of the grocery stores that are doing the same thing.
[00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.120]   It's fine.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.120]   I just read Amazon Unbound, which is the Bradstone's
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:23.960]   follow-up to--
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.480]   Terrific.
[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.480]   Brad is such a good writer.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.400]   Fantastic book.
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.120]   Yeah, we all agree.
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.720]   And he talks about this specifically.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.200]   And it's interesting, because Amazon must have suspected
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.360]   that there was a problem, because they had supposedly
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.960]   lots of controls to keep the data that was being gathered
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.920]   by these third party sellers on Amazon
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.240]   from being used by the people on Amazon
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.160]   or figuring out what products Amazon should make.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.560]   It might have been a pretty porous wall,
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:51.720]   because there seems to be a lot of correspondence magically.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.160]   But they must have known there was some reason not to do this.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.360]   Nevertheless, the defense is, well,
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.960]   we're not doing anything different than every grocery store
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.160]   has done from Time Memorial.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.960]   What is the difference?
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.320]   Is there a difference?
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.760]   And why don't grocery stores get in trouble?
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.040]   I mean, your friend who made Hint.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.840]   Probably pretty pissed off at the whole thing.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:11.400]   Probably.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:15.120]   I also know that they white label Domino Sugar.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.920]   And so their Wegmans brand sugar
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.240]   was made in the same facility.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.880]   That's often the case for these house brands, yeah.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:21.240]   Right.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:25.560]   So I mean, I'm sure that these originator Domino's
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.080]   is just getting slightly less margin on the product,
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.680]   so everybody's making money.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.680]   But what does that-- so think about it
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.880]   from a consumer's point of view.
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:35.880]   Ultimately, you then have less choice,
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:40.560]   because you've now gone from an array of products and brands
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.160]   to basically one brand.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.520]   You're going to be hard pressed to find competition
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.600]   on the shelves.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.400]   And from a, again, just a practical point of view,
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:53.320]   I don't see the difference so much between what we accept
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.920]   in the physical realm and what we rail against
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.040]   in the digital realm.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.480]   I think the only difference really
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:05.080]   is that the digital realm has made it so that it is a lot easier
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:09.840]   to see this happening at a lot larger scale versus, you know,
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.600]   once everybody's like the eastern coast grocery store
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.800]   or public, down south or something like that.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:21.400]   It's not as immediately visible of an issue
[00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.960]   for people to get mad about that.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.640]   And I mean, I think that this is ultimately
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.960]   going to lead to some hard thinking, perhaps,
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.520]   from US or EU regulatory bodies about whether or not
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:36.880]   this practice online or offline is something that, you know,
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.040]   they want to legislate.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:42.840]   I think it also comes down to the perception
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:48.080]   that Amazon is completely dominant, which they're demonstrably
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:49.880]   not in online commerce.
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:50.840]   That's the other defense.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.760]   They're not in any area where they are.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.200]   In any area.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.880]   That's their constant defense.
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.720]   That's right.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.040]   But I think if you thought, you know,
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:02.000]   Wegmans making its own version of hint water
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.920]   is not going to diminish the overall market
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.640]   because there's many grocery stores.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.280]   There's many places you can go.
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:09.880]   But if it was in the back of your mind
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.640]   that pretty soon Amazon is going to be the only online
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:16.040]   shopping place, then it might be more important to you
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.960]   that you enforce rules there because then you really
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.720]   won't have another choice.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.080]   Sure.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.800]   And if you look, again, by market size in the United States,
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.760]   by cap, why don't we get all been out of shape over Walmart?
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.440]   Walmart is, from my point of view, a technology company,
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.920]   not a retail company.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.680]   And Walmart is built at-- Walmart has its own self-driving
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:36.640]   trucks already.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.400]   They are already driving around.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.800]   I know for grocery deliveries.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.600]   My wife told me this morning.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.360]   That's right.
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.080]   So why are we not--
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.920]   I mean, I think that the difference
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:48.920]   is when we're talking with e-commerce, at least in the US.
[00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:52.520]   This is recent data from e-marketer.
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:59.120]   Amazon represents just over 40% of total US e-commerce sales.
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.480]   Meanwhile, Walmart represents seven.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.240]   Walmart's never--
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:03.720]   And it seems like--
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.760]   Walmart's struggled to compete with Amazon.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:10.160]   Nevertheless, 40% is not 80% or 90% or 100%.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.840]   It's not a monopoly by any means.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:15.880]   No, but in the physical presence,
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.960]   Walmart grossly exceeds everybody else.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.680]   And any other super strong--
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:23.440]   I'm no fan of Walmart, especially because so many Walmart
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.640]   employees are subsidized by the government
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:27.720]   in the form of food stamps.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.560]   I'll tell you what I think the problem is.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:35.720]   Because, you know, so Jeff Bezos-- or not Jeff Bezos--
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.640]   Elon Musk, people think he's eccentric.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.280]   They make fun of him for being eccentric.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.240]   I think I think he is eccentric.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:45.480]   Right, but my point is like nobody gets--
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.760]   very few people who are probably listening to the show
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:54.040]   are angry at Elon Musk for forcing the auto market
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.120]   to change, right, to accept and start
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:01.080]   innovating around batteries and, right?
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.040]   Bezos, you could argue Jeff has done the same thing.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.880]   It's just much more distributed,
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.440]   and it's in the fields of artificial intelligence
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.320]   and pharmaceuticals, like all these other places, right?
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:15.080]   And everybody gets pissed off at Bezos.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.520]   And everybody gets pissed off at Amazon.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:23.320]   You know, Elon Musk doesn't own a majority of the auto market,
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.000]   but he's had an outsized influence
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.840]   in dictating what the future looked like.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:27.840]   Just like Jeff Bezos.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.920]   That's analogous to Jeff.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.960]   But everybody-- so I think this has more to do with personality
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.680]   and look, net net on the wealth side of things.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.040]   They are analogous.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.320]   I think it comes down to likability, as it always does,
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.880]   and liking the brand.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.720]   And everybody likes to select their shows.
[00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.600]   I think end users love Amazon.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.960]   And I try not to use Amazon, and I fail every time.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.680]   So I don't think it's a question of people don't--
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:58.280]   they may not like Bezos, but I don't think they dislike Amazon.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.440]   I think they tolerate Amazon.
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.840]   I think people really, especially in COVID,
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:04.800]   really appreciate Amazon.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.760]   Yeah, Amazon is often at the top of consumer
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.720]   sentiment surveys.
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.720]   But I think that it is also has to do with the fact
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:14.400]   that Amazon's dominance in a number of categories
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.600]   has really skyrocketed.
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.040]   At a rate that Tesla could never hope to match.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.400]   That's kind of my position.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.960]   Is that-- I mean, within--
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.440]   It's a fear of what might happen.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:29.560]   Amazon is representative for 83% of all sales of books, music,
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:30.400]   or video in e-commerce.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.400]   So that's too much.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:31.920]   That is too much.
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:35.440]   And 50% of computer or consumer electronics.
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:40.600]   And its dominance is increasing in a variety of other categories
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.800]   that make sense for e-commerce, which is, I think,
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:47.120]   where the-- looking at the 40% of overall e-commerce,
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.720]   perhaps isn't the right number.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.480]   Because one place where Amazon's probably never
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.120]   going to dominate is clothing, because it's really
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:56.640]   difficult to--
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.240]   Not that they're not trying.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.920]   They're trying quite a bit.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.360]   But I think that another aspect of this
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:07.440]   is the Jeff Bezos equation, which I recently just published
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:11.120]   this article on Friday about going
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:15.160]   into the recent history of Amazon's communications and PR
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:15.880]   team.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.440]   And kind of one thing that I learned through this
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:22.840]   is that starting in 2015 to 2017,
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.400]   as Jeff Bezos was inching closer and closer
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.760]   to being the richest person in the world, his PR team
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.120]   started to think about it as a serious PR problem.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.360]   And they launched his Twitter account.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:35.000]   They launched his Instagram.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.240]   They're like, how do we turn Bezos into kind of a humanize
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.080]   and turn him into kind of a swashbuckling, fun guy
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:44.240]   that he's not going to be the target of all these tax?
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:46.600]   I mean, it seems like whether or not they've
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.680]   been successful on that, it doesn't seem like they've
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.760]   been great at it.
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.080]   But it's certainly been a test.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:53.560]   Facebook's problems are similar.
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:58.040]   Mark Zuckerberg is hard to warm up to.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.360]   Yeah, I mean, that's why Mark Zuckerberg--
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.480]   the New York Times had a fantastic story about this,
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.680]   sometimes in recent weeks.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.480]   You know, all those silly photos of Mark Zuckerberg
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.920]   with a bunch of sunscreen on the windsurfing thing?
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.440]   Yeah.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:15.000]   These were all part of a strategy by Facebook's PR team
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.640]   to humanize Mark Zuckerberg, making him a funny and laughable
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.160]   guy instead of weird robot dude.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.240]   Completely backfired.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:26.920]   It made him seem more like a robot, not less.
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.800]   I think that it's hard to humanize people
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:32.520]   in positions of power, especially the extent of Mark
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.840]   Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:34.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.480]   Actually, they quote your boss, Jessica Lesson,
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.840]   in this article.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:46.400]   Apparently, she was there in Tahoe when he posted that video.
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.160]   Ah, yes.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:55.680]   On Instagram with a flag on the hydrofoil, partly
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.200]   because Sam, her husband, was an executive at Facebook
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.200]   and she was an old--
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:01.640]   They all went to school together at Harvard.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.600]   I'm going to get to Sam in a bit.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.400]   You can recuse yourself if you want.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.280]   Oh, is this the vice's parade?
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.440]   His investments, yeah.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.080]   I have interesting thoughts about that story.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:13.400]   All right.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.800]   We're going to take a little break.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.840]   We have interesting thoughts about a lot of things.
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:21.320]   I'm actually a big fan, both of Jessica Lesson, long time
[00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.600]   subscribers since day one of the information,
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.000]   where Paris works.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.520]   And I've known Sam for a long time
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:29.280]   since his first startup, which I thought
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.280]   was the greatest thing ever.
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.680]   We interviewed him.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.280]   It was that dot I/O file sharing thing that he was doing.
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.640]   It was so cool.
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.840]   Anyway, good to have both of you.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.120]   Paris Martin, oh, from the information.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:49.480]   Amy Webb, futurist, and Buddha's hand lover.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.000]   We're going to get more into this.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.520]   And in fact, I want to talk about the great resignation,
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:58.520]   because that also ties into this a little bit.
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:01.440]   It seems to be in the wake of COVID.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.560]   There is something going on, something disruptive,
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:08.400]   something almost like an earthquake to the United States,
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.000]   to its economy, to its medical system.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.720]   I'm very curious what you all think about that.
[00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.000]   But we'll get to that in a second.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.120]   Our show today brought to you by ITProTV,
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.400]   whether you're a seasoned IT professional
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.600]   or somebody who wants to break into IT.
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.400]   I know anybody who listens to our shows,
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.240]   we know you love technology.
[00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.760]   Maybe you'd like to make that your career.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.160]   This is the best way to do it.
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.760]   ITProTV, it's the community you need.
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.560]   And I've known Tim and Don, the founders,
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.680]   since before it began, they created ITProTV,
[00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.640]   because it was the training they wanted for themselves.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.400]   They'd been doing classroom training.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.120]   And they said, you know, it'll be really good
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.400]   if we could do this on the internet.
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.200]   And boy, have they grown?
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:51.080]   Seven studios now in their Gainesville, Florida headquarters,
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:54.160]   filming every day, Monday through Friday.
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.000]   Why so much?
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.800]   Well, because this stuff is a constantly moving target.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.240]   The tests for the certifications change,
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.480]   and you have to constantly update.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.640]   You also, of course, there's new software, new versions.
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:08.080]   Courses go from their studios to their course library
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.440]   in 24 hours.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.840]   It's, of course, information.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:13.360]   But they make it entertaining because they hire people
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.840]   who are not only experts in the field,
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.640]   but who can really communicate.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.400]   People like Tracy and Adam right there.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.080]   They're edutainers.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:23.520]   And they also are on staff, all of their trainers,
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:27.600]   which means you can get assistance from them at any time.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.200]   I think ITProTV has really solved this issue
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.680]   of how do you get this information
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:35.160]   in a timely fashion, in an engaging fashion,
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.480]   in an easy fashion.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.200]   All of the education is divided into 20 to 30 minute episodes.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.120]   So you can easily doing this during a lunch hour or a break.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:47.400]   They have really nice transcripts which you can search.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.360]   So you can go right to the part you wanna brush up on
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.240]   or get that information.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.760]   The content is fantastic.
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.920]   They're the official training partner for CompTIA.
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:59.240]   So for many people getting started in IT,
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:02.120]   you wanna get those A plus certs.
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.720]   Man, do they have great training in all the CompTIA stuff.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:10.720]   This month is AWS month speaking of Amazon at ITProTV.
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.720]   In a couple of days, they're gonna have a webinar
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.960]   on cloud data protection in AWS.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.040]   That's gonna be hosted by Tracy Pierce,
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.600]   who's a senior security consultant for AWS.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:22.000]   So you're gonna get it straight from the horse's mouth.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.720]   They've done a bunch of webinars
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:26.440]   and free stuff this month.
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.200]   You can check out all the webinars
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:32.000]   at ITProTV/webinars so you can see what's coming up.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.960]   Or you can watch the past webinars.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.000]   And you missed, they're all there on demand as well.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.160]   That's ITProTV/webinars.
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:41.000]   Check out their YouTube channel as well.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.640]   Start your IT career today by getting educated
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:46.080]   and certified for the big companies.
[00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.240]   Looking for IT professionals right now,

[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:22.960]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:28.240]   We were talking about the big tech companies.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.800]   Actually, I really have two experts here
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.640]   because Paris covers Amazon for the information.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:36.200]   Amy's written a lot about Amazon.
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.320]   I got the impression from this conversation
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.840]   that you neither of you are too worried about Amazon.
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:41.920]   Is that right, Amy?
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.920]   Well, it depends on what you mean by worry.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.920]   You were kind of defending them.
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:54.920]   Yeah, listen, I don't like...
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.920]   We have a crisis,
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.920]   and the crisis in the United States is that
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.920]   we're living through this grand experiment
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.920]   because outside of COVID,
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:07.920]   there are other things that are happening.
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:12.920]   And we, for a very long time, took a lot of money
[00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:17.920]   out of science and technology, research and development.
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.920]   We're sitting on the precipice of some core technologies
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.920]   that will fundamentally alter how we relate to each other,
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.920]   how business is done, how governing is done.
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.920]   And we've sort of farmed out basic research
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.920]   to the private sector.
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:36.920]   So if everybody wants Amazon to stop doing stuff,
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:41.920]   and change, then we're going to have to funnel billions
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:45.920]   of dollars into public R&D efforts
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:49.920]   and establish moonshots and actually go after them.
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.920]   Because if we don't do that,
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.920]   we are going to have geopolitical problems going forward.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.920]   It's as simple as that.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:59.920]   Government has always been super important.
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.920]   I mean, the internet was created by the government.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.920]   It's been super important in all of this kind of fundamental R&D
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:07.920]   because government could spend a lot more money.
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:11.920]   But there's always been private industry like Bell Labs.
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.920]   Yeah, that gets brought up all the time.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.920]   Leo, name me a company that has the equivalent
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.920]   of a Bell Labs right now.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:21.920]   Well, I mean, I know that Google and Amazon and Apple
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.920]   all spend billions of dollars in R&D.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:27.920]   Right, but they're doing it in a different way.
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:31.920]   So the original Bell Labs, there was more public-private intersections.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.920]   These companies were having--
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.920]   It was more blue sky?
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:36.920]   It was more blue sky.
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:39.920]   It was also, you know, they were building entirely--
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:42.920]   they were building new ideas, right?
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.920]   The problem is that outside of DARPA and IARPA,
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:48.920]   which are focused on military posture,
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.920]   like we don't have those systems in place.
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.920]   But I would say that's a good thing because, in fact,
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.920]   almost always it was with a military eye.
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:59.920]   It was an eye towards defense or offense.
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.920]   It was the war machine.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:04.920]   And so all of these technologies came out of the war machine.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:05.920]   Right, right.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.920]   I would submit maybe that this is a better thing
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.920]   if it's coming out of other--
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:13.920]   and look how space is taken off when it became a public
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.920]   and private partnership.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:18.920]   Correct, but public policy has become impotent.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.920]   And we just do not have strong leaders.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:25.920]   Last week, DeepMind spun off a company called Isomorphic Labs,
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:29.920]   which is specifically intended to build on DeepMinds,
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.920]   deep learning in protein folding,
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:35.920]   to quickly develop new therapeutics
[00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.920]   and do drug discovery in automated ways.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.920]   You know, so that's great, but that's not a public good.
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.920]   And the challenge is that we've really relegated
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:47.920]   all of this to the private sector.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.920]   And then after the fact, when these companies become successful
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.920]   at what we've allowed them and asked them to do,
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.920]   we try to regulate after the fact.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.920]   That's a dumb cross.
[00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.920]   That's a stupid way to operate.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:05.920]   Instead, there needs to be a way to bridge the divide
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:09.920]   between government, tech, and finance.
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.920]   I mean, this is like a three-sided prisoner's dilemma situation
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:16.920]   where each one feels as though they're operating on their own
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:19.920]   and they're powerful, and they don't have anything to gain
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.920]   from collaborating, not really.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.920]   When we all know that if there was a way to get them
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:27.920]   to incent them to collaborate and to start doing some of this work
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.920]   so that it was more defined by public good and long-term values,
[00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:32.920]   then we'd all benefit.
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.920]   I know you look at the future, but let me add, and I don't,
[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:40.920]   but so I don't have a crystal ball, but it looks to me,
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:44.920]   and you correct me if this is a completely crazy analysis.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.920]   It looks to me like the government in the United States
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.920]   has become increasingly dysfunctional.
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:56.920]   And as a result, nothing is controlling the growth of big tech,
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:59.920]   the directions big tech research takes.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:01.920]   Big tech is in effect.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.920]   It happened during COVID, in effect.
[00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:06.920]   I wouldn't say this isn't even just a big tech problem.
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:07.920]   Big business, generally.
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:08.920]   Big business.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:09.920]   Okay.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:10.920]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:11.920]   It's not just tech.
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:12.920]   You're right, Parath.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.920]   But business has stepped up and said, look, we'll take it from here.
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:19.920]   But there is definitely in that Silicon Valley has that mentality
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.920]   of we're technocrats.
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.920]   We understand this much better than government.
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:24.920]   Government's dysfunctional.
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:25.920]   It's too slow.
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.920]   It's too stupid.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:28.920]   We'll take it from here.
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:30.920]   Yes, and they have a point.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:32.920]   Government has become dysfunctional.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:36.920]   Democracy was weakened, and we now have a crisis of trust.
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:37.920]   People don't trust government.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.920]   They don't trust the private sector.
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:40.920]   They don't trust each other.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:44.920]   This is how we got to masks, you know, have microchips in them
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.920]   and wearing a mask is somehow uncatriotic.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:50.920]   It's been going on though since LBJ in the Vietnam War.
[00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:51.920]   It's been built.
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:54.920]   Okay, so LBJ then Nixon, it's been building.
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.920]   So here's the issue.
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:01.920]   The issue is that we're living in an era where we're being fed information
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:06.920]   that is predetermined by automated systems to capture our attention
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.920]   or to get us to spend more money or whatever.
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:12.920]   I was just in Dubai for the past couple of days.
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:16.920]   The world outside of the United States is radically different.
[00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.920]   This is not how other countries operate.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.920]   I'm much more scared by Dubai.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:25.920]   Dubai is far more authoritarian than what was.
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.920]   Oh, I'm not saying that the KSA and UAE,
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.920]   I'm not saying that they're doing it right either.
[00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:36.920]   What I am saying is that the world has an internet that is being splintered,
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.920]   but that internet is very much an American internet,
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:44.920]   and we lead with particular values, which I think are good in some ways,
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.920]   and are self-defeating in others.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:50.920]   I'll defend American values, but I don't think globally.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:56.920]   I mean, you go to Dubai, that's a perfect example of capital out of control
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:02.920]   because of oil and just kind of a long-term prospects for Dubai.
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.920]   I don't think are good for a variety of reasons.
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:08.920]   But I will defend American values anyway,
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:11.920]   and it used to be that we were trying to spread those values
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.920]   that we believed in, at least in our heads,
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:16.920]   the mythology of democracy and all of that.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:22.920]   I think that's, I would say, argue pretty much demonstrably
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.920]   the better way to run things than anything else out there.
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:30.920]   The EU would disagree because, again, outside of the United States,
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:34.920]   it very much looks like our entire modus operandi
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.920]   is about making money at all costs.
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.920]   That's how we got to surveillance capital.
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.920]   Capitalism out of control, yeah.
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:41.920]   Correct.
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.920]   These are publicly traded companies.
[00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:46.920]   They are designed to earn revenue, and they should.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:50.920]   I'm saying that people should be, people in companies should be able to earn money,
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:56.920]   but we need to do this in a way that doesn't damage us in some ways in the future.
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:01.920]   I think you can strike a balance, but from an outside of this country,
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:05.920]   every time I'm in a room with people from other countries looking at us,
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:09.920]   especially when it comes to the internet and digital systems,
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:11.920]   we don't look great.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:15.920]   I don't think anybody would argue with our ingenuity and creativity,
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:20.920]   but at what cost is the question that I think they ask oftentimes.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:24.920]   Who was it said, democracy is the worst form of government except all the others?
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:28.920]   I think that's kind of where we are.
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:31.920]   Look, it's not perfect. Clearly, we've got a big problem.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:36.920]   Lots of problems, lots of dysfunction, but I'll put us up against the EU.
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:40.920]   Do you think they're more successful because they're more collectivist?
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:41.920]   No.
[00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:48.920]   Listen, if you look at net net, the amount of solutions-oriented,
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:52.920]   sort of future facing, plus also just cool whiz-bang tech and science,
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.920]   it's coming out of the United States.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:45:02.920]   But we also have wealth disparity unlike other countries,
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:04.920]   other modern economies.
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:08.920]   We have lower levels of trust in our democratically elected government
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:09.920]   than others do.
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:13.920]   Our access to education is way off-kilter.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:17.920]   So, yeah, we're producing amazing tech and science,
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.920]   and our economy is very strong,
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:25.920]   but we are up against a formidable foe in China,
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:30.920]   which has its own ideas about what the future should look like.
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:35.920]   And we don't have an idea of what the future- collectively,
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.920]   America doesn't have an idea of what the future should look like.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:41.920]   It's not anywhere on paper, not really.
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:44.920]   Now, again, the Saudis are not doing great stuff.
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.920]   One thing they do well is they plan and they execute.
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:52.920]   So authoritarian regimes are always going to execute more efficiently.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.920]   It makes it easier, but there are plenty of non-authoritarian regimes
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.920]   that are able to do the same thing.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:04.920]   I'll sort of- I'll stop here, but I- you know, this is why- if I had unlimited money,
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:08.920]   the thing that I would do with that unlimited money would be to create
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:12.920]   some type of system where every American has to spend like a month
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:14.920]   somewhere outside of this country.
[00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:17.920]   And they have to do it when they're a teenager,
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:20.920]   because that's when your mind is forming, right?
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:24.920]   And come back with a totally different perspective on- I agree with that,
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:25.920]   because we are very insular.
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:29.920]   And historically, always have been going back to the America First Movement
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:30.920]   and Charles Lindbergh.
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.920]   We've been very insular and isolated.
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.920]   Actually, I think public service should come back,
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.920]   and maybe the Peace Corps is a solution. Completely agree.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:38.920]   It should be mandatory.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:46.920]   Do you defend Amazon Paris? You cover it directly.
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:53.920]   I think defend is a strong- I don't really know what defend means in this case.
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:47:01.920]   I think Amazon has grown to such a size that it- I guess it just is and will be.
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:05.920]   I mean, it is a lot of different companies-
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:06.920]   Forever and ever, amen.
[00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:10.920]   I mean, one thing that I realized when I started on the speed is that
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.920]   I at first was like, "Oh, you know, covering just one company.
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.920]   You want that to be kind of constraining?" No, Amazon is like-
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:16.920]   It's everything.
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:17.920]   10 to 20 different companies.
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:18.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:21.920]   It could be 10 to 20 different realities all put in one.
[00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:26.920]   Plus, I think it's fair to say that what's going on in Amazon is a microcosm
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:28.920]   of what's going on in general, right?
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:32.920]   I mean, I suppose when you have a company as large as Amazon,
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:36.920]   in both, I guess, the blue color sense and the white color sense,
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:41.920]   it is going to outlast us all.
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:46.920]   I mean, Amazon is going to continue doing what Amazon is going to do
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:50.920]   regardless of what any of us think or want.
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:55.920]   Do you think Bezos leaving the company to Andy Jassy is going to make a difference
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:59.920]   or is Bezos going to continue to call the shots?
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:03.920]   I mean, I think the fact that he didn't step back from the company,
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:09.920]   he's executive director of the board, speaks to the fact that he still has quite a lot of power.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.920]   But I mean, Jassy is CEO.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:17.920]   The thing that I know from speaking with people who are close to the two of them is
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:24.920]   I believe quite a handful of people that I've asked kind of about the difference between the two have said
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:27.920]   Jassy is human.
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:29.920]   Jassy is a...
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:31.920]   As opposed to Jassy.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:38.920]   I mean, so Jassy, I've heard cares a lot about employees as human beings.
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:41.920]   I think someone I was speaking to the other way could say,
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:48.920]   Jassy is the sort of person who would understand why his employees would want to volunteer one day a month.
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:52.920]   Jassy, right now, he is just in the first couple of months of his tenure as CEO,
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:55.920]   so he is just trying to make the transition.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:49:03.920]   But eventually he is the sort of person that could bring a softer side to Amazon,
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:11.920]   or at least a more humane and holistic approach to leading the company that is less focused on growth at all costs.
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:12.920]   Because it's already huge.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:13.920]   Right.
[00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:14.920]   Right.
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:18.920]   I honestly think that it's interesting, and I'm reading tea leaves,
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:24.920]   but I honestly think government is scared of Amazon because it looks like it's going to just eat the world.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:25.920]   And so...
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:27.920]   I mean, I think government is scared of a lot of businesses for that reason.
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:28.920]   But they're at the same time.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:32.920]   And that's part of the way that this country is set up is, you know,
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:39.920]   we have incredibly large corporations that have an incredible amount of influence over politics and day-to-day life.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:40.920]   Right.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:46.920]   That's the... at the same time, they're completely dependent on these businesses for campaign fundraising.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.920]   For lobbying money, you know.
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:54.920]   I mean, Facebook... I mean, how many politicians use Facebook to get elected?
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.920]   So everybody.
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:57.920]   Right.
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:58.920]   So at the same time...
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:01.920]   I don't think they want to go away.
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:02.920]   I think they just...
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:07.920]   Listen, when you're in DC, there's a hierarchy and people listen.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.920]   I think the... you know, and this is like...
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:12.920]   So like, think of any situation where you're top banana.
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.920]   Like, we're all top banana somewhere, right?
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:16.920]   I hope.
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:17.920]   So like...
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:18.920]   So like partly my cat...
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:19.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.920]   I am top banana.
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.920]   I'm not sure about the cats.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:30.920]   So when you leave, and now you're suddenly in another place in a different social circle among other people,
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:35.920]   and you're no longer top banana, in fact, you're kind of like an apple when everybody else, you know,
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:40.920]   you're like a totally different fruit now, and you have very little clout.
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:42.920]   You know, that rubs people the wrong way.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:47.920]   And I think that's... you know, I do a lot of work in DC, and that seems to be what's happening.
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:52.920]   The tech sector kind of doesn't need to play by the same rules.
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:57.920]   You know, and the regulators don't have the same... the deference isn't there.
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:00.920]   And I think that's part of the challenge, right?
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:03.920]   It's the lack of deference and trust and respect.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:07.920]   So they want the company's to bend a knee?
[00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:08.920]   I think so.
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:09.920]   Wow.
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:10.920]   I do.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:15.920]   And you're, you know, Mark Zuckerberg and your task building the metaverse or your Jeff Bezos
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:20.920]   and you want to build a moon business park colony, you don't really have to bend the knee.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:24.920]   I think they're willing to appear to bend the knee.
[00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:25.920]   Yeah, but nothing else.
[00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:26.920]   Nothing else.
[00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:30.920]   And I think what they do is they appear to bend the knee, all right, fine, whatever.
[00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:35.920]   Look at Tim Cook going hat in hand to meetings with Donald Trump.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:38.920]   You could tell he was gritting his teeth, but he did it.
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:43.920]   So many of the photos from that original meeting in the Trump Tower with all the tech CEOs
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:48.920]   and Donald Trump, where it looks like all the tech CEOs are being like held hostage.
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:49.920]   They have the most pain smiles.
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.920]   But they're bending a knee because that's what you do.
[00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:56.920]   And they're in the background writing checks and making sure the right people get elected
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:01.920]   and lobbying like hell because they know ultimately they're going to win.
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:04.920]   So I don't think the appearance of bending a knee is an issue.
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:05.920]   If that's all it got.
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:07.920]   I wouldn't even say it was bending the knee though.
[00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:09.920]   I think in that case, they're just looking out for themselves.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:15.920]   They're like, oh, I want to come here and appease these people's egos so that my company can
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:20.920]   continue to get the tax cuts or this law passed that we care about or whatever it is.
[00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.920]   But to real people, that's a battle between dinosaurs.
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:25.920]   I mean, giants.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:26.920]   We don't care.
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:27.920]   They're up there.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.920]   Government, big business.
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:36.920]   Meanwhile, more people quit their jobs for the second straight month in a row than in history.
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:39.920]   4.4 million people quit their jobs in September.
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:48.920]   3% of the nation's workforce up from 4.3 the month before, far above the pre-pandemic level.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:51.920]   There is this is called the Great Resignation.
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:57.920]   And I think this is a bunch of normal people looking up at Congress and big business and saying
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:02.920]   neither one of you are taking care of us screw you.
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:08.920]   And I think that's a third constituency that I would be seriously concerned about if I were
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:10.920]   thinking about government.
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:16.920]   And Leo, you just said something that was pretty interesting, which is the everyday people.
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:24.920]   If you ask yourself, who do everyday people come into more, like of all the rules and restrictions
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:29.920]   and ways that we operate, who has more direct control over people's everyday lives?
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:30.920]   It's tech companies.
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:31.920]   It's not government.
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:32.920]   Right?
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:37.920]   The Amazon dictates lots of how I get through my day.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:43.920]   So does Google, so does Microsoft, all of these companies and their automated systems are controlling
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:50.920]   much more of me than the government does in a practical way on a day-to-day basis.
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:55.320]   So that's something worth considering as we're thinking about the future of governance, but
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:56.920]   as it relates to jobs.
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:59.920]   So again, I was on the BLS website.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:00.920]   So this is fun.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:04.920]   If anybody wants a take-home activity for the week, here's what you do.
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:06.920]   Go to the Bureau of Labor Statistics website.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:12.920]   Oh, that was the sound of thousands of people shutting their podcast out.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.920]   It's really good.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:17.920]   And Paris, I think you will love this.
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:18.920]   Oh, no, I love this.
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:22.920]   I'm literally looking at four graphs right now.
[00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:27.920]   So if you dive in, so they are the ones who are tracking the employment data.
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:34.800]   And if you dive in to how they've categorized jobs and you look at journalists, no modern
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:36.880]   journalism jobs are listed.
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:39.920]   There are jobs for like, I don't even know, like I'm a-
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:41.920]   Type-setters.
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:42.920]   Disks jockey.
[00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.920]   Literally the words "disks jockey" are there.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:48.840]   But podcaster is not there.
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:53.480]   And as we all know, if you have bad data in, you're going to get bad data out on the other
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:54.480]   end.
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:58.920]   I think it's one thing to say, everybody's quitting their jobs.
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.480]   All of these jobs are open.
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:03.080]   You know, WTF, the economy.
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:06.800]   But it's another thing to get actual data out there.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:13.800]   And the economists, my academic backgrounds in economics and game theory, and I don't
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:19.760]   think a single economist would have predicted that we'd hit $80 oil barrel prices, that
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:24.680]   we would have this topsy-turvy situation with the workforce.
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:28.600]   And part of the problem is that we're not counting people and their jobs correctly,
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.080]   especially in the tech sector.
[00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:37.120]   Oh my god, like tech sector jobs are completely misrepresented in those data sets.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:38.120]   That's an interesting-
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:40.000]   Yeah, that's an interesting data point.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:45.360]   And bad information means you bad policy because you're not making correct decisions
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:47.440]   based on the information you've got.
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:53.560]   I'm looking at a series of charts here from the Washington Post about kind of the different
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:58.040]   industries that are seeing the highest amounts of employees quitting.
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:00.640]   And the top two or three are-
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:01.640]   Teaches, restaurants.
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:02.640]   Yeah.
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:03.640]   Sorry.
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:05.240]   It's actually through all disc jockeys.
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:08.480]   Only disc jockeys are quitting their jobs, which is really surprising.
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:11.400]   They should really call it the great disc jockey resignation.
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:12.600]   But, you know-
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:15.120]   Restaurants, obviously, you go to any restaurant.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:16.120]   They're all hot-
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.440]   Restaurant bars, hotels.
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.080]   I mean, makes sense given the sort of-
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:20.080]   Are these crap Josh?
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:21.240]   Is that's what it is really?
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:22.240]   Is it just poorly-
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.800]   I mean, I think it's a combination of things.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:29.600]   I think it's traditionally people who are working in the restaurant or hospitality industry
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:33.360]   are not getting paid the amount, probably, that they should.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:38.880]   Plus, they're having to deal with a bunch of angry or insane customers.
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:42.520]   I'm going to extend it though a little bit and say, and I think you saw this in the tech
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:44.640]   industry with engineers.
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:46.600]   Those are starting to feel more and more empowered.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:48.400]   It used to be a union movement, right?
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.280]   But I don't know now what it is exactly.
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:54.760]   Although some of its union, I saw the wire cutter, is saying, "We're going to go on strike
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:56.760]   on Black Friday."
[00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:59.320]   Good luck with that one, right?
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:00.320]   New York Times?
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:01.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:04.800]   They're going on strike starting on Black Friday, if their needs aren't-
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:06.800]   They should go on striking everybody.
[00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:07.800]   They're asking for more.
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:11.040]   I guess like during, yeah, they're going on strike for that whole period and asking for
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:14.080]   people not to click on wire cutter things.
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:20.320]   But the other categories are retail trade, arts entertainment and recreation, and professional
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:21.320]   and business.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:22.320]   No interesting.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.400]   It seems to be all over.
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:25.720]   People are unsatisfied.
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:28.960]   So workers are saying, "These jobs are crappy.
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:32.000]   I'm not going to take it anymore.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.240]   Are they just sitting around unemployed?
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:35.400]   What's happening?
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:36.400]   What's going to happen?"
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:41.240]   I mean, this sounds like the first stages of a revolution, if anything.
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:43.560]   I wonder, so French Revolution aside.
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:49.360]   I wonder if there's another side to the story, and that's on the employer side.
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:57.400]   So I've got a close friend who's an avid listener to Twit, who's a brilliant chief technology
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:00.680]   officer and- As are all our listeners, yes.
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:03.240]   I mean, he's amazing.
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:06.360]   He got laid off because the company is going through all these changes.
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:07.360]   He's having a heart.
[00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:08.360]   He's in his 40s.
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:09.960]   He's having a hard time finding a job.
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:17.800]   I've got another friend who's another penetration tester all up on his certifications and things.
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:26.240]   There are jobs, but there are new criteria in the post in this current COVID world.
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:31.720]   I'm wondering how much of this outside of the usual suspects, like restaurants?
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:36.920]   I wonder how much of this is employers digging in their heels and mandating that work is
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:38.960]   like it used to be, but we're all living in this-
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:39.960]   We don't want it.
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:40.960]   We don't want it to take it.
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:41.960]   Right.
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:44.560]   Well, maybe it's something we don't want it, but we don't have a choice.
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:45.920]   You see restaurants.
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:49.080]   So we know about that because if you're just out and about, you see all the help, you want
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:50.080]   it.
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:53.320]   You don't see people on post on telephone calls, pen tester needed.
[00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:57.480]   So we don't know, and apparently, neither does the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:02.040]   We don't really know what's going on there, but I would guess that you nailed it.
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:07.760]   That's exactly what's happening is that the world has changed and employers have not
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:08.760]   caught on.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:12.520]   I mean, I think this is also what you're seeing in the logistics industry.
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:17.240]   We're currently having, you know, the supply chain crisis and also supply chain crisis.
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:22.320]   And that's in some way, in a long, I mean, half of it is extra is made worse by the fact
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:24.760]   that there are not, are not enough truck drivers.
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:28.400]   There are not enough warehouse employees to unload the trucks if they could get there.
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:32.960]   There are not enough people to crew the ships that will take the thing to be put in the
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:39.080]   truck, all aspects of the labor equation are kind of falling apart because employers are
[00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:42.440]   having a hard time attracting employees.
[00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:48.240]   Well, and also many employers went down the Uber route.
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:51.560]   This is, I read it, there was a great medium post by a truck driver saying part of this
[00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:56.800]   is a lot of companies are hiring truck drivers as contractors and they're paying them per
[00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:04.440]   job, but if you have to wait 12, 15, 20 hours to get a container at the container port,
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.880]   you don't get paid for that.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.560]   So people are just saying it's not, it's not worth it to drive a truck.
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:15.400]   So this is the thing is that the trucking industry has long said, Oh, we have a labor
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:16.400]   shortage.
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:22.200]   They've been saying that since like the 80s and it goes back to, you know, right around
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:29.600]   70s, 80s, there was a great deregulation of the trucking industry in the US in particular.
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:37.120]   And since then truckers are paid, you know, only a cup, a handful of cents per mile.
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:38.560]   They don't really have benefits.
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.560]   They have jobs.
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:42.840]   They have to be out, you know, away from their family for weeks.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:47.080]   Many of them have to purchase their own vehicles and handle all of their own lysusings.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.120]   They end up in a lot of debt to the companies.
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:54.280]   It's not a good job and people shockingly don't want to do it.
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:57.920]   When the labor market is tight, they are like, why would I do that when I could do anything
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:58.920]   else?
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:04.040]   I would add one other problem and it's, it's the, it's not automation, which is the story
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.800]   we hear all the time.
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.880]   It's the threat of automation.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:14.360]   So in a lot of these positions like trucking or the trades, you have to go through extensive
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.360]   training.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:16.360]   You have to get special licenses.
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:18.960]   You have to, in some cases, join unions.
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:23.400]   And the trades have been having similar problems that, that predate COVID.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:28.960]   But people are not willing to go into these fields anymore, in part because America has
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:34.320]   told everybody that if they don't go to a four year college, then like they're not welcome.
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:39.240]   And that trade schools are pointless, which is a stupid message to be sending.
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:45.520]   But if you're constantly talking about AI and the robots coming to take your jobs just
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:51.160]   before the robots come to kill us on our sleep, then you're sending a message that shortages
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:54.760]   or no shortages, we don't need, you know, like, why would I, why would I go through
[01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:58.920]   the process that, that Paris just described to get this job in trucking?
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:02.920]   If like my, if I'm not going to need to do this anymore in five years, because the robots
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:03.920]   are going to drive themselves.
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:04.920]   Yeah, we've been told that, right.
[01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:05.920]   We've been told that.
[01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:06.920]   Which is not true.
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:11.640]   And it's on a longer trajectory, but we haven't effect like we should be figuring out ways to
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:17.640]   encourage people and to make it more equitable, reasonable for them to work these jobs.
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:23.400]   In, in chess, the great grandmaster Aaron Nimzovich once said, the threat is stronger
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.480]   than the execution.
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.240]   And I think that that's the same thing.
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:31.680]   We're more worried about what Amazon is about to become than what Amazon is today.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:37.400]   We're more worried about what our jobs are going to turn into than what they are today.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:42.000]   I think there's a generalized fear of where we're headed.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.120]   Yes.
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:47.320]   And what do you do about that?
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:51.800]   Well fear tends to drive a lot of our decision making unfortunately.
[01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:57.440]   We aren't as motivated by the promise of something different because that implies change.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:05.720]   So in my field, we're constantly contending with do we motivate people using, you know,
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:10.360]   more dystopian scenarios to get them to see opportunity on the other side or what is it
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:11.360]   that we do?
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:17.600]   And people just respond more to fear than they do to, you know, possible opportunities for
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:18.600]   change.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:19.600]   Yeah.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:20.600]   You know.
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:21.600]   Well, you're the futurist.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.600]   Get on it.
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.600]   Yeah, I'll get right on that.
[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:24.600]   Can I ask?
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:27.440]   Actually, could I ask Paris a question related to Amazon?
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:28.440]   Please.
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.440]   You might love it.
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:30.440]   So Paris, it relates to trucking.
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:35.560]   By any chance have you been following Amazon's weird, very quiet project around
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:38.800]   coal mining and trucking and coal mines.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.760]   Coal mining specifically?
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:41.760]   No.
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.760]   That is going to be a future looking.
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:48.800]   Now Amazon was telling me like these.
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:52.800]   They were, I don't, I'm fuzzy on the exact details, but I know that they were working
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:58.720]   with some mine, I believe, in Virginia or West Virginia or somewhere.
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:07.680]   And they were trying to use data to save money on fuel by making the trip more efficient.
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.480]   So like there's this exact pot hole.
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:12.680]   They were basically creating like a digital twin of the route.
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:16.440]   And like if there's a pot hole right here, then like these trucks were totally loaded
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:22.320]   with sensors, then this is, you do these things and like this will make the route more efficient
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:25.080]   and therefore the margin will be X percent higher.
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:28.280]   That's, I mean, Amazon's business is to some degree data.
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:29.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:30.880]   So this was really interesting.
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:31.880]   Yeah.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:33.280]   I don't want to spread.
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:34.280]   It's interesting.
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:40.160]   I'm unsure about the trucking, I'm unsure about the mining aspect, but Amazon over the
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:46.280]   last couple of years has made considerable investments into its trucking network, but
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:51.960]   not in the point of Amazon's actual direct paid truck drivers.
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:57.480]   It specifically has created kind of this uber like app called Amazon Relay that then they
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:03.600]   can use to get independent contractors to either use Amazon's trucks or their own trucks
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.520]   to haul Amazon loads.
[01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:09.640]   But part of that requires them using the navigation software built in.
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:10.800]   Which they hate, right?
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:15.720]   I mean, the truckers hate because they often gets things totally wrong.
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:20.720]   And I mean, there's a lot of funny side effects I found were like, there'll be some dead end
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:27.440]   industry in West Virginia that every day gets dozens of Amazon tractor trailers stuck
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:30.840]   in it and is accidentally knocked over, you know, gravestone.
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:33.360]   You had that story about wemo of that way.
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:39.200]   But he's getting stuck in a dead end and since this happens everywhere because Amazon trucks
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.360]   are going everywhere now.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.680]   But Amazon's GPS is not the most accurate.
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:52.160]   So when it messes up, it really messes up and it can cause kind of nightmare situations.
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:57.440]   So this is Relay.Amazon.com and they're actively soliciting.
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:58.680]   Is that it?
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:05:59.680]   No.
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:03.080]   So this is the might be related to the coal mining.
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:07.320]   This is the technology that kind of is the backbone of Amazon's truck.
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:12.280]   They have both a thing for trucking carriers, which you know, allows you to like book gigs
[01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:13.920]   kind of like Uber.
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:17.480]   And then they have another side, which is freight, which is for shippers.
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:22.520]   You could contact Amazon and then hire one of these truckers to move your own stuff.
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.520]   This is exactly.
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:28.320]   Because Amazon wants to build up this huge network of trucks so that they have extra
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:30.200]   capacity to use during the holiday.
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.160]   So your stuff arrives on time.
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.520]   Amazon understands that logistics is a big part of its business.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:39.040]   But this is exactly this to me is exactly what scares people about Amazon is they go,
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.600]   oh, they have a finger in that pie.
[01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.160]   Oh, they have a finger in that pie.
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:48.880]   So the fear that eventually we're going to be living in Amazon land and they're going
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.200]   to have a finger in every pie.
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:56.160]   Well, we could have literally been living in Amazon land for a hot minute.
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:00.160]   Amazon had partnered with Lanar, which is America's largest home builder.
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.160]   Oh, that's right.
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:02.960]   And they were building-- Echo houses.
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:04.960]   Right.
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:10.280]   So they were building houses that were outfitted completely with Amazon products and came with
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:12.400]   onsite tech support.
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:17.560]   And if you wanted such an Amazon smart home completely outfitted with all of these different
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:22.320]   products and a smart home system that to some degree was interoperable, you could actually
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:26.320]   go to amazon.com and look for one of those houses.
[01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:31.080]   So for a while they had a partnership with Sotheby's-- some of the big readers.
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:32.080]   Right.
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:33.080]   Right.
[01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:34.720]   And it was called Turnkey.
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:36.440]   And you went to that page.
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:41.360]   You typed in wherever you were looking and it would spit out-- it would automatically
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.800]   connect you with a retailer who could sell you an Amazon home.
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:49.520]   So the thing to me, I actually went with all of this to the Fed and I said-- we work with
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:51.000]   the Federal Reserve sometimes.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:54.800]   And I said, listen, I don't think Amazon's permanently in the housing business.
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:08:02.360]   However, what does it mean that theoretically a third party could have better and more real
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:05.560]   time-- like the real time piece of this is key.
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:13.280]   Real time, accurate housing market data, then the government-- the government.
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:18.480]   And they could potentially correlate those data points with like, where are people shopping?
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.480]   In what neighborhood?
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:23.560]   How much people-- like are you eating microwave popcorn?
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:26.960]   And once it got delivered to your house on a Tuesday in the middle of afternoon, are
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:33.640]   you using your spoken interface, your Alexa powered $59 Amazon basics microwave to pop
[01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:34.920]   the popcorn?
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:38.560]   Your entire life becomes this one enormous data stream.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:43.000]   If you go to throw away the empty bag, there's a little scanner attachment.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   This exists, by the way.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.480]   That's Alexa powered that you can clip onto your garbage can and scan everything you throw
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:50.480]   away.
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:51.640]   It goes back to Amazon.
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:53.480]   It'll reorder for you.
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:54.640]   I mean, suddenly this gives real time.
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:55.640]   They have a fridge.
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:58.240]   They're coming out too that will do the same thing.
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:03.400]   So this is like real-- but from a data perspective, this is what's important.
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:10.320]   This gives a window into real time consumption, real time retail, real time housing, unlike
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:13.560]   anything we've ever-- and we've ever seen before.
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:17.680]   And then the main collectors of those data typically are government entities who are
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:20.680]   always 18 to 24 months behind.
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:22.240]   That's why they have to issue corrections.
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:28.360]   You can buy a house in Playa del Carmen, Mexico through an app.
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:34.120]   By the way, Jeff Bezos, major investor, called La House.
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:36.840]   And in fact, the only reason I know this is that this week they announced they're going
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:42.640]   to accept Bitcoin to buy houses in Mexico through this app.
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:52.160]   So again, it's a line I think by Ben Thompson.
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:56.760]   He'd written this in one of his first for Techery, however you pronounce it, is that
[01:09:56.760 --> 01:10:02.880]   Amazon's goal is to take a cut of all economic activity, which a little bit out there as
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.040]   far as statements go.
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:08.400]   But I think that it kind of speaks to the company, maybe sees the world, is that,
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.400]   sensibly, they're more obsessed.
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:16.560]   They want to be able to make every thing that you, their customer, does better in some way
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:21.880]   or provide a solution that would be useful to you in the most generous sense of the world.
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:26.400]   But what that means is that they want to be a part of every single aspect of your life
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:30.280]   and collecting data on all of that so that they can turn that into more money.
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:34.360]   Yeah, it's not a bad business model.
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:37.280]   I mean, it is a business model.
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.280]   It's a business model.
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:40.040]   I can see why people will be nervous about that.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:45.680]   And in a way, it's a mark of respect to Jeff Bezos because you kind of assume he is going
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:49.200]   to execute on this plan and might even succeed.
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:54.960]   Well, I think the key is it's all about these pockets of learning.
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:11:00.360]   To me, is it plausible that at some point Amazon might launch its own housing related
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:01.360]   something?
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:02.360]   Absolutely.
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:07.360]   Maybe they're not going to be selling, constructing and selling smart homes anymore, but maybe
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:11.560]   they're going to create a affordable housing option that subsidizes as long as you're
[01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:17.920]   using all Amazon products and you open up a pipeline for your data.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:23.920]   I was in a meeting with, this was weft a couple years ago, the partnership with Lenard had
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:28.880]   just ended and the head of that organization on I were in the small meeting room together.
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:30.640]   And he wasn't the head.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:34.000]   He was somebody who was higher up at Lenard.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.480]   And he was kind of disparaging the partnership and oh, you know, didn't work out.
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:38.880]   All this was silly to begin with.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:41.360]   And I'm like, dude, you're totally missing the point.
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:43.600]   This was never intended to be a long term deal.
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:47.400]   This was about, this was an experiment where you were the guinea pig on this way.
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:53.800]   It didn't work out when that big shark ate us.
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:54.800]   Yeah.
[01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:55.800]   Didn't work out.
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:58.960]   We're inside of Moby Dick now.
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:01.000]   That wasn't a good business.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.000]   What is this thing?
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   The shark goes, who?
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   How about a hard time reading inside this shark stomach?
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:13.120]   I just, it's so easy to have apocalyptic visions of the future.
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:16.920]   You know, life has always been like this, I suppose, and up and down and people who
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:22.760]   are in the middle of it, you know, kind of simultaneously unaware of it and terrified
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:23.960]   about the future.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:30.680]   But I do wonder what this newly empowered workforce versus a dysfunctional government
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:36.320]   versus a technocrat who want to run it all, how is this going to shake out?
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:40.640]   Maybe it'll just, you know, we'll just bounce along and, you know, democracy will continue
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:43.040]   and we'll kind of muddle our way through.
[01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.360]   Or maybe not.
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:48.200]   And I just really wonder, and I suppose it's not really the portfolio of the show to figure
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:53.920]   that out, but since I have Amy Webb and Paris Martyno here, I think it's a worthwhile question.
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:57.600]   One thing I'm incredibly interested in, which is obviously a question we can never answer,
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:13:06.200]   but what would this great resignation look like if people in the US had a healthcare
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:07.840]   that wasn't either of their employers?
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:08.840]   Be very different.
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:09.840]   I know anecdotally.
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:10.840]   Yep.
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:21.880]   And I think that the fact that we're seeing this much of a kind of, you know, a bubble
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:26.880]   with that speaks to perhaps what is going on underneath the surface.
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:27.880]   Yeah.
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:32.320]   Because right in the United States, healthcare really is employer based healthcare.
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:33.320]   That's how we can help.
[01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:37.960]   I mean, yeah, people can say that Cobra and, you know, the marketplace do exist, but for
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:41.560]   most people, that's not an affordable or realistic option.
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:46.000]   Maybe Obamacare did kind of open the door a little bit to that great resignation.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.480]   Yeah, I think it did in a bit.
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:53.540]   But for a lot of people, I mean, I have friends, I have a friend who had been exploring this
[01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:54.840]   option with his job.
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:57.520]   He's like, oh, you know, I'm really unhappy at work.
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:01.360]   I know I could make some good money freelancing, but he looked into it and he was like, you
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:07.400]   know, for me, a person who actually does use healthcare services, the options available
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.600]   in the open marketplace really don't work right now.
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:10.600]   That's right.
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:13.720]   But I think that goes back to speaking to kind of the governmental dysfunction.
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:18.040]   You know, I mean, there have been a lot of cuts to that program since it was put together.
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:22.040]   Our Canadian friend Renee Richie has said himself, you know, he used to work at I'm
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:27.800]   more and he decided to quit and start a YouTube channel and really try to invest in his own
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:28.800]   brand on YouTube.
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:32.480]   He couldn't have done it if he didn't have healthcare from the Canadian government.
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:33.480]   So that's-
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:37.640]   I wonder if the people who are resigning are those people where my hunch, I haven't seen
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:42.440]   the data, but my hunch is that there's probably a correlation between people who are resigning
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:45.880]   and people who did not have healthcare meaning they were able to leave.
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:47.320]   I think you're exactly right.
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:48.320]   Yeah.
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:49.320]   I think you're exactly right.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:51.160]   That's part of why they were crap jobs.
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.160]   Now, can I give you a-
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:57.440]   Or perhaps they're, you know, in a relationship or where their partner has healthcare or something
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:58.440]   like that.
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:01.640]   Yeah, that actually would be a pretty interesting, again, like if any of you are-
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:02.640]   It's only-
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:03.640]   It's just getting deep.
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:08.040]   That'd be interesting to see if the number of marriages went up over the past two years.
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:11.720]   I think the number of divorces has gone up dramatically because of COVID.
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:12.720]   Right.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:13.720]   I'm maybe wrong on that.
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:14.640]   May that just be anecdotal, but-
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:18.080]   But that would be like another cool like data project.
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:19.080]   Yeah.
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:22.360]   I wonder if the number of marriages in certain markets has gone up because of insurance.
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.960]   But can I give you an alternative future?
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:24.960]   Yes.
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:30.040]   Picture a future in which you have a whole bunch of IPPE6 connected products all over your
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:35.040]   house because most of the electronics we buy now, my coffee machine requires an internet
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:36.040]   connection, right?
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:38.480]   Everything increasingly requires internet connections.
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:41.040]   And you can use a system like Boink.
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:46.000]   I don't know if you ever use this Leo might have like in the 90s, you could donate your
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000]   unused computer to Berkeley.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000]   Yeah.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000]   I used to donate my-
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.500]   I say donate.
[01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:51.520]   My parents say-
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:57.000]   Use a different word because back then we were still paying time-based internet connections.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.560]   It's like no donating.
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:15:59.560]   Yeah.
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:04.160]   Using a lot more connectivity on their dollar.
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:06.120]   But you could donate it for whatever.
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:09.560]   You were doing protein folding or you were doing a search for-
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:10.560]   I was doing study.
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:11.560]   You were doing study.
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:12.560]   Yeah.
[01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:13.560]   Yeah.
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:17.720]   So now there's a network called Gollum, Gollum Network.
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:18.720]   There's others.
[01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:20.200]   That's not a propitious name.
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:22.920]   Boink and Gollum are really great names.
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:23.920]   Yeah.
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:28.080]   Well, so that's kind of like an Airbnb for your phone.
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:31.480]   So like I used to donate the unused computer.
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:34.960]   This is where you get remunerated, but at the moment it's just in crypto and very few
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:35.960]   people can use it.
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:37.480]   But I could imagine several years from now-
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:38.480]   Is this Gollum?
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:39.480]   Gollum.
[01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:40.480]   Gollum.
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:41.480]   I don't know.
[01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:43.640]   Gollum is the creature in Lord of the Rings.
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:48.000]   Gollum is the mud creature in Yiddish mythology.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000]   Yes.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.640]   I think that's more what they're thinking.
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:52.600]   I think they're both bad either way.
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:55.040]   It's not the prizes for a company.
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:57.040]   But it was available.
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.600]   Gollum was available.
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:16:59.600]   So that's good.
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:00.600]   Yeah.
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.400]   But anyhow, I could imagine a future.
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:05.280]   Right now it just works on a mobile device or a computer I guess.
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:11.120]   But I could imagine a future in which I rent out all of the compute for my coffee machine
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.760]   and my refrigerator, everything.
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:15.680]   And they're all working for me.
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:19.680]   I'm potentially working 30 jobs at once.
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:23.640]   And maybe I'm earning some small amount per device.
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:24.640]   So like-
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.440]   Stacey Legan-Botham does that.
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:27.440]   With her router.
[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:28.440]   Yeah.
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:32.760]   And it's some sort of a cryptocurrency she's getting.
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:34.640]   This sounds, Gollum sounds really interesting.
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:35.640]   It's a pretty cool.
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:36.640]   It is pretty cool.
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:38.040]   The sentence, I don't know what it means.
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:43.920]   But Gollum network is an accessible, reliable, open access and censorship resistant protocol,
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:48.800]   democratizing access to digital resources and connecting users through a flexible open
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:49.960]   source platform.
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:52.600]   It sounds like the Bitcoin of connectivity.
[01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:53.600]   It is.
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:54.600]   It's pretty cool, right?
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:55.600]   Yeah.
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.880]   But like my dad couldn't use that.
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:02.840]   So here's where I think this becomes interesting, a plausible alternative future for the everyday
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:03.840]   person.
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:07.160]   If somebody built some type of interface, right?
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:08.160]   I'm doing this.
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:11.440]   That would allow me to connect everything.
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:16.280]   And then I could get crypto in a way that I could actually use it.
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:19.040]   You get paid in GLM, which is I guess Gollum plus.
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:20.680]   Right now it's not super useful.
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:24.040]   But I could imagine a future in which the same structures are in place and the same
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.280]   beneficiaries are there.
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:29.080]   But there's like a middleware layer to make this accessible.
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:33.520]   Like if I was an ISP, I, I, they would never do this.
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:34.920]   But I would totally do this.
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:39.240]   If I was an ISP, this is like they're getting squeezed because there's their profit margins
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:41.200]   are crappy.
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:45.560]   This is a way for them to actually build a meaningful system and they can scrape some
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:50.000]   percent, 2%, 3% off by creating the middleware.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:55.600]   And then everyday people, it's in a way, it's almost a way of re-imagining a UBI universal
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:56.600]   basic income.
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:57.600]   Yeah.
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:58.600]   Right.
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:18:59.600]   Yeah.
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.800]   And anyway, but that would be potentially fodder for.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:04.600]   Every time you're on Amy, I learn about new stuff.
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:07.360]   I never even heard of this.
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:11.560]   Why was just thinking like what, you know, maybe, maybe, but not just because you live
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:12.560]   in the future.
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:13.560]   I, I do.
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:17.200]   I live in the future where we all have Buddha hands.
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:18.200]   Amy Webb.
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:24.040]   Her new book is, is it available pre-order on Amazon?
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.040]   It is.
[01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:27.200]   Everybody please order this book.
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:28.200]   It would be amazing.
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:29.200]   It's, it's a good book.
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:33.720]   It's called the Genesis machine, our quest to rewrite life in the age of synthetic biology.
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:36.200]   I will tell you something that I haven't told anybody yet.
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:40.080]   And that is there are so it's all about the future of synthetic bio.
[01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:42.840]   If you watched Gatica, the movie, you will love this book.
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:43.840]   Love that movie.
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:44.840]   You hated Gatica.
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:45.840]   No.
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:47.200]   If you hated Gatica, you will also love this book.
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:48.200]   Yeah.
[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:51.360]   But the scenarios are written experientially.
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:58.320]   So there's a, there's a scenario that's an FAQ about how to create your future child.
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:59.680]   And there's a restaurant review.
[01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:04.440]   So if anybody reads like Adam Platt or any of those, you know, sort of city, city scale
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:10.920]   restaurant reviews, we wrote a restaurant review set in the year 2037 that explains
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:12.520]   where your food is going to come from.
[01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:15.640]   So just in time for Valentine's Day.
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:18.640]   The Genesis machine.
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:23.440]   My present to everybody is going to be, you don't have to have sex anymore.
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:27.080]   It just create your baby using your own skin, skin cells.
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:28.080]   Nice.
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.080]   Nice.
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:30.800]   No sex needed.
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:31.800]   No sex needed.
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:32.800]   Just skin.
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:34.760]   I'm pre-ordering it right now.
[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:36.280]   I'm telling you, I can't wait to get it.
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:39.960]   And I'm going to have you autograph it next time we can get together in the real, the real
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:40.960]   world.
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:41.960]   Good.
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:43.760]   I've placed my Amazon pre-order.
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:47.680]   So with this Paris, Paris Martenau, who has the cutest apartment.
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:49.280]   I just love your apartment.
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:50.280]   Thank you.
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.280]   Look at that fire.
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:52.280]   I'm in Brooklyn, Brownstone.
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.280]   It's so cute.
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:54.280]   Oh, how fun.
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:55.280]   That's living.
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:56.280]   I know.
[01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:57.280]   That's living.
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:58.280]   I think this is the first time you guys have seen me since I moved.
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:20:59.280]   Yeah.
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.280]   Very fun.
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:01.280]   Very nice.
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:03.800]   Working for the information at Paris Martenau on the Twitter.
[01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:07.920]   Our show today, we got a very modern sponsor to BlockFi.
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:08.920]   BLOCKFI.
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:15.120]   Liso used her BlockFi all over Mexico.
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:19.160]   It's the world's first Bitcoin rewards credit card.
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:24.840]   In fact, when she bought a new car, got some Bitcoin from buying a new car, you can unlearn
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:28.360]   unlimited Bitcoin at every qualifying purchase you make.
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:29.880]   It's a Visa signature card.
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:31.120]   So it's a great credit card.
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:34.840]   In fact, I love Visa signatures because there's no annual fee.
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.280]   There's no foreign transaction fees.
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:37.720]   Great card to travel with.
[01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:38.720]   I love it.
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:41.760]   I love the card with the Bitcoin logo on it.
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:47.320]   You're going to get 1.5% back in Bitcoin on all qualifying purchases with no reward
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:48.320]   limits.
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:54.840]   Basically, you know, Lisa put down her BlockFi and charged her credit card.
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:56.600]   Got some Bitcoin out of it.
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:21:59.680]   Now's the time to start or ramp up your Bitcoin portfolio.
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:01.920]   Of course, Bitcoin is out of terror.
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:06.000]   230% annualized return in the year 2020.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000]   I think if you include 2021, it's even higher than that.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.800]   Best performing asset of the last decade out performing the NASDAQ by 10 times, according
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.080]   to Yahoo Finance.
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:16.320]   But don't think of it that way.
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:19.440]   Just think of it as a cool way to get involved in crypto.
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:21.000]   BlockFi is a leader in crypto.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.920]   It was named to Forbes FinTech 50 list this year.
[01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:27.680]   Plus BlockFi is the easiest place to buy, sell, and earn crypto.
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:30.880]   So you're going to earn Bitcoin, but you've got a BlockFi account.
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:34.160]   So you can trade it in, get some, I don't know, whatever you want.
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:35.160]   Shinei Ibu.
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:38.920]   Dogecoin, whatever you like, or just stick with Bitcoin.
[01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:43.800]   1.5% back in Bitcoin and all qualifying purchases, no reward limits.
[01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:49.360]   And right now, because you're listening, you can get a bonus of $25 in crypto after you
[01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:51.680]   make your first purchase with the credit card.

[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:16.800]   A real Visa signature card means it's kind of the best you can get.

[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:34.760]   and Trust member FDIC.

[01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:48.520]   I feel like maybe I'm living in the future, but I'm going kicking and screaming.
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:50.120]   I don't know.
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:51.120]   Which way would you go?
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.120]   Which way would you go, Paris?
[01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:55.680]   If you go backwards or forwards, would you go back in time or forwards in time?
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:59.640]   Oh, I mean, forwards in time because civil rights, I feel like...
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:00.640]   That's a good point.
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:03.120]   I like having the right to vote.
[01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:05.880]   I like having the ability to marry who I want.
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:09.880]   I feel like things are probably going to get worse, but I guess probably not worse than
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:10.880]   they were.
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:11.880]   Who's to say?
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.280]   We romanticized the past, but...
[01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:15.280]   I have an e-bike now.
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:16.280]   It's good.
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:17.280]   Exactly.
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:18.280]   Life is good.
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:19.280]   Life is fine.
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:20.680]   I might have been a mistake.
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:22.160]   An e-trike.
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.160]   It's a tricycle.
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:24.160]   Why?
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:25.560]   Why do you need a third wheel?
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:26.560]   You don't.
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:29.560]   It was a big mistake, but it's cool.
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:32.760]   I feel like that would be really inconvenient to get in and out of doors.
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:33.760]   It is.
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:34.760]   I have a two-wheeler and I find...
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:35.760]   It's just faster.
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:37.760]   Wait, so this is your second e-bike?
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:38.760]   Is it an e-bike?
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:41.040]   No, no, it's my third or fourth e-bike.
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:46.200]   I also have one of those ones that looks like a motorcycle from the...
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:48.600]   I can't remember the name of the company, but they're really cool.
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:50.600]   That was my first e-bike.
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:51.600]   And then...
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:52.800]   What are you writing now?
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:53.800]   So the...
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:55.800]   I'm embarrassed.
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:25:00.200]   Listen, I did a 30-mile ride today.
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:02.400]   I do really long distance, but I do...
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:03.960]   But you're in good shape.
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:05.400]   You're not an old man.
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:07.880]   I wouldn't say that, but I will tell you a funny story about an e-bike.
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:15.080]   So I ride, usually on the weekends, we do really long cross-state rides.
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:19.480]   I thought I was going at a pretty good clip, and I got smoked by this guy who looked pretty
[01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:20.880]   old, who's on this.
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:21.880]   That's me.
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:23.880]   And it was like the end of a really hard climb.
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:25.640]   And it was like, what the hell?
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:26.640]   I'm...
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:27.640]   Love e-bikes.
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:28.640]   Yeah.
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:29.640]   E-bike, a secret e-bike was on it.
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:32.360]   He was on a secret e-bike.
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:34.880]   That's me, whenever I'm going over the Williamsburg Bridge.
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:35.880]   Aren't they awesome?
[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:38.080]   I'm on a secret e-bike, and it rules.
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:39.280]   You're still pedaling?
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:40.280]   You look like you're pedaling?
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:41.280]   You're still pedaling?
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:44.680]   It's just like, I'm going to go to the doctor's office, and I'm not going to be a sweat monster.
[01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:45.680]   No, no, no.
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:46.680]   I'm going to be a sweat monster.
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:47.680]   I'm going to go to the police.
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:48.680]   Love them.
[01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:49.680]   Better than e-bikes are great.
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:50.680]   I just...
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:51.680]   Even than EVs.
[01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:52.680]   Yeah.
[01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:53.680]   No, no, they're great.
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:58.080]   I'm very competitive, and I got irritated, so I'm pumping as hard as I can.
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.080]   I got an e-bike.
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:00.080]   And I thought I was going to have a heart attack.
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.080]   I can't believe you.
[01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:02.080]   You're living in the future.
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.080]   You need an e-bike.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:04.080]   So...
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:05.080]   I know you got 17 of her.
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:06.080]   I got so many.
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.080]   I should give you one.
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:08.080]   Yeah.
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.080]   So this one...
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:10.080]   We have an e-bike bike.
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:11.080]   You're on an e-bike.
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:12.080]   This one is...
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:13.080]   It's a...
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:14.080]   Ivello compass.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:15.080]   It's a tricycle.
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:16.080]   Oh.
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:17.080]   But I think...
[01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:21.240]   You know, I'm an old man, and I think I'm less likely to get run over if it looks like
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:27.680]   I'm running one of those old man scooters instead of a two-wheeler.
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:29.240]   I just don't want to get run over.
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:30.640]   That's a pretty cool bike.
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:31.640]   I don't know.
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:32.720]   Yeah, it's a really cool bike.
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:37.160]   The thing about a trike, you know, when you're running a two-wheeler, you steal mostly by
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:38.800]   leaning.
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:39.960]   You don't lean into a trike.
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:40.960]   So I felt like the whole time...
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:45.160]   In fact, the first 100 feet I went up in a ditch, because I felt like...
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:46.160]   Wait.
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:48.920]   You were in a ditch on a trike?
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:49.920]   Yes.
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:50.920]   Because...
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:52.840]   Were you up, right?
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:53.840]   I was fine.
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:55.760]   The road was a little bowed.
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:57.520]   So I'm leaning, right?
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:01.000]   And I'm thinking, no, no, I got to lean this way, but I forgot you.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.400]   To steer a trike, you turn the wheel.
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:04.400]   You don't lean.
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:07.800]   So I'm leaning, and I'm leaning, and the bike's still going that way.
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:09.080]   So anyway, I ended up in a ditch.
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:10.080]   But it was okay.
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:11.080]   It was a soft stitch.
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:12.080]   That's fun.
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:13.080]   It was more...
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:14.640]   The only thing hurt was my pride.
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:15.640]   I pulled the thing out.
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:17.240]   I mean, but you have a third wheel.
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:19.440]   So, you know, that can kind of compensate for the pride.
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:20.440]   Yeah.
[01:27:20.440 --> 01:27:22.560]   Are you on a road or you want a trail?
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:23.560]   Well, this is the thing.
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:25.080]   I want to ride to work.
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:27.080]   I want to ride on roads.
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:28.080]   There's a ghost bike.
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:29.080]   You know what those are?
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.760]   Those are the white painted bikes where a bicyclist has been killed on this bridge that I go
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:32.760]   over.
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:34.840]   And every time I go over it, I think that's me.
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:35.840]   So that's...
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:39.640]   I stopped riding because I really love to ride a bicycle, especially an e-bike.
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:40.880]   Because then you just...
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:41.880]   You can commute.
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:42.880]   You can do everything.
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:43.880]   It's just great.
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:45.160]   I will only ride on trails.
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:46.160]   I had too many people.
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:47.160]   You're right.
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:51.160]   I used to be much bolder and I used to do a lot of...
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:53.200]   I used to ride in San Francisco.
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:57.120]   I used to ride all the way out from the avenues to downtown.
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:02.760]   I bike tour a couple at least once a week generally on an e-bike here from Brooklyn to
[01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:03.760]   Manhattan.
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:09.000]   And I only really do that because I've been able to find a path that has good bike infrastructure.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:16.560]   So there's really only like maybe one or two streets where I'm sharing the lane with cars.
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:18.920]   Which I think is the only way...
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:21.040]   Where what magical roads are these?
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:22.040]   Yeah.
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:23.640]   Where can I find those?
[01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:29.720]   There's like a long side where the Wegmans is in Brooklyn.
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:34.480]   If you look, I do a lot of research to make sure that I have bike paths that are offset
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:37.720]   from the road because cars terrify me.
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:38.720]   And I mean...
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:40.840]   It's too bad because I would really love to...
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:45.240]   This is the other bike I have, the Red Power bike, which is just a regular two-wheeler.
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:48.760]   They're relatively inexpensive for e-bikes or expensive.
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:51.560]   I got my e-bike.
[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.160]   It's been about a year now.
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:56.320]   And I would really recommend to anybody thinking about getting an e-bike.
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:59.360]   It's winged bikes, which is a shop-based...
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:02.120]   This is not the first time I've talked about it in this show.
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:06.720]   A shop based in New York, but they sell all over.
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:10.720]   They're really expensive and very cool looking.
[01:29:10.720 --> 01:29:17.200]   They look like a secret e-bike, but they're made of all kind of off-the-shelf different
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:22.000]   parts so you can get them serviced by local shops if anything ever happens.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.280]   They also do offer warranties and it has some affordable.
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.440]   But I really wanted to make...
[01:29:27.440 --> 01:29:30.280]   Yeah, I think I paid 1,500 or something for me.
[01:29:30.280 --> 01:29:31.280]   Yeah, they're still...
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:34.400]   And that was the top-notch Freedom X.
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:37.920]   Mine will go 100 miles before I have to charge it.
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:40.240]   I might be getting my 4V bike.
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:44.120]   Yeah, I love that it has a...
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:45.120]   I would get the fat tire...
[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:50.800]   Head and a tail light built in as well as a little screen built in that will show you
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:53.480]   your remaining mileage, how fast you're going.
[01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:54.480]   That's nice.
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:55.480]   Really good.
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:58.040]   That's why I got the trike because I thought I could have signs on it.
[01:29:58.040 --> 01:30:04.320]   It's 35 pounds bit heavy, but I carry it up my second flight of stairs.
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:07.280]   The thing I like about this is you can remove the battery.
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:12.440]   So I'm currently in a brownstone, but in my last department we had a basement so I could
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:16.160]   just lock my bike up there and then just take the battery out, carry it upstairs to charge
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:17.160]   it.
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:18.160]   You charge it.
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:19.160]   That's nice.
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:20.160]   Yeah.
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:21.160]   Oh, this is nice.
[01:30:21.160 --> 01:30:22.160]   Wingbikes.com.
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:23.160]   I'm your wing man.
[01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:24.160]   Very nice.
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:25.160]   Get it?
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:26.160]   They're really beautiful.
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:28.280]   I've never gotten more compliments on a bike.
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:29.280]   It's a cool looking bike for sure.
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:30.280]   It is.
[01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:31.280]   It's really cool.
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:32.280]   I like it.
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:33.280]   It also got like a...
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:34.280]   You can lock it.
[01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:36.720]   It has an alarm so if anybody touches it, it'll freak out.
[01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:37.720]   You need that in New York.
[01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:38.720]   It's very fun.
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:39.720]   It's got Sentry mode.
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:41.720]   It does have Sentry mode.
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:42.720]   That's left.
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:43.720]   Yeah.
[01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:44.720]   All right.
[01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:45.720]   Well, I live in the country so I'm riding a trike.
[01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:52.560]   So I think your coworkers are obligated to give you a noogie if they see you come into
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:53.720]   the office on a trike.
[01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:55.520]   I don't think I can get it in the door.
[01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:56.520]   That's the only thing I really...
[01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:57.520]   I don't think you come.
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:58.520]   What am I going to do?
[01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:00.440]   I get here and I'm going to leave it out front.
[01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:01.440]   I don't...
[01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:03.680]   I mean, no one's going to steal it, I think.
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:06.680]   Yeah, probably safe in that regard.
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:07.680]   Oops.
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:10.800]   FBI got hacked.
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:11.800]   This is not...
[01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:12.800]   Hate to see it.
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:13.800]   Hate to see it.
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:15.900]   That happened.
[01:31:15.900 --> 01:31:17.640]   This is the article from Brian Krebs.
[01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:21.800]   "Hoke's email blast abused poor coding in FBI website."
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:24.720]   The FBI has a number of email servers.
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:30.360]   This is the so-called LEAP-LEEP server that's used for public emails.
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:34.120]   It's the law enforcement enterprise portal.
[01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:39.280]   The Bureau describes it as a gateway providing law enforcement agencies, intelligence groups,
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:43.200]   and criminal justice entities access to beneficial resources.
[01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:47.480]   In this case, maybe not so beneficial because they...
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:48.480]   It was hacked.
[01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:50.120]   Wasn't that well secured?
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:55.600]   There is, by the way, there are other servers the FBI uses internally for stuff they want
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:56.600]   to keep secure.
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:32:00.640]   So it doesn't excuse it, but this was the public portal.
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:08.600]   This is the...I saw this on Twitter tweet from Spam House, which is a spam monitoring system.
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:13.080]   This is the email that went out from FBI.gov.
[01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:18.720]   Our intelligence monitoring indicates exfiltration of several of your virtualized clusters.
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:25.400]   I love the use, by the way, of buzzwords in this, in a sophisticated chain attack.
[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:30.440]   We tried to black hole the transit nodes used by this advanced persistent threat actor.
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:36.600]   However, there is a huge chance he will modify his attack with fast flux technologies, which
[01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:41.800]   he proxies through multiple global accelerators.
[01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:47.960]   Then the payload on this email, because it isn't a phishing scam.
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:51.920]   It doesn't have any attachments, but this is the payload.
[01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:59.040]   We identified the threat actor to be Vinny Troia, who is actually a real person.
[01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:00.960]   He's a security researcher.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:02.040]   Whom is believed...
[01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:03.360]   Now I have to ask you writers.
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:06.800]   I think this is a misuse of the objective.
[01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:13.240]   Whom is believed to be affiliated with the extortion gang, the dark overlord.
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:17.720]   So maybe there's one little grammatical error that might make you think, suspect this.
[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:21.000]   Actually the name Vinny Troia is what maybe suspected.
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.760]   This is an FBI bulletin warning you about Vinny.
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:27.320]   We highly recommend you to check your systems and IDS monitoring.
[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:35.040]   Beware, this threat actor is currently working under inspection of the NCCIC as we are dependent
[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:37.760]   on some of his intelligence research.
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:41.960]   We cannot interfere physically within four hours, which could be enough time to cause
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:44.200]   severe damage to your infrastructure.
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:45.920]   In other words, he's one of our informants.
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:48.760]   I love that the email ends with Stay Safe.
[01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:49.760]   Stay Safe.
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:52.920]   I think that that is the funniest part.
[01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:54.480]   Stay Safe.
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:59.960]   Stay Safe out there, US Department of Homeland Security, Cyber Threat Detection Analysis,
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:02.360]   Network Analysis Group.
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:06.880]   It's obviously more of a prank than it is anything else.
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:11.720]   I think as far as prank emails go, that's a fine one.
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:14.080]   If I were Vinny, I'd be pretty happy.
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:16.440]   It's like, wow, they take me to the...
[01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:18.400]   Can I ask a question though?
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:25.320]   Why, if normal protocol is to send an email, it's the year 2021.
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:27.320]   Why is the FBI sending...
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:28.320]   Sign it.
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:30.240]   Why is that the process?
[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:32.360]   That makes no sense to me.
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:34.320]   Well, I don't know if it is the process.
[01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:37.200]   It was the process for the guys who hacked the leap portal.
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:39.200]   Well, it went out to people.
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:40.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:45.200]   And people thought it was legitimate enough because of the spoofed URL.
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:47.640]   So I guess my question is...
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:48.640]   How could that happen?
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:52.080]   Is the FBI really communicating regularly by email?
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:53.080]   I think so.
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:54.960]   Do they really say stay safe at the end of your night?
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:55.960]   I bet they do.
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:56.960]   Wow.
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:00.440]   Wasn't that how Hill Street Blues always ended?
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:02.360]   The briefings stay safe out there?
[01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:03.360]   Didn't they say that?
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:04.360]   I think they did.
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:09.120]   So maybe that's law enforcement lingo for stay safe.
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:12.200]   They end every email with just a firm salute.
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:13.200]   Tear.
[01:35:13.200 --> 01:35:21.960]   Do... this is part of the problem actually with email is it is hideously insecure.
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:23.880]   It's easy to spoof any sending address.
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:24.880]   This in this case was not.
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:28.680]   If you looked at the headers, you'd see that it was actually coming from the leap server.
[01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:33.120]   But do you still use key base?
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:34.120]   Amy?
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:35.120]   Yeah.
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:36.120]   Yeah.
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:38.400]   So they got sold to Zoom, but you didn't feel like that in Ping.
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:40.920]   I mean, I'm not doing anything fancy or exciting.
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:41.920]   Right.
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:44.840]   I talked to my super nerdy friends and whatever.
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:46.040]   They say it's okay.
[01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:47.040]   Stay with it, man.
[01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:52.920]   I mean, honestly, if I'm trying to do anything important, I'm doing it in person.
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:57.840]   I, you know, just chit chatting.
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:35:58.840]   But I don't know.
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:35:59.840]   I'm on Discord.
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:00.840]   I'm on key base.
[01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:01.840]   I'm on Signal.
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:02.840]   I'm on Telegram.
[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:04.760]   It's probably proton mail for five seconds.
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:11.840]   Given the NSO group, the famous Israeli hacking group that sells its wares to the
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:15.960]   highest bidder, I think it's prudent to just assume, especially with the kind of people
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:18.680]   you deal with, nothing you're doing is secure.
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:19.680]   Right?
[01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:25.320]   No, I have long time ago made the assumption that nothing that I'm doing is secure.
[01:36:25.320 --> 01:36:29.280]   Everything is gotten like can be gotten, but I'm just not doing anything all that interesting.
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:30.280]   Right.
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:34.400]   And the meetings that I am having where there is sensitive information being shared, I'm
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:38.840]   either in a skiff somewhere in the government office, you know.
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:39.840]   What's a skiff?
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:40.840]   Oh.
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:41.840]   A skiff.
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:44.840]   Let me, let me tell you.
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:47.040]   A skiff is a super modern.
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:48.040]   It's not.
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:50.920]   It's a, it's a really small dark.
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:53.200]   Remember and get smart the cone of silence?
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:54.200]   Yeah.
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:56.200]   It's that, but it's a rectangle.
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:03.160]   So there's like a little blocker area where you leave your, your recording devices behind
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:04.800]   and God knows what might be happening.
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:10.000]   They, you lock it up, but you know, and you go into this room that has like a VCR, totally
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:11.000]   not making this up.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.920]   Like it's a, it's a terribly painted room, shipping wood.
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:20.120]   There's like a cathode raid TV and like a VCR if anybody needs a VCR.
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:22.480]   And you have your, no one needs a VCR.
[01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:23.720]   I've got some old tapes.
[01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:24.720]   I'd like to.
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:30.080]   It stands for sensitive compartmented informational facility.
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:34.080]   I fully thought you were referring to the skiff boat.
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:37.600]   And I was just imagining you on a small boat.
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:41.880]   Steve Gibson always says, if you really want private communications, take off all your
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:46.600]   clothes and go stand out in the middle of a field where nobody can see you and then whisper
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:47.600]   in each other's ear.
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:54.000]   Oh, let's talk about clothing because, so, so MIT, one of the groups within MIT, if
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:00.960]   we're here, which one is working on basically an all body police body cam.
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:07.080]   So like it's fabric that has like multiple, like many, many, many nano sensors on them.
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:11.720]   And it's capable of recording and storing memory in the fabric.
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:17.960]   So you could record the molecular structure, like the, like the molecules outside, the
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:22.360]   temperature, all the, all of that type of, obviously this is being developed for the
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:29.960]   battlefield, but, but it's, but it's clothing that can absorb information and store it for
[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:31.960]   several months without having to recharge it.
[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:33.720]   And it could be washed.
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:38.880]   Which means that theoretically in the future, like the sweater that I'm wearing, you know,
[01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:45.040]   I could recall this, the scent of the Buddhist hand and then the whatever, that day.
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:46.920]   I want this.
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:50.560]   And like put it back on three months from now and remember that fine time when you two
[01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:53.440]   were razzing me about being on a tiny boat.
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:57.680]   As somebody who's nearing his golden years, sailing off into the sunset, I'm always looking
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:04.600]   for technologies I can use in the nursing home to remember my, my more exciting times.
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:05.600]   Yeah.
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:06.600]   Yeah.
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:07.600]   I know.
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:10.000]   So maybe I should get one of these outfits and I could just wear it for the next two years.
[01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:11.000]   You could.
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:16.040]   The other thing is like it means that our memories are potentially more shareable and editable.
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:17.040]   Yeah.
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:23.680]   I remember knives out the movie that made Chris, what's his face is sweater famous, the sweater.
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:26.200]   It was like good, good sweater.
[01:39:26.200 --> 01:39:27.200]   Wait a minute.
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:28.560]   The sweater from knives out.
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:29.560]   I love knives out.
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:30.560]   Oh, oh, come on.
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:31.560]   Oh, come on, Leo.
[01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:32.560]   That was like the whole thing.
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:34.560]   The sweater was the film.
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:36.840]   What the Chris Evans sweater.
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:38.440]   They're the ratty sweater.
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:44.120]   Um, this happens and the ratty sweater is like, I didn't, I apparently missed the entire point
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:45.120]   of the movie.
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:46.880]   I thought it was a murder mystery.
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:54.200]   No, it was Daniel Craig has that accent so that, you know, he talks like he's from New
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:40:02.080]   Orleans in a very broad accent that I don't think any human live as ever actually had.
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:05.600]   But it didn't matter because the star of that movie was the sweater.
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:11.600]   Apparently, according to the New Yorker, absolutely the curious case of Chris Evans sweater.
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:13.760]   But the thing is I've had that sweater.
[01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:14.760]   Okay.
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:23.280]   So, but Leo, Leo, you know, I love you, but I imagine that's what I could go into a store
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:24.280]   or something.
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:29.220]   I could purchase the Chris Evans sweater with, with the memory that Chris Evans might have
[01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:30.760]   created on that day.
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:31.760]   Wouldn't that be awesome?
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:32.760]   That's the way that they smelled.
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:33.760]   Right.
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:34.760]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:35.760]   I can pop.
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:36.760]   I mean, seriously, how blues, I mean, that's crazy.
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:37.760]   You can't do that.
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:38.920]   Um, it's somewhat crazy.
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:39.920]   It's not that crazy.
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:42.320]   I'll see if I can find a link, but, but, but this is already in.
[01:40:42.320 --> 01:40:47.480]   I mean, not for a certain sort of sensors that can, it can't record your feelings.
[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:52.240]   You can record maybe smells, but you could record, you could record the things that cause
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:53.240]   the feelings.
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:55.600]   And for many of us, smell is a trigger.
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:56.600]   That's a big one.
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:57.600]   Right.
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:58.800]   We don't yet have a, we have a ways of recording.
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:01.320]   We don't have yet ways of reproducing it effectively.
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:05.280]   No, but I mean, if you can, we have a projector, right?
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:09.280]   You can take a video of something sticking into a projector and show other people.
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:11.080]   I think this is another way of sensing.
[01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:12.480]   You need a smell projector.
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:13.480]   Well, yeah.
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:18.960]   I mean, it's another way of sensing not tomorrow, but, but this is one of these battle, you
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:25.440]   know, technology developed for the battlefield tends to, at some point, oftentimes make
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:29.320]   its way into the commercial sector, the GPS, right?
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:35.440]   Or the internet, which was originally academic, but for these research, you know, now we've
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:36.560]   got the commercial internet.
[01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:42.200]   So how did I miss the Chris Evans sweater meme?
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:45.200]   I think you were too focused on your own sweater.
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:50.640]   The Irish retailer Blarney Woolen Mills, which has been peddling traditional Celtic knitwear
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:51.720]   say 20, 20, 20.
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:54.280]   I love the idea of peddling sweaters.
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:42:02.640]   That's seen a 150% increase in sales of its $105.00 blast get honeycomb stitch Aaron
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:06.000]   sweater since the film's debut.
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:13.040]   Here, I've got the opposite of the recording sweater.
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:17.600]   I over the last couple of months bought a sweater to forget.
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:24.800]   No, a hoodie from adversarial fashion that is essentially I wear it when I'm out biking
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:30.040]   and it has like a lot of kind of designs and graphics on it that will trick automatic license
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:34.040]   plate readers into injecting junk data into their systems.
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:35.520]   I need that.
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:36.520]   It's very good.
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:37.520]   I'd highly recommend it.
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:38.520]   I need that.
[01:42:38.520 --> 01:42:43.200]   I think we've proven that now there is conclusively a different stream men and women.
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:44.280]   I saw knives out.
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:46.680]   I saw a mystery movie.
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:48.440]   You guys saw you saw a sweater.
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:52.440]   I mean, we saw more than we're just seeing reality.
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:54.960]   I mean, I was out phenomenal film.
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:55.960]   That's right.
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:56.960]   That's right.
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:42:58.600]   That's what it also took the cake.
[01:42:58.600 --> 01:42:59.600]   Great movie.
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:03.240]   It's hard to it was distracting.
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:05.080]   The sweater was distracting.
[01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:08.120]   You know, I've owned sweaters like this my whole life.
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:10.280]   So maybe that's why I didn't notice it.
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:14.920]   In fact, I'm going to start wearing these two work from now on.
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:18.920]   That's your travel fabric.
[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:28.760]   The New Yorker says any really any bulky garment, the tint of Tellegio cheese with with suffice.
[01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:34.200]   Okay, fine.
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:39.200]   Let's move on.
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:41.240]   Interpol has made a big arrest.
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:49.160]   The Reval ransomware really was the ransomware gang was has been a big big problem.
[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:56.200]   Their Sordano kibi ransomware and grand a GAND crab ransomware was being sold as a service.
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:43:57.880]   So affiliates could come.
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:00.120]   They could sign up and they could use it.
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:07.040]   They'd spend they'd share a little bit of their old gotten gains with the Reval gang.
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:19.480]   And and it made it possible for even people with very few skills to become ransomware billionaires.
[01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:20.760]   We got them.
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:28.880]   Not only did we get we got them, not only we did apparently get the guy, at least according
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:35.520]   to American and European officials, the guy who was one of the chief operators of the
[01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:37.280]   Reval gang.
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:42.160]   He had disappeared briefly, shut everything down, then came back and then disappeared
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:46.680]   again after his onion site got hacked.
[01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:55.760]   A Russian national and a Ukrainian national were arrested for attacking these attacks.
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:45:00.200]   And the U.S. Department of Justice announced that they had seized 6.1 million in ransomware
[01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:01.200]   payments.
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:06.440]   The 22 year old was charged on August 11th and now unsealed the indictment with 11 felony
[01:45:06.440 --> 01:45:10.480]   counts, including conspiracy to commit fraud and commit money laundering and intentional
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:12.080]   damage on a protected computer.
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:14.800]   Remember, the big attack was the cassaya attack.
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:20.120]   Cassaya was software widely used by small IT people, MSPs.
[01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:27.160]   And it was the gateway to get into their clients computers and ransomware there.
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:34.440]   Supposedly, this Ukrainian national was the perpetrator of this account.
[01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:39.800]   Another Russian national, 20 years old, charged with 14 similar felony counts is still at
[01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:44.440]   large, still at large.
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:51.760]   And then seven other affiliates have been arrested by your, your appall.
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:58.200]   So I think this is a terrible picture, but here's a picture of the backs of the police
[01:45:58.200 --> 01:45:59.200]   officers.
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:03.240]   Wow, I'm really glad that we have this inside look into what's going on.
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:04.240]   Yeah.
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:06.120]   Looks like one of them's got a purse.
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:09.640]   I don't know what's going on, but one of them's right.
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:11.800]   Very, you know, nice team jackets.
[01:46:11.800 --> 01:46:12.800]   Yeah.
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:14.160]   Team jackets are excellent.
[01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:16.080]   Is this guy kind of trying to run out the window?
[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:19.320]   I don't know what's going on, but it's a terrible picture.
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:21.520]   But that's what we've got.
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:25.440]   I think that the story shows that a 20 something's can accomplish anything.
[01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:26.440]   Anything.
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:27.440]   The world is your oyster.
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:28.440]   They're not resigned.
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:29.440]   They're not quitting.
[01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:32.160]   No, no, they're getting down to work.
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:36.760]   Anyway, I hope this is the end of Reville.
[01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:40.160]   These guys were just devastating the world.
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:43.400]   I mean, they're not the only, of course, they're not the only ransom working out there.
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:49.000]   The fact that they were selling it to subscribers is just kind of reprehensible.
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:56.880]   What happens if like, you think there's a future where there would be zero days that
[01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:00.080]   are just put on the open market for whoever and.
[01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:01.200]   It's kind of what this was.
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:02.960]   Well, okay, it depends what you mean.
[01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:06.760]   I mean, if you want a zero day, NSO groups got some really nice ones.
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:07.760]   Right.
[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:14.640]   I think more like less experienced people trying to sort of make it.
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:16.640]   Yeah, that's what this is.
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:21.880]   So you'd go to this onion site and you would say, yeah, I would like to, can I have some
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:27.320]   sonnet said, you know, Kibi, because I'd like to bring down the Ukrainian National Hospital
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:28.320]   Network.
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:29.320]   Sure.
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:33.120]   And while we want is 10%, you don't have to know anything.
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:35.120]   It's script kitties.
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:39.120]   You can, you can, all you have to know is how to send a fishing email, how to get it in.
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:41.120]   You're the one responsible for getting it in.
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:42.120]   Right.
[01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:43.960]   I wonder if this is like the next.
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:44.960]   Good Lord.
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:45.960]   It's terrible.
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:48.000]   The next things, you know, well, it's funny.
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.880]   I mentioned this before and Lisa and I were watching, you know, there's a lot of movies
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:54.560]   about armored car robberies for some reason.
[01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:55.800]   This is very popular.
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:48:00.080]   Apparently, there's one area in Boston where that's all they do is they rob armored cars
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:03.600]   and I'm watching it and these guys are getting killed and arrested and they're shoot us
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:04.600]   and thinking.
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:06.720]   Nobody robs armored cars anymore.
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:07.720]   That's stupid.
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:09.080]   You could get killed.
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:15.440]   You can make so much more money from the comfort of your own home with very little risk, just
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:17.480]   executing some ransomware attacks.
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:19.760]   The work from home revolution has come to me.
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:20.760]   It's amazing.
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:21.760]   Yes.
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:22.760]   It's amazing.
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:23.760]   You just stupid.
[01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:27.840]   You'd have to be an idiot to try to rob an armored car.
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:28.840]   That's what are you going to get?
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:30.240]   A few million bucks.
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:32.840]   These guys are making hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:35.720]   In fact, this is the first time I've ever seen an arrest.
[01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:38.040]   That's the only reason it's newsworthy.
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:42.080]   These guys rarely get caught because mostly they're in countries with no extradition and
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:43.240]   no law enforcement.
[01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:45.880]   And you know, Putin says, "Go ahead, do it.
[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:46.880]   It's great."
[01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:49.320]   As long as you do it to them, not us.
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:51.520]   So this is the next evolution of the gig economy.
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:53.400]   That's what it is, a gig economy.
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:54.400]   Yeah.
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:55.400]   I'm an affiliate.
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:56.400]   I'm an affiliate.
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:57.400]   Yeah.
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:48:58.400]   Yeah.
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:48:59.400]   Got it.
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:07.600]   So, kind of lost in court, Apple, of course, in the Apple versus Epic battle.
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:14.760]   One almost in every count except the judge, who I think is pretty sharp, Yvonne Gonzalez-Rodgers,
[01:49:14.760 --> 01:49:20.400]   said that Apple has to allow developers to add links and buttons to external payment
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:24.840]   options so that you could, if you're on the Kindle app, for instance, which historically
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:30.400]   you couldn't buy a book on iOS on the Kindle app because Amazon didn't want to give 30%
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:32.800]   to Apple for buying a book.
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:36.640]   So they said, "Look, you can read it in the Kindle, but you've got to go to amazon.com
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:38.320]   to buy the book and come back."
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:40.560]   But they weren't allowed to say that in the app.
[01:49:40.560 --> 01:49:41.880]   Apple's rules prevented that.
[01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:43.800]   They weren't allowed to put a button or anything.
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:48.560]   Now Amazon or whoever else could put a button saying buy a book and it will redirect you
[01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:50.880]   to the Amazon page.
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:50:00.240]   Apple lost in court, but they asked for an injunction saying, "Your Honor, it's going
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:04.880]   to be so hard to do this."
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:08.120]   They said, "Let me see if I can find the Apple."
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:17.360]   "Excuse, we believe," says Apple, "If these changes or if we're forced to implement them,
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:23.000]   it'll upset the platform, it'll harm consumers, it'll harm developers.
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:24.080]   That is a fact.
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:29.040]   It's going to happen, Your Honor."
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:32.000]   Apple's attorney said, "Apple will do nothing unless it's forced to do so.
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:36.120]   Will the judges force them to do so?"
[01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:39.960]   The judge kind of saw through their request.
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:41.840]   You haven't asked for additional time, she said.
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:45.640]   You've asked for an injunction, which would effectively take years.
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:51.160]   You asked for an across-the-board stay, which could take three, four, five years.
[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:57.760]   No, you got to do it and you got to do it by December 9th.
[01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:01.600]   For the first time ever, Apple is going to have to put a link or a link.
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:02.600]   Actually they don't have to do anything.
[01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:03.600]   That's the other.
[01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:04.600]   I run out.
[01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:05.600]   I run Avis.
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:06.600]   This is nothing on Apple.
[01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:07.600]   They just have to allow it.
[01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:13.360]   But Leo, won't you think of the poor big company that is Apple?
[01:51:13.360 --> 01:51:16.800]   What are they going to do if they allow people to put links in their apps?
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:17.800]   Oh, my God.
[01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:19.480]   Think of the children.
[01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:20.480]   This is what happens.
[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:22.000]   Can I offer a different perspective?
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:26.320]   Think of poor Tim Cook's, whatever, nephew.
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:28.440]   Apple, hold on, just one more thing because I got to read this.
[01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:32.200]   This is from Apple attorney Mark Perry.
[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:36.000]   You really got to imagine, I don't know, this is a Saturday Night Live character.
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.240]   Maybe he's the guy with the moist lip and the cigarette, Martin Short.
[01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:43.320]   This will be the first time Apple has ever allowed live.
[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:46.680]   There's still five links in an app for digital content.
[01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:53.000]   It's going to take months to figure out the engineering, economic, business and other
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:54.000]   issues.
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000]   It is exceedingly complicated.
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:00.200]   There have to be guardrails and guidelines to protect.
[01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:03.000]   Trust your own friend.
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:08.400]   To protect developers, to protect consumers, to protect Apple and they have to be written
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:11.880]   that guidelines are going to be explained and enforced and applied.
[01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:13.760]   What's the judge judge said?
[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:14.760]   No.
[01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:18.560]   No, you got to do this and you're going to do it next month.
[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:19.720]   Hallelujah.
[01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:21.800]   The de stay has been declined.
[01:52:21.800 --> 01:52:23.440]   And Apple poor Tim Cook.
[01:52:23.440 --> 01:52:27.120]   Now your take on this Miss Amy Webb.
[01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:28.640]   Well, okay.
[01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:32.760]   So obviously whoever's running PR over there really watched this one.
[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:37.400]   I got to the line about the children and I'm like, all right.
[01:52:37.400 --> 01:52:41.440]   We got to take a step back.
[01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:46.000]   Maybe we've taken this a little too far.
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:51.920]   But from a practical standpoint, if you look at, and I don't mean to dog Microsoft or Windows,
[01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:56.440]   but if you look at the Microsoft, the Windows ecosystem and you look at the whatever Apple's
[01:52:56.440 --> 01:52:58.440]   new operating, what is it?
[01:52:58.440 --> 01:53:01.320]   Just iOS or Mac OS, whatever the hell they're calling it out.
[01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:02.320]   Yeah.
[01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:07.280]   Mac OS and iOS and iPad OS and TVOS and watch OS.
[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:12.880]   So Apple, the system tends to be pretty locked down and not Cluji and not hacked all the
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:14.080]   time.
[01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:17.680]   And I can't say the same thing about Windows.
[01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:19.160]   Can you say the same thing about Android?
[01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:22.000]   Because that would be the direct competition.
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.240]   That's what Tim Cook said.
[01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:27.800]   If you want freedom by an Android phone, he said.
[01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:30.040]   Well, but there is something to be said.
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:33.520]   And I use, you know this.
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:36.360]   I use, I'm agnostic, so I use everything.
[01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:42.640]   And I have the least amount of problems with Apple software out of everything that I use.
[01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:46.360]   And I think part of the reason for that is it's a totally locked down ecosystem now.
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:48.080]   Is it also very unfair?
[01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:49.760]   And is it anti competitive?
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:51.400]   Of course it is.
[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:52.400]   But...
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:55.160]   So there are, I guess you were saying, and there is some merit you shouldn't have mentioned.
[01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:56.160]   Children.
[01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:57.160]   And yeah, whatever like...
[01:53:57.160 --> 01:54:01.440]   So they're saying we want to preserve what is, you know, a rock solid ecosystem without
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:03.320]   adding all of these sides.
[01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:04.320]   Yeah.
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:09.760]   I mean, it's, you know, we all know that there is more to it than just like adding a link,
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:10.760]   right?
[01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:12.520]   There's much more to it than that.
[01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:18.520]   And you know, it'll be interesting to see if they have to change what the payment systems
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:24.760]   look like and if that introduces new bugs or new problems or new, you know, attacks.
[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:25.760]   I guess.
[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:31.120]   I mean, really to me, allowing Amazon to put a button in the Kindle app that says buy a
[01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:38.480]   book that takes you out to Safari and the Amazon store seems to be a pretty straightforward
[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:39.480]   thing.
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:41.040]   In the Kindle app you mean on the phone?
[01:54:41.040 --> 01:54:42.040]   Yeah.
[01:54:42.040 --> 01:54:43.040]   Maybe.
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:44.040]   That's all we're talking about.
[01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:47.960]   Well, I think it's more than that because if something breaks, right, you have somebody
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:52.600]   else's third party system, you know, Apple's ecosystem is very locked down.
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:56.560]   And so now if you've got a payment, we're talking about payment gateways, traffic.
[01:54:56.560 --> 01:55:01.000]   No, because I can right now on Amazon on my Safari and buy something.
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:02.960]   On an iPhone.
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:05.880]   It would just be that more of that.
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:08.040]   I don't, I don't think there's a new payment.
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:09.040]   I don't know.
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:10.360]   I don't think there's a new architecture involved.
[01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:14.920]   Now maybe anyway, that's what Apple Apple agrees with you, but they lost.
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:19.760]   Listen, I know I realize like this whole night, I sound like like an apologist for the corporates
[01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:21.600]   and I certainly don't mean to go.
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:24.800]   No, no, no, no, I, but I do think that we, I mean, you got to, you got to pay for the
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:25.800]   Buddha's hand somehow.
[01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:26.800]   I do.
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:27.800]   I do.
[01:55:27.800 --> 01:55:28.800]   They're very expensive.
[01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:29.800]   I'm very.
[01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:33.040]   Every time you compliment Jeff Bezos or Tim Cook, you just get another one.
[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:34.040]   Yes.
[01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:38.320]   Every time I compliment Jeff Bezos, a new finger forms on my mind.
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:40.200]   And there's a bell ringing somewhere.
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:41.200]   I think that.
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:42.800]   The angel gets its wings.
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:44.920]   And angel gets its smelly wings.
[01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:45.920]   Yes.
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:51.760]   I think we tend to be reductive and everybody, you know, there are, there are some vulnerabilities
[01:55:51.760 --> 01:55:54.480]   in terms of PR that all of these companies have.
[01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:57.600]   And I guess I'm just trying to make the point that I think, I think that there's more nuance
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:55:58.600]   here than that.
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:55:59.600]   All right.
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:00.600]   You're right.
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:10.480]   If you're a pundit though, you know, like somebody like, I'm not working with any of
[01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:11.480]   these.
[01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:12.480]   I'm just trying to get people upset.
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:13.480]   You understand.
[01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:14.480]   It's just link.
[01:56:14.480 --> 01:56:15.480]   We're trying to get clicks.
[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:16.480]   Just trying to get hot takes.
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:17.480]   It's some hot takes.
[01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:18.480]   That's all I'm asking.
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:23.600]   We just want our ad dollars.
[01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:24.600]   Let's take a break.
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:25.600]   Get some ad dollars.
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:26.600]   We will continue on.
[01:56:26.600 --> 01:56:27.600]   Great panel.
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:28.600]   I love Amy Webb and Paris.
[01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:31.160]   I'm back after the ad for more hot takes.
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:32.640]   More hot takes coming up.
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:33.640]   Don't go away.
[01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:38.200]   Actually, before we do a hot take or an ad, let's take a look at some of the things that
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:40.960]   happened this week on Twitch.
[01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:43.640]   What does S E stand for?
[01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:44.640]   Nothing.
[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:45.640]   Nothing.
[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:46.640]   They claim nothing.
[01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:47.640]   Nothing.
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:51.160]   So I'm just off to announce yet another version of Windows.
[01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:52.840]   How is it different from?
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:53.840]   Right.
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:54.840]   It has new, I got this one.
[01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:55.840]   It has a different wallpaper.
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:56.840]   Leo.
[01:56:56.840 --> 01:56:57.840]   Excellent.
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:57:02.160]   A very pretty bloom with many colors.
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:03.160]   Okay.
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:07.200]   Previously on Twitch, this week in Google.
[01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:11.720]   You remember Jeff that I was in vain for a long time against AMP.
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:17.480]   Now I think we're starting to learn where that AMP may not have been the innocent improvement
[01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:21.280]   on web technologies that we were told.
[01:57:21.280 --> 01:57:23.120]   iOS today.
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:28.440]   Coming up on iOS today, Rosemary Orchard and I show you how to use family sharing and
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:31.280]   set up the vices for the family.
[01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:32.280]   Security now.
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:41.480]   Last Tuesday through Thursday was the largest ever three day fall 2021 Pwn to Own.
[01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:50.480]   It's hard to beat an exploit that turns a printer into a jukebox and plays AC/DC.
[01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:53.480]   That's a little.
[01:57:53.480 --> 01:58:00.400]   It is a AC/DC coming out of a printer.
[01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:03.240]   To it, some assembly required.
[01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:06.560]   We eventually missed a bet that really should have played Rick Astley.
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:07.560]   Never going to.
[01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:08.560]   Yeah.
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:09.560]   You're right.
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:13.120]   We figured out finally it's hard to tell from that printer, but it was thunderstruck.
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:15.840]   Is it some every time somebody prints something it plays?
[01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:16.840]   Yes.
[01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:18.320]   Because there's no speaker on that printer.
[01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:25.800]   It's getting the toner printhead to resonate in such a way it sounds like music.
[01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:26.800]   That's a hack.
[01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:27.800]   That is a hack.
[01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:29.640]   That is a hack.
[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:35.000]   I think they got like $100,000 for it because Bonawn is a pretty rich competition.
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:39.760]   Our show today brought to you by Mint Mobile.
[01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:40.760]   I'm a big fan.
[01:58:40.760 --> 01:58:41.960]   I'm a Mint Mobile phone in the other room.
[01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:48.040]   I just mind blowing that I'm getting unlimited talk and text plus data on the nation's largest
[01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:52.120]   5G network for $15 a month.
[01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:57.560]   That is like a quarter of what I'm paying for pretty much the same thing from one of
[01:58:57.560 --> 01:58:59.920]   the big telco providers.
[01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:04.760]   I have to say after years of getting ripped off by big wireless providers with their fine
[01:59:04.760 --> 01:59:08.680]   print contracts, if I've learned anything, it's always, you know, there's a catch.
[01:59:08.680 --> 01:59:09.720]   There's a catch in here somewhere.
[01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:14.800]   So I wouldn't blame you if you heard me say Mint Mobile premium wireless service $15 a
[01:59:14.800 --> 01:59:17.400]   month if you thought, what's the catch?
[01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:20.080]   But you know, I got to say, I've been using it for more than a year now.
[01:59:20.080 --> 01:59:21.680]   There isn't a catch.
[01:59:21.680 --> 01:59:26.520]   Mint Mobile's secret sauce is they're the first company to sell wireless service online only.
[01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:32.200]   They save a lot of money by cutting out the retail stores, a lot of overhead, and that
[01:59:32.200 --> 01:59:35.200]   means they can pass those savings on to you.
[01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:37.840]   And I got to say, there's nothing like Mint Mobile.
[01:59:37.840 --> 01:59:41.160]   If you're looking for extra savings, you get premium wireless.
[01:59:41.160 --> 01:59:43.240]   Starting at $15 a month, that's for four gigs a month.
[01:59:43.240 --> 01:59:46.880]   Most of us, for some of me, that's plenty, but you can buy more than even have an unlimited
[01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:48.760]   data plan for 30 bucks a month.
[01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:52.800]   That's still a third when I'm paying T-Mobile.
[01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:56.760]   And it's even less, smaller fraction when I'm paying for Verizon.
[01:59:56.760 --> 02:00:01.720]   All plans come with unlimited talk, text, high speed data delivered on the nation's largest
[02:00:01.720 --> 02:00:03.840]   5G network.
[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:05.040]   It's T-Mobile.
[02:00:05.040 --> 02:00:09.080]   So if you get good T-Mobile coverage where you are, Mint Mobile will be just the same.
[02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:10.360]   It'll be awesome.
[02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:11.800]   You can bring your phone if you want.
[02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:13.160]   They'll send you a SIM.
[02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:15.080]   They don't charge you for the SIM.
[02:00:15.080 --> 02:00:19.400]   If you want to port your number over, keep the same number, no problem.
[02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:23.160]   And of course, if you're not 100% satisfied, Mint Mobile has you covered a seven day money
[02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:24.720]   back guarantee.
[02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:26.880]   So there's no risk at all.
[02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:29.320]   This is the Ryan Reynolds phone company.
[02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:30.880]   This is the one he owns.
[02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:34.480]   I saw his movie the other night, read notice on Netflix.
[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:37.240]   They managed to get a plug in for Aviator, Jim, his gin company.
[02:00:37.240 --> 02:00:39.760]   I'm just waiting for a Mint Mobile plug.
[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:43.360]   Maybe I missed it, but I didn't see a Mint Mobile plug in the movie.
[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:45.040]   I'll give you the plug right now.
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:46.040]   I use it.
[02:00:46.040 --> 02:00:47.040]   It's great.
[02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:50.600]   In fact, I got an iPhone SE from them for $15.
[02:00:50.600 --> 02:00:53.920]   So for a total of $30 a month, brand new phone, great phone service.
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:55.400]   That's amazing.
[02:00:55.400 --> 02:00:59.200]   To get your new wireless plan starting at $15 a month and get the plan shipped to your
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:02.960]   door for free, mintmobile.com/twit.
[02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:06.920]   MintyFresh, M-I-N-T, mobile.com/twit.
[02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:11.040]   Man, a premium wireless at $15 a month.
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:14.080]   I don't know why you would go with anybody else.
[02:01:14.080 --> 02:01:16.680]   Mintmobile.com/twit.
[02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:20.520]   And we thank them so much for supporting this week.
[02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:23.760]   And tech, thank you for supporting us by using that address that way.
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:25.560]   They know you saw it here.
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:28.240]   Mintmobile.com/twit.
[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:31.440]   How many phones do you have, Leo?
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:32.440]   Oh, my God.
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:33.440]   Too many.
[02:01:33.440 --> 02:01:35.200]   Do they all work?
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:36.200]   Yeah.
[02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:42.280]   So I have a -- and that's why I have accounts with all the carriers because partly I'm monitoring
[02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:43.280]   these carriers.
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:44.600]   But partly -- Okay, wait.
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:45.600]   How many phones, though?
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:46.600]   We talking a dozen?
[02:01:46.600 --> 02:01:47.600]   No, no, no.
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:48.600]   Well, yes.
[02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:49.600]   Six.
[02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:50.600]   But how many are inactive?
[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:51.600]   Yes.
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:52.600]   You want to know.
[02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:53.800]   So I have a Galaxy Flip Phone 3.
[02:01:53.800 --> 02:01:54.800]   That's on Verizon.
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:01:56.600]   I have a Pixel Pro 6.
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:01:58.520]   That's on Google Fi.
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:01:59.960]   I have this iPhone.
[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:01.120]   That's on T-Mobile.
[02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:02.560]   I have the Mint mobile phone.
[02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:03.960]   That's M-I-Fone SE.
[02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:05.720]   That's on Mint mobile.
[02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:09.560]   I feel like I'm leaving something out.
[02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:10.560]   I think there's --
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:11.560]   T-1-18 Verizon phone?
[02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:13.640]   Oh, I do have an AT&T phone.
[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:14.640]   Yes.
[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:17.160]   What's your aggregate time spent on customer service?
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:18.160]   It's got to be what?
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:19.160]   None.
[02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:20.160]   None.
[02:02:20.160 --> 02:02:21.160]   I don't care.
[02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:22.160]   I don't care.
[02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:23.160]   I don't care.
[02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:24.160]   I don't care.
[02:02:24.160 --> 02:02:25.160]   I don't care.
[02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:27.160]   No, I just pay a money.
[02:02:27.160 --> 02:02:28.160]   And I don't question it.
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:31.160]   So do you have more phones than e-bikes or do you have more e-bikes?
[02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:32.160]   Yes.
[02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:33.160]   No, it's roughly equal.
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:34.160]   Why?
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:35.160]   It's my job.
[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:36.440]   So you cover Amazon.
[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:38.440]   I cover tech consumers.
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:39.800]   Having a lot of phones.
[02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:42.120]   Having a lot of phones.
[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:47.160]   I need to have -- I have a Samsung phone, an Apple phone, and a Google phone.
[02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:48.320]   Those are the primary phones.
[02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:50.120]   And I -- because I need to answer questions.
[02:02:50.120 --> 02:02:51.600]   Do they each have different phone numbers?
[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:52.600]   Yeah.
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:53.760]   We need to have an entire segment just on this.
[02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:54.760]   I am fascinated.
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:55.760]   Oh, my gosh.
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:56.760]   Do they each have a different phone number?
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:03:01.000]   Have you ever tried leaving one in each room of a house and then running around on the
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:02.000]   phone with yourself?
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.000]   I don't think they all --
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:04.000]   Are they all on a belt?
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000]   Where are they on your person?
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000]   I mean, you tell a e-pelt.
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:11.000]   And I -- no, I don't.
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.000]   Actually, that's where --
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000]   Do they have different ringtones?
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:15.000]   Yes.
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:16.000]   It's a practical standpoint.
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:19.560]   Oh, first of all, there's all nobody calls me.
[02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:20.560]   So none of them --
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:23.560]   Oh, so that's -- no one tries to get in contact if you use that.
[02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:26.840]   None of them are phones at all.
[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:28.160]   Because I don't make phone calls.
[02:03:28.160 --> 02:03:29.160]   I don't receive phone calls.
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:30.160]   I mean, I could.
[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:31.440]   It's not that I don't have the capability.
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:32.440]   It's just that I don't want to talk to you.
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:33.440]   You definitely do.
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:35.120]   You have the capability to make multiple phone calls.
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:37.880]   I could talk to five different people at the same time.
[02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:38.880]   But I don't.
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:42.680]   And are you -- are you using text messaging?
[02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:43.680]   I do.
[02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:44.680]   Are you on?
[02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:50.640]   So Android Messages allows me to use a desktop and have Android Messages on all the phones.
[02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:55.480]   So that works out for why I was using Hangouts, but Google -- thank you, Google killed that.
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:59.880]   And then Apple's Messages is kind of a problem because I can only use it on Apple devices.
[02:03:59.880 --> 02:04:03.720]   So there's a little -- that's a little tough.
[02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:04.720]   If I could --
[02:04:04.720 --> 02:04:08.800]   I think you are in the perfect situation to build your own kind of sock puppet network.
[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:11.760]   You could really build yourself up.
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:16.040]   You could be one of those, you know, like viral videos where someone walks by with like
[02:04:16.040 --> 02:04:20.280]   a wall of like 25 different phones and they're all liking the same Instagram photo.
[02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:22.400]   I do have a confession.
[02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:28.200]   When Pokemon Go was big, I might have played five different accounts at the same time.
[02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:30.200]   I might have done that.
[02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:34.360]   You're going to get banned from the end.
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:38.240]   Sometimes you're in a battle, you need more help.
[02:04:38.240 --> 02:04:39.240]   You just help yourself.
[02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:40.240]   You got five phones.
[02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:41.240]   That's right.
[02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:42.400]   You just help yourself.
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:44.120]   We could make you chatbots.
[02:04:44.120 --> 02:04:48.680]   And the chatbots could -- could -- could -- you could sort of like outsource the chat
[02:04:48.680 --> 02:04:51.280]   on all the phones and if they get lonely, they could talk to each other.
[02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:53.320]   It was always my goal actually.
[02:04:53.320 --> 02:04:58.680]   Because I do coding for fun as a hobby, not for any real reason.
[02:04:58.680 --> 02:05:03.840]   And it's always been my goal, like my long-term goal to build a chatbot for the IRC that could
[02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:06.800]   -- because I want to exist after my death.
[02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:10.440]   So I think it would be great if I just live on in the chat room.
[02:05:10.440 --> 02:05:11.440]   Right?
[02:05:11.440 --> 02:05:12.440]   And people might not know.
[02:05:12.440 --> 02:05:13.440]   You're going to pick a person?
[02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:14.440]   You're going to pick a person.
[02:05:14.440 --> 02:05:15.440]   You're going to pick a person.
[02:05:15.440 --> 02:05:16.440]   That's your idea of mortality is just posting.
[02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:17.440]   That's the future.
[02:05:17.440 --> 02:05:18.440]   That's the future.
[02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:19.440]   And of all the places.
[02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:20.440]   Oh, Lord.
[02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:21.440]   Oh, Lord.
[02:05:21.440 --> 02:05:27.840]   Hey, have you -- have you used co-pilot on Git?
[02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:29.480]   I have an Adobe.
[02:05:29.480 --> 02:05:30.480]   It's terrible.
[02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:31.480]   Like 30%.
[02:05:31.480 --> 02:05:32.480]   It's like Clippy, right?
[02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:33.480]   Which makes sense.
[02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:34.480]   So it's --
[02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:36.840]   It's 30% of -- yeah.
[02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:40.720]   They know the programmers are a lazy bunch.
[02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:45.320]   And the reason they know this is because like a lot of code, like even a lot of shipping
[02:05:45.320 --> 02:05:49.480]   production code, is just copy and paste it from Stack Exchange.
[02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:50.480]   Somebody Googles.
[02:05:50.480 --> 02:05:54.360]   Googles, googles, googles, googles.com, and googles.com.
[02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:55.720]   They find it on Stack Exchange.
[02:05:55.720 --> 02:05:58.280]   They copy and they paste it and they're done.
[02:05:58.280 --> 02:06:03.160]   And so Microsoft and GitHub thought, well, what if we had an artificial intelligence
[02:06:03.160 --> 02:06:04.820]   technology?
[02:06:04.820 --> 02:06:06.320]   Let's call it Clippy.
[02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:08.120]   We'll call it Clippy for programmers.
[02:06:08.120 --> 02:06:12.940]   They call it your -- this is actually -- tongue-in-cheek, it feels like, but it's not.
[02:06:12.940 --> 02:06:15.760]   Your AI pair programmer.
[02:06:15.760 --> 02:06:21.440]   So what you do is in essence is say, well, I just want to do this.
[02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:24.440]   And then it will find code from GitHub.
[02:06:24.440 --> 02:06:26.160]   See, this is part of my problem with this.
[02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:31.640]   It just kind of looks through GitHub, finds the code, and pastes it in for you.
[02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:33.640]   I think this is a bad idea.
[02:06:33.640 --> 02:06:34.640]   I read it crazy.
[02:06:34.640 --> 02:06:35.640]   It just sticks somewhere.
[02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:39.440]   It was like 30% of all code now on Git was written by CoPilot.
[02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:41.440]   That makes sense.
[02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:43.240]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[02:06:43.240 --> 02:06:46.920]   Probably a lot of it came from Stack Exchange.
[02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:48.000]   So yeah.
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:55.120]   And look, I love programming and I love programmers, but I understand you're under a lot of pressure.
[02:06:55.120 --> 02:06:58.800]   You got to deliver and it's not a great environment.
[02:06:58.800 --> 02:06:59.800]   So I don't know.
[02:06:59.800 --> 02:07:01.640]   I think it's an interesting idea.
[02:07:01.640 --> 02:07:06.640]   I think any serious coder would kind of go, hmm, I don't know if I want to use this.
[02:07:06.640 --> 02:07:10.200]   This is really about people who just got to get the job done.
[02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:12.240]   They're going to do it fast.
[02:07:12.240 --> 02:07:18.720]   I don't think we can move past the point that your idea of a legacy is to continuously be
[02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:19.720]   posting in the Twitch.
[02:07:19.720 --> 02:07:20.720]   I was hoping we moved on.
[02:07:20.720 --> 02:07:25.720]   I was hoping we constantly got a return.
[02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:27.960]   That's so pure.
[02:07:27.960 --> 02:07:31.600]   Wouldn't you like it though if you had something that would just write your articles for you?
[02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:35.640]   No, because then what I do with all my time.
[02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:37.440]   Well, that's a bridge.
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:40.080]   Well, what I do, life is just constant struggle.
[02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:45.080]   I might as well be struggling with this versus gardening.
[02:07:45.080 --> 02:07:51.680]   That's actually, you know, I'm starting to think, am I going to ever retire?
[02:07:51.680 --> 02:07:53.840]   How does this work?
[02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:56.360]   You guys are way too young to even be thinking about that.
[02:07:56.360 --> 02:08:01.200]   I mean, I assume that by the time I get to retirement age, we'll be living in some dystopian
[02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:04.320]   future where no one will ever retire.
[02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:05.320]   But that's probably right.
[02:08:05.320 --> 02:08:06.640]   I mean, that's more of an age.
[02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:07.640]   It's probably correct.
[02:08:07.640 --> 02:08:11.120]   Every time I get a paycheck and I look at them, I'm like, oh, that money going to Social
[02:08:11.120 --> 02:08:15.120]   Security, that's not going to exist by the time I'm a fraternity.
[02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:19.120]   I have to tell you, I'll just give you a little hint as an older person.
[02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:24.080]   If you're planning on retiring on Social Security, you got a problem anyway.
[02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:29.600]   You got a big problem headed right straight at you.
[02:08:29.600 --> 02:08:36.200]   Apple has finally caved, speaking of Apple, on this lawsuit by Apple employees who were
[02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:42.000]   not getting paid for the hours they spent during security checks, which could go on
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:45.000]   for half an hour, 45 minutes.
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:48.680]   The employees, Apple stopped doing this in 2013.
[02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:53.800]   But the employees sued saying the company was violating California law by not paying
[02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:55.520]   them for the time it took to check their bags.
[02:08:55.520 --> 02:08:58.040]   They would search the employees as they left.
[02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:05.720]   Apple has agreed to settle $29.9 million to the employees who were forced to submit to
[02:09:05.720 --> 02:09:08.080]   security checks when they left work after.
[02:09:08.080 --> 02:09:13.000]   I wonder if this security check process is related to, do you remember?
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:20.240]   God, it was like some iconic gocker story where they found an Apple employee had accidentally
[02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:21.400]   left a prototype.
[02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:22.640]   I phone at a bar.
[02:09:22.640 --> 02:09:23.640]   Oh, yeah.
[02:09:23.640 --> 02:09:24.640]   Yeah.
[02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:25.640]   Gizmodo got the phone.
[02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:26.640]   They bought it.
[02:09:26.640 --> 02:09:27.640]   Yeah.
[02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:31.320]   I mean, it was more than they were worried about.
[02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:36.120]   And this is kind of shameful that employees were stealing stuff from the store, so they
[02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:37.920]   were searching them before they left.
[02:09:37.920 --> 02:09:39.880]   But why would it take a half hour?
[02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:40.880]   I don't understand.
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:41.880]   Because there's a line.
[02:09:41.880 --> 02:09:42.880]   A big 30-thatter.
[02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:44.280]   Everybody's clocking out at the same time.
[02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:47.400]   And now you got a guy searching each one of you.
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:55.160]   Each of the 14,683 workers will get $1,286, which is unusual because usually when there's
[02:09:55.160 --> 02:09:59.880]   a class action like this, you get a certificate for a bag of chips or something, you know?
[02:09:59.880 --> 02:10:02.480]   But they're going to actually get some real money, which is good.
[02:10:02.480 --> 02:10:05.320]   I mean, there's some other things happening to buy an iPhone.
[02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:06.320]   Yeah.
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:07.320]   Oh, yeah.
[02:10:07.320 --> 02:10:08.320]   Yeah.
[02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:09.320]   Buy an iPhone.
[02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:10.320]   Yeah.
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:11.320]   Almost.
[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:12.320]   Almost.
[02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:18.080]   Facebook, which set up the oversight board now says, "We can't keep up."
[02:10:18.080 --> 02:10:19.960]   So they want to redo it.
[02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:21.960]   Remember Facebook was used as over--
[02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:23.960]   Are they saying that it needed more oversight?
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:27.120]   They need some oversight in the oversight board.
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:31.080]   I think a lot of us thought the oversight board was just an attempt to evade responsibility.
[02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:33.360]   Well, we're going to hire some well-known famous people.
[02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:35.040]   That is shockingly oh, shocking.
[02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:36.800]   That I would be so cynical.
[02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:41.680]   And a report published this week, Facebook said, "It's struggling to keep up with the
[02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:46.960]   pace of recommendations from the board, and it needs to come up with a better way that
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:51.480]   doesn't entail writing, dueling, multi-page missives."
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:56.960]   Basically, they want the oversight board to stop having so much oversight of what
[02:10:56.960 --> 02:10:57.960]   they do.
[02:10:57.960 --> 02:10:58.960]   Stop telling us what to do.
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:10:59.960]   Stop saying so many things.
[02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:02.040]   Tell us to do less.
[02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:04.240]   We've got to build the metaverse.
[02:11:04.240 --> 02:11:12.400]   So it's not a whole lot of the 69 recommendations the board made in six months, the last six
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:14.920]   months.
[02:11:14.920 --> 02:11:17.960]   Facebook has implemented 12.
[02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:19.280]   Another 23 are in progress.
[02:11:19.280 --> 02:11:21.960]   The company promised we will implement the recommendations.
[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:23.480]   That's the whole point.
[02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:25.440]   Whatever you say, we're going to do it.
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:28.800]   And of course, among other things, they were ruling on the banning of President Trump and
[02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:30.800]   so forth.
[02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:35.000]   I actually stopped doing Facebook stories because-
[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.800]   You were doing Facebook stories?
[02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:39.280]   What were you posting?
[02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:40.280]   No, no, no.
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:43.320]   I mean, just talking about it on the shows because it's like-
[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:44.760]   Oh, stories about Facebook.
[02:11:44.760 --> 02:11:45.760]   And here's another one.
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:46.760]   Yeah.
[02:11:46.760 --> 02:11:47.760]   I mean, they're everywhere.
[02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:48.760]   Yeah.
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:50.240]   Especially the last couple of weeks.
[02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:55.680]   Elon has agreed to sell about $5 billion in Tesla stock.
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:11:56.680]   He had a poll.
[02:11:56.680 --> 02:11:57.680]   He had a vote on Twitter.
[02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:01.160]   Didn't he need to pay taxes or something?
[02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:06.600]   Yeah, it turns out, it turns out, excuse me, Elon, this had been planned for months.
[02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:08.960]   The poll was just theater.
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:09.960]   Okay.
[02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:12.520]   I will never say this again.
[02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:15.400]   We got a hand to Elon Musk on this one.
[02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:18.680]   This one time, putting a Twitter poll out there when you already know you're going to
[02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:21.760]   sell stock is kind of a great tweet.
[02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:22.760]   It's a good poll.
[02:12:22.760 --> 02:12:24.160]   It's also- It's great.
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:27.360]   It also potentially, I think, is an SEC violation.
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:28.360]   Oh, yeah.
[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:29.360]   I mean, everything he does.
[02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:30.360]   Oh, he doesn't care about that.
[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:32.200]   Yeah, he's got plenty of those.
[02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:33.840]   Clearly, he's got those racked up.
[02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:38.800]   I mean, if you're going to go the tweet your way into SEC violations route, this is a pretty
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:41.960]   good tier like, you know, post.
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:47.480]   The tweet November 6th, Elon said, "Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a
[02:12:47.480 --> 02:12:50.000]   means of tax avoidance."
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.800]   So I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock.
[02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:54.040]   Do you support this?
[02:12:54.040 --> 02:12:56.600]   57.9% yes.
[02:12:56.600 --> 02:13:00.200]   He says, "I will abide by the results of this poll whichever way it goes."
[02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:06.840]   Although if it had gone against, he- By the way, why is Elon have his rocket as his Twitter?
[02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:07.840]   It's a little phallic.
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:10.600]   See, I think, yeah, well, I think there's- Maybe there's-
[02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:11.600]   Maybe there's- Maybe there's- Maybe there's-
[02:13:11.600 --> 02:13:12.600]   I think that's why.
[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:13.600]   I think that's why.
[02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:18.520]   I'm controlling Jeff Bezos now for- From literally day one, so part of the story that
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:23.520]   I wrote the other day, I was looking back through Bezos's history, his first ever tweet,
[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:25.480]   Elon was in the replies.
[02:13:25.480 --> 02:13:27.240]   From day one, Elon- Oh, that's interesting.
[02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:28.240]   That's interesting.
[02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:29.240]   What was it?
[02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:30.240]   Do you remember what it was?
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:31.880]   His first ever tweet was- I'm trying to remember the wording.
[02:13:31.880 --> 02:13:37.600]   It was something about a notable, like, it was actually the new shepherd rocket.
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:40.680]   It was some part of it was re-landing.
[02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:45.520]   So it was a video Bezos posted of like, "Oh, wow, our first reusable rocket launch.
[02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:46.920]   So incredible."
[02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:49.520]   And Elon's response was something defective.
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:51.520]   It's not actually the first.
[02:13:51.520 --> 02:13:55.320]   We've been doing something that works as similar, like some SpaceX-
[02:13:55.320 --> 02:13:59.000]   How does you love it when billionaires try to one up each other?
[02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:00.000]   Isn't that cute?
[02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:01.000]   On Twitter.com?
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:02.000]   Love it.
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:03.000]   Thank you.
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:06.280]   Somebody responded to Elon's tweet, "You know what would be really great if the tax
[02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:12.200]   laws in this country required billionaires to pay their fair share and not because of
[02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:14.760]   a Twitter poll.
[02:14:14.760 --> 02:14:18.600]   But in fact, I think he did owe some taxes and so he was going to pay it."
[02:14:18.600 --> 02:14:23.400]   He's moving to Texas, you know, because you don't want to pay those California gains.
[02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:25.880]   Darn taxes, my goodness.
[02:14:25.880 --> 02:14:29.800]   Oh, this is a bad one.
[02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:31.560]   And I don't have much to say about it.
[02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:32.560]   It's not about Elon.
[02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:35.800]   This is actually about you and your processors.
[02:14:35.800 --> 02:14:44.520]   AMD has revealed, this is the register headline, an epic playing on the fact that the AMD processors
[02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:45.520]   called the EPIC.
[02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:48.520]   50 flaws, 23 of them, high severity.
[02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:54.360]   Oh, and Intel has 25 bugs too.
[02:14:54.360 --> 02:14:55.360]   Nasty.
[02:14:55.360 --> 02:14:59.960]   EPIC processors, all three generations, have massive flaws.
[02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:02.920]   Some of them very serious.
[02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:04.840]   So does Intel.
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:11.880]   So if your hardware's got bugs, your software's got bugs, there will be patches.
[02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:14.240]   I can ask a question.
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:20.520]   Is it the case that there's maybe more leaking or more complexity or more transparency?
[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:23.440]   So there's just like many more bugs now than there were before?
[02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:25.440]   That's a good question.
[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:28.040]   On the one hand, you could say it's good that they're saying there's a bug and we're
[02:15:28.040 --> 02:15:29.040]   going to fix it.
[02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:30.040]   Right, right.
[02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:32.440]   Versus like, I wonder if like, yeah.
[02:15:32.440 --> 02:15:34.640]   You don't want them to just shut up about it.
[02:15:34.640 --> 02:15:35.840]   Or not disclose it.
[02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:39.280]   I wonder if that was practiced a long time ago and things have changed now.
[02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:42.160]   I mean, there's a number of very famous bugs.
[02:15:42.160 --> 02:15:47.600]   Intel had a floating point bug that the company attempted to cover up for a long time, but
[02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:50.760]   eventually somebody found it and then they had to fix it.
[02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:56.800]   So yeah, I think you might be right that it might just be there's a culture now of.
[02:15:56.800 --> 02:15:59.240]   Yeah, maybe there were always like 50 bugs, 25 bugs.
[02:15:59.240 --> 02:16:00.760]   I just didn't know.
[02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:01.760]   Right.
[02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:02.760]   You know.
[02:16:02.760 --> 02:16:03.760]   Oh, nasty story.
[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:06.360]   Actually, you know, I'm going to save them and take a quick break and then we'll have
[02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:08.160]   one more nasty story.
[02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:09.160]   Great.
[02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:12.360]   I'm going to end on another bad note.
[02:16:12.360 --> 02:16:13.520]   This is my dystopia.
[02:16:13.520 --> 02:16:15.240]   I get to live in it.
[02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:16.240]   Okay.
[02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:20.520]   You can entice people to make it through the ad read by promising them terrible news.
[02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:21.600]   No, let's okay.
[02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:23.840]   So and then one good story.
[02:16:23.840 --> 02:16:24.840]   Okay.
[02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:27.160]   Can you find one for me quick?
[02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:28.440]   In the bottom of the Internet.
[02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:32.080]   Somewhere at the bottom of the end of the Internet, there's got to be a nice story.
[02:16:32.080 --> 02:16:36.520]   Actually, subscribe to a subreddit called made me smile.
[02:16:36.520 --> 02:16:38.160]   It's a very cute subreddit.
[02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:39.160]   Yeah.
[02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:41.880]   I think there's also one called I bleach that is of a similar vein.
[02:16:41.880 --> 02:16:44.080]   I bleach is that bad or good?
[02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:45.080]   No, no, no.
[02:16:45.080 --> 02:16:49.080]   It's like, instead of, you know, you're bleaching your eyes with goodness.
[02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:51.400]   Oh, it's making you cry.
[02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:52.400]   Okay.
[02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:53.400]   You know, yeah.
[02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:59.480]   And then there's no, no, no, which is another fun one where the worst things possible happen.
[02:16:59.480 --> 02:17:01.200]   I subscribed for a while.
[02:17:01.200 --> 02:17:02.680]   So yes, yes, yes.
[02:17:02.680 --> 02:17:04.000]   We're happy endings.
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:05.920]   No, no, no, we're unhappy endings.
[02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:09.280]   And then somebody realized, well, just the title of the subreddit tells you how it's going
[02:17:09.280 --> 02:17:10.280]   to end.
[02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:12.520]   So somebody made maybe, maybe, maybe.
[02:17:12.520 --> 02:17:15.160]   And you don't know.
[02:17:15.160 --> 02:17:16.480]   It's just chaos.
[02:17:16.480 --> 02:17:19.200]   It's a combination of posts from both.
[02:17:19.200 --> 02:17:23.000]   So you just don't know ahead of time is it's going to end well or poorly.
[02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:26.080]   And so it's a little surprise at the end of every video.
[02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:27.080]   It's so much fun.
[02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:28.440]   Is that what you tried to do for Twit here?
[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:29.440]   Yeah.
[02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:31.160]   Maybe, maybe, maybe we'll have a happy story at the end.
[02:17:31.160 --> 02:17:37.000]   You'll see our show name brought to you by worldwide technology and Intel.
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:38.000]   We love WWT.
[02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:42.680]   In fact, Lisa and I went out to visit them in St. Louis at the end of actually it was
[02:17:42.680 --> 02:17:46.720]   early 2020 right before the virus shut down all travels.
[02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:49.360]   Our last trip before COVID.
[02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:54.600]   And I'm so glad we went out to see the Advanced Technology Center, the ATC.
[02:17:54.600 --> 02:17:59.160]   This is, I can't think of another company that does this a research and testing lab where
[02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:05.360]   they bring in, you have to understand what WWT does is help companies with their technology,
[02:18:05.360 --> 02:18:07.120]   the sell enterprise technology.
[02:18:07.120 --> 02:18:12.760]   So they built this lab so they could go in there and try all the latest stuff, more than
[02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:18.680]   half a billion dollars of equipment from the leading OEMs.
[02:18:18.680 --> 02:18:25.280]   And their engineers internally use the ATC to create proofs of concepts, pilots to understand
[02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:26.420]   technology.
[02:18:26.420 --> 02:18:30.460]   What they've done though, which is really exciting is they started this last summer, they make
[02:18:30.460 --> 02:18:35.440]   the ATC available to anybody who wants access to this.
[02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:42.500]   So it gives you a chance to do on-demand labs about all kinds of enterprise technology,
[02:18:42.500 --> 02:18:44.300]   including solutions from Intel.
[02:18:44.300 --> 02:18:49.600]   Like there are Xeon scalable processors or Intel's Optane Persistent Memory or Optane
[02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:51.360]   SSDs.
[02:18:51.360 --> 02:18:58.060]   But you can do labs in every area of enterprise technology, multi-cloud architecture, security,
[02:18:58.060 --> 02:19:04.260]   networking, primary and secondary storage, data analytics and AI, DevOps.
[02:19:04.260 --> 02:19:08.540]   This is where WWT really is a trusted partner for their customers.
[02:19:08.540 --> 02:19:12.660]   You can go into these labs, test out products and solutions before you go to market.
[02:19:12.660 --> 02:19:16.420]   There's technical articles there, there's expert insights, there's demonstration videos,
[02:19:16.420 --> 02:19:22.880]   there's white papers, those labs, all the tools to help you keep up with the latest technology.
[02:19:22.880 --> 02:19:26.080]   It's a physical lab space in St. Louis, but you don't have to go there.
[02:19:26.080 --> 02:19:27.400]   It's now virtual.
[02:19:27.400 --> 02:19:30.960]   So if you're a member of the ATC platform, by the way, it's free to join.
[02:19:30.960 --> 02:19:36.080]   You can access these resources anywhere in the world, 365 days a year.
[02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:38.760]   WWT is the company you need to know about.
[02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:39.760]   You need to work with.
[02:19:39.760 --> 02:19:44.600]   If you have a business and you use technology, you need a partner like WWT, a partner that
[02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:50.460]   understands business, understands strategy and understands that technology is there only
[02:19:50.460 --> 02:19:55.420]   as a means to achieve your business ends.
[02:19:55.420 --> 02:19:59.820]   So it's not technology for technology's sake, and that's really what you want in a technology

[02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:50.020]   www.wt.com/twit-love-these-guys-love-the-work-they're-doing to really make a big difference
[02:20:50.020 --> 02:20:51.020]   in the world.
[02:20:51.020 --> 02:20:53.600]   Alright, horrific story.
[02:20:53.600 --> 02:20:59.100]   Do not buy the Galaxy Bud Pro from Samsung.
[02:20:59.100 --> 02:21:01.860]   This is a really terrible story.
[02:21:01.860 --> 02:21:06.180]   Chris Weddle writing for Android Central, apparently there's a material, maybe it's
[02:21:06.180 --> 02:21:11.900]   nickel, maybe it's the acrylate they're using, a new form of plastic they're using, but
[02:21:11.900 --> 02:21:16.520]   he got infections from using these buds.
[02:21:16.520 --> 02:21:21.760]   He had to go to the doctor and apparently it's become fairly widespread.
[02:21:21.760 --> 02:21:28.000]   Now not everybody's going to have this problem, but if you read the story, it's kind of a
[02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:29.000]   nightmare.
[02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:30.720]   Even at one point said, "Is this the buds?"
[02:21:30.720 --> 02:21:36.320]   He only used one that year alone got infected.
[02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:39.320]   He's got a picture of how swollen they got so swollen.
[02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:40.320]   No.
[02:21:40.320 --> 02:21:41.320]   No, you don't want to see that.
[02:21:41.320 --> 02:21:42.320]   No, no, no.
[02:21:42.320 --> 02:21:43.320]   No, no.
[02:21:43.320 --> 02:21:44.320]   No, no, no.
[02:21:44.320 --> 02:21:45.320]   No, no, no.
[02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:46.320]   No, no, no, no.
[02:21:46.320 --> 02:21:48.800]   That's not a maybe, maybe.
[02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:50.800]   That's a no, no.
[02:21:50.800 --> 02:21:54.380]   Samsung does say caution if you feel this comfort stop using it.
[02:21:54.380 --> 02:21:56.220]   Yeah, seems like a good idea.
[02:21:56.220 --> 02:21:57.220]   Yeah.
[02:21:57.220 --> 02:22:01.120]   If the earbud makes your ear swell up, you probably don't put it in there.
[02:22:01.120 --> 02:22:07.400]   They're not saying publicly yet that this is a problem, but there is a class action lawsuit.
[02:22:07.400 --> 02:22:08.760]   Maybe just something you should be aware of.
[02:22:08.760 --> 02:22:11.040]   I actually love the Samsung Galaxy Buds.
[02:22:11.040 --> 02:22:12.040]   It's as Christid.
[02:22:12.040 --> 02:22:15.320]   And I used them for years without any problems, so did he.
[02:22:15.320 --> 02:22:16.320]   But he's these new buds.
[02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:18.120]   He said, "Be careful."
[02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:19.960]   They're bads.
[02:22:19.960 --> 02:22:20.960]   They're not good.
[02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:22.400]   They're bads, not buds.
[02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:23.920]   This bud is no fun.
[02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:24.920]   That's not buds.
[02:22:24.920 --> 02:22:25.920]   Yes, yes.
[02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:31.920]   I was trying to think of tech that we stick into our orifices and I get your buds.
[02:22:31.920 --> 02:22:34.400]   I never thought twice about your your buds.
[02:22:34.400 --> 02:22:36.560]   And now all of a sudden I'm like, "It's like you."
[02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:37.560]   Elector toothbrushes?
[02:22:37.560 --> 02:22:38.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:22:38.560 --> 02:22:40.080]   That's probably the only other one.
[02:22:40.080 --> 02:22:44.160]   He says he has always been careful about this.
[02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:48.240]   He's never had ear infections before, but he would always wipe them off before using
[02:22:48.240 --> 02:22:51.080]   them without gall swabs, which I've never done.
[02:22:51.080 --> 02:22:53.120]   Yeah, that's way more than me.
[02:22:53.120 --> 02:22:54.480]   Yeah, I just stick them in.
[02:22:54.480 --> 02:22:55.480]   I think, "Well."
[02:22:55.480 --> 02:23:00.040]   I every once in a while will go and clean my ear pods with a little Q-tip and maybe some
[02:23:00.040 --> 02:23:02.400]   alcohol wipes if I'm being very...
[02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:03.560]   That's once in a while.
[02:23:03.560 --> 02:23:09.320]   I mostly use over the ear headphones because I feel like in ear buds hurt my ears after
[02:23:09.320 --> 02:23:10.320]   a while.
[02:23:10.320 --> 02:23:14.760]   I'm very concerned about sound and noise levels generally.
[02:23:14.760 --> 02:23:15.760]   You should be.
[02:23:15.760 --> 02:23:16.760]   I feel like I'm going to lose my hearing.
[02:23:16.760 --> 02:23:20.080]   I'm constantly worried about, especially living in New York.
[02:23:20.080 --> 02:23:26.840]   I have a little tiny thing of ear plugs that I carry on making teaching and then whenever
[02:23:26.840 --> 02:23:28.440]   I'm in the subway, I pop them in.
[02:23:28.440 --> 02:23:34.580]   I used to mock people who would very theatrically put their fingers in the ears when police
[02:23:34.580 --> 02:23:36.560]   cars or firetrucks went by.
[02:23:36.560 --> 02:23:37.560]   Now I am that guy.
[02:23:37.560 --> 02:23:40.720]   I mean, you only got one pair of them.
[02:23:40.720 --> 02:23:41.800]   I was as a kid.
[02:23:41.800 --> 02:23:45.480]   I used to love sitting next to the speakers at rock concerts because I loved how it just
[02:23:45.480 --> 02:23:46.960]   really grew.
[02:23:46.960 --> 02:23:50.680]   Now I have a continuous ringing and it'll never go well.
[02:23:50.680 --> 02:23:51.680]   Oh, no.
[02:23:51.680 --> 02:23:52.680]   Yeah.
[02:23:52.680 --> 02:23:54.080]   Take care of your ears, kids.
[02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:57.720]   You only get one pair.
[02:23:57.720 --> 02:24:06.480]   The hottest IPO of the year, perhaps of the last few years, what is going on?
[02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:09.000]   Relations at 6.9%.
[02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:13.520]   People think the economy is tanking, but the stock market is red hot.
[02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:16.240]   Rivian went public this week.
[02:24:16.240 --> 02:24:18.560]   80 billion dollar valuation.
[02:24:18.560 --> 02:24:19.800]   Facts by Amazon?
[02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:20.800]   Yep.
[02:24:20.800 --> 02:24:21.800]   Another big winner.
[02:24:21.800 --> 02:24:26.160]   Created by an Amazon CEO for Exac.
[02:24:26.160 --> 02:24:27.840]   Is Rivian a meme stock?
[02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:29.560]   Some people think it is.
[02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:34.400]   They're just buying it because it's a meme.
[02:24:34.400 --> 02:24:35.760]   I don't know what Rivian is.
[02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:36.760]   You guys film in?
[02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:38.280]   Oh, it's the electric truck company.
[02:24:38.280 --> 02:24:39.280]   Oh.
[02:24:39.280 --> 02:24:40.280]   In fact, they're...
[02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:42.280]   Wait, that's the biggest IPO?
[02:24:42.280 --> 02:24:43.280]   Yeah.
[02:24:43.280 --> 02:24:44.880]   Yeah, maybe that's...
[02:24:44.880 --> 02:24:47.760]   I'm very confused.
[02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:50.440]   Maybe that's why people are confused.
[02:24:50.440 --> 02:24:52.120]   It's a pickup truck.
[02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:55.600]   It's not a truck for commercial use, although they're...
[02:24:55.600 --> 02:25:00.040]   Actually, I think they've sold quite a few for commercial use, but it's...
[02:25:00.040 --> 02:25:04.160]   Ford's doing an electric truck too, but Rivian I think is the first to market with...
[02:25:04.160 --> 02:25:13.800]   Amazon has a 20% stake and Rivian has agreed to sell quite a lot of electronic vans.
[02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:17.440]   I believe some commercial vehicles to Amazon for parts.
[02:25:17.440 --> 02:25:18.440]   So is there anything...
[02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:19.440]   So is there anything...
[02:25:19.440 --> 02:25:20.440]   So is there anything...
[02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:21.440]   Does it do...
[02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:22.440]   Is there like interesting tech?
[02:25:22.440 --> 02:25:23.920]   Is it a different type of battery?
[02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:24.920]   Yes.
[02:25:24.920 --> 02:25:25.920]   Like what is...
[02:25:25.920 --> 02:25:26.920]   It has a kitchen.
[02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:27.920]   Are you serious?
[02:25:27.920 --> 02:25:28.920]   Yeah.
[02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:32.920]   Let me see if I can find it.
[02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:36.280]   There comes a certain point in the tech news cycle where I'm just like, "You could say
[02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:37.280]   anything to me."
[02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:39.320]   And I'd be like, "Okay, I mean, probably...
[02:25:39.320 --> 02:25:41.600]   I mean, yeah, all the vans have a kitchen.
[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:42.600]   That makes sense."
[02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:43.600]   Well, the idea is...
[02:25:43.600 --> 02:25:45.200]   I don't know, Leo, I think this is the bad news.
[02:25:45.200 --> 02:25:47.880]   I think this is a dystopian story.
[02:25:47.880 --> 02:25:48.880]   This is...
[02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:52.400]   The idea is you could live in your truck, I guess.
[02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:59.680]   They have a lot of accessories, you know, camper, shells and stuff.
[02:25:59.680 --> 02:26:03.280]   And on the side here, let me see if I can find a picture of it.
[02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:05.920]   On the side of it, you can...
[02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:08.160]   There's a little slide out kitchen.
[02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:12.200]   Let's maybe build a Rivian and maybe we'll be able to...
[02:26:12.200 --> 02:26:16.360]   I've got it up without pushing any buttons to $73,000.
[02:26:16.360 --> 02:26:17.360]   If you Google Rivian Kitchen...
[02:26:17.360 --> 02:26:18.360]   It's like a cartoon.
[02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:19.360]   A video comes up.
[02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:21.680]   Oh, is there a video if I Google Rivian Kitchen?
[02:26:21.680 --> 02:26:22.680]   Rivian Kitchen?
[02:26:22.680 --> 02:26:23.680]   Yeah.
[02:26:23.680 --> 02:26:24.680]   Okay.
[02:26:24.680 --> 02:26:27.520]   I gotta tell you, if my choices are this thing or the stupid looking Cybertruck?
[02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:30.320]   Well, the Cybertruck, apparently, I think Elon's having some trouble.
[02:26:30.320 --> 02:26:31.320]   Cybertruck is never having...
[02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:32.320]   It's never...
[02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:34.120]   We all knew that when it was brought out.
[02:26:34.120 --> 02:26:35.120]   I think it's not even a string legal.
[02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:36.440]   It's not street legal.
[02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:39.200]   So here's the Rivian kitchen.
[02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:41.040]   It slides out of the hole on the side.
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:42.720]   This is a tech truck.
[02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:43.920]   Side of the truck.
[02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:47.080]   It's got an electric, it's got an induction stove because it's an electric truck, so it's
[02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:49.520]   got a big battery.
[02:26:49.520 --> 02:26:52.080]   They have five cans of tomatoes.
[02:26:52.080 --> 02:26:55.840]   I say that's a lot of beans, or like I'm not sure what they're making.
[02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:57.440]   That's like probably too many beans.
[02:26:57.440 --> 02:26:58.440]   Oh, it's so cute.
[02:26:58.440 --> 02:27:00.840]   It's got little holders for all the pots and pans and stuff.
[02:27:00.840 --> 02:27:01.840]   It's like an airplane.
[02:27:01.840 --> 02:27:03.040]   It's got all the plane.
[02:27:03.040 --> 02:27:04.040]   Yeah.
[02:27:04.040 --> 02:27:05.040]   Isn't that great?
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:09.000]   It looks like a butter pad industry's cast iron there, and that's a good...
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.960]   So watch, here's gonna just gonna slide out.
[02:27:11.960 --> 02:27:16.640]   I actually want this truck because of this.
[02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:17.640]   I'm just saying.
[02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:19.040]   I feel like the future of cars...
[02:27:19.040 --> 02:27:20.840]   I think they're trying to tell us something that...
[02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:24.280]   When you put your job in the great resignation, at least you can live in your truck.
[02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:25.280]   I think that's great.
[02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:28.160]   I have to move out of our homes and live in the desert.
[02:27:28.160 --> 02:27:30.320]   I'm living in a truck down by the river.
[02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:31.320]   That's exactly right.
[02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:32.320]   Truck.
[02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:33.320]   Yup.
[02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:34.320]   Truck kitchens.
[02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:35.320]   Yep.
[02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:40.080]   But at least in the back you have room for all five of your electronic bikes.
[02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:41.640]   That's true.
[02:27:41.640 --> 02:27:45.280]   I feel very sorry for the people not watching what we are watching right now.
[02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:49.480]   I don't know how to describe this other than to say this is slightly nicer than my actual
[02:27:49.480 --> 02:27:50.480]   kitchen.
[02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:51.480]   That's exactly.
[02:27:51.480 --> 02:27:52.480]   Look at that, doesn't it?
[02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:54.280]   I mean, that drawer is organized.
[02:27:54.280 --> 02:27:55.280]   There's batch of...
[02:27:55.280 --> 02:27:59.280]   It's one of those drawers that has a little component for every piece of like...
[02:27:59.280 --> 02:28:00.280]   Yeah.
[02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:01.280]   It's got ridges.
[02:28:01.280 --> 02:28:03.280]   But that is good at first, but then you...
[02:28:03.280 --> 02:28:04.280]   That's a classic.
[02:28:04.280 --> 02:28:06.160]   Most of your stuff probably won't fit in there.
[02:28:06.160 --> 02:28:07.160]   I don't know.
[02:28:07.160 --> 02:28:09.520]   Okay, now I have a problem, guys.
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:11.160]   Where do we clean?
[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:13.360]   This is where this whole thing falls apart for me.
[02:28:13.360 --> 02:28:16.640]   There doesn't seem to be a place to clean all of these things, so what do we do when
[02:28:16.640 --> 02:28:17.640]   we're done?
[02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:18.640]   We're just...
[02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:21.640]   We're just like mush it all back in there with all the fat and all the beans.
[02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:22.640]   All the beans.
[02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:23.640]   All the beans.
[02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:24.640]   Right.
[02:28:24.640 --> 02:28:26.640]   Like you're going to use carrots to see what's going to be...
[02:28:26.640 --> 02:28:29.280]   I guess it's outside so you could just have a hose.
[02:28:29.280 --> 02:28:30.280]   Yeah.
[02:28:30.280 --> 02:28:31.280]   You hose it all down.
[02:28:31.280 --> 02:28:32.280]   I don't know.
[02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:36.520]   This is starting to seem a little less cool when you start thinking about the like...
[02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:37.920]   80 logistics.
[02:28:37.920 --> 02:28:39.920]   Billion dollars.
[02:28:39.920 --> 02:28:41.120]   80 billion dollars.
[02:28:41.120 --> 02:28:47.440]   The company netted 12 billion from its stock IPO.
[02:28:47.440 --> 02:28:48.440]   Very, very successful.
[02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:49.600]   Good for them, I guess.
[02:28:49.600 --> 02:28:50.600]   Yeah.
[02:28:50.600 --> 02:28:51.800]   I feel like this is just like people.
[02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:52.800]   It's like...
[02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:56.640]   Aren't people like making new ways to deliver vaccines?
[02:28:56.640 --> 02:28:57.640]   Like new...
[02:28:57.640 --> 02:29:01.640]   Yeah, people are delivering blood using drones.
[02:29:01.640 --> 02:29:03.960]   I thought this was the happy story.
[02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:05.840]   The kitchen truck.
[02:29:05.840 --> 02:29:07.160]   I am not seeing it that way.
[02:29:07.160 --> 02:29:08.640]   This to me is like the ultimate story.
[02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:11.800]   Why does the kitchen truck need 80 billion dollars, Leo?
[02:29:11.800 --> 02:29:13.800]   And especially when you can't clean anything.
[02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:14.800]   Yeah.
[02:29:14.800 --> 02:29:17.080]   There's no sense of the kitchen truck.
[02:29:17.080 --> 02:29:18.080]   Come on.
[02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:21.120]   How about paying Bitcoin to get into the next movie?
[02:29:21.120 --> 02:29:24.920]   The KMC theater is going to start taking Bitcoin payments.
[02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:26.960]   This came out of a tweet.
[02:29:26.960 --> 02:29:29.760]   Also, this was Elon Musk inspired, I believe.
[02:29:29.760 --> 02:29:30.760]   I'm sure.
[02:29:30.760 --> 02:29:31.760]   So no.
[02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:32.760]   Also, Campto.
[02:29:32.760 --> 02:29:37.280]   Corporate strategies now being dictated by some dude tweeting.
[02:29:37.280 --> 02:29:38.280]   That's great.
[02:29:38.280 --> 02:29:39.280]   Yeah, this is silly.
[02:29:39.280 --> 02:29:41.280]   I also love that all these companies are like, "Oh yeah.
[02:29:41.280 --> 02:29:43.480]   Weird Twitter polls are going to be our new corporate strategies."
[02:29:43.480 --> 02:29:45.280]   Like five people are in...
[02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:46.280]   Come on, man.
[02:29:46.280 --> 02:29:48.080]   There's like journalists, Silicon Valley.
[02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:49.080]   Here's an happy...
[02:29:49.080 --> 02:29:51.080]   And Twitter has still not figured out how to monetize.
[02:29:51.080 --> 02:29:52.440]   Here's a happy story.
[02:29:52.440 --> 02:29:53.440]   I found...
[02:29:53.440 --> 02:29:56.000]   Twitter should make kitchen trucks.
[02:29:56.000 --> 02:30:02.400]   The infrastructure bill, which will be signed tomorrow, includes 65 billion dollars for
[02:30:02.400 --> 02:30:04.360]   broadband in this...
[02:30:04.360 --> 02:30:06.040]   This is a happy story.
[02:30:06.040 --> 02:30:07.040]   Good job, Leo.
[02:30:07.040 --> 02:30:08.040]   That's a good one.
[02:30:08.040 --> 02:30:09.040]   You know who's really happy?
[02:30:09.040 --> 02:30:11.560]   Comcast, AT&T, Verizon.
[02:30:11.560 --> 02:30:19.200]   All the ISPs that are never going to make any of the internet speeds remotely better in
[02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:20.200]   any rural area.
[02:30:20.200 --> 02:30:22.200]   But guess where that money's going?
[02:30:22.200 --> 02:30:23.200]   Yeah.
[02:30:23.200 --> 02:30:24.200]   Starlink.
[02:30:24.200 --> 02:30:25.200]   No.
[02:30:25.200 --> 02:30:26.200]   No, I think you're right.
[02:30:26.200 --> 02:30:27.640]   I think Starlink might get something.
[02:30:27.640 --> 02:30:28.640]   One week.
[02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:34.700]   The biggest portion, 42.45 billion for a broadband equity access and deployment program would
[02:30:34.700 --> 02:30:41.040]   give subsidies to ISPs that build in underserved areas.
[02:30:41.040 --> 02:30:42.800]   Now we've seen this happen before.
[02:30:42.800 --> 02:30:44.240]   These companies make big promises.
[02:30:44.240 --> 02:30:45.800]   They say, "Yes, yes.
[02:30:45.800 --> 02:30:47.680]   We're going to build out Arkansas."
[02:30:47.680 --> 02:30:49.520]   They take the money and then nothing.
[02:30:49.520 --> 02:30:53.720]   And they're like, "Well, we wouldn't want to put down new wires ourselves.
[02:30:53.720 --> 02:30:55.120]   That would cost money.
[02:30:55.120 --> 02:30:58.600]   It's not as if we had money to spend all that."
[02:30:58.600 --> 02:30:59.600]   Right.
[02:30:59.600 --> 02:31:01.400]   Our executives are getting a lot of this.
[02:31:01.400 --> 02:31:02.400]   14 point...
[02:31:02.400 --> 02:31:03.400]   What about their children?
[02:31:03.400 --> 02:31:05.960]   How would they children have millions of dollars to inherit?
[02:31:05.960 --> 02:31:08.400]   How would children think of the children?
[02:31:08.400 --> 02:31:09.400]   Think of the children.
[02:31:09.400 --> 02:31:16.320]   Another 14.2 billion does go to a Affordable Connectivity Fund.
[02:31:16.320 --> 02:31:20.480]   It was $50 per people living more than two.
[02:31:20.480 --> 02:31:26.240]   By the way, how poor do you have to be to live 200% under the poverty line?
[02:31:26.240 --> 02:31:30.740]   But for people living 200% of the poverty line, they were getting a $50 subsidy because
[02:31:30.740 --> 02:31:34.080]   kids are going to school now.
[02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:36.480]   This is how you stay up on current events.
[02:31:36.480 --> 02:31:39.880]   Internet is increasingly something everybody needs.
[02:31:39.880 --> 02:31:41.840]   It's a basic need.
[02:31:41.840 --> 02:31:42.840]   So 50...
[02:31:42.840 --> 02:31:45.160]   He has a basic need for adults to be able to find jobs.
[02:31:45.160 --> 02:31:48.400]   So that emergency broadband benefits program is running out.
[02:31:48.400 --> 02:31:50.240]   That $50 is going away.
[02:31:50.240 --> 02:31:54.920]   So now, thanks to the infrastructure bill, we're going to give them $30.
[02:31:54.920 --> 02:32:02.600]   So find the 20 somewhere, even if you're 200% under the poverty line.
[02:32:02.600 --> 02:32:07.520]   $2 billion for broadband grants and loans distributed by the Department of Agriculture.
[02:32:07.520 --> 02:32:10.600]   $2 billion for tribal broadband connectivity.
[02:32:10.600 --> 02:32:13.320]   $1 billion for middle mile network grants.
[02:32:13.320 --> 02:32:21.040]   All I can see is the CEOs of AT&T Verizon and Comcast going, "Excellent, excellent.
[02:32:21.040 --> 02:32:23.120]   $600 million for private activity bonds.
[02:32:23.120 --> 02:32:27.080]   I hope some of this goes to doing what we really do need to do, which is make sure that
[02:32:27.080 --> 02:32:31.120]   Internet access is available and affordable all over the country."
[02:32:31.120 --> 02:32:32.120]   I think that's...
[02:32:32.120 --> 02:32:33.120]   I hope so too.
[02:32:33.120 --> 02:32:36.120]   Internet access that is available and affordable is decent.
[02:32:36.120 --> 02:32:38.320]   I mean, it's really criminal.
[02:32:38.320 --> 02:32:45.280]   The amount, how often ISPs get significant public resources to expand broadband access
[02:32:45.280 --> 02:32:51.520]   and then the service they end up providing is barely enough for someone to use a browser
[02:32:51.520 --> 02:32:54.200]   much less login to a Zoom meeting.
[02:32:54.200 --> 02:32:58.080]   The ISPs need to adopt a new mental model.
[02:32:58.080 --> 02:32:59.600]   This is a...
[02:32:59.600 --> 02:33:05.120]   We do a lot of work in telecommunications and the most frustrating meetings I have by far
[02:33:05.120 --> 02:33:09.440]   are with ISPs who just...
[02:33:09.440 --> 02:33:16.200]   They're currently set up so that they're driven quarter by quarter and that prevents them from
[02:33:16.200 --> 02:33:18.920]   fundamentally altering what they're doing from it.
[02:33:18.920 --> 02:33:23.520]   There are other ways for them to make money besides squeezing consumers.
[02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:30.440]   My concern with this new source of money is that it doesn't incent them to evolve.
[02:33:30.440 --> 02:33:31.440]   It should have.
[02:33:31.440 --> 02:33:33.080]   So, we'll see.
[02:33:33.080 --> 02:33:36.720]   We will let Amy Webb have the final thought because...
[02:33:36.720 --> 02:33:38.240]   Oh my God, please don't do that.
[02:33:38.240 --> 02:33:40.120]   You want to end on a happy note?
[02:33:40.120 --> 02:33:42.600]   I gave up on that a long time ago.
[02:33:42.600 --> 02:33:44.200]   We're in a dystopia.
[02:33:44.200 --> 02:33:45.680]   Happy birthday, Ryan.
[02:33:45.680 --> 02:33:46.680]   Congratulations.
[02:33:46.680 --> 02:33:47.680]   Happy birthday, Ryan!
[02:33:47.680 --> 02:33:53.000]   What does life tell?
[02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:54.520]   I just think you...
[02:33:54.520 --> 02:33:55.680]   Both of you are the greatest.
[02:33:55.680 --> 02:33:58.200]   I'm so glad I could just have some time with you.
[02:33:58.200 --> 02:34:00.560]   Thank you for spending your evening with us.
[02:34:00.560 --> 02:34:05.560]   Paris Martenau is at the information where she covers Amazon, but I think everything
[02:34:05.560 --> 02:34:07.160]   Paris writes is a must read.
[02:34:07.160 --> 02:34:08.160]   It's so great to have you on.
[02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:09.160]   I appreciate it.
[02:34:09.160 --> 02:34:10.160]   Well, I'm going to be here.
[02:34:10.160 --> 02:34:12.040]   Your new place is so cute.
[02:34:12.040 --> 02:34:13.040]   I just love it.
[02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:14.040]   Thank you.
[02:34:14.040 --> 02:34:15.040]   I'm really obsessed with interior design.
[02:34:15.040 --> 02:34:16.040]   It is.
[02:34:16.040 --> 02:34:17.040]   It's been very fun.
[02:34:17.040 --> 02:34:18.040]   Beautiful.
[02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:19.040]   Now, that's...
[02:34:19.040 --> 02:34:20.040]   I have a...
[02:34:20.040 --> 02:34:21.040]   You can't really see...
[02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:26.240]   I have a mirror ball covered mannequin butt, which I think is really important to understanding
[02:34:26.240 --> 02:34:27.240]   my ethos.
[02:34:27.240 --> 02:34:28.240]   Okay.
[02:34:28.240 --> 02:34:29.240]   I liked it until then.
[02:34:29.240 --> 02:34:30.240]   So...
[02:34:30.240 --> 02:34:35.480]   Listen, I think it explains itself clearly.
[02:34:35.480 --> 02:34:36.920]   Did you make it or did you buy it?
[02:34:36.920 --> 02:34:37.920]   I did.
[02:34:37.920 --> 02:34:44.480]   I also a vintage seller that I know was selling a newspaper covered mannequin butt during
[02:34:44.480 --> 02:34:45.680]   the depths of quarantine.
[02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:49.600]   I purchased it, painted it blue, and then covered it in mannequin.
[02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:51.120]   Oh, so it's both?
[02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:52.120]   So it's both.
[02:34:52.120 --> 02:34:53.120]   How did you do that?
[02:34:53.120 --> 02:34:54.800]   There are so many of them.
[02:34:54.800 --> 02:34:55.800]   So many what?
[02:34:55.800 --> 02:34:56.800]   Mannequin butts?
[02:34:56.800 --> 02:34:57.800]   No, no, no.
[02:34:57.800 --> 02:35:02.240]   We're going to get a close up of the manne of the disco.
[02:35:02.240 --> 02:35:04.600]   Oh my God, the butt is naked.
[02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:05.800]   That's a lot of work.
[02:35:05.800 --> 02:35:08.200]   That's disco chaps you made there.
[02:35:08.200 --> 02:35:09.200]   Holy cow.
[02:35:09.200 --> 02:35:12.000]   That's what we all said.
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:15.720]   Now, you are also wearing blue pants.
[02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:16.720]   Is there a connection?
[02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:17.720]   There is.
[02:35:17.720 --> 02:35:18.720]   You're wearing blue.
[02:35:18.720 --> 02:35:19.720]   I think you like blue.
[02:35:19.720 --> 02:35:20.720]   You've got to represent.
[02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:22.800]   There's blue, a lot of blue in that house.
[02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:23.800]   Yeah.
[02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:24.800]   Paris.
[02:35:24.800 --> 02:35:27.400]   And I'm a bug for Paris beyond the blue mannequin butt.
[02:35:27.400 --> 02:35:28.400]   Yes.
[02:35:28.400 --> 02:35:29.400]   Disco globe thing.
[02:35:29.400 --> 02:35:30.400]   Yes.
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:31.720]   Her coverage of Amazon is badass.
[02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:33.920]   It's really, really good.
[02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:37.800]   And I never got to meet you in person and I'm so excited that I got to meet you.
[02:35:37.800 --> 02:35:41.400]   You tell Jessica it's the only reason I give her $400 a year.
[02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:46.240]   I am also a paid criber and it's good stuff.
[02:35:46.240 --> 02:35:47.960]   I actually love the information.
[02:35:47.960 --> 02:35:51.360]   We didn't get to talk about Sam Lesson investing in people instead of companies.
[02:35:51.360 --> 02:35:54.640]   Honestly, it's a very interesting article and a very interesting article.
[02:35:54.640 --> 02:35:58.520]   So maybe next week we'll talk about it.
[02:35:58.520 --> 02:35:59.520]   Thank you, Paris, for being here.
[02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:00.520]   I really appreciate it.
[02:36:00.520 --> 02:36:01.520]   Anything you want to plug?
[02:36:01.520 --> 02:36:03.040]   Do you do a podcast or anything?
[02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:05.240]   No, I mean, follow me on Twitter.
[02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:06.800]   One thing I want to plug.
[02:36:06.800 --> 02:36:07.960]   Buy a printer, everybody.
[02:36:07.960 --> 02:36:10.040]   I bought a printer this summer.
[02:36:10.040 --> 02:36:11.040]   Really a great.
[02:36:11.040 --> 02:36:12.040]   Boy, is that retro?
[02:36:12.040 --> 02:36:12.960]   I've been printing a lot of things.
[02:36:12.960 --> 02:36:14.520]   Why would one want a printer?
[02:36:14.520 --> 02:36:20.560]   Sometimes you just want to like, you're looking over your article before it goes out and you
[02:36:20.560 --> 02:36:23.160]   want to stop staring at your bad screen.
[02:36:23.160 --> 02:36:25.240]   Instead, look at something printed.
[02:36:25.240 --> 02:36:26.240]   It's very nice.
[02:36:26.240 --> 02:36:28.240]   Did you buy some blue pencils too?
[02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:29.960]   I have a blue pen.
[02:36:29.960 --> 02:36:33.400]   I think you bought a subscription to printer cartridges.
[02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:34.200]   Now that you've got a printer.
[02:36:34.200 --> 02:36:37.160]   I basically did buy a subscription to printer cartridges.
[02:36:37.160 --> 02:36:38.160]   That is the portrait.
[02:36:38.160 --> 02:36:39.160]   Welcome.
[02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:40.160]   Welcome to the printer life.
[02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:41.720]   It's very nice.
[02:36:41.720 --> 02:36:44.120]   You should make it play music.
[02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:45.120]   Make your printer play.
[02:36:45.120 --> 02:36:48.080]   Honestly, if I get more text heavy, I will make it play.
[02:36:48.080 --> 02:36:52.040]   I think you need to cover it with Mirror Ball Disco glitter.
[02:36:52.040 --> 02:36:57.000]   I think I would, but the one bad thing when you cover something in Mirror Ball little
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:01.240]   things is you will be finding them around your house for the rest of time.
[02:37:01.240 --> 02:37:02.240]   It's like litter.
[02:37:02.240 --> 02:37:03.240]   It never goes away.
[02:37:03.240 --> 02:37:04.240]   Yeah.
[02:37:04.240 --> 02:37:05.240]   They're everywhere.
[02:37:05.240 --> 02:37:06.240]   Sometimes I'll find one of my cat.
[02:37:06.240 --> 02:37:07.400]   I'm like, "How?"
[02:37:07.400 --> 02:37:12.840]   I think a Mirror Ball covered cat might be interesting too.
[02:37:12.840 --> 02:37:13.840]   That's true.
[02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:15.640]   Amy Webb, you're the best.
[02:37:15.640 --> 02:37:17.560]   Congratulations on finishing the book.
[02:37:17.560 --> 02:37:19.320]   I can't wait to get my copy.
[02:37:19.320 --> 02:37:22.000]   I've already pre-ordered it.
[02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:25.080]   Everybody should do the same.
[02:37:25.080 --> 02:37:31.960]   This is all about the biotech revolution that is imminent, that is about to bite us in the
[02:37:31.960 --> 02:37:33.120]   butt.
[02:37:33.120 --> 02:37:40.400]   The Genesis machine are questioned to rewrite life in the age of synthetic biology, just
[02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:43.000]   in time for Valentine's Day.
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:48.200]   It can actually, you can grow your own new butt.
[02:37:48.200 --> 02:37:51.680]   And then if you're really into that kind of thing, you could bite it and eat it.
[02:37:51.680 --> 02:37:57.880]   I think I might need a new butt because I am suffering from male pattern ass loss.
[02:37:57.880 --> 02:37:59.920]   So oh my God.
[02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:03.600]   I just found some glitter from your mannequin butt.
[02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:06.080]   What am I going to do?
[02:38:06.080 --> 02:38:09.600]   It's not only spreading, it's here too.
[02:38:09.600 --> 02:38:10.600]   I don't...
[02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:12.840]   It truly is everywhere.
[02:38:12.840 --> 02:38:14.000]   It's everywhere.
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000]   I found it in...
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000]   I went to Portugal briefly.
[02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:21.040]   I somehow ended up in the hotel room of Portugal.
[02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:24.400]   He will follow me to the end of time.
[02:38:24.400 --> 02:38:25.400]   Oh my God.
[02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:27.680]   Amy, good luck.
[02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:28.680]   What are you going to do next?
[02:38:28.680 --> 02:38:29.960]   Where are you going next?
[02:38:29.960 --> 02:38:31.600]   Your life, you're such a jet setter.
[02:38:31.600 --> 02:38:33.440]   What am I doing next?
[02:38:33.440 --> 02:38:34.600]   I'm going to eat dinner.
[02:38:34.600 --> 02:38:36.400]   My husband made chicken tikka masala.
[02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:37.920]   Oh, I love it.
[02:38:37.920 --> 02:38:38.920]   That's my plan.
[02:38:38.920 --> 02:38:39.920]   I don't know.
[02:38:39.920 --> 02:38:40.920]   I'm...
[02:38:40.920 --> 02:38:42.680]   My class at NYU has started back up.
[02:38:42.680 --> 02:38:43.680]   Oh, exciting.
[02:38:43.680 --> 02:38:47.000]   I'm at Stern and it's in person for the first time in, I guess, two years.
[02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:48.000]   Really exciting.
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:50.240]   So I'm there with my team every week.
[02:38:50.240 --> 02:38:51.240]   I don't know.
[02:38:51.240 --> 02:38:53.160]   I'm getting ready for South by Southwest.
[02:38:53.160 --> 02:38:55.080]   It's going to be in person and it's going to be...
[02:38:55.080 --> 02:38:56.080]   Oh, that's huge.
[02:38:56.080 --> 02:38:57.080]   It's going to be awesome.
[02:38:57.080 --> 02:39:01.600]   It's the 15th anniversary of our TechTrend report so we're going to do something kind
[02:39:01.600 --> 02:39:03.720]   of amazing while we're there.
[02:39:03.720 --> 02:39:05.400]   But it's going to be in person.
[02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:06.560]   It'll be great.
[02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:07.560]   March 2022.
[02:39:07.560 --> 02:39:08.560]   March 2022.
[02:39:08.560 --> 02:39:09.560]   Yep.
[02:39:09.560 --> 02:39:10.560]   Western Texas.
[02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:12.720]   We'll see you there.
[02:39:12.720 --> 02:39:13.720]   You know what?
[02:39:13.720 --> 02:39:15.040]   I would love to go to...
[02:39:15.040 --> 02:39:16.040]   I love South by...
[02:39:16.040 --> 02:39:17.040]   It's going to be good.
[02:39:17.040 --> 02:39:18.040]   They're doing...
[02:39:18.040 --> 02:39:19.040]   They're doing...
[02:39:19.040 --> 02:39:21.360]   We're doing weather at a pretty horrific storm.
[02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:23.680]   They must have suffered badly less.
[02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:24.680]   They really have.
[02:39:24.680 --> 02:39:25.680]   And they're just...
[02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:26.680]   It's a...
[02:39:26.680 --> 02:39:31.120]   The community is everything and I've been a part of it for, I guess, almost 20 years.
[02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:36.640]   There's a picture of me crowd surfing at the Stubbs BBQ.
[02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:41.320]   So that's one of the things I did at South by.
[02:39:41.320 --> 02:39:42.320]   Amy Webb...
[02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:44.440]   You speak by Sayhaida Elon.
[02:39:44.440 --> 02:39:45.760]   Will he be there?
[02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:46.760]   I hope not.
[02:39:46.760 --> 02:39:47.760]   Elon's everywhere.
[02:39:47.760 --> 02:39:49.640]   He's in our hearts.
[02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:53.040]   He's in our mannequin butts.
[02:39:53.040 --> 02:39:54.440]   It's true.
[02:39:54.440 --> 02:39:57.440]   You got Elon in my mannequin but...
[02:39:57.440 --> 02:39:59.800]   Thank you, Amy.
[02:39:59.800 --> 02:40:00.800]   Thank you, Paris.
[02:40:00.800 --> 02:40:02.320]   Thank you, all of you, for being here.
[02:40:02.320 --> 02:40:06.000]   I think you're probably pretty glad you listened to the show this week.
[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:07.840]   I know Ryan is.
[02:40:07.840 --> 02:40:12.880]   If you want to watch us do it live, we do this week at Tech every Sunday afternoon.
[02:40:12.880 --> 02:40:14.680]   230 Pacific.
[02:40:14.680 --> 02:40:18.920]   It's 530 Eastern Time 2030 UTC.
[02:40:18.920 --> 02:40:22.160]   If you want to watch live, there's a stream at live.twit.tv.
[02:40:22.160 --> 02:40:23.880]   There's also a live audio stream.
[02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:28.240]   People will watch live chat live in a couple of places where there's always the IRC where
[02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:34.080]   my bot will live forever at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:40:34.080 --> 02:40:40.440]   We also have a Discord channel which is available to all in Sundry as a member of Club Twit.
[02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:46.240]   $11 a month gets you ad free versions of all the shows which shortens their length considerably.
[02:40:46.240 --> 02:40:52.080]   You also get access to our fabulous Discord which to me is the future of social because
[02:40:52.080 --> 02:40:56.280]   everybody in here is great and they're talking all the time about all sorts of interesting
[02:40:56.280 --> 02:40:57.280]   stuff.
[02:40:57.280 --> 02:41:01.560]   You also get the Twit Plus feed which has stuff that we don't put out as podcasts, stuff
[02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:03.880]   that didn't like the conversation about.
[02:41:03.880 --> 02:41:07.240]   The boot is had at the beginning of the show before the show started.
[02:41:07.240 --> 02:41:11.240]   Not going to be in the podcast, probably will be in our Twit Plus feed.
[02:41:11.240 --> 02:41:12.240]   Go to Club Twit.
[02:41:12.240 --> 02:41:14.360]   That's content you've got to pay for.
[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:15.360]   That's not free.
[02:41:15.360 --> 02:41:16.360]   That's not free.
[02:41:16.360 --> 02:41:18.560]   I mean you've got to put that behind the paywall.
[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:20.440]   Yeah, no that's paywall baby.
[02:41:20.440 --> 02:41:21.440]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:26.800]   Find out more at Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:29.640]   On demand versions of the show are also available for free at our website.
[02:41:29.640 --> 02:41:31.880]   All our shows are Twit.tv.
[02:41:31.880 --> 02:41:35.880]   There's a YouTube channel for every show including this week in tech and of course the easiest
[02:41:35.880 --> 02:41:39.520]   way to get any shows to subscribe in your favorite podcast player.
[02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:41.040]   If you do that you'll get it automatically.
[02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:43.880]   As soon as it's available we push it out to you.
[02:41:43.880 --> 02:41:47.960]   And if your podcast client allows reviews do me a favor.
[02:41:47.960 --> 02:41:52.080]   Tell the world we've been around since 2005 but there's still have to be one or two people
[02:41:52.080 --> 02:41:53.840]   that's never heard of Twit.
[02:41:53.840 --> 02:41:55.920]   Five-star review would make a big difference there.
[02:41:55.920 --> 02:41:57.480]   Thank you in advance.
[02:41:57.480 --> 02:41:58.480]   I'm Leo Laport.
[02:41:58.480 --> 02:41:59.480]   We'll see you next time.
[02:41:59.480 --> 02:42:05.680]   Another Twit is in the can or the glitter covered mannequin but as it were.
[02:42:05.680 --> 02:42:08.080]   Another Twit is in the mannequin.
[02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:20.680]   Another Twit is in the mannequin but.
