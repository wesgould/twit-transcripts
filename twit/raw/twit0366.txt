[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.440]   And boy, I think this is just a stellar panel.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.160]   I am very excited about the show today.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.840]   Starting on my far right here with Mr. John C.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.400]   Devorect, of work.com/blog channel.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.120]   Devorect, I'm going to see you again, John.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.080]   Knowajendashow.com?
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.720]   Is that what you meant?
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.840]   Knowajendashow.com.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.200]   Who had the over under at 20 seconds?
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.320]   That's Brian Brushwood from Schwood.com, Scam School, Brian.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.240]   He's also the--
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.720]   not the biological father, the spiritual father
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.720]   of the Diamond Club.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.400]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.760]   Are you talking about the top 10 best-selling book on iTunes?
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.720]   Unbelievable.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.720]   Wow.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.720]   Two weeks and running.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.200]   You beat my 20 seconds, by the way.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.800]   And I'm very pleased to say one of the original Twits
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.560]   from Google Ventures, Mr. Kevin Rose.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.040]   Hello.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.880]   Thank you for having me.
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.480]   How are you?
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.400]   How's it going?
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.200]   So since we saw you last, you got engaged.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.640]   And your beautiful fiance is sitting right there.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.000]   Hanging out.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.680]   That's great.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.560]   Congratulations.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.400]   You did it in Japan.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.040]   It was beautiful.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.400]   Yeah, cherry blossom festival.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.880]   It was awesome.
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.840]   So gorgeous.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.280]   You're going to have to forgive me,
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.960]   because I know stuff about you from Path
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.600]   that I'm not sure whether I should say or not.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.160]   From Path?
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.920]   Definitely that one thing earlier, probably not.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.880]   That was the only one?
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.800]   I mean, what else is there?
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.800]   I'm not the best.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.720]   I only engaged with other things on Path.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.960]   The fact that the engagement was only on Path.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.640]   No, no, no.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.960]   You know, this is a problem with Path, because I love Path.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.560]   But you forget that it's kind of private.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.120]   It's just your close friends and that everything you see
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.760]   is not public.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:29.160]   Right.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.240]   And so I apologize for what you do.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.680]   You busted him on what?
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.520]   I mentioned the fact that he bought a submarine.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.440]   It's not a big deal.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.400]   You bought a submarine?
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.440]   Very small, not a big deal.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.240]   The yellow submarines.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.440]   And since we saw you last dig kind of got dissolved and went--
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.560]   Well, engineers went--
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.760]   Pulled a Phoenix, right?
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:50.640]   Rise of the ashes.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.520]   Yeah, that's what's interesting.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.960]   So the engineering staff went to the Washington Post.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.320]   Right.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.560]   The patents went to LinkedIn.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.080]   LinkedIn, that was kind of the surprise.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.040]   We didn't realize that LinkedIn bought the patents.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.640]   And then for--
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.000]   Now, by the way, those were more significant.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.840]   I think LinkedIn's paid over a million bucks for the patents.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.080]   LinkedIn paid three and a half million, something like that.
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.560]   But what got all the attention was half a million dollars
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.000]   or something like that from beta news.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.040]   Yeah, how mad were you with all the crappy coverage
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.960]   that's saying like sold for a half for $500,000.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.560]   You probably have that in your couch right now.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.200]   They even buy.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.440]   They bought their name.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.200]   Yeah, they bought the name of the traffic.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.600]   So dig still had around 15 million monthly unique visitors.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.640]   They wanted to--
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.920]   They had to be worth more than--
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.480]   Yeah, with things.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.400]   This is a funny thing.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.200]   We had offers for a little--
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.600]   right around a million and a half to sell the product off.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.840]   But the investors were really cool.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.440]   They wanted essentially the product
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.840]   to go to someone that would take care of it
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.120]   and do right by the name.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.280]   And so there was an option to sell it off to someone
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.920]   that essentially was going to turn it into a link farm.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.120]   And they were like, now we'd rather make sure it lands
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.080]   has a good soft landing.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.320]   So John at Betawork stepped up and said, we have Bitly.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.680]   We have a chart beat.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.760]   We build cool products.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.960]   Does it sound like a good match?
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.920]   And we were all for it.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.040]   Yeah, I love Bitly.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.200]   I love chart work chart beat.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.800]   We use that.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.400]   If you think of anyone that understands
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.440]   like the real time web and the nature of being
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.760]   able to detect trends as early as possible,
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.960]   it's those guys.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.040]   Now they said they rewrote the code from scratch.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.880]   Yeah, from scratch.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.080]   And it's a very different looking site.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.000]   But it's much more modern.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.200]   It kind of looks like Pinterest or the Verge or--
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.400]   Yeah, I like the design.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.280]   This is the new look.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.240]   This is how everybody looks nowadays.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.360]   They're kind of a magazine form.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.440]   But same idea, right?
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.560]   In fact, I still have my account.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.320]   You can see I'm still Leo Leport on dig.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.440]   Yeah, there's a lot of stuff they have to add back.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.560]   There's none of your history there.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.440]   If you go down the bottom, you can see more trending articles.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.520]   You can see the little graphs there.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.600]   I love the graphs.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.400]   That's nice.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.600]   Yeah, it's going to be pretty cool.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.920]   So you're happy with what they did with it?
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.560]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.760]   I mean, these guys, they basically
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.400]   came in with nothing and said, we're going to completely
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.200]   rebuild this in six weeks.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.720]   They went for it, and this is what they launched, which
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.840]   is a great kind of V1 of the product.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.040]   It's actually pretty impressive.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.520]   I'm glad they got rid of a lot of the stuff.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.520]   They killed a lot of the features and stripped it down
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.040]   to its--
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.080]   I should have sworn my dig for was my idea shirt.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.440]   I think I'll have to.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.440]   That's right.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.360]   That's a good shirt.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.920]   What kill dig now that you're well away from?
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.560]   Now you're going to go and--
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.080]   Now you're going to go and--
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.880]   Now you're going to go and--
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.680]   Yeah, just see what you're doing.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.200]   Just see what you're doing.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.120]   And here we are doing a new--
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.360]   I feel like I should take a look for Kevin.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.720]   No, it's all good.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:11.720]   It's all good.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.920]   That's a reason to jump out.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:19.920]   It's just criticized him.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.920]   You talk about it.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.920]   You talk about it.
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.920]   You talk about it.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.920]   You talk about it.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.920]   You talk about it.
[00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.920]   You talk about it.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.920]   You talk about it.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.920]   You talk about it.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.920]   You talk about it.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.920]   When I was on the board, when I was still involved,
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.920]   when I was trying to sell the company, it was difficult.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.920]   But I think that if you look-- in hindsight, when I look back
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.920]   on dig, I feel that there was-- even when we had dig V3,
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.920]   before we even launched dig V4, we started to see a slow decline
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.920]   in traffic.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.920]   We knew that things were starting to go down.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.920]   I mean, Twitter was breaking news stories faster than anyone
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.920]   else.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.920]   If you remember on Facebook, a lot of the stuff that was being
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.920]   shared initially was kind of like relationship status and photos
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.920]   and things of that nature.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.920]   And all of a sudden news stories started being propagated
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.920]   throughout Facebook.
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.920]   And these other social sites just came up around us
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.920]   and started eating a lot of our traffic.
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.920]   And so I think that dig V4 was a reaction to a lot of that.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.920]   Like, how can we get things back on track?
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.920]   And the thing that's difficult is when you have a company that's
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:11.920]   50, 75 employees and you're focused so much on month over month
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.920]   growth, it's really hard to not try new, crazy, big things to
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.920]   keep up with that burn that you have going on.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.920]   I mean, you have a huge staff of people that are pulling decent
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.920]   salaries.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.920]   I think our monthly burn at one point was $700,000, $800,000
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.920]   a month when you have that many people on board.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.920]   Dig was built on a bunch of our own actually purchased servers.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.920]   We were created before Amazon S3 and all these other services.
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.920]   I never ever saw it.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.920]   I was so excited when you bought that rag.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.920]   There was a lot of hardware costs that went into hosting dig.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.920]   I mean, we had 500 plus servers.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:44.920]   It's all coloads.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.920]   All coloads.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.920]   And with that goes with a lot of high-end network administrators.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.920]   I mean, there's a lot of costs involved there.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.920]   So for us, you know, I think that we should have kept it extremely
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.920]   small.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.920]   Looking back, we should have kept it 10 people max.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.920]   It would have been a very profitable, awesome little site at 10 people.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.920]   And we would have been a little bit slower when it came to new features,
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:06.920]   but I think that would have been OK.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.920]   I mean, if you take a look at what Reddit and some of these other
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.920]   sites have done, they've kept it extremely small from a burn
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.920]   standpoint and they've been able to keep true to who they are.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.920]   And I think that's the first time we got in a lot of troubles when we
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.920]   decided to not build features for our core audience, but instead build
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.920]   them for what we thought was going to bring in a different audience
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.920]   and more traffic.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.920]   This is why you're valuable, Google Ventures now, because having had
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.920]   this experience, you can talk to startup founders and say, hey,
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:33.920]   dude, slow down.
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:36.920]   I definitely try to have them avoid a lot of the mistakes.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.920]   And you have some credibility because you've been there.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.920]   And so you're not just saying this like some abstract academic thing.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:43.920]   This is something you know about.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:44.920]   Yeah, no doubt.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.920]   What a journey though.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.920]   Like I remember hearing about, did you explain to me what you were up to a dig?
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:49.920]   I don't know if you even remember this.
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.920]   The first time we met was when David Prager brought me out to teach you how to
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.920]   blow fire or a scree- I guess that's right.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.920]   I don't know if it was a tack of a lower screeching.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:58.920]   So now, yeah.
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.920]   And then we got out there and the folks at G4 were all like, I don't see the
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:03.920]   tack angle and they canceled it.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.920]   Right.
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.920]   So I did two segments for Unscrewed instead.
[00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:11.920]   Man, but that's, it has been amazing to watch the transformation the entire,
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.920]   and a privilege to take part in, you know, my small bit with revision three
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.920]   and kind of watching everything go through.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.920]   It's just a special.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:19.920]   It's crazy.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.920]   I mean, it's, can you believe it's been that long?
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.920]   Like I think we've known each other for over five years now, six.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:24.920]   Yeah, no, no, no.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.920]   I think, I want to say it was like 2005 maybe.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:28.920]   I mean, it was pretty early.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.720]   So then, so you started milk and I have to say everybody.
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.920]   I was very surprised when I heard that you had sold milk, Daniel, you,
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.920]   Daniel, a bunch of people from milk went to Google.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.920]   Because I thought, well, this is, I thought he wanted to be an entrepreneur.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.920]   Yeah.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.920]   I mean, we launched our first app, Oink, and it had some decent traction.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:47.920]   I like doing a lot.
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.920]   We won a bunch of Apple design awards.
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.920]   We had about 275,000 users download it.
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.400]   But Google came in and gave us an offer that we couldn't say no to.
[00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.280]   I mean, we all made money.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.280]   The investors all made money.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.320]   But for me personally, was this something, did you have to say, hmm, is this what I want
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.320]   to do?
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.760]   Well, here's the, Oink was at a point where we were getting ready to launch our second
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.800]   version of it.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.840]   We were happy with the traction, but we weren't blown away by it.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.840]   It wasn't like dig type.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.840]   It wasn't viral.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.840]   Crazy viral growth.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.840]   And so, you know, am I going to sit there and beat on Oink for the next four or five years?
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.240]   Would you say that from the day one at milk, we will fail fast and we'll move quickly.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.160]   And we would shut down and go on to the next thing.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.320]   And we had a couple of ideas of things that we wanted to build, but really nothing that
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.160]   I was overly excited about.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.800]   There was nothing where I was like, wow, this is going to be the next big thing that I wanted.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.200]   So what did Google say that turned your ear?
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:40.240]   Well, we sat down with Bradley Horowitz, who, yeah, he's an amazing dude.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.120]   He's over at Google Plus, and he's like, you know, we really need some help from a design
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.440]   and product standpoint.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.160]   Like, would you be interested in talking to us?
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.160]   And so...
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.160]   He was right, by the way.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.160]   Did you have anything to do with the Google Plus iOS and the internet apps?
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.160]   I came and was very tail-end to that.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.200]   So I looked a lot like Oink, and I thought, boy, that looks like maybe Daniel or David
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.200]   had something to do with that.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.360]   We saw it for about, gosh, three weeks before a launch.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.360]   It was too quick.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.360]   There was the way you could have been.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.960]   It was already kind of baked at that point.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.880]   So when we first talked, you said, I can't tell you what I'm doing at Google.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.880]   Right.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.880]   I'll let you know.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.880]   Right.
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.480]   And the rumors were product guy, Google Plus guy.
[00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.520]   Did they say to you Google ventures from day one, or was that something that came later?
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.960]   Well, basically, they were pretty cool in that they said, come in, kind of get your
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.360]   feet wet, float around, and see where you want to land.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.000]   They're actually known for doing this, aren't they?
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.520]   They hire people without a job.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.240]   Yeah, it was nice that they kind of let us pick where we wanted to end up.
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:37.680]   And so, you know, I think they would have liked us to stay on Google Plus.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.280]   But ventures was something I'd already done, worked with the ventures guys in the past.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.520]   I'd raised money with them through milk.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.880]   And so, I mean, Angel Vesting is something that's been a hobby of mine for several years
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.880]   now.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:52.200]   And I've quote, I've several times on this show gone through you list of advancements,
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.800]   which are very, very impressive.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.800]   Oh, thank you.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.800]   Well, Zingo, OMG Pop, Twitter, Fab.
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.320]   I mean, some really good investments.
[00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.320]   Thanks.
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.920]   It's been lucky to be involved with some great companies.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:04.920]   So, it's been awesome.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.920]   So, and it's been fun adventures?
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.360]   Yeah, ventures have been really cool.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.200]   I mean, it's basically Google gives us $200 million a year to invest.
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:17.920]   And they essentially say go out there and invest it in all the crazy, cool new ideas
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.960]   and products that you enjoy.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.880]   And for us, it's we're not really a strategic fund to Google in any way.
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.880]   So we can invest in competitive things.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.960]   We're essentially a separate company.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.960]   That's interesting.
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:34.120]   So, you don't have to ask permission from Larry, hey, you know, this is competitive.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.120]   Do you mind if we invest?
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.120]   No, no.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.120]   That's interesting.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.120]   So, it's great.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.960]   And so, there's seven of us doing investments, eight of us now.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.000]   You get to be like a judicious Santa Claus sitting on your throne.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   You're like, like you.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   You got to check.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   You look like you.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   You're a bag.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   But there's freedom in that though.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.200]   I mean, I would imagine it's obviously empowering to you.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:13:02.640]   But it's also, it solidifies the importance of you remaining or retaining that user perspective.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:07.160]   Yeah, I think that when I sit down with the entrepreneurs, the thing that I kind of help
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.560]   bring to the table, I try to bring to the table is producted by.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.600]   So, I sit down and we go through their idea.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.520]   Oftentimes, it's kind of wire frame stage.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.000]   It's getting ready to launch something in a few weeks.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.360]   And so, hopefully, I can help out there.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:22.160]   I probably give an average of five to 10 suggestions and they maybe go away and implement
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.680]   one of them into their product, which is kind of cool because it still feels like I'm staying
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.960]   involved as an entrepreneur.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.160]   But really, I'm just kind of giving advice.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.360]   So, a lot of coffee shop meetings, a lot of working at a San Francisco meeting all the
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.360]   new startups.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.080]   And it's fun to see stuff before it's launched.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.080]   I mean, you know how it is.
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.920]   When, at Tech TV, I'm sure you still get it here.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.520]   You get people that come in and have a product.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.000]   They're about to launch and you get to see it.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   They got that wild lights.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Look where it's like crazy looking.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.480]   They're like, "This is going to be awesome.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.480]   They're fired up."
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.360]   And you get some of that energy from them.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.360]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.360]   And it's like one of the...
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.560]   You see the passion coming from the person who created it, but then also, you have to
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.920]   put the reality filter on the other side of it.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:58.680]   Because no matter how excited they are, if it's something that's not right for the marketplace,
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.680]   if it's something that a user doesn't want, then obviously, Google doesn't want but put
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.680]   their money towards it.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.680]   Exactly.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:09.640]   Google's... our whole investment strategy is if it's good for the internet and for all
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.640]   things tech, then it's ultimately good for Google, which I think is the right way to approach
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.640]   things.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.120]   So what should the cafeterias do you like the best?
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.720]   There's the important question.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.680]   Cloud is probably my favorite.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.680]   It's really good.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:22.680]   All right, look.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.760]   And I don't know why this is stuck in my head.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:29.320]   I guess because there's an article about it in the doc, but is there anything at Google
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.440]   that you're more excited about than the self-driving cars?
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.760]   I am so sick of driving.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:33.760]   I'm sick of other people.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.240]   So that's one of our stories.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.080]   300,000 miles without an accident.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.400]   In fact, the only accident that happened with self-driving cars was when the human was driving.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.400]   That's right.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.400]   I can't wait.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:45.400]   I see them all the time on campus.
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.400]   They had the little thing at the top that just spins around.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.400]   Yeah, the light are.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.720]   It's kind of scary.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.520]   It's kind of silent like.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.160]   So I had a pilot on the radio show today.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:58.080]   I didn't ask him what airline.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.720]   But he flies a triple seven.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.760]   I said, "You let the plane land itself."
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.760]   He said, "All the time you have to have FAA regulations.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.480]   So you have to, every certain amount of time, you have to let the plane land it to test the
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.480]   autopilot."
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.640]   Yeah, I landed in a plane that turned that thing on.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:13.640]   They didn't warn us.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.640]   And the plane took a two-bounce hit.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.200]   So it doesn't do that good a job.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.200]   I didn't ask him that part.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.200]   I know, I think it does most of the time.
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.760]   But this took a two-bounce and that pilot had to come on and apologize.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:22.760]   Oh, we had a lot of plane.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:23.760]   It was a rough landing.
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.760]   See, this is the perfect situation for pilots.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:26.760]   Way up in the air.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.880]   They could take credit for all the nice landings and they could blame the computer for the
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:30.880]   ones that saw it.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.880]   There's flight dead.
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:32.880]   It's been smoothly inside.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:33.880]   It could have been buffloading me.
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.800]   Did you see the crash landing that happened with the GoPro?
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.800]   No.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.920]   Oh, there's a plane that went down with the GoPro camera.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.480]   The guy had a GoPro on his head.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.480]   Holy cow.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.480]   He's insane.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.480]   This is a direct flight.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.480]   Go.
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:46.480]   Some guy.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.480]   The pilot?
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.480]   GoPro plane crash.
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.480]   Wow.
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.480]   We can watch it.
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.480]   He's sitting around.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:53.440]   But I'll tell you what, man.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.040]   It's what I think of with the Google cars, some driving cars.
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.360]   If you search for GoPro and crash, there's quite a few.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.960]   Is it the one who was flying a Piper Cub?
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.280]   No, it was like a small little plane.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.840]   It crashed in the trees.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.840]   It was insane.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:08.840]   I think this is it.
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.040]   Before we take a look at this, something that the author Andrew Maine, the guy who wrote
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.040]   -- Ready player one?
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.040]   No, no, no, no.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.040]   The public enemies here.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.040]   Public enemies here.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.040]   I was confused.
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.040]   I do too.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.040]   Right.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.040]   Andrew Maine once told me, because I get bent out of shape about legal issues, but he said,
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.040]   "Don't worry, Brian.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.040]   Technology outpaces legislation."
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.040]   And I was like, "What does he mean by that?"
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.400]   And I realized that the Google cars, self-driving cars, is exactly that.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.520]   Because what does it mean to drive drunk when the computer is doing the driving?
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:36.120]   What does it mean to drive when you're old and blind and you can't get around?
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:41.000]   It's like the technology will fundamentally alter, and all of a sudden, so much legislation
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.840]   becomes completely irrelevant.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.600]   All of a sudden, magic occurs.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.600]   What are you guys looking at?
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.600]   We're looking at the plane crash.
[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:49.600]   As you --
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.600]   As you --
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:51.600]   I know.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.600]   What were you saying?
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.600]   I'm over here.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.600]   I'm talking -- I have a vision for our future.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.600]   That's our seat.
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.600]   Oh, this is our seat.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.600]   Talking about -- Oh, whoa!
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.600]   Party foul.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.600]   Everybody wearing a GoPro?
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.600]   That's a block.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.800]   Because I'd like to see that on Insta Replay.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.800]   All right, well, here.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.200]   Let me just recap this.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.280]   Because one of the things that's also awesome, obviously, Google put out that awesome video
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.200]   where they had a blind man being able to go out and get Taco Bell and so on.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:16.600]   By the way, we put that in one of our shows and we got a DMCA takedown from Google.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.200]   They're working out the books.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.760]   Hey, what's the answer to Google guy right here?
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:22.760]   I don't --
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.760]   He can't help us.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.560]   Answer to everything from Google.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:26.560]   You have to help us.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:31.280]   But also, think about your parents and think about them in 20 more years and their ability
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.800]   to stay mobile and stay at home.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.280]   If they don't have to drive, you know, it's like they can -- there's so much more -- we're
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.480]   going to live longer, fuller lives because this --
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.480]   This is --
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.480]   This is should be up for us.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.800]   Well, yeah, for especially the millennials, you're a bunch of drunken alcoholics.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:44.800]   Yes.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.800]   And they need you.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:46.800]   You're welcome.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.800]   Oh, my God.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.800]   Yeah, turn the audio up.
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.800]   I'm very good.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.800]   Check this out.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.800]   So, turn the audio up.
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:53.440]   This is -- we'll start at the beginning here.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.160]   We're flying around in a little small plane that's in Idaho.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.680]   That's the propeller, by the way.
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.520]   Oh, my -- oh, oh, oh, oh, that's not so bad.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.520]   Oh, my God.
[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.520]   Oh, my God.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.520]   Oh, my God.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.520]   Oh, my God.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.520]   Oh, my God.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.520]   Oh, my God.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:09.520]   Oh, my God.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.520]   Oh, that's bad.
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.520]   It's the bridge.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:17.000]   Well, this is the side view, which is -- what happened to his plane?
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.400]   By the way, everybody survived this accident, by the way.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.400]   You've been watching this.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.400]   You've been watching this.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.840]   Yeah, I'd be a little shaky.
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:25.840]   Wait until you see the pilot.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.840]   Hold on.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.840]   They're going to show the pilot in a second.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.840]   It's crazy.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:29.840]   Did the pilot die?
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.840]   This is like having a live dig.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.840]   Oh, wow.
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.840]   Oh, I was going to shoot the radio.
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:33.840]   They always come out to the apartment.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.840]   The pilot was bloody and it was awesome.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.840]   If you like to watch the rest, log in to NBC.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:41.040]   Speaking of which, this is from a deadspin.com.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:48.680]   Apparently, the NBC commentators during the Olympic Games, they were going to see the
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:54.840]   NBC commentators during the Olympics and during the U.S. Spain Gold Medal basketball
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:55.840]   game.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.840]   Got a little confused about somebody who was in the audience here.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.840]   Let's just --
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.840]   He's going to get to that three-throw line.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.840]   Darren Williams.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.760]   Step again to that three.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:08.040]   They think that -- that's Jesse Eisenberg in the audience.
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:15.000]   If we've got every executive of notes, it seems worldwide attending these games.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Every executive.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   They think it's Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   That's funny.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.800]   They talk about "Friending."
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:24.040]   I often confuse Jesse Eisenberg for Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.360]   Look, man, I don't blame money.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:29.040]   I mean, how hard must it be -- I don't know what they think about sports ball, but I would
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.040]   imagine it's very difficult.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.040]   It's very difficult.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.040]   Sports ball.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.040]   Where they put it through the giant H or something.
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.040]   There's like, "Noblong."
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.040]   I don't really follow it.
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.040]   Apparently not.
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.960]   But I would imagine it is very difficult to process all that live and feed that back
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.960]   to people.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.960]   You got a million things, juggled.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.360]   I just thank God I have to do live television.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.360]   It's the worst.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.360]   It is so hard.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.360]   I've ever seen this NBC thing.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:50.360]   It scores out.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:51.360]   It's horrible.
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.360]   You know what they did, though?
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.280]   And, by the way, what about this one Jamaican guy?
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.040]   The guy is so roided up, it's ludicrous.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.200]   He looks worse than Ben Johnson.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.360]   You mean, you saying bald?
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:02.120]   No, the other guy, the guy always comes in second to him.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.760]   You see his shoulders are all like, "The guy looks like a cow."
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.520]   I mean, he's like, "He's so roided up, it's ridiculous."
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.680]   It's not NBC's fault.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:11.320]   Nobody says, "Yes it is."
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.080]   How is that NBC's fault?
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.920]   I mean, they should say he's roided up.
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:15.920]   Mm-hmm.
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:16.920]   I don't know.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.920]   It's like a cow cow.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:18.920]   How does it not look like they're on Roy's?
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.920]   It's a risky thing to look at him.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:21.920]   Well, just take a look at him.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.920]   It was a cert.
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:23.920]   It was a carper.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.920]   I can't remember a second.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.280]   I guess you could say he looks like he is, rather than he is.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.920]   You could say he looks like he is.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.920]   No.
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:31.920]   He looks like a cow.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:32.920]   He's blackly stated that he is definitely not--
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:33.920]   No, stop it.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.920]   Stop it.
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.920]   Stop it.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:36.920]   He gave him steroids.
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.920]   I said roided.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.920]   That doesn't mean anything.
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:39.920]   His hemorrhoids is what you're done.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.920]   He's got a hemorrhoids.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:41.920]   He's got a hemorrhoids.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:42.920]   He's so fast.
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.920]   The guy has to stop every so often and do a rub down.
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:45.920]   It's terrible.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:46.920]   Wow.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:47.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.920]   Sponsored time.
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.920]   Now, yeah, I'm going to take a break because I don't think this is going to get better.
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.320]   Why would it?
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.920]   Why should it?
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.920]   Now, let me ask you, Kevin, you probably-- do you want to recuse yourself from Google
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:00.920]   Stories?
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:01.920]   Because there's a few.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.160]   And most importantly, I think this change in the search algorithm, which I think is a
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.160]   little bit--
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.160]   So I have nothing to do with the search algorithm.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.160]   Can you help us fix the search algorithm?
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.160]   Do you know what I'm doing?
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.160]   Kevin, if you want to--
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:12.160]   Listen, I'm having trouble with my YouTube account.
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.160]   Can you please give me a hand?
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.160]   Please give me a hand.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.160]   Who's your password?
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.160]   Who's the password's the password's the password's the word here?
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.160]   Speaking of right it up, you've been lifting.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.160]   You've been working out.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.160]   I don't work on it.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.160]   It's the cafeteria.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.160]   He looks good.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.160]   He's going to look bigger.
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.160]   Ooh.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.160]   This time goes by you watch.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.160]   Warning.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.160]   Why do you think everyone's on a--
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.160]   There's a cafeteria.
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.160]   I'm telling the cafeteria.
[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.160]   They serve roids there.
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.160]   You've been doing some roids.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.160]   You got a little bit of guns going on here.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.160]   Nothing going on.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:39.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:44.160]   This show brought to you by our friends at Citrix, make us go to my PC.
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.160]   Go to my PC.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.160]   I've never heard of this.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.160]   You know what it's summertime.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.160]   Yeah, tell us what it is.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.160]   Well, it lets you.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.160]   This is kind of cool because perhaps you want to go to the pool, you want to take
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.160]   off earlier.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.160]   Maybe you like to take a vacation.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.160]   And I think people sometimes think, well, I don't want to look at the office computer,
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:03.160]   but you know when you get back from a vacation and you're in boxes, 18,000 messages,
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:07.160]   it would be nice if you could like clear out stuff once in a while while you're on vacation.
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.160]   Maybe there's an emergency, the boss calls or whatever.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.160]   Go to my PC.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:15.160]   It lets you connect directly to your office, Mac or PC, anywhere you are from any other
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.160]   computer, including your iPhone or your iPad.
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.160]   So don't have to take your laptop with you on vacation.
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.160]   That's fine, but you've got your iPhone, you've got your iPad.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.160]   Emergency comes out.
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.160]   You can log in.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.160]   So this is the thing.
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.160]   A 30-day free trial.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.160]   I want you to do this now before you head out.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.160]   The summertime's here.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.160]   You know, all of France's closed this month.
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.160]   Yep.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.160]   They can actually--
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:39.160]   They're going to go to France, leave on the 14th of July, and then they go a month and a half.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.160]   They're gone.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.160]   I remember I was in Paris in August, I wanted to go to Bertillon, which is--
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.160]   Forget it, you can't get it.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.160]   Famous ice cream store, I thought August, ice cream, perfect.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.160]   No, they're closed.
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.160]   Yeah, of course.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.160]   What?
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:50.160]   They're closed in August.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.160]   Yeah, now they are.
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.160]   Most of France's closed in August.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.160]   Unless you're in beer rits, then it's somewhere like--
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.160]   Yeah, they're open.
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.160]   Maybe France needs to go to my PC.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.160]   I figured out a new use for go to my PC.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.160]   Are you on-- wait a minute, you're not really on your home computer.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.160]   Oh yeah, no, no, right now.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.160]   What are you at?
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.160]   Check this out.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.160]   Here we go.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.160]   I'm going to hold this over here.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.160]   You can switch to this camera.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.400]   So one of the things you could do with go to my PC is on iOS device, you of course can't
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.400]   do Flash, right?
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.400]   Right.
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:18.160]   But this is the sales tracking for the Diamond Club, and it's a Flash application.
[00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.160]   So I'm going to-- let me go and zoom in here.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.160]   Isn't this cool with the retina display?
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.160]   You actually have the detail.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.160]   There you go.
[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.160]   There's a little mouse.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:26.160]   So there's the Diamond Club.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.160]   Oh.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.160]   Is this your computer at home?
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.160]   Yeah, this is my office computer.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.160]   Wow.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.160]   So it's like I can log in, and I can actually see this is a Flash application.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.160]   You're going to watch a Flash video.
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:38.160]   Well, it's a Flash application showing the sales for the Diamond Club.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.160]   Look at that.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.440]   What happened last week?
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.320]   We released.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.320]   That's all.
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.680]   I want to ask you about that in a second.
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:46.680]   You want to try this?
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.520]   Go to my PC.com.
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:49.520]   Click the try it free button.
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.560]   The promo code TWIT, easy to do.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.560]   Try it free button.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.240]   Again, you see that working on an iPhone.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.240]   That is pretty awesome.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.240]   I do it all the time.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:57.240]   And you know what else I do have four?
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.680]   Is on the Google Plus.
[00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:01.240]   Hey, since you're a Google.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.720]   On the Google Plus mobile app, I love the mobile app.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:08.200]   But the problem is, is when you put a link in there, it doesn't find a preview and do
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.760]   the nice thing that it does on the desktop.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.000]   Can you fix that?
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   I will open up, go to my PC, and I will copy and paste it.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.680]   I'll actually email and link to myself.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.480]   I'll open it up on my home PC.
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.480]   I'll plug it in.
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.480]   Wow, work.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.480]   I know.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.480]   I agree.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.480]   So it's a good thing.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.480]   But until then, I'm going to go to my PC.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:25.480]   You can see right now.
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.480]   You can change the app.
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.720]   Go in there and change the app.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:29.720]   And commit it.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.720]   There you go.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.720]   My goodness.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.720]   Anyway, we thank them for their support.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.040]   So you mentioned Diamond Club.
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.040]   Yes.
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:39.600]   This is the fabulous best seller from Patricia Harkins Bradley, who by the way tweeted
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.600]   me.
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.600]   I was really honored.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:42.600]   She actually tweeted me.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:43.600]   I felt like celebrity.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:48.080]   It is shocking to me how little of this Justin and I have any idea who's doing what.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.960]   But we just trust them all implicitly.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.400]   Like we trusted all the authors that they would write original stuff and that they wouldn't
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.880]   plagiarize it off of some blog or something like that.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:00.520]   And we trust the people who run the Patricia Harkins Bradley Twitter account.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.440]   But it's on its way out.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.840]   It's slipping out of the top 10 right now.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.560]   But now is when all the coverage is happening.
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.360]   And so we've enjoyed--
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.520]   I think it could come back.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.520]   You never know.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.520]   So wait.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.840]   This is the top 10 book on the--
[00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:14.840]   Here, I'll show you.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:19.200]   If you open up the top 10 best-selling books on iTunes, you will see an erotic fiction
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.640]   novel called The Diamond Club.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.640]   It was.
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.640]   I'm really curious.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.240]   Can you talk about how much do you make if you're on top 10 on the iTunes?
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.240]   Oh, no, no.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.240]   We totally did.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.240]   As a matter of fact, you will.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.240]   Don't even start asking us.
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.240]   We just could tell you.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:34.720]   We already did a whole episode of NSFW where we broke down the numbers.
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.680]   Take a look at customers also bought.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:40.000]   Originally, it was all my books and Andrew Maine's books.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.800]   But now, look, it's right there.
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:43.800]   The pictures.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.800]   Oh, here.
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:45.800]   It's all porn.
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.800]   Like at this point, it's self-sustaining.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.800]   It's all people who love sex novels.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.800]   And they're by an arts sex novel.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.800]   Those are not sex novels.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:53.800]   They're romance novels.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:54.800]   They're boning novels.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:55.800]   Especially.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.800]   Especially this one.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.800]   That's a romance novel.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:58.800]   Right there, I can tell.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.800]   This has been a fascinating experiment.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.320]   Now, when we launched it, we acted like, you know, we called it a hoax, a prank and all
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.320]   these things.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.720]   Now that it were two weeks in, we're calling it an experiment and a satire.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.640]   But you know, this one's 99 cents too.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.640]   So I think somebody got a message because yours, you know, if you wanted to get 50 shades
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:20.080]   of gray, which is of course the king of this category, you would be spending $10 per volume,
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.840]   times three volumes.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:26.280]   But many that yours was only 99 cents and don't believe the print length.
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.280]   31 pages.
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.280]   No, that's right.
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.280]   It's like two.
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.960]   Yeah, it's like 64,000 words.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.200]   But here's the important thing.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.840]   People want to know the numbers and we talked about this on NSFW.
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:40.280]   But basically to get in the top 10 of iTunes book sales, you're looking at about when we
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:45.040]   hit number four, we were doing about 2,200 copies a day.
[00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:47.600]   Now we're down to less than a thousand.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.680]   I'd say we're on 900 copies a day and we're still in the top 10.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.680]   And so you can actually.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.480]   You can figure out what it takes.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.320]   Yeah, you can break it all down.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:01.200]   But especially if you want to think they're getting an actual romance novel will be kind
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.840]   of dismayed when they read chapters like nerdiest and dirtiest.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.000]   It's got high star reviews.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Well, I can.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.240]   Okay, so here's the thing.
[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.920]   We don't know grittles.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:14.600]   We all know lights, no camera, all action.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.760]   I think she has sex at an eye hot.
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.080]   But here's the thing.
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:20.080]   We started all.
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.080]   Leg it Larry.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:25.280]   It's actually two and a half legs.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:29.200]   Here's the important thing is we thought that it was just going to be a joke.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:33.200]   But at some point, like somebody's enjoying it because we're starting to see these four
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.960]   star reviews where they say sex is great.
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.320]   I kind of wish there was a little more of a plot.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.600]   And I don't think that's our people making.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.880]   Each chapter was written independently by people who had not read any of the other chapters.
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.120]   Yeah, we basically sat on NSFW and sort of sketched out.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.840]   We're like, here's the name of the main character.
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:49.840]   There's a club.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:50.840]   It's in San Francisco.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:51.840]   Right.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:53.440]   She's having revenge sex with everyone she can.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:58.040]   And mostly you've got to read this because a lot of romance on Cleft is Silicon Valley
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.040]   Bigwigs.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.040]   Am I in there?
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.040]   You know what?
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.040]   Maybe not by name.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.040]   None of us have read it.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.040]   None of us have read it.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.040]   But we can write you.
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.040]   But you're in it.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:11.160]   Well, and the media coverage has been phenomenal because I think out of everything, our favorite
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.680]   thing was somebody wrote it up on an Italian blog.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.680]   And it's all an Italian.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.680]   I have no idea what it says.
[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:18.160]   But I'm like, that's a foreign language.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.600]   And they're talking about us and our experience.
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.640]   You've sold more than $12,000 worth of books.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.640]   You've made 20,000 copies.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.640]   20,000 copies.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.160]   It's 20,000 bucks minus apples.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.160]   Take you with about 16,000.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.160]   That's 30%.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.160]   That's 30%.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.160]   And then book takes 10%.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.160]   Over takes some.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.160]   Yep.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.160]   And then of course, so that's down to what?
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:37.160]   Like, uh...
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.160]   16,000.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.160]   No, no, no, like 14, 14.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.160]   12,000.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.160]   12,000.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.160]   There you go.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.160]   And then taxes are going to be like what?
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.160]   33%.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.160]   It's called 9,000.
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.160]   No, brother.
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:47.160]   So what are you going to do with it?
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.400]   Well, first and foremost, we promised everyone that we're going to spend it on the authors.
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.800]   We'd like to give everyone an autographed copy of a hard copy of it.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.800]   Oh, that's a deal.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.440]   It's like one of your contracts, Leo.
[00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.600]   Yeah, you get a copy of the book.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.120]   And from the beginning, we called this the Huffington Post model, where they do all the
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.120]   work and we keep all the money.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.120]   Well, there it is.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.600]   But then, and of course, we're going to have a big party at DragonCon that we talked
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:11.000]   about and we're going to buy them t-shirts and stuff.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   Oh, whoa.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.360]   I wrote the Diving Club and all I got was this lousy t-shirt, as it all say on there.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.360]   That's good.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.360]   I like that.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.360]   That's a good start.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:24.640]   I've got an interesting story and obviously a success in many, many ways.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:32.800]   Let's talk about Google's new search, which Danny Sullivan, I think said, how did he put
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:33.800]   it?
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:37.520]   The copyright police win.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:43.840]   Google has announced that they will begin taking into account the number of copyright
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.960]   removal notices they receive for a given site.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:53.040]   If a site receives enough, copyright removal notices, they will penalize it in the search
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.040]   results.
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.040]   Good.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:56.040]   Good for them.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.040]   I think that's great.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:58.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.040]   It's about time.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.120]   Google should use it to leverage itself, these guys.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:06.400]   Oh, you know, you're putting copyright and stuff on the site and, you know, the Belgian
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:09.920]   idiots said that you can't even look at our sites.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:10.920]   Right.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.440]   Although you put it on robot.txt, you could put a robot thing in the center.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.440]   Yeah, they'll ignore it.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.440]   I didn't expect to be this guy.
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:19.040]   I'm going to, I'm going to try to explain the other side of this issue.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.040]   Okay.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.040]   Okay.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.040]   Here it is.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:23.040]   Here's, let's, let's, let me set the scenario.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.040]   Okay.
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.040]   I go on Google.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.040]   Oh, let me see.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.640]   Brian Brushwood, I want to find his book.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:32.840]   And then all of a sudden your book crops up or a site linking to your site.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.840]   It has the torrent link.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.040]   Well, maybe it's a torrent.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.040]   Maybe it's not.
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.040]   Maybe it's your website.
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.040]   Okay.
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.280]   So I go to your website and then I order a book.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.280]   Okay.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.280]   Now, what's the problem?
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:47.280]   I don't know.
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:51.160]   I don't know how this changes it.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.440]   They say a valid takedown request.
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.160]   But I don't know what valid means.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.800]   Well, especially when you run the risk of, of there being mass hysteria.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.640]   I'll tell you why this makes me nervous for two reasons.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.560]   One is we get takedown requests for every show.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:08.400]   In fact, we'll get a takedown request for showing that clip from NBC of Jesse Eisenberg.
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.880]   Now Google sometimes takes the shows down.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:14.120]   Sometimes they just give us a notice saying, "Hey, we're not going to penalize you."
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.680]   But we get them all the time now.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:20.560]   The second thing that bothers me is Google is specifically exempting YouTube their own
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.560]   site.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.920]   Ah, well, that would be annoying.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:25.920]   There is a follow up.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:26.920]   We can do it.
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:31.280]   There's a follow up article where Google, what Google said was that they are treating
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.620]   YouTube just like any other site.
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:36.480]   There are other factors beyond the number of takedown requests.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:40.720]   And I assume that has something to do with the number of takedown requests relative to
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.240]   the total traffic that they see on that particular site.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:48.240]   So unless worried about that, but what I'm more worried about is this Lend Inc story.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.240]   Did you guys see this?
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:50.240]   Mm-hmm.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.240]   So there's a website called Lend Inc.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.240]   Lend.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.240]   And some...
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.640]   L-E-N-D-I-N-K.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.040]   And somebody essentially stirred the pot.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.040]   It's gone now.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.040]   You won't be able to find it.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.240]   It's reduced to ashes.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:03.360]   It's been destroyed because basically...
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.560]   It was intimidated by the business.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:10.120]   Well, the idea, what behind it was, it's created by a disabled veteran who wanted to
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:15.080]   create a site for people who had lendable copies of print books to find other people
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.080]   you wanted to collect them to.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.080]   Correct.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.080]   And link them together and like lend them to...
[00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.080]   It's totally legal.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.680]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:25.320]   Someone got a bug up their butt and decided to start twittering all of the different authors
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.360]   saying, "Hey man, your stuff's on this pirate site.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.920]   Your stuff's on this pirate's site."
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.160]   They built it into a witch hunt.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.680]   They exploded all over the place.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.000]   They started calling for actions.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.720]   They submitted takedown requests.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.360]   And the site was reduced to total ashes.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.240]   He was only allowed to get his...
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.800]   I don't know if it's the domain or some other aspect of it.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.160]   Only able to get it back if he promised to individually.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:49.160]   This is one guy, one disabled bet with a website that essentially ran itself and they're
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.880]   saying the only way it can come back is if you personally review every single takedown
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.880]   request.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.520]   And he's like, "I don't even know if it's worth it at that point."
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:57.640]   So here's the problem.
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:02.640]   This guy's website under this rule would be completely buried because he's had so many
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:08.640]   takedown requests even though they're completely unjustified and completely felonious.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:11.040]   The Electronic Frontier Foundation has come out.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.560]   Felacious is what I meant to say.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:13.560]   Felacious.
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.560]   Felacious.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:15.560]   Did you say felonious?
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.560]   It's a felonious.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:19.920]   It's completely hilarious is what I meant to say.
[00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:26.840]   GFF's headline is, "Google's opaque new policy lets right holders dictate search results."
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.240]   Now I agree with you John.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:34.120]   If Google is saying, "Hey, this is a pirate site," and by the way, most of the sites,
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.640]   they gave a list of the sites that would be affected immediately and it's almost all
[00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.240]   torrent sites.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.080]   And I guess that's not unreasonable.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.920]   My concern is that the takedown process itself is kind of flawed.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:46.240]   We get takedowns all the time.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.240]   It is a Mars rover video.
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.880]   And by the way, half the stuff you're getting to take down those is for us Paul.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:52.880]   It's fair use.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:53.880]   What you just did.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.480]   All this stuff is sometimes though it's not even from a rights holder.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.480]   So this is a YouTube flaw.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:02.560]   By the way, they say this is not the same, we're not going to use the same mechanism
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:03.720]   that YouTube's using.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.280]   This is a different mechanism.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:08.160]   In fact, they're very clear if you go to Google.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.800]   These are takedowns from search results.
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:13.360]   So if you go to Google and you say, "I want to have a takedown," they say, "Now if this
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.000]   is for YouTube, go somewhere else.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.320]   This is a different link.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.520]   This is for search results only."
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.640]   So they're very clear about making that distinction.
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:29.360]   So the Mars rover landing, video NASA posted of JPL and people cheering was pulled down
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.920]   by the Scripps Howard news service.
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:37.440]   It was actually blocked for a day or two because Scripps Howard has local television news broadcasts
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:42.200]   that featured these clips, uncopy-ready clips from NASA in their local news.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:48.680]   The content ID system said, "Oh yeah, I recognize that from the local news issue to takedown."
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:49.680]   The takedown automated.
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:52.240]   It just, I presume it was automated.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:56.320]   And now what that means though is that NASA had to notice it, had to appeal it, and of
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.280]   course Google immediately responded to put it back up.
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.440]   It's not completely brain dead.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.360]   But that's problematic.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.880]   And for our content, we get taken down frequently.
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.080]   We make the fair use argument.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.840]   It usually gets put back.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.400]   But for news content, a day or two later could be worthless.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.640]   So now I just think the process is flawed.
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:17.640]   It's not.
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:18.640]   It's not the same process.
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:19.640]   It's not the same process.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.400]   But that's why I worry about this.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.840]   Well, I'm going to flip back now.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.840]   I'm going to take John's side again and say, "You know what my side is."
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.760]   That ass flawed.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.760]   As flawed as the mechanics are on this, they're working out the bugs on it.
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:35.760]   They're figuring out I would a million times over, much, much rather, see Google tinker
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:41.000]   with the system to reduce the visibility of pirate sites than I would to see some heavy-handed
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.320]   legislation come in and just smash everything.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:48.200]   So it's like I applaud the legislation, but this particular implementation, you know,
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.840]   there will be growing pains, there'll be bumps along the road.
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.640]   But I would much rather see private industry take it on than involving others.
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:57.640]   And EFF says that they say, "Look, they're not seizing don't main names as the government
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:58.640]   does."
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.640]   Right.
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.360]   But they say, in particular, this is the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:05.080]   We worry about the false positives problem that I was just talking about.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:08.560]   We've seen the government, for instance, wrongly target sites that actually have a right to
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:13.000]   post the fringe and fringing material or otherwise legally display content.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.120]   Without details on how the process works, we have no reason to believe that Google won't
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:22.600]   make similar over-inclusive mistakes dropping lawful, relevant speech, lower in its search
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:25.000]   results without recourse for speakers.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   Well, okay.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.600]   Well, you say without recourse, but shows like this are recourse and Google will respond
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:33.800]   far faster than any government will to make corrections because they have a profit motive
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.800]   for it.
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:39.440]   But take, and again, I'm quoting the EFF, "Take down requests are nothing more than accusations."
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:44.080]   This is the point you made earlier, Brian, of copyrighted, accusations of copyright infringement.
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:48.560]   No court or other umpire confirms that the accusations are valid.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:52.680]   The voting search results, telling the searcher, "These are not the websites you're looking
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:55.160]   for based on accusations alone.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:58.840]   Gives copyright owners one more bit of control over what we see here in Reid."
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:03.840]   And I agree that the problem is it's a pendulum and it's been swinging way in the favor of
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.840]   copyright hold.
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:05.840]   Sure.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.840]   And I'm a copyright holder.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:07.840]   We create content.
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:08.840]   I'm not-
[00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:12.400]   I think that's tricky here though, is that you can have anyone with a large audience.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.480]   Like let's say right now you said, "You know what?
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.720]   I really don't like."
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.560]   And any company, throw it out there.
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:18.560]   Yeah, take them down.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.560]   Take them down.
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:24.720]   I want you all to go out there and independently create 500, 1000, 10,000 of these notices.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.720]   Send them in.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.200]   It's going to damage them, right?
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.200]   Like they're just going to take down the side and knock it out of those search results.
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:32.520]   Hopefully they have other secret sauce behind the scenes.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:35.400]   Like they say that they're going to be taken into account here before they do something
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.400]   like that.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:40.560]   But I would just be worried that someone with a big audience can exploit this.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:44.600]   I think that's always the problem with email black holing.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.400]   It's a good idea to stop spam.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:50.000]   But what happens when we saw that before with maps and orbs was that exactly that would
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.240]   happen, that people would use it to target other people.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.600]   And it's such an automated system.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.600]   It's very hard to prevent that.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:57.600]   Good.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.680]   And so what do we conclude from this debate?
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:01.760]   I think that was a very good conversation.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.760]   I don't know what we're going to do.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.760]   I'll just go ahead and fix it.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:06.320]   I just put it in right now.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.640]   That would probably be Python, not Objective-C on that.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:12.880]   I just mentioned that Google Ventures, your little army might know a little bit about
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:15.760]   this just to invest at 8.2 million in DocuSign.
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.320]   I think that's really interesting.
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.320]   Yep.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.320]   I was there.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.320]   So let me ask you real quick about this.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:25.240]   And here's what I like about DocuSign is the best advancements in technology take some
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:30.840]   little thing, something that seems insignificant on the surface and figures out a way to massively
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:35.440]   improve the efficiency and the pleasantness of doing it.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:39.600]   And as a stage performer, that means every time I do a stage show I have to sign a contract
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.800]   and every institution has their own rules about how they want it.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.040]   So facts this or sign that it is.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:46.440]   And you're faxing it.
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.680]   That's the problem is all this.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.960]   Anytime you buy a house, you're faxing this thing.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:50.960]   Right.
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:52.960]   In fact, because they want your signature.
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.160]   I mean, we can imagine that's more secure in any way.
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:59.680]   We had to deal with Telix to do this gig in Indonesia.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.080]   They had for the visa, they had to Telix over.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:05.960]   Did you like the computer museum to do the Telix?
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.560]   I mean, how'd you do it?
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.320]   Apparently there are companies that come live.
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.000]   They've hasted on a yellow sheet.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   Well, apparently.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.120]   But I'll tell you that's what I like about DocuSign is that they make it so super easy
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.280]   and the faster that we can.
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.280]   You're waiting for this company.
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:18.280]   Oh, sure, sure.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.280]   I've had a number of contracts that had to be done.
[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.280]   And that was the weird part.
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.600]   Indonesia sent me two documents.
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:25.480]   The RCTI is the big television station over there.
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:28.600]   They sent me the contract and I had to DocuSign it, right?
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:34.440]   But meanwhile, the Indonesian government sent over a Telix that I had to go to the visa
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.240]   office and deal with all that stuff.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.240]   Cable, that's Brian Brushwood fellow.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.320]   Let's sign him up today.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.480]   So DocuSign does what, Kevin?
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:48.120]   They're essentially e-signatures, like legally binding e-signatures so that you can go in.
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:53.520]   And if you're buying a house or whatever it may be, it creates this secure encrypted
[00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:58.160]   little envelope that you can go in and securely sign something, tie to your IP, tie to your
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:01.360]   email address so they can prove it's actually this person.
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:05.200]   And it's who has to subscribe to the service?
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.200]   Both parties?
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:09.000]   The receiver doesn't have to pay anything to send her.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.680]   It depends on what they're doing and who they are.
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.280]   And is there a smaller business?
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.280]   Is there legal support?
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:14.920]   I mean, is there law supporting this?
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:15.920]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:16.920]   There is.
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:18.920]   Okay.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:19.920]   Federal law.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:20.920]   Yes.
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:21.920]   So this is good anywhere in the US and apparently in the Philippines.
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:22.920]   I'll tell you what's fun.
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:23.920]   I'll tell you what's fun.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:24.920]   Is trying to do your signature with your mouse.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:25.920]   Just sort of new thing.
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:26.920]   Well, is it a signature?
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:27.920]   Use a Wacom tablet.
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:28.920]   You can adopt a signature.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:30.480]   So you can adopt a signature.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.480]   It could be XXYYZZ.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:35.040]   It just automatically creates a little font for you.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.040]   That's kind of art.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.040]   That seems a little archaic.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.800]   Well, I mean, it takes you to my signature via a publisher.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:40.800]   Should my signature be a publisher?
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:42.400]   Yeah, that would write exactly.
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.440]   Instead of my actual, like, I signed my name.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:45.760]   Also, I got problems with my Gmail.
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.160]   Can you fix that too?
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.160]   No problem.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:50.680]   So you don't have to sign-- you don't actually--
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.440]   No, you don't have to sign anything.
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:55.480]   Now you just adopt a signature and it creates a little font for you.
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.480]   It's like two seconds.
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.480]   It's that simple.
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.800]   And then there's some sort of cryptic-- it probably is a public key.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.040]   Yeah, there's-- you have to go on the site and read all about it.
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:03.040]   There's a whole--
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.520]   Well, and keep in mind also, what is a signature?
[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:06.520]   Because any time-- and this is part of the reason--
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:07.520]   Ah, yes.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:09.520]   What is a signature?
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.520]   This is what is a signature.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.520]   I've wondered myself.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:16.000]   And what I mean by this is contract law, like by the letter of the law, the moment that
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.360]   I agree to this price and you agree to this event, we have a contract.
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.000]   We have an oral agreement, right?
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   But then--
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   All I have to do is shake your hand, sir.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   Sure.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   Or even just talk over the phone, right?
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.480]   But essentially, everything beyond that is just more proof if it ever gets ugly between
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.560]   us that we can hash out in the court of law.
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:34.520]   So if DocuSign is able to say, no, we have a verified, we're able to-- it came from this
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.520]   IP address.
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.840]   It was signed by this person.
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:37.840]   It was--
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:38.840]   You're a fan of this email address?
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:39.840]   Exactly.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:41.000]   Yeah, there's a handful of things they use.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:48.960]   And so if the standard of evidence for DocuSign is as good as a forensic analysis of handwriting,
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.120]   then at that point, it's just as good as that signature.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.120]   Right.
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.200]   Now, I presume there's-- this is a competitive space.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:55.760]   There have to be many other companies, too.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.120]   Adobe has something in there.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.800]   Hello, Science, another one.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.440]   There's a handful of companies that-- but DocuSign is--
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.280]   Are they the market leader right now?
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.280]   Yeah, by far.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.280]   Interesting.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.280]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.280]   And I'd never heard of them if it--
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.280]   Oh, a lot of big companies, HP.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:09.280]   There's a whole handful of huge companies that use--
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.280]   Not enough of them as far as I've concerned.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.160]   So I'm going to go to DocuSign today.
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.280]   Well, until the real estate industry adopts it.
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.280]   Because I mean, seriously--
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.280]   They do now.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.280]   They do now.
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:19.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.080]   The crazy thing is-- it's funny because they came into pitch us and they were talking about
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.560]   their business and how fast it's growing and the numbers are insane.
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:27.080]   But one of the things that was interesting is they see themselves competing with FedEx
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:29.000]   overnight.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.520]   Because so many people overnight document their sign.
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:32.520]   Oh, sure.
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:33.520]   Sure.
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:34.520]   And they're like, we're disrupting FedEx overnight.
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.520]   And I'm so crazy.
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.520]   Think about how much more sense it makes.
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:40.840]   If what-- if the product that you want is a solidified agreement between two willing
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:43.000]   parties, then there's two ways to do it.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.040]   I mean, DocuSign's way, of course, is electronically they figure out some way to secure that both
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.040]   parties agree.
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:53.440]   And then the other side is, let's mail a piece of dead tree 7,000 miles to the--
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:54.440]   To the other side of the world.
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:55.440]   I have a world.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:56.440]   Exactly.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.760]   Another investment you probably know a little bit about.
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:01.760]   I know you were an investor in early investor in Square.
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:06.800]   Jack Dorsey's really cool company that lets you charge things with a little piece of Square.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:10.960]   And then the new business, which I love, is Pay by Square, where you walk into a--
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:11.960]   Have you used it?
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:13.960]   We have a coffee shop over here.
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:14.960]   That's awesome.
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.080]   I have an app on my iPhone or Android phone.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.640]   I have this coffee shop.
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.640]   It's called Acre over here.
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:22.160]   And when I walk in, I just put it on my bill.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:25.400]   I'm Leo, and he sees it on his iPad.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:26.880]   And I can add a tip, and it's done.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.280]   Are you an Android guy now full-time?
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.760]   Oh, this S3.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:30.760]   Awesome.
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:31.760]   The Skaislav.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.920]   Are you allowed to carry iPhones in the Googleplex?
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:34.920]   Ah!
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:35.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.160]   You've played with this before.
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:40.160]   This is the one you put in the French.
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.160]   I love Android.
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:42.160]   And I have an iPhone.
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:43.160]   I'm using the Nexus version, which is--
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.160]   Nexus is nice.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:45.160]   But you know what I want to get?
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:46.160]   And then we'll talk about Square.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.200]   So here's the weird thing about Square.
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:49.200]   What is it?
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:50.200]   We were talking about phones.
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:51.200]   Sorry.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.200]   We did a quick U-turn.
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.680]   We'll get back to Square in a second.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.280]   But as long as we're talking about phones.
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.280]   So supposedly--
[00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.480]   You have a button on yours.
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.480]   Yeah, I like the button.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:43:59.400]   I like a physical button.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.840]   Google apparently doesn't.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.680]   When they went to Ice Cream Sandwich, they eschewed the buttons.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.640]   But I like buttons, still.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.600]   So Apple's-- supposedly, rumors has it.
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.160]   September 12th could announce the new iPhone.
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.160]   I'm so excited.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:12.760]   26th.
[00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:13.440]   Really, are you?
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.200]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.880]   Because what do you think Apple could do that makes it competitive?
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:17.880]   Honestly, I have to get beat this.
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.120]   So this is the whole thing.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:21.040]   When I went to Google, they gave me an Android phone.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:21.560]   Right.
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.560]   Probably in Nexus, I would guess.
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:23.560]   They gave me an Nexus.
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.240]   And they basically said they were very cool with it.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:28.040]   They were like, we develop apps for the iPhone and for Android.
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.280]   So use whichever one you like.
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:31.280]   We're going to put our software on both devices.
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.640]   And so I actually tried to switch over a full time.
[00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.200]   So I carried both around with me.
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:40.240]   I love the extra screen real estate that you get on the Android devices.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.240]   It's just so much--
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.440]   3 and 1/2 inches of starting to look--
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:43.840]   What happened now, you are the big note guy.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:45.080]   There's a new note coming out by that.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:46.120]   That's what I was about to say.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.880]   August 29th.
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.640]   Just two weeks before Apple's announcement,
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.800]   Samsung's going to ship the Galaxy Note 2.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:53.480]   And they said--
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:54.520]   A blood feud.
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:55.800]   I think it's fascinating.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.880]   This thing is 5 and 1/2 inches.
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:44:59.640]   It's even bigger than the last note.
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:02.720]   And they're going to use a new thin screen technology that's
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.040]   like a flexi screen.
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.600]   They claim is unbreakable.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.080]   And because it's so thin, they have bigger battery.
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.720]   They have a thinner phone, but bigger battery.
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:10.960]   I think this is going to be--
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.280]   This is the problem Apple's facing.
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:14.200]   Apple iterates once a year.
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:16.280]   Samsung's now iterating every few months.
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:17.240]   Right.
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:19.480]   Because they've got these different model lines.
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:20.280]   And so it's tough.
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.720]   It's also confusing those at the same time.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:22.720]   Like, when I look at-- what's the--
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.640]   I don't know what the latest Samsung phone is or something
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:26.160]   about what there's one coming out next week,
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:26.880]   two right here.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:27.880]   Here it is right here.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:29.840]   The S3 is the current hot--
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.680]   Look at whatever I'm carrying, Kevin.
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.040]   It'll always be the latest.
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:33.840]   That's right.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.800]   Leo will always have the latest and greatest.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.000]   I am looking for the Note 2, and I will buy it as soon as--
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:38.760]   Are you sponsored by Samsung?
[00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:39.280]   No.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:40.120]   Do they hook you up with free devices?
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:40.880]   No, I bought that.
[00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:41.200]   I don't know.
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.280]   He's kind of about money.
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.800]   He just buys the stuff left and right.
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.680]   He's got rooms full of phones.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.400]   He's unbelievable.
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.480]   And will he give us any--
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.080]   Is he going to give you one in the back door?
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.000]   No, he won't give one away.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.800]   He keeps them all.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:56.360]   So here's the thing I think of with Android versus iPhone.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:00.840]   Is iPhone-- an analog for PC gaming, basically, right?
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.840]   iPhone, you've got these slow, iterative, you know,
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:07.160]   major generations that come about once a year give or take.
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.560]   Likewise, in gaming, you have console iterations.
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.280]   I happen every three to five years.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:14.120]   But as a result, every time with a console comes out,
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.000]   that's the new hotness, and everyone goes to it,
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.720]   because you could write custom software for it.
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:21.680]   But meanwhile, PC gaming is very boutique.
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:24.400]   But like at this point, PC gaming is so far ahead
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.720]   of the curve with Xbox, Xbox, Xbox, Generation.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.280]   The hardware is like, what, five, six generations behind
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.000]   at this point.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.400]   So right now, PC is seeing a big push.
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:32.680]   You know what?
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:35.480]   Likewise, you get this very fast iterations
[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.040]   with Android phones, because they're always
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:38.040]   coming out with new ones.
[00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:39.880]   And I think where you're really going to see this happen
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:40.960]   is with Google TV.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:43.720]   I wouldn't be surprised if Google TV eventually
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:47.360]   becomes a competitor to a lot of the console, the set top boxes,
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:50.760]   because consoles vary very slowly.
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:52.800]   You know, every, what, seven, eight years?
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.600]   They're not even-- we haven't even heard about the next PlayStation
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:56.320]   or Xbox.
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:57.840]   But meanwhile, you've got stuff like Uya.
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:01.000]   You've got the Sony Google TV coming out.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.120]   I think that gives them a first-boomer advantage.
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.200]   I agree.
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:07.720]   No, I agree.
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:10.560]   And I think that's why it's going to be very compelling
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:13.320]   or very interesting in a way to see what happens with the iPhone 5.
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:15.480]   We'll call it that even though Apple won't.
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:19.040]   Because it's going to be LTE, but that's playing catch up.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:22.120]   It's going to be 4 inches, but that's playing catch up.
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:23.160]   They're doing something.
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:23.880]   I think it's risky.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.600]   They're changing the 30-pin connector for a 19-pin connector.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:29.160]   That's actually more risky than it is a move forward.
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:30.400]   I'm sure Apple thinks it's a move forward.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.440]   What do you think that's risky?
[00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:35.040]   Because a lot of people like me have a big investment in 30-pin docks,
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.920]   30-pin radios, 30-pin cars.
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.320]   We'll have to use an adapter, though.
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:40.280]   Yeah, we'll have an adapter.
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:41.480]   And it's always like $25.
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:42.320]   You're like, what is this?
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.280]   It's never as good.
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:44.280]   And it's always expensive.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.280]   And it won't dock as solidly, probably, right?
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.640]   Because it'll be in an adapter.
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:50.760]   Have you seen the new adapters for the new MacBook Pros?
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:51.560]   Yeah, I have one.
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:52.640]   I hate it.
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:53.640]   The giant MagSafe.
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:56.240]   It's the most tiny thing you know it's $0.25 to $0.50.
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:56.440]   I know.
[00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:57.320]   It's a Mac cost.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:57.800]   It's a Mac cost.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:59.160]   And it's like $30.
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:47:59.660]   Yeah.
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:00.240]   No, I have a retina.
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.520]   I love the retinas.
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:03.680]   So, John, are you changing the language to Portuguese?
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.280]   You know, this thing--
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.000]   Because no, he changed it to Russian last time.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:07.880]   Yeah, that was a good one.
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:09.600]   That was a good one.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:12.120]   If you think about it, it's quite funny.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:13.320]   It's language learning for you, yeah?
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:15.680]   That was an awesome reversal, if you're like, well, it's not dumb.
[00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:16.480]   It's not juvenile.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:18.520]   If you were smart, you think it's awesome.
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.800]   It's quite funny.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.640]   You got so much junk on this phone, it's unbelievable.
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:24.800]   Well, like what?
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:26.320]   I mean, just page after page.
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:26.720]   You like my fish tank?
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.000]   After page of stuff.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:28.520]   You like this--
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:29.040]   I have to--
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.400]   --you just got to be draining your battery.
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:31.240]   No, it's great.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:31.720]   That always--
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:34.800]   And what's the love portrait of Paul Ryan doing on your thing?
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:35.240]   Wow.
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:36.120]   He's my new hero.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.280]   Are you kidding?
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:38.000]   Yeah, that's Flipboard.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   When Flipboard came out for Android,
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.360]   that was a huge differentiator.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:43.880]   That really was a huge differentiator.
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:48.880]   I just think it's going to be tough for iPhone.
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:49.440]   I don't think it's--
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:49.960]   I agree.
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:50.760]   --automatic.
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:52.720]   And I think this is going to be the first time it's not on.
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:55.040]   These guys are really aggressive.
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:57.640]   And I think they're also mad because they get sued.
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:58.560]   We're going to take a break.
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:00.640]   I want to talk about the Apple Samsung lawsuit
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:01.640]   because there's lots going on.
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:03.280]   That is a lot of fun.
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:06.880]   I was a little miffed, Judge Lucie Coe,
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:15.480]   blocked the picture from 2001, a space odyssey of Dave using
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:17.280]   a tablet.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.680]   And she said, no, you can't admit that Samsung.
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:21.120]   It's been a very interesting trial.
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:23.280]   And I really want to ask you about Square and Starbucks
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.280]   because I think this is huge.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.880]   I'll talk about App.net as well.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:27.560]   Huge.
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:28.120]   You know what?
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:29.160]   I am on App.net.
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.360]   I like App.net.
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:33.040]   Dalton Caldwell finally got funded.
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.280]   It's self-funded, but it's good.
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:35.000]   It's very interesting.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:35.800]   Are you on App.net?
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:36.640]   I'm not.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.340]   I'm not.
[00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:37.840]   I'm not.
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:38.360]   I can help you.
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:39.440]   So you got face cameras.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:40.280]   What?
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.040]   I can hook you up.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:42.280]   I can hook you up.
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:44.000]   But first, let's talk a little bit about something
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.520]   I know you are already signed up for.
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:47.000]   Right?
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.680]   Audible.com, the greatest audio books in the world of 100,000--
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:50.360]   Never heard that.
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:51.520]   Tell me about this Audible.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.240]   Oh, you're so good, Brian.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:55.600]   You do really a good job about this at W.
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:56.200]   No.
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:58.000]   You should see what a good job--
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.120]   The record for most assists on a sponsor is amazing.
[00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:06.560]   Audible.com, it is the 100,000 book bookstore, audio books.
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:10.880]   I'll tell you, one of the things that I missed as I grew up
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:13.880]   and got busy in the world was I used to love to read.
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:16.760]   And for a while, I just didn't get to read.
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:19.440]   Then, during my commute to the tech TV,
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:21.280]   I had two hours a day.
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:24.080]   All of a sudden, I'm reading again thanks to Audible.com.
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:26.320]   I've been a member since 2001.
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:27.160]   I got to pick for you.
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:29.800]   500 books later.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:30.280]   I love it.
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.720]   And you know, that's one of the great things
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:34.280]   I like about Audible is they have the app now for Windows Phone
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:36.160]   7, Android, and iOS.
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:40.960]   That means your entire library is on your phone,
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:44.320]   which means you can listen at any time.
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:46.720]   Any book you've ever bought, you can go back.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:47.720]   I'll look at my library here.
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:50.240]   They're all in here.
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:50.880]   I just love it.
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:54.080]   So Audible.com plays back on almost any device.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:55.320]   You can listen to great books.
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:56.440]   There's a Steve Jobs bio.
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:57.320]   That was a great book.
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.840]   I loved listening to that.
[00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:00.320]   What do you recommend today?
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:02.600]   So I just finished a book by Matt Ridley called
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:03.760]   The Rational Optimist.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:04.760]   Have you read this?
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:05.760]   No.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:06.760]   It is utterly fantastic.
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:07.760]   What do you get on my list?
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:11.480]   And it totally made me have so much faith in humanity
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:13.520]   and our ability to survive and thrive.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:16.520]   One of the things he does is he basically makes a case for,
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:18.000]   hey man, things are just going to get better.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.200]   Technology's awesome.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:20.680]   Free trade encourages.
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:23.320]   This marketplace of ideas causes people to compete,
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:25.320]   to come up with more efficient solutions.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.680]   And that's why humanity, by all measures,
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:29.560]   is getting better and better year after year.
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:31.640]   And one of the things he says that kind of blew my mind
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:36.760]   is he says, stop measuring wealth by dollars or pesos
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.680]   or any other currency, because what does that mean?
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:41.480]   Instead, measure wealth by what you can get
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:45.040]   for what the average person has to invest in time.
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:48.680]   So in ancient Babylon, it would take six hours of effort
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:51.480]   in order to make enough money for the average person
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:54.440]   to buy enough oil for an hour's worth of reading light,
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:56.720]   six hours of labor for an hour's worth of reading light
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:57.840]   in the middle of the night.
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:59.520]   Then you jump forward to the Middle Ages.
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:01.440]   Now all of a sudden it will say two hours.
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:02.840]   I'm sure all these numbers are wrong.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:05.320]   But two hours of effort to get a single tallow candle.
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:06.960]   By the time you get to the 1800s,
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:09.440]   takes around 15 minutes of effort to get enough kerosene
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.200]   to light your lamp.
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:12.600]   And nowadays with our compact fluorescent bulbs,
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.720]   with our LED lights, the average salary
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:16.800]   in the United States of America,
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.880]   it takes a half second of labor
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:20.680]   to get an hour's worth of lighting.
[00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:21.880]   And so he also makes an interesting case.
[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:23.960]   - That's a really good way to measure it, I think.
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:26.040]   - He also talks about like Louis XIV,
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:29.360]   of course, one of the most extravagant kings of France.
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:32.040]   He talks about what he had as far as available.
[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:33.920]   He would apparently have 10 different meals
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:35.280]   prepared for him every single night.
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:37.040]   And so tremendously wasteful,
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:39.000]   they would create, they would have to slaughter all these pigs.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.760]   And he would just go and pick like, "I want that."
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.560]   Nowadays we get that for a--
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:46.200]   - I walk at my front door, I've got 15 ways to have a hamburger.
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:48.800]   - Right, we have the knowledge of all the greatest thinkers
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.120]   in humanity, stuff that we travel in ways
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:53.320]   that were unimaginable to the pharaohs.
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:55.000]   - I often think that, I often think,
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.240]   we live like kings.
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:57.080]   - Absolutely, absolutely. - We really do.
[00:52:57.080 --> 00:52:58.400]   - Better than kings. - Better than kings.
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:52:59.800]   - We have hot and cold running water.
[00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:01.880]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.600]   And it doesn't take a single slave to do it.
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:07.080]   I mean, it's amazing, it's highly enjoyed it.
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:09.800]   It totally fundamentally altered my perception of reality.
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.720]   - I often think that we do take for granted
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:14.080]   what an interesting world.
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:17.640]   Now obviously, prosperity's not evenly distributed.
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:20.000]   There are a lot of people who don't live nearly as well
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.400]   as a peasant in the 14th century.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.040]   And we need to solve that.
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.920]   But I think that-- - Sure, sure.
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.600]   - This is interesting, the rational optimist,
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:29.480]   how prosperity evolves, Matt Ridley.
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:30.720]   I'm gonna put it on my list.
[00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:33.520]   I just downloaded another book I wanted to read
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:35.880]   about money, the end of money.
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:38.400]   This is the same kind of category.
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:41.800]   This is philosophy of modern times kind of.
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:43.600]   The end of money, counterfeiters, preachers,
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:46.600]   techies, dreamers, and the coming cashless society.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:48.400]   I was reading an article that referred to this.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.440]   And this is what's so great about Audible.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:51.640]   You read about something like that.
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:53.760]   Now I would normally go to a bookstore, a library,
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:55.640]   maybe look at my Kindle.
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:56.920]   Yeah, Audible, you just download it.
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:57.760]   Boom, you got it.
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:58.960]   Seconds later you're listening to--
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:00.400]   - When you listen to Jim or what are you--
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:03.240]   - I listen in the car, the gym when I walk the dog.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.720]   I actually now play, I set it up with my Sonos,
[00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.600]   so I plot my iPhone in the Sonos,
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:09.280]   and I listen while I'm a cleaning house
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:12.920]   or walking, just a lion bed and listen, I love it.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.440]   I really-- - Cleaning house, really?
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:17.080]   - Yeah, what do you mean, I clean house?
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:19.560]   - Well, you do, but not in that way.
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:22.520]   I do not have a cleaning lady.
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:27.880]   I clean my own toilets, John.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:29.800]   - You sit there and you scrub the floor in the kitchen.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:31.120]   - I do.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:32.840]   I think it's humbling, I think it's important.
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:34.880]   I think one has to stay in touch.
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:36.800]   - Yeah, you and I are rich guys, we understand.
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:38.440]   You gotta stay in touch.
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:41.920]   - With only.
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:44.000]   - Audible.com.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.160]   Here's what you do, go to audible.com/twit2.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.000]   You get two choices.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.400]   Now you can, if you're really interested
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:50.960]   in political philosophy, there's two books.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:51.800]   - Uh-huh.
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:53.040]   - Right there that you could listen to,
[00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:55.520]   but if you love fiction, if you love nonfiction,
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:58.000]   we had Daniel Suarez on triangulation on Wednesday
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.560]   talking about his new book,
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:02.440]   it's Unaudible, Kill Decision, if you didn't see that.
[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:04.520]   - I love, I finally, I did actually,
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:05.400]   'cause everyone sent it to me,
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:06.760]   'cause you told him about the dynamical,
[00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:08.200]   like one of my favorite authors.
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:09.200]   You told him about the dynamical,
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:10.040]   and he liked it?
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:11.000]   - And you know the other thing is,
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.800]   he talked about his days,
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.440]   he said the best thing for being a writer,
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:15.640]   John, you'd be interested in this.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:19.240]   He ran D&D, he was a dungeon master,
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:20.880]   and they were like a decade.
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.880]   And he said, "I learned the art of storytelling
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:24.200]   as a dungeon master."
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:25.880]   - Is that awesome? - Is that awesome?
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:27.880]   - We should have a, you wanna do a show?
[00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:28.720]   - Yes. - Yes.
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:29.560]   - Are you kidding me?
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:30.400]   - Are you kidding me?
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.360]   - Oh, you'll be packing in with this one.
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:33.280]   - Everybody, don't do it.
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:34.280]   - I'm serious, I will do a paper.
[00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:35.020]   - Will we do that,
[00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:35.860]   - We'll do that,
[00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:36.680]   - In a paper show. - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:37.960]   - But I think we should do a D&D.
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:38.840]   You wanna do the dungeon master?
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:40.720]   - I know I can't be the master, but I'll play.
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:42.120]   - We gotta find somebody who's a good story.
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:42.960]   - Play a kickass, hey.
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:44.080]   - Wait a minute, Daniel Suarez.
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:45.920]   - Sure, you can be our D&D master.
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:53.200]   - Oh, you would be an awesome dungeon master.
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:56.800]   - Oh, I don't know, I'll have to practice up.
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:57.800]   All right, deal, deal.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:00.440]   - I'm serious, I will come out here to play D&D.
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:01.440]   - D&D, you will-- - Pen a paper though,
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:03.240]   none of this-- - Pen a paper, no, no, no, no.
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:08.240]   Suarez wrote a weather program for D&D.
[00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.840]   It was one of his first computer programs.
[00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:11.520]   - You know who I should pitch this to?
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:13.640]   - You know, I'm like really good friends with Ernest Cline,
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:16.840]   he would be amazing as the game master for that.
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:17.680]   - Deal.
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:18.920]   - All right, I'll talk to you about technical.
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:21.080]   - After the show, I'll talk to you about
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:22.920]   where we're gonna put this, 'cause I have an idea
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:23.760]   that I don't want it to be.
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:25.320]   - The end is near.
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:26.680]   - I have a very good idea.
[00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:28.880]   We always wanted to do poker, you remember that?
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:31.360]   We wanted to do, you know, instead of twit,
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:33.000]   which should have been a poker game.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.120]   And then we'd do the talking, but we'd also have
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.280]   a hand to play.
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:37.120]   - Something to do.
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:38.680]   - Something to do, this is so boring.
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:42.120]   So Starbucks and Square together,
[00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:43.360]   I think this is really interesting
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:45.680]   that you probably know more details about this.
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:48.320]   Is Starbucks gonna start having an iPad in every Starbucks?
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:49.160]   - No, they're not.
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.680]   - They're not gonna do the pay with Square thing.
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:53.480]   - No, they're gonna accept a Square as a payment type,
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:55.120]   but they won't actually have the device
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:56.440]   and the iPad and the Swiper there.
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:58.480]   - That's too bad, 'cause that is amazing
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:00.000]   friction-free experience.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.880]   - Tell me the whole thing, I don't know anything about it.
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:03.520]   - You pull up your pay with Square
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.720]   and you're checking out and you use that to check out.
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:06.640]   - They just don't have an iPad.
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:08.240]   - Is this an NFC deal?
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:11.480]   - No, it's, believe it or not, it's Wi-Fi.
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:12.560]   I think it's Wi-Fi.
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:13.400]   - It was a Bluetooth.
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:15.440]   - No, no, no, it just uses the internet.
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:16.440]   You don't have to be on Wi-Fi,
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:17.680]   it just goes out to your cell provider,
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:18.520]   tells it that you may be able to--
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:20.040]   - Okay, so it's using whatever internet access you have.
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:21.520]   - Oh, it goes with the phone company.
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:22.720]   - So here, I have it right here
[00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:23.800]   and I'll show you what it looks like.
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:26.880]   So you get a card case, they used to call it card case,
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:29.240]   now they call it pay with Square.
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:31.680]   And in your card case, you have tabs
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:34.760]   for everybody you do business with
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:36.880]   who supports this thing.
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:38.680]   - So it's kinda like when you walk into a bar
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:39.760]   and you say you wanna open a tab
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:40.920]   and you hand them a credit card,
[00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:42.400]   instead of this you just open your phone
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:44.400]   and you say I wanna open my tab at this bar,
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:46.960]   now you have an open tab at the bar.
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:49.960]   - So it gives you a directory of all the places
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:51.520]   that pay with Square.
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:53.720]   And here's our local one, Acre Coffee.
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:55.680]   Now I can look at my tabs,
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.920]   let me launch my tabs thing here, where is that?
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:01.440]   So we could tell it's been a while since I've used that.
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:04.120]   - And so this is easier than pulling out a credit card
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:05.000]   and throwing it at the guy?
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:05.840]   - Yes.
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:06.680]   - Well if you happen to count.
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:08.360]   - 'Cause as soon as you walk in,
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:10.000]   okay, so this is the cool thing.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:14.240]   As soon as you walk in, you show up on,
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:16.760]   there it is, you show up on their screen.
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:18.840]   They see that you've walked in, they say hi Leo.
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:20.320]   - So you just can't walk in without somebody
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:21.160]   saying hi Leo.
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:22.560]   - You can turn it off, but I leave it on.
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:23.440]   - Look at how happy she is.
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:24.800]   - She's happy to see me.
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:26.760]   - Oh would you like Leo?
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:29.440]   - By the way, if it were her, I probably--
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:30.600]   - Leo, what can I get you?
[00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:31.480]   - It's a new name.
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:32.320]   - Hi.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:33.320]   - Leo, why are you coming back so often?
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:34.440]   - Yeah.
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:36.800]   - How much of a tip is the fourth time today Leo?
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:38.320]   (laughing)
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:39.160]   - It really works well.
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:41.560]   And so all you do is you say, I don't know.
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:43.520]   - Well that's a loyalty program right there, Bam.
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:46.040]   - It's a big loyalty program, just having it.
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:46.960]   Really, just having it as well.
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:47.800]   - Think about that, man.
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:49.640]   How many people would offer you a loyalty program?
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:50.480]   But I can't be bothered.
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.640]   Everyone's always like, hey do you have a Ralph's car?
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:53.480]   - I always use my car.
[00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:54.320]   - I would eat those cars.
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:55.880]   - It's like screw that.
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:58.560]   I end up overpaying for everything because of it.
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:58:59.400]   - So when I go in--
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:01.120]   - You end up overpaying for everything.
[00:59:01.120 --> 00:59:01.960]   - You don't have your car.
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:02.800]   - Well 'cause I'm always on the road.
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:03.640]   - And it's always--
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:04.480]   - And it's always--
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:05.320]   - Exactly.
[00:59:05.320 --> 00:59:06.720]   - So you can have it set to auto open the tab
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:09.880]   whenever I'm nearby.
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:11.800]   It's using geofencing, he uses GPS,
[00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:13.200]   so it knows I'm nearby.
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:15.200]   I can see previous payments,
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:17.360]   so I can see everything I've bought
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:18.200]   talking to that nicely.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:20.400]   - So you're buying right into the cashless society
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:21.240]   that model.
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:22.080]   - This is awesome.
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:22.920]   - So everything can be tracked.
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:25.000]   - Everything you do will be noticed.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:25.840]   - Wait a minute.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:26.840]   - It'll go right to the insurance company saying,
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:29.680]   this Leo is going to be drinking too much coffee.
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:31.040]   Jack up is rate.
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:31.880]   - I don't know.
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:34.160]   I think that's a straw, straw daddy.
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:35.000]   - Straw what?
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:35.840]   - Straw daddy.
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:36.680]   - Straw daddy.
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:37.520]   - Straw daddy.
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:38.360]   - Straw daddy.
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:39.200]   What is it?
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:40.040]   It's a paper tiger.
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:41.320]   It's a straw dog.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:42.880]   - Yeah, you tell him to have insurance companies.
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:44.920]   - I don't think the insurance company's really--
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:45.760]   - No, he has his name.
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:46.760]   - What if he's drinking green tea
[00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:47.840]   and then your rates go down?
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:48.680]   - That's true.
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:49.520]   - My rate--
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:50.360]   - I think that could happen.
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:51.200]   - It's too complicated.
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:52.640]   - Green tea all the time.
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:53.960]   - Well, by then we'll have
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:55.560]   a single pair of insurance and that'll be--
[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:56.400]   - Tell you what though, man.
[00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:58.040]   It's like I'm kind of on JCD's side
[00:59:58.040 --> 00:59:58.960]   when it comes to cash.
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:00.760]   There's nothing like just cash money.
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:02.080]   - Cash money.
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.840]   - It's filthy.
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.360]   - That cash has so many germs on it.
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:07.200]   - Points of the war.
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.040]   - Do not touch that stuff.
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.280]   - We use the pennies anymore.
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.400]   We need to get rid of pennies.
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:11.600]   - What a stupid idea.
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.080]   In fact, the real problem with pennies--
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.880]   - I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what,
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:17.240]   I challenge each of you guys to walk around
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:20.440]   with $3,000 in 20s in your pocket
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:23.320]   and just check out how it feels.
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.480]   - You did that like the money--
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.120]   - You're rubbing the money on your chest.
[01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:28.400]   - I'm not gonna lie, it's kind of--
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:30.880]   - You wait a minute, you carry a money clip, don't you?
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.440]   You carry a roll.
[01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:33.320]   - Yeah, actual cash.
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:34.360]   - Do you have your roll with you?
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:35.600]   - It's over there, but I'll tell you what--
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.200]   - Hey, there it is, go get it guys.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.840]   - I'll go wait.
[01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:40.040]   I'll tell you what though,
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.280]   some of these international gigs,
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:44.320]   they don't, a lot of the performers don't trust wire transfers
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:46.440]   and so instead they'll actually pay with hundreds
[01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:50.160]   and then say you come back with like $7,000 stuff
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.000]   down your pants.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.800]   - I love Square, I think Square is huge.
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:56.280]   One of the concerns, and I'm wondering
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.600]   when you invested in them,
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:00.000]   don't you think something like Visa's
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.200]   just gonna come along and say thanks, nice job.
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:03.520]   Or Verifone, which is already--
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.480]   - Ronda just buying them, thanks, nice job.
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.520]   See you guys, we'll take it from here.
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.160]   - Yeah, I mean there's been a lot of competition.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:11.280]   If you take a look at Intuit and others,
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:14.520]   they've made small little credit cards swiping devices
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:16.920]   that connect to the mobile phones and, you know,
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:19.720]   it's, I think that Square is very competitive
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:20.560]   when it comes to rates,
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:22.480]   like the percentage that they actually take
[01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:23.880]   and as long as they remain that way,
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.560]   I think that they kind of have a leg up.
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.920]   They have the best interface by far.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.200]   - I think that's comes down to user,
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.400]   so that's what you've determined,
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.560]   it comes down to user interface.
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:34.080]   - Especially the tools that they provide for merchants.
[01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.320]   - Very elegant. - They're awesome.
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.160]   - Yeah, it's very elegant.
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.000]   - I love it. - I love it.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.200]   - When I sell stuff via Square,
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.720]   I get a receipt via email.
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.600]   You as the buyer get a map of where you bought it,
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.960]   you get all sorts of information that I think is very cool.
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:46.800]   - Yeah, that's cool.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.320]   - By the way, good news, you know when you die,
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.440]   Google's gonna pay off your wife.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.600]   - Wow. - I heard this.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:52.440]   - Hush money. - This is,
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:53.880]   she's over there. - 10 years or something like that.
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:55.040]   - What's the day, when's the date?
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:55.880]   Have you said a date?
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.080]   - The date lady's gonna die, are you sick?
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:00.480]   (laughing)
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.320]   - The wedding. - Oh, the wedding.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.320]   (laughing)
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:07.560]   - So it turns out, chief people officer at Google,
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:10.960]   Lazlo Block was being interviewed,
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:13.480]   and he said, this is in an interview
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.720]   with a Meghan Cassellie of Forbes magazine.
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.680]   This might sound ridiculous,
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:21.320]   but we've announced death benefits at Google.
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.880]   Apparently, they'll pay your salary,
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:28.640]   half your salary, for 10 years to a surviving spouse.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.040]   - That's pretty awesome. - That is awesome.
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.960]   - Yeah. - The spouse will see
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.560]   all stocks vested immediately.
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:37.120]   Any child will receive $1,000 a month from Google
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.200]   until they reach age 19 or 23.
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.800]   You should get pregnant immediately.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:42.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:44.640]   - She's on it, she's on it.
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:46.000]   She can't gee on it. - She's on it.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.440]   And the couch over there.
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:48.600]   Do you know what I know of that?
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.720]   - She said it. - Thumbs up.
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.440]   I'm not saying her name, 'cause I don't know,
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:53.280]   it's Summer Tomato.
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:55.880]   I don't know if it's private or not.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.400]   - Your name is out there everywhere.
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:58.400]   - It's Daria Pino.
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.760]   - I thought it was Summer Tomato.
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:00.600]   - Summertomato.com.
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:04.720]   - Give her a plug, summertomato.com, exactly.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.440]   So Summer Tomato is gonna get
[01:03:06.440 --> 01:03:09.760]   half of your pay for 10 years.
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:10.600]   All this stuff.
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:12.880]   Now, the funny thing is, I don't know
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:16.440]   if there's any benefit to Google, you're dead.
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.520]   - Oh, there's tremendous, I mean,
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.640]   the fact that we're talking about it is a benefit.
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:20.800]   - It makes you wanna work at Google.
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.040]   - But everyone wants to work at Google.
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.600]   - Everyone's doing, look at what Amazon did
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.600]   here just a couple weeks ago.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:26.800]   Did you read about this? - No.
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.760]   - So they offered, now they're offering to pay for your college,
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.840]   no matter what the degree is, if you're working at Amazon.
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:33.680]   - That's fantastic.
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:35.400]   - Most companies say like a half-speed degree
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.000]   in this field, you know what I mean?
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   They're saying like any degree,
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.240]   it doesn't matter if it benefits Amazon or not.
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.400]   It's awesome, I mean, I think more companies
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.240]   should do things like this.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:44.880]   - This is all turning into, it's headed right to where
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:45.960]   you can see where it's headed.
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:46.800]   - Welfare state.
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.000]   - Company Town. - Oh.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.480]   - That's gonna be the next thing Google does,
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.440]   that's my prediction.
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:51.560]   - You know who is doing that?
[01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:52.400]   - Company Town.
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:55.000]   - Shay of Zappos.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:55.760]   - Yeah, Tony, yeah.
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:59.280]   - Tony Shay has decided to buy downtown Las Vegas.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.800]   It's a whole downtown LV movement.
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:05.000]   They wanna make it a company town for Zappos.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.120]   And what they wanna do is bring in other startups,
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:10.520]   bring in, you know, hipster businesses.
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:11.520]   - Ooh, hipsters.
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:15.080]   - I think is it downtown LV?
[01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:16.240]   - This is what you got on today.
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.320]   - He's such a hipster.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.320]   Is it downtown LV?
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:19.160]   What is it?
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:20.000]   - I need to do a big mess.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.440]   - When you say company town, we all think of, you know,
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:24.440]   Shanty Towns where I pay my employees Brian Brown.
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:27.160]   - Oh, my soul to the company store.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:29.840]   - Right, but like what if everybody loves it
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.000]   and everyone else is jealous?
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:31.840]   - They always did it.
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:32.680]   - And they do.
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.600]   - And the company folds or they turn the screws
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.800]   on the poor employees and say,
[01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.080]   you know that free stuff we're giving you?
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:40.280]   It's gonna cost you a little money now.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:42.040]   You know, that's what happens.
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:42.880]   But it's fine.
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.280]   Everybody wants to do you.
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.600]   Knock yourself out.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:50.240]   - They are gonna remake downtown.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.840]   It's called the Downtown Project.
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:53.960]   I'm sorry, it's downtownproject.com.
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:54.960]   - In Las Vegas?
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:55.800]   - Yeah.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.120]   - The old where all the casinos are?
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:58.680]   - The dumpy, not the strip.
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:00.040]   - The downtown would have the--
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:00.880]   - It's a free one, it's a free one.
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:01.720]   - It's a free one, it's a free one.
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:02.560]   - Free one, where they got the strip.
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:04.480]   - Where the laser lights are.
[01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.320]   They're gonna have--
[01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:06.160]   - There's lasers everywhere.
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:08.160]   - I, that really narrows it down.
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.400]   - Where the lasers are, maybe.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:11.320]   - You know where the lights are right?
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:12.880]   That's downtown.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:13.720]   - So real quick.
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:17.080]   - So Zappos is allocated $350 million
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.480]   to revitalize downtown Vegas.
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:20.720]   100 million real estate.
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:22.120]   - This is not a residential area.
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:24.880]   - 100 million residential development.
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:26.640]   50 million in small businesses,
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:30.360]   50 million in education, 50 million in tech startups.
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:33.200]   I think this is really exciting.
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.880]   It's Tony, but it's effectively it's Amazon, right?
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:37.800]   I mean Tony's-- - No, it's Tony's money.
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.800]   - Yeah, apparently they--
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:41.600]   - That is, I think that is fascinating.
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.800]   So that's the new form of company town.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.120]   Do you think there's anything wrong with that, John?
[01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.240]   - Yeah, of course I do.
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.080]   - Really?
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:47.920]   - Yeah.
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:48.760]   - I think it's a future.
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:49.600]   - What are you not against?
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:50.440]   Are you against government?
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:51.280]   - You're against companies?
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.120]   - It's government because it was especially
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:55.240]   when a company becomes like a government.
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:56.080]   - What?
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.920]   - And these things have never worked out.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:00.320]   They just enslaved the labor.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:01.320]   - Slave.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.160]   - It's a form of enslavement.
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.000]   - I'm telling ya.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:04.840]   - I'm telling ya.
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.320]   - I'm living in the company town
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.000]   because it's a good deal.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:08.920]   - Yeah. - All right.
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:10.200]   - But you are-- - That's okay.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:13.200]   Why don't you just, you can do whatever you want.
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:14.040]   I don't care.
[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:16.000]   I can be a by myself with this thought.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.600]   I'm only basing this on what happened in the 30s
[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:21.120]   and then the depression era and even before then
[01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:22.320]   when they created these places.
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:23.160]   - The real world, the real world.
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:24.160]   - Or let's go back to the areas of--
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.760]   - Coal mines.
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.400]   - Oh my soul to the companies.
[01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.200]   - A lot of company towns around coal mines.
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.040]   - Wait, what?
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.240]   - Do you hate the fact that Google has free food?
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.600]   - 16 times.
[01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:34.880]   - I have to tell you what, everybody,
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:37.800]   I know this went to work for Google has gained 50 pounds.
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:38.640]   Minima!
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:39.480]   (laughing)
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:40.320]   - Look at Kevin!
[01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:41.160]   - He's beautiful.
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:42.000]   - He's a mother.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.080]   - Is there a thing?
[01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:43.920]   - She's beating him.
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:44.760]   - She's beating me.
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:46.160]   (laughing)
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:47.000]   - There's a thing called--
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.160]   - Some of it's a man I was feeding him.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:50.800]   - Now there's a thing called the Google 10
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:52.920]   that they talk about where you put on 10 pounds.
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:53.760]   - Immediately.
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:54.760]   - Ladies and gentlemen, I give you--
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:55.760]   - And by the way, the Tennessee--
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:56.600]   - Tennessee, where is he there?
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:57.440]   - Oh!

[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:45.320]   Put your Gmail results in your Google search.
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:47.440]   And people are upset about this.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:48.640]   I think this is great.
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.640]   - Well, here's the other--
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.520]   - I mean, I don't know, you've got,
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:54.640]   do you have the 4.1.1.1 Android--
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.360]   - One, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one,
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.200]   - I do.
[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.200]   - Yes, I have about it.
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.120]   - The butter, whatever it is.
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:04.280]   - When you got to Google now, it tells you all--
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:05.640]   - Don't you love Google now?
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.040]   - I actually do like it.
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:07.880]   - I was scared about it.
[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:10.760]   - I know it's onerous, it's onerous, but I like it.
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:12.360]   It knows that I'm an Oakland A's fan,
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:13.200]   it gives me the score.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:15.800]   It also knows I'm a Giants fan, it gives me the score.
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.760]   It tells me how far away I am from home,
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.560]   and then if I do a search on the machine
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:22.040]   and go back to my phone, and I want to go to this place,
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.040]   it says, "Look, we got it already set up,
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.240]   "just hit the button, and I'm on my way."
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:26.600]   - It's the company town phone.
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:27.440]   - Who are you?
[01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:28.280]   - It sounds totally company town.
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:29.120]   - Who are you?
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:31.720]   - This is, you just did a freaking Frankenstein change.
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:33.400]   - What's going on?
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:35.200]   - It was like, oh, this is what I have.
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.040]   - I got everything wrong.
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.040]   Wake up, sheeple.
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.560]   I love Google now.
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:39.760]   What is this?
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:41.160]   - Yup, you got it.
[01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:44.360]   A foolish consistency is the hop governor,
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:46.240]   a small mind-oriented Emerson.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.760]   (laughing)
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.920]   - So I searched for John C. Devorek on Google,
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:51.800]   and then I'm mixed in with my,
[01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:53.560]   actually I'm really starting to like this,
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:55.720]   mixed in, and I was a little skeptical at first,
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:57.680]   but with the regular search results in the middle,
[01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:58.960]   I have the knowledge graph,
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:01.600]   which is right now it's Google+, profile,
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:02.760]   plus Wikipedia.
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:04.640]   Other people, by the way, who show up,
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.200]   Adam Curry, Leo Laport, Patrick Norton,
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.160]   Kevin Rosen, Brian Brushwood.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:11.040]   - Those are fine, fine individuals.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:11.880]   - Isn't that great?
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:13.360]   That's the people I should be, is he just--
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:14.560]   - It's kind of scary that it just pulled out
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.400]   the podcast for today's show.
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:17.240]   - The people on this show.
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:21.160]   - And then, but notice that we book everyone from now on.
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:22.720]   - Yeah, that's how we do it, Chad.
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:24.360]   Just search for him and see who else shows up,
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:26.920]   and then the Gmail results.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.480]   Now it doesn't do all the Gmail results.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:31.520]   If I search on Gmail, I'll get far more hits,
[01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:33.560]   but I think that's kind of an interesting--
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:34.840]   - It's very interesting.
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:36.720]   It's dangerous, but interesting.
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.960]   - I don't know, I mean, I understand people are concerned,
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.560]   but it's not like they don't already know that.
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:43.560]   - This is all over an encrypted connection.
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.560]   It's the same data as a new company.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:46.720]   They're just splicing it together.
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:48.720]   - Yeah, they're sending half of it to the NSA,
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.480]   half of it to the CIA, and--
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:51.480]   - We'll think it's that one.
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:53.200]   - We'll see it into your search results, though.
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:55.200]   - Yeah, they might as well give it to you too.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:58.360]   (laughing)
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.640]   - Let's talk about Apple.
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:02.040]   Okay.
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:02.880]   - Let's talk about Apple.
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.040]   Let's talk about Samsung.
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:06.520]   First of all, there is an Apple Google connection.
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:07.880]   There are three Google things,
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:09.600]   Googly things on the iPhone,
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.320]   two of which are gonna be gone soon.
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:13.760]   One is Apple is replacing Google Maps
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.000]   with its own iOS 6-map.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:15.840]   - Mistake.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.240]   - YouTube, the app is gone,
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:19.240]   although I'm sure Google will offer its own better--
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:21.120]   - Yeah, that's better for the consumers.
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:24.640]   - But even then, well, we may talk about this later.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:25.680]   You wanna talk about it now?
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:26.920]   - Go ahead, let's talk about it now.
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:28.920]   - Well, I mean, the thing I like about the YouTube app
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:31.280]   going away is that as a content producer,
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:33.440]   it means that we could finally monetize mobile views,
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.080]   which you couldn't do, 'cause Apple made that.
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.160]   - You couldn't put any ads on it.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.360]   - And plus, there was tons of stuff,
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.400]   like I've got content on my personal channel,
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:41.960]   I'll add popular music to different things.
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:45.400]   And then one of the crazy things everyone asked about
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:46.440]   was how do you do your hair?
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:48.280]   And I just forward them to link to how I do my stuff.
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:49.840]   - By the way, what happened to your hair?
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:51.080]   - I'm in the hair.
[01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:51.920]   - I'm rocking.
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:54.080]   - It used to have the straight up of this spiky hair now,
[01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:56.120]   and I'll make fun of you when you're a flatter.
[01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:56.960]   - They're still producting it.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:59.320]   - It looks like a hipster now.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:00.880]   It must have shadush bag must have shadush.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:02.040]   - You used bedhead, what do you use,
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:03.360]   'cause I'm trying to get the video.
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.280]   - I used these, I would for you the video.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:06.360]   - Oh, so I sent me the video?
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:10.680]   - Actually, type in crazy video game hair, nine minutes.
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:12.320]   And this is a video where it's like a walk through
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:13.840]   of me doing the craziest five minutes.
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:14.680]   - Do you actually take, do your hair?
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:16.000]   - It actually takes even less now.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:19.600]   But, like, obviously, I would just forward people
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:21.720]   this video right here, but it won't play
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:22.640]   on their mobile devices.
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.400]   And so finally, because they can monetize, by the way,
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:25.320]   that's-- - They won't play at all.
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:26.480]   - That's a nice white fro, right there.
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:27.960]   - That's an amazing haircut right there.
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:29.400]   - That's right.
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:30.240]   - Wow, I like it.
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.800]   - But because it's playing some music by Jason Forrest here,
[01:11:32.800 --> 01:11:35.480]   it won't play on your mobile device,
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:37.520]   but it's just-- - Because Jason can't monetize it,
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:40.640]   so they decided, okay, it's content ID that
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:41.520]   we're just gonna block it.
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:42.360]   - Correct, correct.
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:44.000]   - The other thing that says, "cannot play on mobile devices,"
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.200]   but then you see here-- - Why don't you shake your head?
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.400]   There was a head band. - I was, it's part of the technique.
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:52.200]   - It's not so, you know, the first guy who taught me
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:54.480]   the product of my hair was this cat right here.
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.040]   - This cat? - This cat right here.
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.120]   This hipster right here.
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:58.960]   - No. - I remember before a show,
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:00.040]   you went-- - He told you how
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.360]   to cut your hair or shave away.
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:03.200]   - No, he went into the, don't you remember this?
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:06.840]   You would go in, you and Dan Huard would go in
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.800]   to the makeup room and you'd do your hair
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:09.800]   before the show. - Before the show.
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:11.160]   - Yeah, of course. - No, she's supposed to.
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.480]   - You had a hair person do your hair.
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:13.840]   - Yeah, you had a makeup person.
[01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:15.840]   Full time? - We had to do it ourselves.
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.520]   - The old-fashioned way. - No, they put,
[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:19.680]   they had this stuff and then, and then,
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:22.320]   but the way you did it was odd because I would comb my hair.
[01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:23.640]   - Right, and you'd make it all nice.
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:24.640]   - I'd do a part. - And we'd mess ours up.
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:27.320]   - And you would actually intentionally kind of make it messy
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:28.560]   and then glue it that way.
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.240]   - It was to look. - So there was one--
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.560]   - There was one-- - So you went,
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:32.400]   and you went to messy?
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.240]   I'd ever saw that. - That's right,
[01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:34.840]   you did it one time. - There was one screensaver's way.
[01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:36.480]   I said, "Kevin, show me how to do it."
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:41.480]   - That's right. - Didn't work. - No, I can't see.
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:42.480]   - You need this video. - By the way, I'm almost done.
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:43.480]   He goes to eight minutes and then there's, did it do it?
[01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:46.520]   - It looks sharp. - There is actually on the wall,
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.160]   taped to our wall here, a spike.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:50.120]   - Occasionally there-- - Lost it in a battle.
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:51.800]   - Yeah, he lost one. - I noticed one time he came in
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:54.680]   and he had a moth stuck onto one of the spikes.
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:55.680]   - That sounds right. - Right now, he's got--
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:57.800]   - And pale this flappin'. - You should see it.
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:59.720]   - When he's saving his expensive seats
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:01.520]   for once he gets his sons. - That's how he spends his seats.
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:03.080]   (laughing)
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:04.920]   - Can we talk about something besides my hair?
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:08.840]   - Yeah. So do you think Apple will remove Google Search
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:12.000]   from iOS 6? That's the last--
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.080]   - If I was Apple, I would. - I don't think so.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:16.440]   - I think it's a mistake. - It must make a money.
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:18.600]   - Who do you put in there, Bing? - Yeah, Bing.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:21.160]   - Oh God. That's depressing.
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:22.800]   Are you rebooting did Windows crash on you?
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:25.000]   - Maybe, a little bit. (laughing)
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.600]   Just go about your business.
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:27.880]   There's nothing to see here.
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:31.560]   That is a big laugh. - He's sitting here
[01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.920]   with his finger on the other side of the street.
[01:13:33.920 --> 01:13:35.680]   (groaning)
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:37.240]   - How does Windows crash these days?
[01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:38.560]   It doesn't crash anymore. - It doesn't crash anymore.
[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:39.960]   - I don't know what it is.
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.480]   This thing takes a lot of physical abuse.
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:42.840]   I don't know if it's a hardware problem.
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:43.840]   - It's a hardware problem, sure.
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.960]   - Sure. (laughing)
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:47.160]   - That's the ticket.
[01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:49.720]   You can make that check out to be our IAM.
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:54.200]   - So Apple Design expert says Samsung is a copycat.
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:55.720]   - Oh, really?
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:57.600]   - So there's dueling tumblogs, you know.
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:01.480]   Apple copies Samsung.com and Samsung copies Apple.com
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:05.120]   which apparently seems that every company copies
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:05.960]   every other company.
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:06.800]   Did you know that?
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.680]   - I've heard that.
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:09.520]   - What do you say?
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:12.600]   I would like to get kind of, you're the voice of sanity.
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:13.440]   - I am.
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:14.720]   - John C. Dvorak.
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:16.560]   I would like to get your take on this
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.960]   'cause I think on the one hand you could say,
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:19.360]   "Hey, Apple has the right to protect
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:20.800]   "it's intellectual property."
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:23.160]   But isn't it the case in technology?
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:24.560]   And you've been an expert witness now.
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:25.640]   - Well, absolutely. - I'll pretend
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:28.040]   I'm the attorney for the case here.
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:30.000]   Isn't it the case, Mr. Dvorak,
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.680]   that all technology companies have built upon
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:34.840]   the developments of other companies?
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.720]   - To be the attorney actually, to be honest about
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:37.560]   the first thing they say,
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:38.640]   "Do you really know what you're talking about?
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:39.560]   "What school did you go to?"
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:40.400]   - Do they really?
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:41.480]   - Hours and hours of this.
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:42.320]   - You're kidding.
[01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:43.160]   - To rack up the bill on the other guy.
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:44.160]   - Oh, that sucks.
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.600]   - Anyway, I just mentioned that.
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.720]   But it's good for me, I get the charge more.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:48.560]   - You don't care.
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:49.400]   - Not it's not that bad.
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:51.040]   - Sure, I can talk slow.
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:53.000]   Yes, this is the way it's always been done.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.840]   In fact, I think the whole patent system
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:55.720]   needs to be over-hulled.
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:58.000]   - Well, that's the right answer, obviously.
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:02.040]   But it does feel like Apple is saying on the one hand,
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:04.200]   you copied swipe to unlock,
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.920]   and you copied tap to click.
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:07.320]   - It's actually slightly different.
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:10.120]   - And especially the glowing button that--
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:12.520]   - But yeah, I mean, if you look at notifications in iOS,
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:14.320]   that's directly ripped off from Android.
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:15.840]   There's just no question in my mind.
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:17.520]   Is Apple saying, "Well, you're open source,
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:19.520]   "so we can copy you, but you can't copy us?"
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:20.400]   Is that?
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.040]   - I don't know.
[01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:23.520]   I think they're all douchebags.
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:27.040]   - That's the right answer.
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:30.280]   I just...
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:32.000]   - Did you guys see that Conan O'Brien video?
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.240]   - Yes, that's actually pretty funny.
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:35.880]   I think I played it last week, didn't I?
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:37.080]   Or did I play it on the last Twitter?
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.800]   Did I play it on Twig or something?
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:39.640]   - Back really quickly.
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:41.360]   - Okay, well, let me play it again then.
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:44.400]   Actually, while I'm getting that ready,
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:46.760]   why don't we take a look at what's coming up
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:47.600]   in the week ahead.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:49.320]   Tom Merritt in our TNT newsroom.
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:50.840]   - He's over there waiting.
[01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:51.680]   - Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:52.640]   Here's a look at some of the stories
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:55.160]   we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead on Tech News today.
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:56.520]   Everyone's on vacation,
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:57.840]   so there's not that much going on.
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:01.680]   Wednesday, August 15th, Gamescom kicks off in Cologne, Germany.
[01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:03.320]   There's gonna be a lot of sneak peaks at Games,
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.840]   things like World of Warcraft,
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:05.840]   Mist of Pandaria.
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.080]   Thursday, August 16th,
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:09.600]   Happy Birthday Internet Explorer.
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:12.800]   Friday, August 17th, Gadget, GDGT.com
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:14.280]   has a live event in Seattle.
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:16.120]   And also, Friday, August 17th,
[01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:18.360]   the CD turns 30 years old.
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:19.200]   - Wow.
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.640]   - That's a look at some of the things we'll be talking about
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:22.040]   in the week ahead on Tech News today.
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:23.920]   Maybe there'll be a Kindle announcement or something.
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:24.760]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:26.200]   - That's kind of hard to believe
[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:28.640]   that the CD's 30 years old.
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:29.520]   - And still around.
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.120]   - Do you remember your first CD, John?
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:33.280]   - I remember the weirdest thing I do, actually.
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.120]   - I told you.
[01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.000]   - But I remember one day,
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   'cause I used to chop a tower of records for records,
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.520]   and then one day I walked in,
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:42.840]   and it wasn't a, just overnight.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:43.920]   It was like you go, what?
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:44.920]   - It took all the records, yeah.
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:45.760]   - It took all the records, yeah.
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:47.640]   - It wasn't one record in the entire place.
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:49.160]   It was all CD just over now.
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:50.080]   - Have you been to Tower Records lately?
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:51.080]   - Now it's broke.
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:51.920]   - 'Cause it's dry cleaners.
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:54.480]   - Yes, actually it's the one in San Francisco, isn't it?
[01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:55.320]   - It's just going to cleaners.
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:57.000]   - A green dry cleaner.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:57.840]   - Yes.
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:58.760]   - You realize this is like confession time.
[01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:00.000]   You have to say what your first CD is.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.160]   - First CD, I can't remember.
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:03.000]   It was like, I can't remember what it is.
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.920]   - I remember my first CD about in 1984.
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:05.760]   - Which was?
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:06.600]   - What?
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:10.000]   - It was Avalon by Roxy Music.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:10.840]   - Oh yeah.
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:12.200]   - And the reason I bought it is
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.560]   'cause I asked a friend of mine who was hip, who was with it.
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:16.440]   I said I want to buy, I got a CD player,
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:19.280]   I want to buy a CD, what would be good to show off
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.200]   the new stereo?
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:21.720]   And they said Avalon, actually it was still
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:22.640]   one of my favorite records.
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:23.480]   What was your first CD?
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:25.720]   - I got a TurboGrafx CD attachment
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:27.600]   to my TurboGrafx 16 for Christmas
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:29.840]   and so I figured, oh I can play CDs now.
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:30.680]   So I bought--
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:31.520]   - Wait, was that a Sega?
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:32.520]   - No, no, no, it's TurboGrafx.
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:34.080]   It was a competitor to the Genesis.
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:34.920]   - Okay.
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:37.200]   - And so I got sex packets by Digital Underground,
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:38.200]   the Humpty Dance.
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:39.040]   - You remember that?
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:41.080]   - No.
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:41.920]   - No, I don't either.
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.080]   - You never heard of it.
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:43.920]   - You remember your first CD?
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:44.760]   - Yeah, MC Hammer.
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:45.600]   - MC Hammer.
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:46.440]   - Yeah, same size.
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:47.280]   - Yeah, that was my first CD.
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:48.280]   - Yeah, you did, yeah.
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:49.120]   - You did.
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:49.960]   - And now your buddies.
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:50.800]   - I told them that actually.
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:51.640]   - Oh yeah.
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:53.400]   - I told them, I'm like, you were my first CD?
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:55.240]   He's like, cool, I'm like, oh, thanks for saying it.
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:17:57.080]   - It's like translation, I'm old.
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.800]   - You know the most impressive thing I ever saw,
[01:17:58.800 --> 01:17:59.640]   that was that picture.
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:01.120]   I don't know, this might be "Pimpath" again.
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:02.600]   I don't know if I can say this.
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:04.520]   - That picture of you--
[01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:05.360]   - Oh, you've been facing--
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.240]   - Picture of you with Jack White.
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:08.080]   - Yeah, that was great.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:08.920]   - That was awesome.
[01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:09.760]   - That was crazy.
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:10.600]   - The White Stripes.
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:11.880]   - So I was in London randomly
[01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:13.040]   and I just went to this brand--
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:13.880]   - Randomly, who's--
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:14.720]   - Who's woke up in London?
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:18.120]   - Hey, I'm floating around and now I'm in London.
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:20.680]   - The convention, the camera randomly.
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:22.040]   - Talking to the conference.
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:23.040]   (laughing)
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:24.640]   - It was randomly talking to you in a conference.
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:25.480]   - It was a little wet.
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:26.320]   - Yeah, okay.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:27.160]   - They're London congress.
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:30.840]   I randomly was there and no, I went to this bar
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:33.760]   and I was with Kevin's sister from Instagram
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:35.600]   and he was like, hey, I know this model.
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:36.600]   I don't know why I'm telling this.
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:37.840]   (laughing)
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:39.240]   - You like, bro, you're a sh*t digging hole.
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:40.400]   - Let's go out to this bar.
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:41.760]   - Gary's sitting right over here, I know,
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:42.600]   I know, I know, it reminds me.
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:43.720]   - It's all good.
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:45.480]   - It was Kevin, it was all Kevin.
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:46.320]   - It was exactly.
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.160]   - It wasn't you.
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:48.680]   - It turned out to meet up with the supermodel
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:50.720]   and she's sitting there with two other people
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:52.160]   or three other people.
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:54.400]   And I'm like, that guy looks familiar.
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:56.000]   And it's freaking Jack White.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.520]   And I was like, holy sh*t.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:58.520]   - He's a god.
[01:18:58.520 --> 01:18:59.360]   - Yeah, I know.
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.400]   And so I bought him some scotch
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:02.520]   and we ended up getting hammered.
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:03.920]   I had a flight at 7 a.m. the next morning.
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:06.520]   I'm like, okay, do I go home at midnight
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:08.480]   or do I get him Jack White?
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:11.960]   - This is like that get him to the Greek.
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.760]   - Get him to the Greek.
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:15.920]   - How do you explain to someone like Jack White
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:18.120]   that you heard of the universe?
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:19.120]   - Kevin was.
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:20.800]   - No, he was a dig fan.
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:21.640]   - Really?
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:22.480]   - Yes.
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:23.560]   - He had heard a dig, but he didn't know like,
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:25.320]   he was all in a game.
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:26.320]   - You wanna pull a skate?
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:27.520]   - He didn't even carry a cell phone.
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:29.040]   He's like, I don't believe in cell phones.
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:30.320]   I'm not in his manager head.
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:31.640]   - See, that's the way all these celebrities are.
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:33.280]   If you wanna impress a celebrity,
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:34.920]   name a website they've heard of
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:36.320]   and be like, that was me.
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:37.160]   - Yeah, that's true.
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:38.440]   They've heard of Instagram.
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:39.280]   It's me.
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:40.120]   - How's he gonna know they're different?
[01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:40.960]   - You know what Instagram was?
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:43.600]   - Because the founder of Instagram was sitting next to me.
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:44.440]   - Yeah, Jack.
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:47.280]   - Oh, I mean, you're gonna be in the comments problem.
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:51.280]   - That would have made it even better if you'd say Instagram.
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:52.120]   You know what that is?
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:52.960]   - That was my advantage.
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:53.800]   - That's right.
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:55.360]   - And Kevin's system's going, what?
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:56.200]   - What?
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:57.040]   - Yeah.
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:57.880]   - All right, here you go.
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:00.720]   Conan and Brian, I think this does actually,
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:03.440]   it argues in apples.
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:04.440]   - It's a slow burn, but it gets better than you.
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:05.640]   - It argues in apples favor.
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:06.480]   Here you go.
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:12.960]   - Apple is claiming that Samsung copied iPhone technology
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:14.880]   to market its own products.
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:17.040]   While Samsung's Vice President of Electronics
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:21.440]   has already released a video that's defending his company,
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:23.560]   it's a video message defending Samsung.
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:24.400]   Let's take a look.
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:27.200]   - Hello.
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:30.440]   Apples claim that Samsung has copied their technology.
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:33.160]   It's an allegation we're vigorously denying.
[01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:35.480]   Since we entered the personal electronics space,
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:38.400]   Samsung has created products that as you can see,
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.640]   bear no similarity to Apple.
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:44.200]   Notice the greater edge of our Galaxy phone.
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:46.400]   And what about our Galaxy tablets?
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:47.520]   - I'm not even close.
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:51.960]   - It's not just electronics.
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:55.760]   Samsung's originality is also on display in our home appliances,
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:57.760]   whether it's our new Mackerelade oven,
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:01.160]   our VAC Pro vacuum cleaner,
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:04.160]   or I washer with sprawl wheel control.
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:07.720]   They come to our retail stores,
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:09.600]   where you can talk more about our products
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:11.240]   with a Samsung smart guy.
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.720]   (laughing)
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:15.440]   - A lot of people ask, how does Samsung stay so--
[01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:16.440]   - Three imagination.
[01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:17.440]   - So innovative.
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:18.360]   It's very simple really.
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:22.080]   We stay through to the vision of Samsung founder,
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:23.400]   Stefan Jobe's.
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.360]   (laughing)
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:28.080]   - Of course, it's Steve Jobs with a little one here.
[01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:28.960]   - That's amazing.
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:31.400]   - You know, I think if they could show that in court,
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:33.120]   case closed, right?
[01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:34.520]   But it is more complicated than that.
[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:37.120]   I mean, Apple copies, everybody copies.
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:38.920]   We're all, it's all in sem--
[01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:39.760]   - Everybody's in seminary.
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:40.800]   - It goes anywhere.
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:43.360]   Besides that, not as though anyone starving to death
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.240]   in the process.
[01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:47.880]   - Well, you know who's not, is the lawyers, of course.
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:49.360]   That trial will continue on.
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:51.840]   Let's talk about app.net.
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.520]   Don Caldwell, you must know Dalton.
[01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:57.200]   He started I-Meeam, very, very successful.
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:58.280]   Sold it, who bought I-Meeam?
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:21:59.120]   - AOL?
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:21:59.960]   - My space.
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:00.800]   - My space.
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.400]   I knew somebody hip and with it.
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:03.320]   (laughing)
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:05.480]   And then he took some of that money,
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:06.760]   put it into something called pick please,
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:07.840]   which was very cool.
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:10.560]   In fact, it was before Instagram, there was pick please.
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:13.120]   Unfortunately, Instagram came out shortly thereafter
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:14.440]   and just knocked it out of the park
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:15.760]   with beautiful user interface.
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:19.200]   And pick please and end up folding.
[01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:21.240]   He took some of that money and put it to app.net,
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:26.240]   which was a marketing tool for app developers, I guess.
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:30.280]   And he's pivoted app.net.
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:33.840]   And this came out after two very controversial postings,
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:35.520]   Dalton put on his blog.
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:36.760]   The first one talking about,
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:38.720]   I'm gonna be curious about your take on this, Kevin,
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:40.640]   going to Facebook and essentially being threatened
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:45.080]   by Facebook saying, yeah, we are either gonna acquire you
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:46.760]   or we're gonna bury you.
[01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:47.840]   You got the choice.
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:49.080]   - I like that style.
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:50.080]   (laughing)
[01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:51.960]   - I don't even know you anymore.
[01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:53.200]   What is this?
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.120]   - Well, that's what Dalton said.
[01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:56.320]   He said, Mark, what's the story?
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:57.680]   This is not the company you started.
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:22:59.160]   This is not what you want, is it?
[01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:00.240]   That was very controversial.
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:02.280]   Then he wrote an article about Twitter,
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:07.280]   saying they're poor stewards of what really should be
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:11.920]   almost a public utility, that Twitter made a choice
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:14.160]   early on, and this is, I guess, fairly well known
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:17.160]   in the Silicon Valley lore or San Francisco Valley lore
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:19.920]   that Twitter had to decide at some point
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:23.000]   whether to support a third party ecosystem
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.280]   and become kind of the internet dial tone
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:27.520]   or to become an ad supported property.
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:30.080]   And when they decided to become an ad supported property,
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:33.200]   inevitably what followed was you cut off the third parties,
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:36.040]   you need to drive people to your apps to see your ads.
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:37.560]   - Screw the little man.
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:40.120]   - Well, unfortunately, the Twitter was built on
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:42.880]   these third party apps, that's what put Twitter on the map.
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:44.640]   And so there's a lot of third party developers
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:47.200]   very upset, including Dalton with Twitter.
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:49.960]   So he said, well, I wanna do, of course,
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:51.280]   this is the common wisdom.
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:53.400]   If you're not paying for something,
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:54.800]   then you are the product.
[01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:56.120]   You're the product on Facebook,
[01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:57.680]   you're the product on Twitter,
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:23:59.200]   the ads are what makes the money,
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.280]   you're the product on Twitter.
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:01.760]   I mean, you're not paying for Twitter,
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:05.120]   we show you ads, that's how we make our money.
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:07.280]   He said, but something like Twitter's too important
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:09.760]   to let it be owned by a single company.
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:11.920]   He's created something called app.net,
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:15.120]   which is a, he wants to make a paid Twitter service
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:16.480]   with an open API.
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:17.800]   In other words, take the other fork
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:20.080]   in the road that Twitter avoided.
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:23.360]   And he's raised $579,000.
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:25.000]   - There's something in here I've noticed
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000]   looking at his page, it should be noted.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.040]   - Don't have the scoble, your buddy,
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:32.080]   quote anything for you.
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:33.600]   He says, he's got a quote here,
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:35.280]   words about app.net.
[01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:40.280]   Dalton Caldwell's learnings from failure are awesome.
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:45.560]   And he inspired me his failure, apparently,
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:47.480]   inspired me to support his new idea.
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:49.000]   - I disagree with this, I think.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.360]   - That's a terrible quote.
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:51.520]   - No, there is no--
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:55.000]   - You're such a loser that I've given you some money.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000]   - There is no success without failure.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.760]   The best you can do is fail for this in a quote?
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:01.520]   - Yes, no. - No, what do I mean?
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:04.480]   - There's no, this is a negative way of doing things.
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:06.440]   - So it's very bare bones right now.
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:09.880]   I'm on app.net, it's early alpha stages.
[01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:11.480]   - Everyone has to pay.
[01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:12.880]   - Yeah. - That's his idea.
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:14.640]   - But we don't know how much he hasn't said.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:15.760]   - Well, no, we don't know.
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:16.600]   - Well, that's what he said.
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:18.320]   - That's what he's asking for now.
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:20.520]   I gave him 100 bucks to be a developer.
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:23.160]   So with 100 bucks, you get access
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:24.760]   to additional developer tools.
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:26.480]   - And we put a dead pool in right now.
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:27.320]   - Well, that's the question.
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:28.920]   It really feels like it's gonna be dead.
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:31.680]   And yet I really think we do need an open Twitter.
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:34.120]   - I think we do too, but I'll put money down.
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:35.040]   - It's hopeless, isn't it?
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:36.280]   - Yeah, of course.
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:37.480]   - 'Cause Twitter's so good, it works.
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:38.960]   - No, why can't you do some Facebook?
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:40.360]   - Facebook people love it.
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:42.080]   - Why can't they do-- - I refuse to use Facebook.
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:42.920]   - You know what, that's interesting
[01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:44.960]   'cause every time they do studies,
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:46.320]   people who use Facebook hate it.
[01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:47.680]   Doesn't mean they don't use it.
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:50.000]   But nobody loves Facebook.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.160]   But everybody wants what Facebook gives you,
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:52.960]   that connection.
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:54.760]   - So I think that he's doing a great thing
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:56.240]   for developers here with this idea.
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:57.080]   No doubt about that.
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:57.920]   - It's a great API.
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:59.440]   - It's a great API, it's a great idea
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:01.520]   for developers who have been burnt by Twitter.
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:06.520]   For consumers, I don't know that we feel that Twitter is just,
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:08.400]   like I've never gone to Twitter and thought like,
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:10.960]   oh my God, so many ads on here, I just can't take it.
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:13.160]   Like I think they do a pretty good job
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:16.480]   at keeping them lightweight and not, you know,
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:17.920]   really serious. - But Marty's solving
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:21.440]   a problem that exists, but nobody knows it exists.
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:22.880]   Perhaps, is that, you think?
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:24.480]   - Well, I mean, from a consumer perspective,
[01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:26.320]   is it a problem then at that point?
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:27.160]   - No.
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:29.360]   - Well, a lot of people are using this for brand building too.
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:31.240]   They're using it like celebrities come on board,
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:32.480]   sports figures, you name it.
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:35.280]   They like the fact that they have three million plus followers.
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:36.960]   Like they're not gonna use this
[01:26:36.960 --> 01:26:40.000]   if they only have, you know, 10,000 paid followers
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.400]   or 50,000 paid followers.
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:42.240]   - Right.
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:45.440]   - I just, I don't know if, app.net will fix it or not,
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:48.280]   but one of the other articles that we were talking about
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:50.360]   talking about tonight is the underground trade
[01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:51.440]   of Twitter followers.
[01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:52.480]   And I actually went on--
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:54.400]   - And when you say paid followers,
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:55.560]   it really is paid. - It is paid.
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:57.640]   - Well, I'll tell you, like, and it's astonishing
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:26:58.640]   how cheap it is.
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:26:59.680]   Like, I'm not gonna lie.
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:00.720]   Like, I'm a little embarrassed
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:01.800]   of my Twitter follower account
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:03.680]   and pardon me, wants to spend $18
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:06.240]   to get 40,000 more followers on there.
[01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:08.560]   - So Barracuda Labs. - It's a Barracuda, of course,
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:12.480]   is it appliance the businesses use to protect them?
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:14.080]   They did a research study,
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:17.200]   Jason Ding, research scientist at Barracuda Labs,
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:19.320]   set up a team of three Twitter accounts
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:24.080]   and purchased between 20,000 purchased
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:28.480]   between 20,000 and 70,000 Twitter followers from eBay.
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:30.280]   - Okay, so here I just went to eBay
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:32.280]   and I typed in Twitter followers.
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:34.600]   And at the top, you got 30,000 Twitter followers
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:36.920]   within 96 hours, no admin access--
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.600]   - And this actually works, by the way.
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:43.600]   - 20,000 followers for $15, 100,000 followers for $80.
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:46.320]   It's like, come on, man, it's like, let's just do this.
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:48.480]   - Buy it now. - Buy it now, now.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:49.920]   Buy it now. - Make you wonder.
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:51.640]   - Buy it, buy it, buy it, come on,
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:53.960]   look at these, they-- - Stop it.
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:56.960]   - They all promise they get money back guarantees.
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:27:58.200]   - How does this work, first of all?
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:27:59.480]   How do these companies get that?
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:02.840]   - There's a million Chinese in that have joined Twitter
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:04.240]   and they're all part of the scam.
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:05.080]   - Well, I'll tell you,
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:07.280]   it's probably all robot controlled open accounts.
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:09.720]   And what's funny is they actually mention specifically
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:12.400]   like no eggs, like none of them with the egg,
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.160]   they all have individual fake pictures.
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:15.000]   - That's important.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:15.840]   - And then they also, you know,
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:17.680]   some of them are like eggs. - No eggs.
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:19.040]   - Yeah, exactly. - I love it.
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:21.160]   Some of them talk about like, you know,
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:24.600]   tweeting sense, you know, what, like Jews or whatever.
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:25.840]   - This is the interesting thing.
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:28.200]   When they look at these followers that they bought,
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:32.920]   most of them don't have many tweets, they don't have many.
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:33.760]   - There's a fan count.
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:35.880]   - And they're just doing it for the number.
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:38.800]   - 61% of the fake accounts were less than three months old.
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:40.880]   The average age, 19 weeks,
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:43.640]   55% have fewer than 2,000 followers.
[01:28:43.640 --> 01:28:44.880]   - Is that a picture of Romney?
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:45.840]   Is he one of the boys? - Yeah, yeah.
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:47.360]   Apparently 10% of the accounts.
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:49.240]   - This is an interesting account graphic.
[01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:51.160]   - Yeah, number of Mitt Romney's Twitter followers
[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:55.160]   went up 17% in just one day on July 21st, 2012.
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.880]   And it's unfairly picking on Romney
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:58.160]   'cause there's other reasons
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:00.600]   where it's like you just need to boost your own credibility.
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:02.320]   I won't say who he is, but a friend of mine
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:04.240]   is developing a television property.
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:06.800]   And apparently it was a thing in one of the meetings
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:08.560]   that it came up, he just hadn't been playing
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:09.680]   the social media game.
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:11.600]   Super great on camera.
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:13.440]   This guy's gonna have a dynamite show.
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:14.800]   When you see it, you're gonna have no way.
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:16.040]   - Come on. - And I'm not gonna tell you.
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:17.040]   - What difference does it make?
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:18.240]   - This is first name.
[01:29:18.240 --> 01:29:19.080]   - Yeah, this is first name.
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:19.920]   - This is the Peritunde.
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:20.920]   - It's Kevin.
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:23.080]   Kevin, it's not Kevin, it's bull crap.
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:24.840]   But the important thing is they were all like,
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:26.120]   "Well, we're just really concerned
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:27.760]   'cause you only have 800 followers on Twitter."
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:29.360]   He's like, "Yeah, I don't do the Twitter thing."
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:30.680]   And they're like, "Yeah."
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:32.360]   And all of a sudden he has a profit motive
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:34.920]   where it's like, "Well, crap man, I'll spend $500 in my shirt."
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:36.360]   - So you working with him now
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:37.920]   and you've discovered all these crazy ways
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:38.760]   you get an extra followers
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:40.360]   so you can help him out as a consultant
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:41.480]   and you're gonna boost it?
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:42.960]   - Hold on, this sounds like a brilliant idea.
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:43.960]   Let me get a piece of paper.
[01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:44.840]   - Go ahead.
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.120]   - Well, you just figured it out.
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:48.680]   Yeah, I don't have to go any further.
[01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:51.240]   - I think there's more than, by the way,
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:55.320]   you would presume of course that what it is
[01:29:55.320 --> 01:30:00.320]   is that they're using people who are signing up for accounts
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:02.600]   or doing little gold farming kind of things,
[01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:04.600]   people in Asia may be a mechanical trick.
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:06.080]   But here's an interesting one.
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:07.880]   I don't know if I should show this person something.
[01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:08.720]   - Come on, show it.
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:11.440]   - This is one of the hackers who hacked Matt Honen.
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:13.360]   And this person has had this account
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:14.920]   of very brief amount of time.
[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:17.240]   He's got 123 tweets.
[01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:18.520]   He's following 70 people.
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:19.360]   - Who's that?
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:20.200]   - He has 170.
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:21.080]   - I'm sorry, I'm looking.
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:23.000]   It looks like they put a picture of Boxy on there.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.040]   Can you show it?
[01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:26.000]   Come on, show it, show it.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.440]   - You could show it, I guess.
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:32.040]   So Cosmo the God is part of the Eugene.
[01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:33.520]   - Anna Sweet.
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:34.840]   - Well, they just make up names.
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:36.520]   By the way, they changed their names at random.
[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:38.920]   He's part of the Eugene Nazi hacking group,
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:40.000]   which is pretty difficult.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000]   But here's what's interesting.
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.920]   He has 107,000 followers,
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:45.040]   even though he's only had 123 tweets.
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:46.960]   Those are obviously fake followers.
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:48.640]   I don't think he's buying them.
[01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:50.440]   I don't think he has any incentive to buy them.
[01:30:50.440 --> 01:30:52.680]   I think he's figured out ways to generate followers
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:55.200]   automatically in some sort of hack attack.
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:56.360]   - That would make sense.
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:57.200]   It's doable.
[01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:01.760]   - So I think there's a very interesting--
[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:02.800]   - Who's gonna confess some?
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:05.320]   - Can I confess an idea that I wanted to do
[01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:07.360]   like four years ago to generate publicity
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:09.400]   when I finally got on Twitter and I had like,
[01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:11.280]   maybe 5,000 followers.
[01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:13.480]   I was going to, and I apologize, Kevin.
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:15.280]   I was going to be-- - In advance.
[01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:17.360]   - One of the unique aspects of Twitter
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:19.960]   is that you can change your username
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:21.120]   and everyone's still following you,
[01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:22.840]   even though you're under a different name.
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:28.240]   So I was going to change my name from @schwood
[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:32.520]   to @Kevin_rose and change my profile picture
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:36.680]   to Kevin Rose's 'cause everyone figuring most of the people
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:38.800]   who follow me also follow Kevin Rose
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:40.480]   and figure out some kind of crazy thing
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:42.440]   to post pretending to be you.
[01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:44.480]   And then it would look like it came--
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:46.240]   - You're like, "Then I was gonna crawl on your bed at night
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:49.160]   "and I'm like, "Where's this going Ryan?"
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:51.520]   - No, but it's like, I never fully forward.
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:53.760]   I couldn't figure out what the big payoff was gonna be,
[01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:55.600]   but I can't believe nobody's taken advantage of that.
[01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:58.360]   No one with hundreds of thousands of followers
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:01.280]   has pretended to be someone else and then flipped back.
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:02.280]   - Yeah, I don't think that's happened.
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:03.280]   No.
[01:32:03.280 --> 01:32:05.280]   - Did you-- - Did you have this problem?
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:06.880]   - Did you have this problem at all
[01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:08.040]   where people doing that?
[01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:09.880]   - They're paying for digs all the time, absolutely.
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:10.920]   - Yeah, it was a big underground--
[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:13.000]   - It's hard to stop.
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.000]   Can we follow Twitter for not stopping this?
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.240]   - It's extremely difficult.
[01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:18.240]   - They don't care. - They don't care.
[01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:19.080]   - What would they care?
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:21.440]   What's a bad part of it?
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:22.920]   - It only looks good for Twitter.
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:24.000]   - Yeah.
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.760]   At least it looked even like everyone's wows.
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:29.640]   - But it does attack the credibility of paying any attention
[01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:30.720]   to follower numbers, right?
[01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:31.920]   I mean, that's bogus.
[01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:34.320]   I guess they don't care.
[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:35.440]   - What would Twitter care?
[01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:36.440]   - Yeah, they don't care.
[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:37.840]   - Have you noticed-- - I just think back
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:39.480]   when Kevin and I were in a race.
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:40.320]   - Yeah, I know that two of you were--
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:42.240]   - You were number one, you know how many followers we had
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:43.080]   when we were in a race?
[01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:44.640]   5,000. - Yeah, something like that.
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:46.720]   - Hey, that was in the top 10 list during that era.
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:49.480]   - 5,000 was like, you were number one on Twitter.
[01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:52.120]   - If you had 5,000 followers.
[01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:53.600]   - I noticed-- - I noticed--
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:54.640]   - I noticed this one thing earlier.
[01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:56.320]   - But a follower meant something.
[01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:58.960]   - I got like 85,000 followers.
[01:32:58.960 --> 01:33:01.720]   I had like, during that when you two were racing,
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:03.400]   I had, when you got to 10,000,
[01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:05.480]   I remember and the 10,000 is a good number.
[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:07.000]   - I think it was 10,000 actually, yeah.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.320]   - When you get to 10,000 back then,
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:10.380]   and you send out something,
[01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:12.040]   hey, link to this and you run it through a bitlier
[01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:13.600]   somewhere you would track it,
[01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:16.560]   you would get a 35%, you get a huge response.
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:17.400]   - Right, oh for sure.
[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:18.760]   - Now with this huge number,
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:21.160]   she's like click on it, 200 people.
[01:33:21.160 --> 01:33:22.000]   - Yeah, I think that's--
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.680]   - It's like everyone's giving up on this thing.
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:25.040]   I think it's dead.
[01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:27.920]   - The thing is, I'm using Twitter more than ever.
[01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:29.640]   - Yeah, but you're not, who cares?
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:30.480]   Nobody cares.
[01:33:30.480 --> 01:33:32.560]   - Oh, no, nobody cares, I'm just saying I like it.
[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:33.960]   - Yeah, I like it too.
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:36.400]   - Did I tell you how I got the verified check on Twitter?
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:37.560]   - Oh, sure. - Well, 'cause I--
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:39.440]   - I have never gotten a verified check
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:40.680]   and I have begged for it.
[01:33:40.680 --> 01:33:43.440]   - Number one, first thing I did was I created
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:47.000]   an account called schwoodblackops.com.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.680]   And I set out a tweet saying--
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:50.680]   - This may be the way to go. - Say and listen,
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:52.800]   if you're the type of person who wants to participate
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:53.840]   in something at some point,
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:55.000]   I may ask you to do something
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.800]   and I can't publicly acknowledge it.
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:58.040]   - And that they may never come.
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:33:59.880]   - Exactly, exactly.
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:01.120]   So, follow schwood black ops.
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:03.080]   And every time I post something on that account,
[01:34:03.080 --> 01:34:05.680]   I instantly delete it, figuring it's out there.
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:06.880]   I've said the word.
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:09.160]   So, at some point, whoever's in charge
[01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:11.400]   of the schwoodblack ops account said,
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:13.600]   "Hey, everyone make Frank Bryan Brushwood accounts
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:15.040]   so that Bryan Brushwood can complain
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:17.040]   about all these fake accounts ripping him off."
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:19.080]   And so, sure enough, there was like, like,
[01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:22.240]   SHW00D and all these other ones.
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:24.720]   And so, I'm just like, "Twitter was with all these.
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:27.480]   I'm so hard, nobody believes it's me anymore."
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:29.400]   (laughing)
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:30.640]   - You played them.
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:31.480]   - Oh.
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:33.680]   - All right.
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:35.320]   - You have a new Kickstarter project?
[01:34:35.320 --> 01:34:36.160]   - Yeah, totally.
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:37.000]   - I don't have any.
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.080]   - Okay, somebody said in the chat room that--
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:40.160]   - Oh, no, no, no, I have one that is gonna be coming out
[01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:41.920]   next week at a company that I'm gonna help fund.
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:42.760]   Yeah, it's gonna be really--
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:43.680]   - So, that's interesting.
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:45.800]   So, this is a company that's going through
[01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:50.080]   normal traditional angel funding, you know, VC funding,
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:51.440]   but they're still gonna go to Kickstarter.
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:53.040]   - I don't know if they're going through VC funding or not.
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:54.360]   I'm gonna try and convince them to--
[01:34:54.360 --> 01:34:55.200]   - To not do that.
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:56.240]   - No, to come in and take some money.
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:57.080]   - Oh, okay.
[01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:57.920]   - But we'll see.
[01:34:57.920 --> 01:34:59.920]   - But they've decided to go Kickstarter.
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:01.160]   - That's what we were thinking about this.
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:02.440]   You know, it's like some of these companies,
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:04.360]   they can raise their entire round via Kickstarter,
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:06.880]   never have to give away any equity, which is awesome
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:07.720]   for the company.
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:09.400]   - It really changes the equation quite a bit.
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:10.960]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:13.320]   - They rejected our plea.
[01:35:13.320 --> 01:35:14.160]   - We were--
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:15.000]   - We were--
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.240]   - We were gonna, to help with the studio,
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:17.280]   we were gonna have a Kickstarter project.
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:18.480]   We ended up just doing it ourselves.
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:21.680]   - What about this thing I heard about this coming in here?
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:24.120]   Something called Tech Guy Labs.
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:25.200]   - And the new website's us.
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:26.040]   - Is there labs?
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:27.840]   I've been all over this place.
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:29.920]   I've not found the labs.
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:31.560]   Where are the tech guy labs?
[01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:34.080]   Is there a sign on the door that says Tech Guy?
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:36.080]   - This whole thing is, what would it look like to you
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:37.000]   if we were a lab?
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.920]   - It would be a lab like.
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:40.360]   It would be lab like.
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:41.240]   - What do you mean lab like?
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:42.200]   - No, he's got that hidden.
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:44.200]   I've been waiting in chambers downstairs.
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:45.040]   - Last where?
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:45.880]   Is that what you're talking?
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:46.720]   You want some labs where?
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:47.560]   - Yeah, I've been downstairs.
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:49.680]   I see a lab down there.
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:51.440]   - We've got Vats.
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:53.360]   He's got, I wear a bunny shirt.
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:54.360]   - I think you get one of those.
[01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:55.720]   - He's got a Saint Elmo's fire.
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:56.560]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:57.400]   - He's crazy.
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:59.000]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:35:59.840]   - You've been spinning.
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:01.720]   You've been in Los Poios, Ermonos, right?
[01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:03.520]   (laughing)
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:05.760]   - So, did you just reveal your plan to deal meth
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:07.280]   out of the twin labs?
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:08.760]   (laughing)
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:10.240]   - That's what lab means to me.
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:11.400]   (laughing)
[01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:12.360]   - All right, we'll take a break.
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:13.240]   You know what they did?
[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:14.080]   You know what they did?
[01:36:14.080 --> 01:36:16.800]   They completely disintermediated the post office
[01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:18.640]   and I wasn't even looking.
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:21.720]   Stamps.com, it's so cool.
[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:23.480]   You do not have to go to the post office anymore.
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:26.200]   - This would mean, this is one of your major sponsors.
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:27.040]   - Yes.
[01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:29.360]   - This would mean that the post office is important to you
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:31.880]   because they still use the postal system
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:32.720]   to deliver the mail.
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:33.560]   - That's true.
[01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:34.400]   No, that's a very good point.
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:36.720]   - So, you shouldn't be on the side of these idiots
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:39.520]   in Congress that are trying to screw the American public
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:40.960]   by closing the post office
[01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:44.360]   because of the phony baloney 75 years in advance.
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:45.800]   - Are they trying to put the post office out of business?
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:48.520]   - Yeah, they made them pre-fund the retirement
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:51.120]   for the next 75 years so they could break them.
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:52.880]   And so, now they're running in a deficit
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:54.040]   when they should be making a profit.
[01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:56.760]   This is a major scam that nobody wants to talk about
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:58.000]   except the postal unions.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.680]   - So, these people who are trying to do this,
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:01.000]   what is their motivation?
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000]   - Well, maybe there's two things that are going on.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.800]   One is UPS and FedEx would get all that business.
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:07.720]   - So, maybe they're being funded by the delivery service.
[01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:08.560]   - Yeah, that's a possibility.
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:10.080]   The second thing is there's a lot of laws
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:12.720]   involving postal fraud and other sorts of things
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:14.320]   that allow a certain criminal activity
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:15.480]   that start taking place.
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:17.400]   Because you can send, for example,
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:18.960]   in fact, the Bank of America does this.
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:20.320]   They send something by mail,
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:22.600]   but when they send something that's a little sketchy
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:25.920]   that they could be busted for, they send it by FedEx.
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:29.600]   - What does Bank of America send via FedEx and sketchy?
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:30.440]   - I'll talk to you.
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:32.960]   I'm gonna discuss it in a future video agenda show.
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:35.120]   - Make America, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:37.040]   The Bank of America is foreclosing on people
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:39.280]   that they have no right to foreclose on.
[01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:41.080]   And they've been sending most of those,
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:43.200]   the paperwork on that all goes out to FedEx.
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:45.480]   - But you understand the United States Constitution.
[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:47.320]   - Yeah, it's got it in there.
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:49.440]   - You know, created the postal service.
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:50.320]   - Yeah, I realize that.
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:52.520]   - Article I, section eight, clause seven,
[01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:54.920]   empowers Congress to establish post offices.
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:57.080]   - They are trying to screw the post office.
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:58.600]   - But they can't because it's in the Constitution.
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:00.320]   - They can do whatever they want.
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:01.160]   - They can?
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:02.000]   - Who's they?
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:02.840]   - I don't know.
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:04.480]   - If Congress is the one that's doing it.
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:05.800]   - They can't do whatever they want,
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:06.800]   it's in the Gosh Constitution.
[01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:08.800]   - Yeah, but the Constitution can be shoved down
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.760]   to some little entity that means nothing.
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:12.000]   - Well, maybe this is a,
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.080]   this is gonna be stamp.com is trying to do this.
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:15.040]   - No, they're not.
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:15.960]   They're using the post.
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:17.480]   They're stamps.com's doing the right thing,
[01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:20.160]   and you should do the right thing by stamps.com
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:21.000]   and support the post office.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:22.920]   - You know, they've sent over two billion letters
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:26.360]   in packages using stamps.com, two billion letters
[01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:28.560]   in packages, the post office loves stamps.com.
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:29.880]   I'll tell you why.
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:33.600]   Because you basically turn your desk into a post office.
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:36.200]   You print your own US postage with your computer,
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:38.400]   your printer, you don't need a postage meter.
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:39.640]   You know who doesn't loves stamps.com?
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:41.520]   Pitney Bose must hate these guys.
[01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:43.200]   Who's gonna buy a postage meter?
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:44.720]   Or Rhett, well you can't even buy 'em.
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:46.320]   Who's gonna lease a postage meter?
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:49.160]   When you can do this, you print it with your own computer.
[01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:51.560]   You have the USB scale that automatically tells you
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:52.720]   exactly how much postage
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:55.920]   you never have to put up any more on than you need.
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:56.760]   - You get a scale?
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:58.520]   I don't know how much package weight.
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:38:59.360]   - You get a scale?
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:00.200]   - Oh, they give you a scale.
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:01.680]   - USB scale plugs right into the computer.
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:02.600]   So you plop the letter on there,
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:05.720]   prints right on the letter, which looks very nice.
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:06.920]   They'll even fill out forms.
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:08.640]   If you're an Amazon or eBay seller,
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:11.000]   they will take the data from the page
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:14.120]   and create the whole thing.
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:15.160]   Same thing with QuickBooks.
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:16.760]   So if you're doing invoices or so forth,
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:18.120]   it takes it from QuickBooks.
[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:19.120]   - You know what the best part is?
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:19.960]   - What?
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:21.760]   - You don't have to physically go to the--
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:23.760]   If you put physical postage on your stamps,
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:24.920]   if it's over two pounds--
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:25.760]   - 13 ounces.
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:26.680]   - 13 ounces, right?
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:27.520]   - 13 ounces.
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:29.480]   - The Unibom are ruined it for all of us, right?
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:31.520]   So as you can't put physical stamps on it,
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:33.560]   but if you have a meter, they'll come pick it up.
[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:34.880]   - Well, you don't even need a meter,
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:36.240]   but you're right, the Inducia--
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:37.080]   - Stamps.com.
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:38.280]   - Inducia, you're printing at stamps.com,
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:40.000]   have identity information in it.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.400]   So they say fine.
[01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:42.920]   The mail carrier comes, picks it up.
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:45.560]   You can schedule a pickup or use your regular pickup.
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:46.560]   It's just really great.
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:47.600]   I want you to try it now there.
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:49.840]   If you go to stamps.com, you see the $80 value.
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:52.120]   You might say, that's good, I'll take it, no.
[01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:53.760]   Click the microphone up here.
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:57.800]   And I want you to enter TWIT in the offer code.
[01:39:57.800 --> 01:39:58.640]   - Magic.
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:39:59.480]   - Magic, that is--
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:00.480]   - There's a picture of Leo.
[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:01.320]   - What?
[01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:02.160]   - That is magic.
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:03.000]   - What?
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.600]   - It's a really old picture of Leo.
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:06.600]   - You haven't changed, you have an age to moments.
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:10.280]   - And it turns that $80 offer into a $110 value.
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:13.320]   You get $55 in postage coupons that you can use
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:14.320]   for a postage.
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:15.760]   You get the digital scale.
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:18.160]   You pay shipping and handling for that, it's less than five bucks.
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:20.200]   To pay for that, you get a $5 supply kit
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:21.800]   and a four week trial.
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:24.080]   All of that just by going to stamps.com
[01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:25.280]   and using the offer code TWIT.
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:27.400]   So I do want you to try this, especially
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:29.160]   if you have a small business.
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:31.240]   Actually, there's a stamps.com service fee,
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:34.960]   but if you use it enough, they'll waive the fee.
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:36.160]   It's free.
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:37.160]   It really is a great service.
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:38.160]   - I've always liked stamp stuff.
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:39.160]   - I am a big fan.
[01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:41.720]   You know I found out about them, they owned a company
[01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:45.280]   that would let you put stamps with your face on them.
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:46.640]   So I have Leo LaPorte stamps.
[01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:49.320]   The problem is they're like 22 cents stamps or not.
[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:50.160]   - They're still good.
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:51.160]   - Well, I mean two of them.
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:52.640]   - Yeah, it just means more of your face.
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:53.640]   - More of my face.
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:54.640]   - Isn't it a 45 cents?
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:55.480]   - It's been a while.
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:56.320]   - It's been a while.
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:57.160]   - What is it now?
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:58.000]   - That's the 45 cents.
[01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:58.840]   - Is it 45?
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:40:59.680]   - I don't know, is it?
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:00.520]   - What is it?
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:01.360]   - 44.
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:02.200]   - You need the lifetime stamps.
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:03.640]   - 45, 44, 44, 44, 44.
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:05.840]   - And I have 44, 44, 44.
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:07.880]   - It's 45 now?
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:10.840]   That just shows you how many people use the post office.
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:12.000]   Nobody knows with postage.
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.280]   - They keep changing it because they've been gouged by--
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:15.120]   - You know what?
[01:41:15.120 --> 01:41:16.520]   - They're like lifetime stamps and you don't know
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:17.360]   how much you're paying.
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:18.200]   - That's what I bought.
[01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:19.040]   - It could be $50.
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:19.880]   You don't know.
[01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:21.040]   You don't care.
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:22.880]   45 cents, wow.
[01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:23.720]   - Still-- - They raise it again
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:24.560]   when they do that.
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:26.120]   - Because they're being screwed over
[01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:27.200]   and they need a little more money
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:29.160]   and cash screwed over.
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:30.000]   - They are.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.360]   - Have you ever felt like they're being screwed over
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:33.560]   when you go to the post office?
[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:34.720]   Who do you think's being screwed
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:36.080]   when you go to the post office?
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:37.280]   - I have a great post office.
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:39.320]   There's two post offices I have access to
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:41.920]   and one of them is a fantastic operation you get in.
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:44.200]   You get out, they got, I don't have any complaints.
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:46.240]   - The post office, they're dead inside.
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:50.720]   - This is your-- - This is your post office worker.
[01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:53.720]   - Because they can-- - Oh, you can, nobody likes.
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:55.280]   It's the worst thing ever.
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:57.200]   - This is 'cause you keep going in there.
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:58.240]   Will you stop?
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:00.920]   - So I wanna build a set.
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:01.960]   This I think is another show.
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:04.280]   So we're gonna do the game "The Dungeons and Dragons"
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:06.680]   and then I'm gonna build like a back porch
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:07.520]   and I'll have a little--
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:09.000]   - Oh, you're not back on this again, are you?
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:10.080]   - Yeah, I have a little pickle barrel.
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:11.360]   A couple of rocking chairs, you and me,
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:12.360]   will sit there all around.
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:13.200]   - Pickle barrel.
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:17.200]   - Oh, the post office is really in trouble, good.
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:19.800]   - I hear-- - I'm telling you,
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:21.560]   you got a fun-- - Congress has been in form.
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:23.760]   - All over the map, man, defending the post office.
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:24.840]   - All right.
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:26.520]   - I like, you know what?
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:27.520]   - Look into it.
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:30.000]   - I have to admit, the best thing in the world
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.200]   getting mail.
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:32.280]   - Oh, physical mail's great?
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:33.120]   - Yeah, what?
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:34.280]   - Mail sucks.
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:35.800]   - Wait, get it?
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:37.840]   You like getting letters in the mail?
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:38.680]   - Are you kidding?
[01:42:38.680 --> 01:42:40.280]   You busted, it's a mystery and you--
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:41.840]   - If I could smell the-- - And you smell the beer.
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:43.360]   - Is there mystery?
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:44.760]   - No, no, no, no.
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:46.280]   - Do you ever turn it off mail?
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:47.520]   - Yes, it's the worst. - You know why?
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:48.360]   Why is it the worst?
[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:49.200]   Did you get a paper cut?
[01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:50.360]   - I just wanna pay for things online,
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:51.560]   stop sending me bills.
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:52.400]   - Oh, bills?
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:53.400]   Well, yeah, I don't get bills.
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:55.520]   - Well, you know, the flyers, the grocery flyers,
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:56.400]   like, meets 20%.
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:58.200]   - I have all care.
[01:42:58.200 --> 01:43:00.800]   - All the grocery flyers out.
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:04.440]   - I have all my bills sent to prisoners in South Dakota.
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:05.800]   - Oh, you do paymybills.com?
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:06.640]   - Yeah.
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:08.200]   - Or it's pay trust now. - Pay trust, yeah.
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:09.040]   You know this.
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:09.880]   - I finally shut it down.
[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:11.440]   I used it for like-- - You shut it down?
[01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:12.880]   - Yeah, I just-- - Well, you don't use it anymore.
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:15.160]   - We moved, we moved, and then the bills I cared about
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:16.000]   were coming to my house.
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.360]   I was like, there's like two bills
[01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:19.160]   that were going up to South Dakota.
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:20.000]   - Oh, I really like it.
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:20.760]   - So all my bills go to South Dakota
[01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:22.680]   where they're handed and are carefully by prisoners.
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:23.760]   - This is still around?
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:25.400]   This was coming around for a long time.
[01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:26.240]   - Yeah, it's called pay trust.
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:27.080]   - Pay trust.
[01:43:27.080 --> 01:43:27.920]   - I have an evidence.
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:29.680]   - They take my freaking grocery flyers
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:31.040]   and all that other stuff I don't like.
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:31.880]   - No.
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:32.720]   - Yes?
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:33.800]   - Well, do you send everything just--
[01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:35.480]   - You just make sure you change all the address.
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:36.920]   - Can you let certain ones through--
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:38.760]   - No, the problem is that that junk mail
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:40.960]   is addressed to resident, right?
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:43.520]   It's not addressed to you, it's just to that address.
[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:45.280]   So there's nothing anybody can do about that.
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:46.800]   There is something, there's an app you would like
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:47.800]   called Paper Karma.
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:48.640]   - I signed up for it.
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:49.800]   - Wait, what is this thing?
[01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:50.800]   - I know what it is.
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:52.320]   - Hey, you know, I'm more concerned about people
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:54.000]   calling me all hours of the day
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.040]   with a machine on the other end,
[01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:56.960]   telling me there's some stuff--
[01:43:56.960 --> 01:43:58.480]   - Hi, this is great Romney.
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:00.200]   - Mike, you still have a landline phone, that's why.
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:01.480]   - Mike, I know.
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:04.560]   Mike, because you can talk on a landline phone with that.
[01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:05.520]   Hello, what?
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:06.520]   - You know what?
[01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:08.280]   - You're breaking up, I'm breaking up, I'm breaking up.
[01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:09.400]   - Let me turn around to the corners,
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:11.160]   you're getting better reception, I'm breaking up.
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:12.000]   - What?
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:12.840]   - What?
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:13.680]   - Verizon.
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:14.520]   - These phone suck.
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:16.440]   - I would get rid of my landline,
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:18.520]   except that I'm the kind of person,
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:21.200]   like I spazz out if my cell phone's more than five feet away
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:23.280]   from me, my wife could care less.
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:25.720]   And so it's like, I'll call the cell phone five times,
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:27.520]   it won't answer, nobody picks up,
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:31.240]   pick the landline, the whole house erupts with phone ringing
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:32.880]   and she just wants to stop the ringing
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:34.240]   so she picks up the phone.
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:35.600]   And it's like, it's the only reason I'm spending--
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:38.000]   - What kind of a wife do you have?
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.680]   - A delightful lady, pregnant with her third child.
[01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:41.520]   - Really?
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:42.360]   - Congratulations.
[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:43.200]   - Yeah, I find out the sex when I go back.
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:45.880]   - If you were to Google, you'd get $1,000 a month.
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:48.440]   - Yeah, I've been able to talk to Kevin about that.
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:52.120]   - Let's take a break, find out what, you know,
[01:44:52.120 --> 01:44:54.240]   a lot of times I think people watch this show
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:55.840]   and they go, really?
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:56.680]   - Really?
[01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:58.200]   (laughing)
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:00.120]   - So just in case that's you,
[01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:01.760]   we do have other shows on the network
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:03.240]   that are just fabulous, let's take a look
[01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:06.600]   at what you might have missed if you missed this week on Switch.
[01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:07.760]   - He's Twig.
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:09.200]   - Tech News today.
[01:45:09.200 --> 01:45:12.400]   - Tom, you don't like the old TV icon with the dials?
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:15.520]   - You know, I really liked it five years ago
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:17.800]   when it first came back, but it could use a little--
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:19.480]   - The problem is that it acts like an old TV.
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:20.840]   - Exactly.
[01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:22.280]   - All about Android.
[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:24.800]   - I love how it knows who's in the categories,
[01:45:24.800 --> 01:45:27.880]   tech science and TV movies of the people that you're following.
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:29.520]   I love that, it just knows.
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:31.560]   (laughing)
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:32.880]   - So excited by the guy.
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:35.040]   - You are, I-Fi for the guy phone.
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:38.280]   It's my absolute favorite must have iPhone out on
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:40.000]   for anybody who's a heavy app user
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:43.240]   or finds themselves running into battery life issues regularly.
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:45.240]   You don't have to live this way.
[01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:46.200]   Here's the answer.
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:51.200]   - Gizwiz, you pop up hot dog toaster.
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:54.240]   - Is it that hard to cook a hot dog
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:56.400]   that you need a pop up hot dog toaster?
[01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:57.240]   - Really?
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:46:00.640]   - Hey, cook toaster hot dog kid, I'll be back later.
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:01.720]   - It promise you get your wings.
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:03.760]   - You don't switch, you miss the whole one.
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:05.760]   - No, you can't use those wieners that pump you.
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:07.840]   - This was a house ad, Leo.
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:08.920]   - Yeah, it's a house ad.
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:09.960]   - Huh?
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:10.800]   - What's the matter?
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:14.080]   - Nothing, I just didn't think that you'd ever do a house ad.
[01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:15.560]   I love it for one.
[01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:16.400]   - Well yeah.
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:18.560]   - Because we feature it as a course.
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:20.880]   But I think a lot of people watch some of our shows
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:23.600]   don't know about NSFW, which is a really, really
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:24.760]   wonderful show.
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:26.440]   - And it should be said that actually,
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:28.240]   this all was born out of the fact that like,
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:30.080]   the stuff was happening, especially with GameOn.
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:31.800]   Obviously, GameOn, we didn't hit our numbers.
[01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:33.640]   - I blew it on GameOn, and I wanted to make sure
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:34.480]   I didn't do that.
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:35.320]   - And there was a lot of people who said,
[01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:36.160]   "Well, I'm a huge fan.
[01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:37.920]   "If you, I didn't know you were doing a gaming show,
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:38.760]   "you didn't blah, blah, blah."
[01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:40.880]   So this is the way to in-house let all the fans know.
[01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:42.000]   - Exactly how it happened.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:49.320]   - Speaking of which, Zach, I'm Zane Donovan and Kevin Rose.
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:52.440]   Separated at birth?
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:53.520]   - Who is Zane Donovan?
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:54.360]   - I don't know, this is--
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:56.360]   - From Eureka, he's in Eureka, I believe.
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:57.800]   - Some guy's in random life.
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:46:58.640]   - I think it looks that much like.
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:46:59.920]   - It doesn't look anything like him.
[01:46:59.920 --> 01:47:02.800]   - Maybe if Kevin put on 30 more pounds, I don't know.
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:04.440]   (laughing)
[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:05.960]   I think Kevin's a lot cuter.
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:06.800]   - Thank you.
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:07.640]   - Thank you.
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:09.720]   - No, thank you.
[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:10.560]   - No, thank you.
[01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:11.920]   - Thank you, thank you.
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:13.840]   - Thank you for being so cute.
[01:47:13.840 --> 01:47:14.680]   - Thank you.
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:17.920]   - Facebook says likes are free speech.
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:21.720]   This is a really interesting case, a deputy sheriff.
[01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:26.640]   Lost his job after he liked the Facebook campaign page
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:28.880]   of his boss's rival.
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:29.720]   - Yeah?
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:32.760]   - They fired him because he liked the other guy.
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:34.040]   - Oh, that's not-- - And they get elected.
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:34.880]   - Oh.
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:37.720]   - Sure.
[01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:39.320]   - Okay, sounds like a bullshit story.
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:40.760]   (laughing)
[01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:43.520]   - Moving on to item two, let's see,
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:44.840]   I have other stories here.
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:51.320]   Oh, this is a good story, actually.
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:52.840]   - Unlike everything else we've got about this.
[01:47:52.840 --> 01:47:54.240]   - Yeah, the appeals court says,
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:57.400]   it's okay to wiretap people, wirelessly.
[01:47:57.400 --> 01:47:58.400]   - Of course.
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:47:59.240]   - Why not?
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:00.080]   What could be wrong with that?
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:01.920]   - He goes right in with the company town thing.
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:02.760]   - Wait, wait.
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:08.960]   - So this is, I don't know, it really isn't technology,
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:11.200]   but it just, it frosts my--
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:13.800]   - It's kind of technology, you're wiretapping.
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:14.640]   - Yeah.
[01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:17.200]   - Apparently it is legal.
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:18.960]   These are the--
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:21.160]   - These are the Bush era investigations.
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:22.000]   - Bush era spy programs.
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.120]   - Well, the Obama can just kill it in the whole overnight.
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:25.960]   - Oh, sure, because that's,
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:28.280]   tell me one policy that Obama hasn't just done
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:30.920]   that was the Bush era policy, just times 11.
[01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:32.960]   Like, "Is that all, I'm the OR and F. God?"
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:35.520]   And just as psych will end it by sending more troops.
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:36.440]   - Yeah.
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:37.600]   - What do you hate Obama?
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:38.600]   - I hate all of those assholes.
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:39.680]   - Okay, well that's fine.
[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:40.520]   - That's different.
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:43.960]   - The National Security Agency is allowed to spy on you
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:45.920]   if you are making a call in the United States
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:48.040]   if they believe the other person
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:51.200]   on the other hand is overseas and associated with terrorism.
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:52.800]   And they don't need to ask for a warrant,
[01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:55.400]   they just flip a switch and they listen.
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:56.880]   - My understanding is that the NSA
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:48:59.280]   has been recording everything anyway.
[01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:00.680]   - Well, we don't know.
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:04.120]   This is certainly a case AT&T has agreed to help out.
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:05.080]   - Help out.
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:08.400]   - You know, we're gonna help you guys out.
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:11.600]   - Now, this could be appealed.
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:12.680]   This was a single judge.
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:15.440]   This wasn't a, it wasn't appeals court,
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:17.440]   but we could go farther.
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:18.280]   - Yeah.
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:21.680]   - Yeah, I just, that just bothers me.
[01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:22.520]   - Why?
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:23.360]   - Just thought I'd bring it up.
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:24.200]   'Cause I don't think the government
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:26.520]   should be allowed to spy on anybody without a warrant.
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:27.520]   - Huh.
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:29.640]   - Wait, wait, wait, what is this, huh?
[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:30.480]   - What?
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:32.000]   - What's the, what's the, what's the,
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:33.600]   it's called the Fourth Amendment, bro.
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:34.440]   - Bro. - I can check it out.
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:36.320]   - Bro. - Unwanted.
[01:49:36.320 --> 01:49:37.160]   - Bro. - Bro.
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:38.480]   - So jusyser. - Bro.
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:39.800]   - Dude.
[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:41.800]   - I got to get the dude thing out of the way.
[01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:47.760]   - Beware, people without Facebook accounts are suspicious.
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:49.160]   - That would be me.
[01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:50.720]   - No Facebook account? - No Facebook account?
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:51.880]   - No.
[01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:54.000]   - There's a phony one on there, it appears to be me,
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.040]   but it's not, believe me.
[01:49:55.040 --> 01:49:56.400]   - Dude, don't let me. - I've not wanted,
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:57.720]   I see all I see is a bunch of,
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:00.240]   everyone I know has got to face with a slack jaw,
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:02.360]   bug eye and they're staring at the screen on Facebook,
[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:04.840]   scrolling and scrolling on what their high school friends
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:07.240]   were doing, you know, that they haven't seen for 30 years,
[01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:08.840]   but now they're following them.
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:10.720]   What a waste of time.
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:12.600]   - So here's what's funny is I read this article
[01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:14.040]   and I thought, well, this is bogus.
[01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:16.400]   I'm not suspicious of people who don't have Facebook accounts
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:19.320]   until just now when you said you don't have Facebook account.
[01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:21.840]   And I got very suspicious. - That's a little weird.
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:23.280]   - He doesn't have an answering machine either,
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:24.960]   it's a little weird.
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:27.120]   - Slash.pointed to a German news story
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:28.480]   in which an expert noticed that,
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:31.800]   noted that mass murderers, Anders Breivik,
[01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:34.200]   which is, he was the Norwegian guy in James Holmes
[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:35.920]   from Aurora, Colorado,
[01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:38.200]   lacked much of a social media presence,
[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:41.440]   leading to the conclusion that not having a Facebook account
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:42.520]   could be one of the first signs,
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:44.200]   you may be a mass murderer.
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:45.400]   (laughing)
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:47.520]   - I, you know, one of the things that happened,
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:50.160]   one of the things you can do on a Tweet Deck
[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:52.200]   is you can, you know, pick which social network
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:53.240]   you wanna post to.
[01:50:53.240 --> 01:50:55.600]   So before we went live, like three hours ago,
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:58.840]   I put something on my MySpace page saying,
[01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:01.000]   this is a test of my MySpace page.
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.760]   If you read this, I will send you $100,
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:05.280]   write me at Brian@sho.com.
[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:06.560]   - Did you get any takers?
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:08.640]   - No, not one. - Nobody seems to have--
[01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:10.360]   - Now you will, I would take that down pretty quick.
[01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:11.920]   - Yeah, I'm gonna get him. - I'm gonna get him.
[01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:13.320]   He's grafted at the deal.
[01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:15.800]   - Yeah, the deal is now on the end of the experiment.
[01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:16.640]   - Okay.
[01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:20.480]   - Farhard Manjou on Slate says,
[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:21.480]   "I think we've mentioned it before,
[01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:22.640]   "if you're going out with someone
[01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:25.120]   "and they don't have a Facebook profile,
[01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:26.400]   "should be really weird." - Yes, it's really weird.
[01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:28.680]   - If you're a young person, yeah.
[01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:31.640]   - Yeah, if you're in your 20s. - You're young.
[01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:34.800]   - I would say, yeah, if you're in your 20s, of course,
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:36.880]   because you're gonna be dating a lot of people
[01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:38.120]   and you would be weird. - How about employers?
[01:51:38.120 --> 01:51:40.040]   You think employers should worry about somebody
[01:51:40.040 --> 01:51:41.440]   who doesn't have a Facebook page?
[01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:42.280]   - Well, I don't know.
[01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:43.760]   Would you be worried about someone who didn't have a telephone?
[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:45.120]   You're gonna hire someone to a Tweet
[01:51:45.120 --> 01:51:45.960]   and you're like, "What's your phone?"
[01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:47.680]   And they're like, "Oh, I don't do phones."
[01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:50.840]   - No, we absolutely pay attention to
[01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:53.800]   how active future employees, our perspective employees,
[01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:55.360]   are on social media and that's a big bargain.
[01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:56.200]   - Do you look at their Twitter and everything?
[01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:57.200]   - You bet.
[01:51:57.200 --> 01:51:58.360]   - Yes, if they're not. - If they're not.
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:00.400]   - So you're doing what you say the government shouldn't do.
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:02.320]   You're spying in advance.
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:04.320]   - That's not spying, it's all about it.
[01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:05.280]   - How's that spying?
[01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:06.680]   - Well, I don't go to their house
[01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:07.960]   and go through their trash.
[01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:09.040]   Although that's a good idea.
[01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:10.200]   You might wanna make a note of it.
[01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:11.720]   - That isn't a bad idea.
[01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:16.200]   - No, but I think that if you are a technology company
[01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:18.480]   and you're a broadcast company and you're in media
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:20.840]   and you wanna hire somebody who,
[01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:23.200]   and they're not participating in Twitter and Facebook,
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:25.680]   that's probably not a good indicator, right?
[01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:26.520]   - Absolutely.
[01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:27.360]   - I say no.
[01:52:27.360 --> 01:52:28.200]   - I'm one of the first interview questions
[01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:29.040]   we had at Digg is like, "What's your name?"
[01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:30.040]   - I'm not Twitter.
[01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:31.040]   - I do all my-- - What's your Digg account?
[01:52:31.040 --> 01:52:33.080]   You're not gonna hire somebody who just used Digg.
[01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:33.920]   That's crazy talk.
[01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:34.920]   - That's one of the first things we asked people.
[01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:35.920]   - I learned a lot from Kevin.
[01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:37.160]   You told me something really valuable
[01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:40.560]   and actually I've used it in talks many times.
[01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:43.760]   You said at first at Digg, we hired people for their skills
[01:52:43.760 --> 01:52:46.600]   and then we realized that that's a problem
[01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:48.280]   because that they're hidebound
[01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:50.080]   and that really hire people for their intelligence,
[01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:52.880]   their enthusiasm and their ability to learn--
[01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:55.000]   - Generalists versus-- - They're generalists.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.280]   I thought that was really great insight
[01:52:57.280 --> 01:52:58.680]   and it certainly informed what we do.
[01:52:58.680 --> 01:53:00.440]   We don't want people that are--
[01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:02.000]   - No, wait, you're going on and on
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:03.280]   about how they have to do this.
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:05.360]   They have to be rigidly on Facebook
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:06.840]   and they gotta be on Twitter and all these things
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:08.560]   and now you're saying they should just be
[01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:10.520]   crazy wild-eyed generalists.
[01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:12.640]   - Remember Dane?
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:17.640]   He had 150 question air that we gave everybody
[01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:19.680]   before they would hire them.
[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:20.720]   - You had an answer. - You had an 150.
[01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:23.840]   - Yeah, it was things like where did Leo's salad go?
[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:26.200]   It was like to test their twit knowledge.
[01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:28.080]   - Well, this is what you said, you just--
[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:29.680]   - And one of the worst employees--
[01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:32.920]   - That was the worst employees we ever hired
[01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:34.960]   succeeded through that questionnaire.
[01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:36.040]   - Okay, who was this?
[01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:37.080]   - I'm not saying names on that.
[01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:38.240]   I can't, that would be--
[01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:39.080]   - We can find out.
[01:53:39.080 --> 01:53:40.360]   - It would be illegal. - You'd still hear?
[01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:42.880]   - It would be illegal. - Hey, how did that AMA go for you?
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:44.440]   Now, I have a theory.
[01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:45.280]   - I did it 'cause of you.
[01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:46.800]   - Yeah, okay, so my theory is--
[01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:48.880]   - I went on the internet, I saw that you did one,
[01:53:48.880 --> 01:53:50.160]   I'm like, that's cool, I'm gonna do one.
[01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:52.080]   - But then you went to Alcatraz.
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:53.400]   - Yeah.
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:55.720]   - Why do I have to sit there at the computer?
[01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:56.800]   - 'Cause that's how it works!
[01:53:56.800 --> 01:53:57.640]   - I didn't know that.
[01:53:57.640 --> 01:53:59.440]   - What's AMA, what are you talking about?
[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:01.080]   - It's not to be playing anything.
[01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:01.920]   - You're not doing anything.
[01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:03.960]   - Of course you never used Reddit 'cause you had dig.
[01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:06.360]   - It is a dig, and we did it where you'd ask
[01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:07.200]   all the questions.
[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:08.040]   - The dig dialogue. - We wrote them up
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:10.400]   over the course of a couple of few days.
[01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:11.480]   - It was like a big dialogue.
[01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:13.440]   - 'Cause the dig dialogue, yeah.
[01:54:13.440 --> 01:54:14.200]   And that's how it worked.
[01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:15.040]   I just assumed it worked.
[01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:16.840]   - You guys stole the idea from you guys?
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:17.680]   - I don't know what--
[01:54:17.680 --> 01:54:18.920]   - Ah, that's what you wanna say.
[01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:21.920]   - I'm doing my AMA, and people are starting to say,
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:23.080]   hey, you know, Kevin's starting an AMA,
[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:24.000]   but he's not answering.
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.560]   In fact, there's a picture from Instagram on Alcatraz.
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:27.720]   He's on Alcatraz.
[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:28.680]   (laughing)
[01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:29.920]   - He was a friend's birthday party.
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:31.240]   - So my theory was Kevin--
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:32.440]   - Is Alcatraz great?
[01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:33.280]   - Yeah, it's cool.
[01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:34.960]   - So have you been there for like the nighttime parties?
[01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:37.760]   - No, but I got a tour from one of the park ranger
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:39.080]   that runs it, he took us in the back.
[01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:40.120]   - Oh yeah, Ranger Craig.
[01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:40.960]   - That guy.
[01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:41.800]   - Yeah, he's a big fan.
[01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:44.800]   I wanna Ranger Craig if you're watching, I wanna contact you.
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:46.480]   - I haven't heard him for a while.
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:47.320]   Maybe he's not there anymore.
[01:54:47.320 --> 01:54:48.160]   - No, he's still there.
[01:54:48.160 --> 01:54:50.600]   No, I had a theory, 'cause I thought,
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:52.760]   you know what, I was doing my AMA, Kevin Starman,
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:53.680]   and he saw that, and he said,
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:55.400]   well, I'm just not gonna do it while Leo's doing his.
[01:54:55.400 --> 01:54:56.480]   I'll come back later.
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:58.560]   - I just was going to a party.
[01:54:58.560 --> 01:54:59.720]   - I mean, it wasn't like I was--
[01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:01.240]   - And then the next morning I woke up,
[01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:02.240]   and then there was all these--
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:04.720]   - There were many stupid articles written
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:06.040]   about how I didn't do it, and I thought,
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:07.120]   well, maybe I shouldn't do it,
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:08.280]   and I just basically--
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:09.280]   - You made me look good, thank you.
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:11.480]   - That's kinda funny just to like kill the writers.
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:12.520]   - But why you're not taking credit for this?
[01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:13.720]   You should be like, I totally--
[01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:15.120]   Leo, it was out of respect for you.
[01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:16.280]   - It was out of respect for you, Leo.
[01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:17.120]   - Thank you.
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:20.400]   - So where we're brought to you today by carbonite.com.
[01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:21.920]   - Never heard of it, what does it do?
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:23.600]   - Oh, I'm glad you asked.
[01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:26.280]   That's four assists in one show, that's pretty darn good.
[01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:27.760]   - He'll tell you to the limit.
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:29.400]   - You're pretty damn good, young man.
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:30.960]   - Be under the table in a minute.
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:31.960]   - Oh!
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:34.000]   - It's an online back way.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.360]   - Well, it was funny as I thought,
[01:55:35.360 --> 01:55:37.360]   you're like, look, if I drunk it, I was like,
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:39.080]   wait a minute.
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:41.240]   There's another meeting of that phrase.
[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:45.080]   - Oh, I just got it too.
[01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:45.920]   (laughing)
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:46.760]   - Carbonite.
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:49.640]   - That's shocking.
[01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:52.320]   Carbonite.com, line back up.
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:53.600]   - Come here, muscly arms.
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:54.760]   - Carbon, I can't do that.
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:55:57.160]   I gotta practice Herbert the pervert.
[01:55:57.160 --> 01:55:59.880]   - Come here, come here, muscly arms.
[01:55:59.880 --> 01:56:01.800]   - No, that's you, have to practice.
[01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:05.240]   - Oh, so, so, so, I wonder if you could find
[01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:07.240]   the dollar bill strapped to my thigh.
[01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:10.440]   Did you already play you singing Dancing Queen
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:12.000]   as Herbert the pervert?
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:13.520]   - The Dancing Queen.
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:17.200]   - So, Carbonite, line back up is automatic.
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:18.880]   - By the way, they love it when you associate
[01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:20.160]   their service with pedophiles.
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:21.160]   That's cute.
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:22.720]   - I think it's in the docs somewhere.
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:24.880]   - All right, we're not doing this, Ed.
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:26.400]   - Yeah, I was good.
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:27.920]   - That was probably a mistake.
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:30.640]   (laughing)
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:32.160]   - Leo, I think what you meant to say--
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:33.960]   - Add in the can here, come on.
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:35.800]   - I think what you meant to say was that
[01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:38.360]   all your products and service, all your photos,
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:40.080]   all your documents, everything you care about,
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:41.920]   sooner or later your hard drives go to crap.
[01:56:41.920 --> 01:56:44.720]   And when they do, you wish your stuff was backed up
[01:56:44.720 --> 01:56:46.480]   in the cloud. - You know, I hooked up,
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:47.480]   I don't know if Matt's gonna do it,
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:50.160]   but Matt Hone, remember the wired guy
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:51.000]   who got hacked last time?
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:51.880]   - Oh yeah.
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:54.720]   - And he had pictures of his 18-month-old daughter
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:57.120]   from birth, he had them on one computer,
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:56:59.360]   the MacBook Air that the hackers wiped.
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:01.360]   And that was his only copy.
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:03.440]   And I said, "Matt, wait, you're a tech writer
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:04.360]   and you didn't back up these pictures."
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:05.480]   - It's crazy.
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:06.840]   - But it happens to everybody.
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:08.200]   Everybody does this, unfortunately.
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:09.040]   You do it the first time
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:10.240]   and then you don't do it ever again, right?
[01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:11.720]   - It's happened to me a week and a half ago.
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:12.560]   - No.
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:15.080]   - I was giving a computer to my niece,
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:16.960]   my old heir 'cause Google gave me one,
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:17.840]   so I had an old heir sitting there.
[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:20.640]   - Oh yeah, it's very easy to wipe it and start over.
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:21.680]   - Yeah, so I just wiped it and started over
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:23.280]   and I was like, and they went, "Oh, I thought it was a hole."
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:24.360]   - I had them backed up, so.
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:26.160]   - Good man, good man.
[01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:28.120]   Carbonite backs up whenever you're online
[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:31.440]   automatically, continuously, you can encrypt it,
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:33.280]   it's HTTPS, so you can use it anywhere,
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:34.080]   you don't have to worry about that,
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:35.280]   but you can further encrypt it
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:37.880]   and only you hold the keys, so it's very private.
[01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:40.280]   I love carbonite and I want you to try it out
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:42.780]   free for two weeks, very affordable,
[01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:45.680]   $59 a year for your computer,
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:46.680]   less than five bucks a month
[01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:48.120]   for everything on your hard drive.
[01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:49.840]   They do have external drive plans,
[01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:52.120]   they have multiple computer plans, small business plans,
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:54.000]   so visit the website, carbonite.com,
[01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.800]   use the offer code TWIT,
[01:57:55.800 --> 01:57:57.320]   you can try it without a credit card,
[01:57:57.320 --> 01:57:59.600]   all you need is the offer code TWIT for two weeks.
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:01.160]   If you decide to buy, use TWIT again
[01:58:01.160 --> 01:58:04.280]   and you'll get 14 months for the price of 12.
[01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:05.200]   - So do you know anything about,
[01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:06.480]   I'm here on the site looking at it
[01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:08.640]   and it talks about the mirror image backup?
[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:09.560]   'Cause some of these services,
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:12.200]   they don't allow you to back up video files or--
[01:58:12.200 --> 01:58:13.560]   - So yeah, this is how they do it.
[01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:15.320]   Now, and I think this is reasonable
[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:17.400]   and you can read the FAQ,
[01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:20.000]   but the default is not to back up those super large files.
[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.280]   - You can manually, you can say,
[01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:23.800]   no, no, I wanna back up that folder.
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:24.640]   - Okay.
[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:26.320]   - And the reason is, I think people,
[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:28.320]   it's using your upstream bandwidth.
[01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:31.720]   So people forget that, you know,
[01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:33.360]   if you have terabytes of data--
[01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:34.400]   - You can press video, whatever may be.
[01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:37.120]   - It's gonna take a really long time
[01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:38.880]   because what, you know, there's lots of people out there
[01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:41.400]   who have 128K up, do the math,
[01:58:41.400 --> 01:58:44.480]   it's gonna take you four years to back up that five terabytes.
[01:58:44.480 --> 01:58:45.640]   So I think reasonably,
[01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:48.040]   they turn off the super large files by default.
[01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:49.760]   So if you're just using the automatic settings,
[01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:50.880]   but you can always go in there.
[01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:51.720]   The other thing they do is--
[01:58:51.720 --> 01:58:52.720]   - But that's important to you, you can say--
[01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:54.280]   - I think 'cause anything over four gigabytes
[01:58:54.280 --> 01:58:55.320]   must be manually added.
[01:58:55.320 --> 01:58:56.160]   That makes sense.
[01:58:56.160 --> 01:58:57.440]   Four gigabytes is actually huge.
[01:58:57.440 --> 01:58:58.280]   - It's huge, yeah.
[01:58:58.280 --> 01:58:59.320]   - So I think that that's the reason.
[01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:02.160]   I think they do have some limits on the trial offer as well.
[01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:03.840]   I don't think you'd get the full,
[01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:05.800]   I think you don't get the backup video on the trial offer.
[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:07.800]   - But again, once you've done it, think about it.
[01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:09.640]   Like it becomes incremental after that.
[01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:10.880]   You get the bulk of the batch.
[01:59:10.880 --> 01:59:12.400]   Yeah, it takes two weeks to do it first
[01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:13.240]   and then you're done.
[01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:15.240]   - This made me so happy.
[01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:17.720]   The Ustream Mars Curiosity broadcast,
[01:59:17.720 --> 01:59:20.160]   right after it was happened Sunday, right after Twit,
[01:59:20.160 --> 01:59:24.080]   we did our own broadcast, Beat Prime Time CNN.
[01:59:24.080 --> 01:59:25.520]   - Okay, well, first of all--
[01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:27.480]   - Well, yeah, I know where you're going with this.
[01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:29.080]   - It's CNN we're talking about.
[01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:29.920]   Who's not?
[01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:30.760]   - The Bfos.
[01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:31.600]   - He's not on the best of time.
[01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:35.200]   3.2 million people in total, check the stream on Ustream.
[01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:39.120]   3.2 million, peak viewership, half a million people.
[01:59:39.120 --> 01:59:43.280]   Prime Time Sunday night, CNN is 426 million,
[01:59:43.280 --> 01:59:47.800]   or 1000, I should say, less, MSNBC, 365,000.
[01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:50.320]   Fox does have 800 or 3000, so it's a little bit bigger,
[01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:52.000]   but that's a lot of people.
[01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:56.080]   It makes me wonder why you didn't see much coverage
[01:59:56.080 --> 01:59:57.560]   of it on mainstream.
[01:59:57.560 --> 02:00:00.000]   - Well, I think because it required a lot of context,
[02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.240]   and this is something, if you tuned into the special,
[02:00:02.240 --> 02:00:05.200]   you saw that here at Twit, it was just a Robert Young,
[02:00:05.200 --> 02:00:07.320]   and I saw you in the chat room as well.
[02:00:07.320 --> 02:00:10.440]   I skyped in for a bit, Dr. Kiki, Skyden.
[02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:13.800]   - We had Bill Sel, who was in charge of the Sky Crane,
[02:00:13.800 --> 02:00:15.360]   explain what was going on.
[02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:16.760]   - It was the context that's really--
[02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:18.920]   - Jonathan Sterling from How Things Work, is that his name?
[02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:21.760]   - How Stuff Works, it's Jonathan Strickland.
[02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:23.480]   - Strickland, that's his name.
[02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:25.960]   And so, yes, you've got a lot of context,
[02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:27.200]   but I really thought about this,
[02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:28.640]   and I realized exactly what it is.
[02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:30.920]   - What is it? - Unmanned missions.
[02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:33.040]   It's very hard to get people to care about
[02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:34.520]   unmanned space missions.
[02:00:34.520 --> 02:00:37.880]   When there's humans, if there were humans landing on Mars,
[02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:38.960]   it'd be the biggest thing ever.
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:41.200]   They would have had to move the Olympics.
[02:00:41.200 --> 02:00:42.040]   - Right.
[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:43.440]   - But because it was a machine, even though,
[02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:46.360]   it's a Volkswagen-sized space flag.
[02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:48.600]   - It's like, what, $2.6 billion when it's made?
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:51.880]   - It's an amazing thing, but it's not a human.
[02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:53.160]   - And there's no risk involved.
[02:00:53.160 --> 02:00:55.400]   - Well, that is, you gotta say,
[02:00:55.400 --> 02:00:57.800]   in watching the coverage, I think that,
[02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:00.400]   you get excited because of what just happened.
[02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:01.400]   And then that was cool.
[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:03.080]   - You can picture us back on Mars.
[02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:05.520]   - Yeah, yes, kind of.
[02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:07.040]   There were resizing them and trying to--
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:07.680]   - They were dusty. - They were okay,
[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:09.200]   they were dusty.
[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:10.960]   I was hoping, when I tuned in, I'm like,
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:12.120]   "Okay, here comes the live stream.
[02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:13.240]   "We're gonna turn on the cameras."
[02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:15.960]   You know, I was expecting something a little bit more
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:18.680]   modern in HD streaming from Mars or something like that.
[02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:20.760]   I know the tech doesn't exist, but--
[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:23.880]   - It's 14, you understand it's 14 minutes
[02:01:23.880 --> 02:01:25.560]   by the speed of light to Mars.
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:26.400]   - That's crazy.
[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:28.400]   - So that's the latency and the bandwidth
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:29.800]   is only eight kilobits per second.
[02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:30.640]   - You know, I'm watching this.
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:31.640]   It was so fun to watch it.
[02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:35.480]   And the bad astronomer.
[02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:36.320]   - Phil Plait.
[02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:38.040]   - Phil Plait was also on our show,
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:40.880]   and he tweets, "It's landed."
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:42.880]   And everybody said, "No, no, no, it hasn't landed yet.
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:44.040]   "It's just to play in the parachutes."
[02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:45.280]   No, he was right.
[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:47.320]   It had landed. - 15 minutes, yeah.
[02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:49.280]   - But we were seeing what was happening.
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:51.480]   Everybody at JPL was seeing what was happening 14 minutes.
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:53.360]   - So there's no control then at all.
[02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:54.200]   - No.
[02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:55.200]   - There was, in fact, that--
[02:01:55.200 --> 02:01:56.200]   - That's why it's amazing, man.
[02:01:56.200 --> 02:02:01.200]   - This crane autonomously launches, drops the nylon strings,
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:03.800]   cuts the strings, flies off.
[02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:05.600]   It's amazing. - Think about how many problems
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:06.440]   they had to solve.
[02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:07.520]   This thing was coming down--
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:08.360]   - At least 10.
[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:09.960]   - The atmosphere is too thin.
[02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:13.040]   The atmosphere is too thin for the--
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:13.880]   - That's a great big story.
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:17.040]   10 things, 10 problems they solved to land on Mars.
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:18.400]   - Well, because the atmosphere is too thin,
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:20.200]   like people would look at the video,
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:23.240]   and first of all, NASA has become incredibly media savvy.
[02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:26.120]   They understand that now that they're smaller operation,
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:28.400]   they understand the importance of social media.
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:30.240]   - They have Mars Curiosity tweeting.
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:32.200]   - Of course, they personified,
[02:02:32.200 --> 02:02:34.480]   they anthropomorphized the land--
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:36.160]   - They have Mohawk guy tweeting.
[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:38.600]   - Sure, and they also had a trailer
[02:02:38.600 --> 02:02:42.440]   to get people excited to set up the context for everything.
[02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:44.000]   When people looked at the trailer, they're like,
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:45.120]   "Well, that's a bit cartoonish.
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:48.080]   "This is a Cluji way to land a rover."
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:51.720]   But they used the parachutes at first to slow it down.
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:53.120]   You can't use the parachutes entirely
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:55.120]   'cause the Mars atmosphere is too thin.
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:56.320]   It's gonna land and crash.
[02:02:56.320 --> 02:02:58.080]   This thing's like one and a half rockets.
[02:02:58.080 --> 02:02:59.720]   - Well, but the problem with rockets,
[02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:01.600]   the problem with rockets is you try to land it
[02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:02.760]   buck Roger style.
[02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:04.880]   There's so many fines on the Martian surface.
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:06.960]   And when you say fines are different than dust,
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:09.920]   dust are a thousand times thicker than fines,
[02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:11.080]   that you're gonna get them inside.
[02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:12.520]   It's gonna be a big mess.
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:13.960]   It could screw up the equipment.
[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:14.800]   So what they did was like--
[02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:17.120]   - It's basically like burning man.
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:18.960]   - Yes, yes.
[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:20.240]   - After a week.
[02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:22.640]   - Everybody was high, it was amazing.
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:25.760]   - But they used the parachutes to get it down
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:28.440]   to decelerate and then they have this kind of lander
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:30.400]   with rockets, but they can't bring the rockets
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:31.400]   all the way down to the surface.
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:34.200]   So they have a hover and they lower this one and a half ton
[02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:35.760]   lander onto the surface.
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:37.720]   And man, it was electric.
[02:03:37.720 --> 02:03:39.480]   It was magic, man.
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:40.760]   - And those of us who were in the chatroom
[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:42.920]   really had a sense of we were participating
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:44.000]   and watching something exciting.
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:47.280]   But this is why you have manned missions.
[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:48.960]   Because if you're really gonna get people to care,
[02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:51.600]   you gotta put a person there, I think.
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:54.240]   - Yeah, I'm in total agreement with your theory.
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:55.960]   - Well, it's pricey though.
[02:03:55.960 --> 02:03:58.280]   - It's pricey and it's dangerous.
[02:03:58.280 --> 02:03:59.520]   - And it's slow and stupid.
[02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:01.440]   - Curiosity ain't coming back.
[02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:04.080]   You put a human there, you kinda have to bring him back.
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:07.280]   - So Carl Sagan was big on robotic exploration.
[02:04:07.280 --> 02:04:09.080]   He was like, for every one human you send,
[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:10.040]   you can send a 10 robot.
[02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:12.080]   - It's the smart thing to do.
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:16.200]   However, James Cameron is very big on getting people
[02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:17.320]   off this rock.
[02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:19.240]   - And that's because James Cameron's a storyteller
[02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:21.560]   and he understands that without the human element,
[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:23.160]   there's no consensus on this.
[02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:25.160]   - James Cameron did an article in Wired
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:27.800]   in which he points out that not a single woman
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:31.320]   in the history of mankind has seen all of Earth
[02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:32.640]   as an orb from the distance.
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:35.760]   Only men, no women, and it's been like 30, 40 years
[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:37.800]   since the last Apollo mission since anyone.
[02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:40.240]   So he described low Earth orbit as the equivalent
[02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:42.200]   of putting your face up against a baseball,
[02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:43.440]   or I'm sorry, a basketball.
[02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:45.280]   - I'm gonna make a prediction.
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:47.040]   There is a young girl right now,
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:48.440]   probably middle school or high school.
[02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:49.280]   - It's my daughter.
[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:50.880]   - Who will be the first woman on Mars,
[02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:52.840]   the first person on Mars, it will be a woman,
[02:04:52.840 --> 02:04:56.200]   and she is right now watching right now.
[02:04:56.200 --> 02:04:57.800]   - This shit is watching Twitter.
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:00.200]   - I love Daddy and I hope I get to go to Mars.
[02:05:00.200 --> 02:05:03.040]   No, no, no, but she was definitely watching
[02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:04.360]   the Curiosity landing.
[02:05:04.360 --> 02:05:05.560]   She was definitely watching that,
[02:05:05.560 --> 02:05:08.440]   and I bet you anything that that's exactly what happens.
[02:05:08.440 --> 02:05:09.280]   - You know, that's actually--
[02:05:09.280 --> 02:05:10.080]   - I hope it happens in my lifetime.
[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:11.400]   - That's actually one of my big regrets
[02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:12.880]   is that I was on the road when that happened.
[02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:14.280]   I would have loved to, you know,
[02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:17.760]   we got an eight inch Dobsonian telescope
[02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:20.960]   and we covered the Mars, I'm sorry, the Venus transit.
[02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:25.960]   We covered the Ring of Fire eclipse.
[02:05:25.960 --> 02:05:27.800]   - One last story and I wanna ask John about this
[02:05:27.800 --> 02:05:29.600]   'cause he has a little bit of a dog in this one.
[02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:34.600]   Craig's List is basically shutting down all access.
[02:05:34.600 --> 02:05:37.400]   They've now asked the search engines
[02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:39.760]   to stop indexing Craig's List ads
[02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:40.920]   so they don't appear in the cache
[02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:43.800]   so that companies like Padmapper and Three Taps
[02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:45.880]   can no longer get access to Craig's List data.
[02:05:45.880 --> 02:05:48.560]   Your son wrote a really cool Craig's List tool
[02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:50.000]   and was shut down by Craig's List, wasn't he?
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:51.120]   - Right, a couple times.
[02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:51.960]   - Is it Eric?
[02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:54.240]   - Yeah, he has a private version now
[02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:56.400]   that you really don't, it's very hard to get access to
[02:05:56.400 --> 02:05:59.400]   but he uses a completely different technique
[02:05:59.400 --> 02:06:02.400]   that takes a little longer
[02:06:02.400 --> 02:06:04.480]   but it actually works just as well
[02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:06.280]   and I don't think they can find him
[02:06:06.280 --> 02:06:08.360]   or shut him down at all now.
[02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:09.880]   But unfortunately it's like, you know,
[02:06:09.880 --> 02:06:11.200]   five people get to use it.
[02:06:11.200 --> 02:06:14.040]   - What is the problem with Craig's List?
[02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:16.760]   - I don't know, he's got to stick up his ass.
[02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:21.840]   Seriously, what difference does it make to Craig
[02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:23.320]   who's now spending a lot of time
[02:06:23.320 --> 02:06:25.720]   at cocktail parties drinking Chardonnay?
[02:06:25.720 --> 02:06:27.680]   What difference does it make to him, whether or not--
[02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:30.080]   - Well, Jim Buckmaster is probably the guy who's--
[02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:31.800]   - I'm not buying this for a minute.
[02:06:31.800 --> 02:06:32.960]   - You think it's Craig, Craig Newmore.
[02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:35.120]   - It has to be 'cause he's, why,
[02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:36.280]   what difference does it make to him
[02:06:36.280 --> 02:06:40.360]   if I want to search Sacramento, Seattle, San Francisco,
[02:06:40.360 --> 02:06:41.200]   maybe all the--
[02:06:41.200 --> 02:06:42.680]   - So Eric's tool was cross,
[02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:44.840]   search cross city which Craig's List does not allow you to--
[02:06:44.840 --> 02:06:46.360]   - Right, you can check off a bunch of boxes
[02:06:46.360 --> 02:06:48.120]   'cause you're maybe gonna be in these areas
[02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:51.640]   or places you can access by driving.
[02:06:51.640 --> 02:06:54.720]   I mean, why can't I get Sacramento on the Bay Area search?
[02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:56.400]   - And Padmapper did a very cool thing.
[02:06:56.400 --> 02:06:57.960]   It would look through Craig's Listings
[02:06:57.960 --> 02:07:00.520]   and show you on a map something Craig's List does not do
[02:07:00.520 --> 02:07:01.480]   where all the listings are.
[02:07:01.480 --> 02:07:03.080]   So you could say, I want to be in this neighborhood.
[02:07:03.080 --> 02:07:03.960]   Let me look at the listings.
[02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:05.720]   - Have you guys have met Craig before, right?
[02:07:05.720 --> 02:07:06.800]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:07.880]   - He's Craig.
[02:07:07.880 --> 02:07:10.920]   He's just like, he doesn't want to do a change anything.
[02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:12.000]   He like squirrels.
[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:12.840]   - I think you're right.
[02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:14.120]   - He does like squirrels.
[02:07:14.120 --> 02:07:15.640]   - Yeah. - He treats them all the time.
[02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:17.520]   - Yeah, so you think it's just merely
[02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:19.360]   kind of a deep-rooted conservatism?
[02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:20.280]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:22.520]   He's just like, he's happy with the way things are, man.
[02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:24.320]   Doesn't want people screwing it up.
[02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:27.760]   - It is risky because ultimately somebody
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:30.040]   is gonna come along and steal it, right?
[02:07:30.040 --> 02:07:30.880]   - Absolutely.
[02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:32.560]   - In fact, I would bet you have investments
[02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:33.920]   through four companies that are looking at that.
[02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:35.360]   - I think I know the space
[02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:36.560]   that's actually gonna pull it off.
[02:07:36.560 --> 02:07:39.000]   And it's not gonna be a Craig's List competitor
[02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:40.440]   but I think it's gonna be the build out
[02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:42.840]   of the neighborhood graph.
[02:07:42.840 --> 02:07:44.560]   - You agree with Jenna Wirtham writing
[02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:46.960]   in the New York Times she was talking about.
[02:07:46.960 --> 02:07:49.480]   Highlight, for instance, which is kind of
[02:07:49.480 --> 02:07:51.240]   using who's nearby but you think it's gonna be--
[02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:52.240]   - I'm not a fan of highlight.
[02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:53.640]   I just never gotten into it.
[02:07:53.640 --> 02:07:54.720]   - I know I am not either.
[02:07:54.720 --> 02:07:57.640]   - I think Next Door is doing good space.
[02:07:57.640 --> 02:07:59.640]   Nextdoor.com is doing good work in the space.
[02:07:59.640 --> 02:08:00.720]   I believe that--
[02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:03.680]   - Nick Pilton's also written quite a bit about this saying--
[02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:05.240]   - About neighborhood graphs being built out.
[02:08:05.240 --> 02:08:06.080]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:08:06.080 --> 02:08:07.440]   - It's just, it's coming.
[02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:08.280]   I can feel it.
[02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:10.680]   Like the fact that we don't know who our neighbors are
[02:08:10.680 --> 02:08:13.120]   in San Francisco, like I know who's left and right
[02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:14.680]   and top and bottom but I don't know
[02:08:14.680 --> 02:08:16.560]   who lives across the street or down the street.
[02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:18.200]   There's gonna be a graph built out.
[02:08:18.200 --> 02:08:20.120]   There's gonna be services on top of that graph
[02:08:20.120 --> 02:08:22.360]   that are gonna be everything from neighborhood watch
[02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:27.360]   to creating a platform for trading goods with each other.
[02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:28.520]   It's gonna happen.
[02:08:28.520 --> 02:08:29.640]   So I think that's how a Craigslist
[02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:30.880]   will ultimately be disrupted.
[02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:32.800]   - Nick writes, "So why hasn't anyone managed
[02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:35.520]   to unseat Craig's List, a site that's barely changed
[02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:37.240]   and close to 20 years?
[02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:40.840]   It has dug an effective moat by cultivating an exaggerated
[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:44.440]   image of doing good, the peace sign icon."
[02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:45.280]   - Right, I love that.
[02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:48.280]   - That keeps its customers loyal while behind the scenes
[02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:50.280]   it bullies any rivals that come near
[02:08:50.280 --> 02:08:52.000]   and stifles innovation.
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:55.440]   - Social will take these guys away.
[02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:56.760]   That's what's gonna happen.
[02:08:56.760 --> 02:08:58.640]   - Craig, you're a nice guy.
[02:08:58.640 --> 02:09:00.360]   You're like, of course he doesn't need the money now, right?
[02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:01.520]   I presume that he's done more than that.
[02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:04.840]   - He sold a big chunk of it to eBay, I think.
[02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:05.720]   - Yeah. - A ton ago.
[02:09:05.720 --> 02:09:06.960]   - So it was hundreds of millions.
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:07.800]   It's fun.
[02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:09.000]   Hey, it's been so much fun.
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:09.840]   You guys are great.
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:11.000]   I gotta tell you though, next week
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.480]   is gonna be a much prettier show.
[02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:14.320]   - What?
[02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:16.520]   - Yes, Callie Lewis will be joining us.
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:17.920]   Cheryl Lazaro will be joining us
[02:09:17.920 --> 02:09:20.480]   but the prettiest of all, Kevin Pereira, it's gonna be--
[02:09:20.480 --> 02:09:21.960]   - No way, yeah.
[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:22.800]   - He's coming.
[02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:23.800]   - So okay, what is this?
[02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:25.280]   - I saw the Twitter fight.
[02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:27.240]   - Is this the people I used to fight with episode
[02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:28.080]   that you have coming back to week?
[02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:30.720]   - That's all the people I hate next week on Twitter.
[02:09:30.720 --> 02:09:32.640]   I hope you'll all tune in for that.
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:34.120]   No, I felt so bad 'cause--
[02:09:34.120 --> 02:09:34.960]   - He's a good dude.
[02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:36.280]   You said that too.
[02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:41.680]   - Yeah, it's boring but somebody asked me on Twitter,
[02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:44.880]   why don't you have Adam Cessler and Kevin Pereira on ever?
[02:09:44.880 --> 02:09:47.600]   And I foolishly 'cause it's the brevity of Twitter.
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:50.200]   I said, well, because they're tainted by G4.
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:51.040]   (gasps)
[02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:52.160]   Boy, did I break somebody's heart.
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:53.640]   I mean-- - It's tough to have that nuance
[02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:55.200]   because what you meant, I would assume.
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:09:58.160]   What you meant to say is that's the reason they haven't been on
[02:09:58.160 --> 02:10:00.000]   is because I'm still bitter about G4.
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:01.640]   - Yeah, I'm still bitter.
[02:10:01.640 --> 02:10:03.240]   - Well, and actually I invoked your name
[02:10:03.240 --> 02:10:06.800]   because I said, one of the things I fear is
[02:10:06.800 --> 02:10:09.480]   that G4 bro audience, I think that some ways--
[02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:10.480]   - No, yeah, you brought this up to you again.
[02:10:10.480 --> 02:10:12.680]   - Diggs audience kind of got tainted a little bit
[02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:15.720]   because your association with G4 brought in a bunch
[02:10:15.720 --> 02:10:18.640]   of kind of not such great community members.
[02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:20.080]   And I think that that's not what her--
[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:22.080]   - You said idiots though, I think is the word--
[02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:23.360]   - Idiots would be the word.
[02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:25.880]   So in fact, what I said is I don't think there's--
[02:10:25.880 --> 02:10:28.560]   I love Adam Cessler and I don't know Kevin Pereira
[02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:29.720]   and in fact I've never seen his work
[02:10:29.720 --> 02:10:30.880]   but I'm sure he's a nice guy.
[02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:32.840]   Everybody I know like you and Sarah says,
[02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:35.640]   he's great but it wasn't that I didn't want them on,
[02:10:35.640 --> 02:10:38.280]   it was I didn't want their fans on.
[02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:40.560]   And in fact, I think I proved my case
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:43.880]   if you saw the bitter invective that I got on Twitter
[02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:46.200]   from his fans, it was kind of like--
[02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:48.080]   - You're on this, yeah, right?
[02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:49.600]   - You proved the point.
[02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:51.160]   - I proved the point, yeah.
[02:10:51.160 --> 02:10:52.800]   I think I saw the tweet actually, it was like--
[02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:54.360]   - Yeah, you understand that.
[02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:55.920]   - I don't understand that.
[02:10:55.920 --> 02:10:57.680]   - And you can keep--
[02:10:57.680 --> 02:10:59.240]   - So-- - You need a barrage--
[02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:02.040]   - But then I got a very sweet direct message
[02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:05.080]   from Kevin who said, "Hey, I feel bad,
[02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:08.240]   "I was a big screensavers fan, I was 23 years old,
[02:11:08.240 --> 02:11:12.320]   "I didn't know what, you know, I took it, it was a job."
[02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:15.040]   And so I felt so bad, I said, "Kevin, come on the show."
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:17.040]   So he's gonna-- - By all accounts,
[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:17.880]   he's a good guy.
[02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:19.200]   - I don't know him, I've never met him,
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:21.480]   I've never seen his work, I literally have never watched,
[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:23.520]   I never watched you on G4, I've never watched
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:26.240]   a minute of G4 television, so I don't know.
[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:28.200]   But I'm sure he's nice and we'll find out.
[02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:31.000]   And Shira's great and Callie Lewis is great,
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:31.840]   so it's gonna be a wonderful show.
[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:32.840]   - Can't go wrong.
[02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:35.320]   - I had a fight with Callie Lewis over climate change,
[02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:36.560]   I guess I'm right.
[02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:38.160]   - I thought it was over something else.
[02:11:38.160 --> 02:11:39.320]   - No, no, it was climate change.
[02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:40.320]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:43.040]   - Well, see, I don't even know what the question is,
[02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:44.200]   'cause there's so many questions.
[02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:46.960]   - She, we, she and I were debating whether it was man-made.
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:49.080]   Nobody debates now that there is climate change.
[02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:50.400]   - Yeah, and it's probably man-made.
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:51.240]   - And it's probably man-made.
[02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:53.680]   - But the real debate is like, what can we do,
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:54.520]   and what should we do?
[02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:56.160]   - It's very simple, you should paint your roof's white,
[02:11:56.160 --> 02:11:57.720]   if everybody painted their roof's white,
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:11:59.320]   it would increase the albedo of the earth
[02:11:59.320 --> 02:12:02.080]   by a significant percentage, reflecting the sun's
[02:12:02.080 --> 02:12:03.480]   raised back into space.
[02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:04.840]   - Have you watched Coolit, the documentary?
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:05.680]   - Yeah, that'll do it.
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:08.080]   - With the skeptical environment, environmentalist?
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:09.000]   - Is that what they suggest?
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.320]   - Well, among other things, he talks about like people,
[02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:13.200]   there's things that people would buy
[02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:15.520]   to feel good about the environment,
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:16.640]   and then there's things that people could do
[02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:18.240]   that actually make a big impact.
[02:12:18.240 --> 02:12:19.560]   - And painting your roof white would be one of the--
[02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:22.120]   - Would be the hugest, absolutely.
[02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:24.520]   - And I'll paint, I'll paint anybody's roof white
[02:12:24.520 --> 02:12:26.360]   as soon as you go to my MySpace page.
[02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:27.200]   - You will?
[02:12:27.200 --> 02:12:28.040]   - Yeah.
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:28.880]   - First and the next five minutes.
[02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:31.080]   - First person who goes to my MySpace page and says--
[02:12:31.080 --> 02:12:33.720]   - By the way, I've gotten six emails saying $100.
[02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:36.480]   (laughing)
[02:12:36.480 --> 02:12:39.840]   - John C. Devorak is at noagendocheau.com.
[02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:43.240]   - A channel devorak.org, or chat.com.
[02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:45.360]   devorak.org/blog, I don't know.
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:47.160]   - You can't even get as you are on the floor.
[02:12:47.160 --> 02:12:48.400]   - I have too many things going on.
[02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:50.240]   - There's this thing called a cell phone,
[02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:51.120]   if you ever tried it.
[02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:52.680]   - I got one right here, see?
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:53.520]   - Yeah, that's good.
[02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:54.360]   - A big one.
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:55.200]   - You don't do the burners anymore,
[02:12:55.200 --> 02:12:56.400]   you decided to go for the real phone.
[02:12:56.400 --> 02:12:58.720]   - Well, now you can virtualize the burner experience.
[02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:00.200]   - You know about that app, right?
[02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:02.720]   That gives you like you could get a 20 minute burner
[02:13:02.720 --> 02:13:04.080]   or a seven day burner.
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:05.160]   - On a real phone?
[02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:06.320]   - On a phone, it's an app.
[02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:07.840]   You just buy them--
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:08.720]   - Does it give you a new number?
[02:13:08.720 --> 02:13:10.240]   - Yes, it gives you a number and it burns.
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:12.880]   They do point out like we will comply with all, you know,
[02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:13.880]   law enforcement or whatever.
[02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:14.720]   - So if somebody subpoenas them, they'll--
[02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:16.640]   - Right, but meanwhile, if you're out dating
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:17.720]   and you don't want to give your real number,
[02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:19.680]   you just use the burner app.
[02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:21.160]   - Is that what you're doing?
[02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:23.280]   - No, I'm at Las Poyos Armados.
[02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:24.280]   (laughing)
[02:13:24.280 --> 02:13:26.560]   - I mean, you're gonna chicken dinner.
[02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:27.920]   - Kevin Rose, great to see you.
[02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:29.320]   - Congratulations on your success.
[02:13:29.320 --> 02:13:33.200]   I love the Chrome logo, the sticker on your MacBook Air.
[02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:34.080]   - They set up at the Goog.
[02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:34.920]   - You having fun?
[02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:36.120]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:36.960]   - It's cool to see all the stuff
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:38.200]   that hasn't been launched yet.
[02:13:38.200 --> 02:13:39.040]   I think that's one of the--
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:40.360]   - So you know secrets.
[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:41.200]   - A handful.
[02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:42.480]   - Yeah, you know some cool stuff.
[02:13:42.480 --> 02:13:44.440]   - The Google X stuff is awesome.
[02:13:44.440 --> 02:13:46.200]   Everything that they're building out there,
[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:48.080]   Google branded ecstasy.
[02:13:48.080 --> 02:13:50.440]   Yes, that's what it sounds like.
[02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:51.680]   - What's with Larry's voice?
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:52.760]   Do you know what's going on?
[02:13:52.760 --> 02:13:53.600]   - It's coming back.
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:54.440]   - It's coming back?
[02:13:54.440 --> 02:13:55.280]   - I've heard him speak.
[02:13:55.280 --> 02:13:56.120]   - I've heard him speak.
[02:13:56.120 --> 02:13:56.960]   - Oh, okay.
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:13:57.800]   - It's squeaky.
[02:13:57.800 --> 02:13:59.600]   - Yeah, it's one of those things where you just lost it
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:01.000]   for a couple months or something.
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.200]   - I'd like to talk to y'all about Google.
[02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:04.800]   (laughing)
[02:14:04.800 --> 02:14:07.920]   You know, we've got these autonomous vehicles.
[02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:09.600]   Did you like to go for a ride?
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:10.920]   - Yeah, you're getting back to that pit of the ballboys.
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:11.920]   - So, all right.
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:13.560]   - They get stuck around in my car.
[02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:14.400]   - Just about.
[02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:16.080]   - You know, I have candy.
[02:14:16.080 --> 02:14:16.920]   - Wow.
[02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:18.080]   - I have candy in my pocket.
[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:20.120]   - You're doing this too good, Leo.
[02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:20.960]   Too good.
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:23.160]   Sounds a little rehearsed if you ask me.
[02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:24.360]   - I've been practicing.
[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:25.360]   - I'm sure you are.
[02:14:25.360 --> 02:14:26.440]   (laughing)
[02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:27.280]   - Everyone Google, Leo.
[02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:28.720]   - Go to the port dancing queen.
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:29.560]   - That's a good one.
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:30.560]   - That's the official one, right?
[02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:32.320]   - Is there a video on the internet of that?
[02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:33.160]   - All right, yeah.
[02:14:33.160 --> 02:14:34.000]   - Oh, yeah.
[02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:35.840]   - It's my favorite song.
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:37.200]   - It's, you did the whole thing.
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:38.520]   (laughing)
[02:14:38.520 --> 02:14:39.840]   You lived in...
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:40.680]   - I've got you.
[02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:41.520]   - Shkiddo.
[02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:42.320]   (laughing)
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:44.440]   - Brian Brushwood, shwood.com.
[02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:46.160]   He's got the world's largest computer
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:47.560]   and he is finally rebooting.
[02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:48.400]   - He's in this large.
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:49.760]   - He's trying to rebooting.
[02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:50.600]   - Finally rebooting.
[02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:52.880]   - He's a giant, it's a boat anchor.
[02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:53.720]   - That's what he told us.
[02:14:53.720 --> 02:14:54.560]   - That's what he told us.
[02:14:54.560 --> 02:14:56.200]   - He's about to get 4060X I think.
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:14:58.560]   - I was about to get a MacBook,
[02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:00.840]   but they didn't do the retina on the 17 inch
[02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:02.120]   and I don't think I'm gunna now.
[02:15:02.120 --> 02:15:03.360]   - Oh, you don't need a 17 inch
[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:04.640]   when you've got retina, baby.
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:06.120]   - Well, if you shove your face on it.
[02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:08.360]   - You wanna come over and see my retina display.
[02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:09.760]   - All right.
[02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:11.440]   You don't have to get closer to appreciate it.
[02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:13.680]   - You gotta get really close.
[02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:15.280]   - I wanna thank you all
[02:15:15.280 --> 02:15:18.800]   for being here through this nightmare that we call Twitch.
[02:15:18.800 --> 02:15:20.360]   We do this show every Sunday afternoon,
[02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:24.000]   3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time, 2200 UTC.
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:25.040]   I do hope you'll watch live.
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:28.000]   It's fun to see the chat room blow up
[02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:29.360]   whenever we say anything.
[02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:31.200]   But, and by the way, come in studio too.
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:32.560]   We've got a great studio on it.
[02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:33.760]   So if you're ever in the area,
[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:36.040]   email us tickets@twit.tv.
[02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:37.400]   That's new address we use.
[02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:38.680]   Who came here from the farthest?
[02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:41.560]   Is there anybody from outside the US here?
[02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:43.800]   Yes sir, where are you from?
[02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:44.720]   Where?
[02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:45.560]   Brazil.
[02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:46.400]   - Brazil. - Brazil.
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:47.240]   - Brazil. - Brazil.
[02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:48.080]   - Tell us about our sponsor, Brazil.
[02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:48.920]   - Say a certain.
[02:15:48.920 --> 02:15:51.160]   - I can't hear it.
[02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:52.000]   - In your face, Brazil.
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:52.840]   - Holland.
[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:53.680]   - Holland.
[02:15:53.680 --> 02:15:54.520]   - Where are you from?
[02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:55.360]   - I think it's--
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:56.200]   - Poland.
[02:15:56.200 --> 02:15:57.040]   - Oh wow.
[02:15:57.040 --> 02:15:57.880]   - He wins.
[02:15:57.880 --> 02:15:58.720]   - Where are you from?
[02:15:58.720 --> 02:16:00.040]   - Just Texas.
[02:16:00.040 --> 02:16:01.040]   - Texas.
[02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:01.880]   (laughing)
[02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:02.720]   - I guess that is out of the country.
[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:03.560]   - Where are you from?
[02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:05.960]   - Canada, that's, so we have people from Poland,
[02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:07.800]   Canada, Brazil.
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:08.640]   - And Holland.
[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:09.480]   - And Holland here.
[02:16:09.480 --> 02:16:10.320]   That is just a-- - And France.
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:12.480]   - And France, where is the French?
[02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:13.320]   - That was in.
[02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:14.160]   - Oh.
[02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:15.000]   - Oh, I thought you said Texas.
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:15.840]   - No, he said France.
[02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:16.840]   - France.
[02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:19.120]   - France is not Texas.
[02:16:19.120 --> 02:16:21.560]   I came from Indonesia.
[02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:22.400]   - I don't know if that counts.
[02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:23.240]   - I came from Indonesia.
[02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:24.080]   Direct flight.
[02:16:24.080 --> 02:16:24.920]   There you go.
[02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:25.760]   - Is that right?
[02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:27.600]   - It's one-- - Actually, you flew in
[02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:28.760]   and you were going back to Austin.
[02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:29.600]   Is that the deal?
[02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:30.440]   - Yes, yes.
[02:16:30.440 --> 02:16:31.280]   - He hasn't been home in two weeks.
[02:16:31.280 --> 02:16:32.120]   - I left from, yeah, I haven't seen it.
[02:16:32.120 --> 02:16:33.360]   - What were we doing in Indonesia?
[02:16:33.360 --> 02:16:34.200]   - I was doing that.
[02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:35.040]   We talked about this.
[02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:35.880]   I did this too.
[02:16:35.880 --> 02:16:36.720]   - Oh, I did it.
[02:16:36.720 --> 02:16:37.560]   - Early in the show we mentioned it.
[02:16:37.560 --> 02:16:38.400]   - It's been a long.
[02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:39.240]   - It's been a long.
[02:16:39.240 --> 02:16:40.800]   - But I didn't get to tell you my favorite part.
[02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:42.960]   My favorite part was I spent like two days
[02:16:42.960 --> 02:16:44.760]   after the TV special getting recognized
[02:16:44.760 --> 02:16:45.760]   around Indonesia.
[02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:47.600]   And then when I got on the plane to Taipei,
[02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:50.960]   I was like, all right, now that's over, walking through Taipei airport.
[02:16:50.960 --> 02:16:51.840]   I'm walking along.
[02:16:51.840 --> 02:16:53.440]   It's like two in the morning.
[02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:56.040]   And so it goes, Brian brush what?
[02:16:56.040 --> 02:16:58.760]   And I turn and the guy goes, I love all your stuff.
[02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:01.080]   And I'm like, well, which stuff I'm trying to feel him out.
[02:17:01.080 --> 02:17:03.720]   And he goes, I bought a brick at the brick house.
[02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:05.400]   I'm like, come see you this week.
[02:17:05.400 --> 02:17:06.240]   - It's really neat.
[02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:07.560]   - It was amazing.
[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:09.480]   - I really appreciate everybody who's here in studio.
[02:17:09.480 --> 02:17:10.480]   Everybody's watching at home.
[02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:11.320]   We're very grateful.
[02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:14.240]   It's great to be able to do a show that is this silly
[02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:17.160]   and this crazy and have some fun while we're doing it.
[02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:18.920]   So thank you. We'll see you next time.
[02:17:18.920 --> 02:17:21.000]   Another twit is in the can.
[02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:21.840]   It's amazing.
