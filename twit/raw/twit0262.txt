[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.240]   to show the covers of the technical universe,

[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.520]   We don't actually gather news.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.360]   We don't actually report on news.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.880]   We don't do anything, really, except sit here and read
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.120]   other people's reporting and talk about it.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.920]   And I've got a perfect cast for that today.
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.480]   Joining me from St. Paul in the St. Paul Pioneer Press.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.160]   Julio Heda Zapata.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.920]   It's good to have you back.
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.360]   Thank you.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.600]   OJEZAP.com.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.320]   And I haven't had him in ages.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.440]   And we've really missed you, John.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.880]   See, Devorak.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.040]   You have to have a signature thing.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.080]   I don't think that works.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.040]   [LAUGHS]
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.960]   I'll come up with something.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.040]   I think maybe Tarzan's thing would be better.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.120]   You know, the other day on the radio--
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.960]   Oh, Leo.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.600]   Oh.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.040]   The other day on the radio, the guy called me up
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.760]   who created this signature, our senior hall.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.280]   Yeah, he's an actual--
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.920]   And then he does family feud.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.000]   And so he's a guy to coined family feud.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.440]   He's famous for elongated vowels.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.080]   That's a guy's name.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.120]   I can't remember his name.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.640]   Nice guy.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.280]   I asked him to do it on the show.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.280]   And he said, and now Leo LeBord.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.960]   Did you keep it?
[00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.240]   No.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.000]   Sounds like a keeper.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.360]   That should be a keeper.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.280]   I'd use that.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.680]   This is episode 262.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.080]   If you want to follow along, those of you watching at Home Live,
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.920]   we do do this live at live.twit.tv.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.400]   Every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.160]   Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern, 2,200 UTC.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.360]   You can go to delicious.com/twit/262 for this particular--
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.720]   Go ahead, creek the microphone.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.440]   When I used to--
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.960]   Julio, you just have to put up with him.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.000]   When I used to do radio with John--
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.840]   I gave him a computer with sound effects.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.920]   I said, knock yourself out, because he would just get bored.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.960]   That was a mistake to do that.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.920]   It was a huge mistake.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.960]   I would just assume do a whole show of sound effects.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.120]   I think you did?
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.720]   I think a couple of times, maybe.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.840]   I still have those sound effects if you need them.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.280]   You sent me the disc.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.800]   You have more?
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.280]   I have all of them.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.320]   The thing that went to the time is 6 a.m.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.320]   And--
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.320]   3 a.m.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.840]   And--
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.860]   And so--
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.680]   You have it somewhere, don't you?
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.840]   Yeah, you want to hear it?
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.320]   You should be able to bring that up in a second.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.080]   I can play it for you.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.880]   The classic.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.360]   The time is now 2 a.m.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.680]   In Bacaba, Belgium Congo.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.240]   This is the long first.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.600]   This is the long first.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.440]   The home of the jungle telegraph.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.480]   We'd like to say hello to Ungat Unga,
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.520]   Oomp, and Mrs. Oomp, and all the boys up at the transmitter.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.160]   Julio is an actual journalist who's saying,
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.960]   how did I get here?
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.320]   So the point is, my copy of that is "Deteriorade."
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.880]   I don't know what happened--
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.800]   Well, I'm going to send it to you.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.880]   I need that one, yeah.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.080]   For the longest time, did not know where that sound effect
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.560]   came from.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.720]   And finally, somebody said it.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.480]   It's from a "Dennis the Menace" episode.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.200]   Mr. Wilson gets a shortwave radio,
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.200]   and that's what he picks up, which is kind of bizarre.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.600]   So before we get to the actual stories of the day--
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.480]   and there are some wacky stories today-- for instance,
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:44.400]   Intel spending $7.68 billion on Maccathy of all things.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.040]   I'm just going to say right now, I'm going to say it right up
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.520]   front, we're just going to get it out of the way.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.760]   I am not going to whine about buzz on this show.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.120]   I wanted to hear about this.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.040]   OK, let me whine about buzz for a little bit.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.640]   Wait, my resolution didn't last long, did it?
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.160]   What would you say if you post on Twitter?
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.960]   What would you say if you were posting on Twitter
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.240]   and thinking it was working fine?
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.120]   But for six weeks, everything you were posting
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.720]   was visible only to you, nobody else.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.280]   Oh, a bozo filter.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.320]   You think that's what happened?
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.320]   Yeah, that's what it is.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.560]   Because I was complaining about Verizon Google,
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.960]   maybe they put me under the bozo filter.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.040]   That could be.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.760]   That's what it's called.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.360]   That's what it is.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.040]   That's what it does.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.840]   Because I was posting on buzz.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.120]   I was seeing it.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.880]   We used to use a bozo filter at PCMag.com's forums.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.240]   So people think they're posting.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.360]   Yeah, you get a bozo, and you say,
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.320]   this guy's describing us crazy, and then you tell,
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.120]   "I'll put him on the bozo filter."
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.560]   And they put him on, and his IP, when he posted,
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.400]   he'd know when he would see it but him.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.360]   So you're bozoed out for some reason.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.720]   What was, yeah, and the thing is, I should have noticed,
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.400]   because normally there'll be some engagement
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.560]   when I post something, there'll be comments,
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.400]   there'll be likes, whatever.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.520]   You often dozens.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.360]   There was nothing.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.560]   It was just dead silence.
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.760]   But I was traveling, I was posting Mobley,
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.720]   so I wasn't really paying that much attention.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.000]   And Friday night, I'm looking at this and thinking,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.880]   "Nobody's there.
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.080]   Nobody's seen what I'm posting."
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.920]   And not only that, I used, I was,
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.760]   "Hey, I committed myself to buzz thoroughly."
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.800]   This was Google Buzz then.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.520]   Google Buzz, I put all of my eggs in the buzz basket,
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.560]   so to speak.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.960]   And I was actually convinced me to put a,
[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.040]   you convinced me to put a profile on Buzz
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.440]   based on, I heard there was a new one.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.440]   Yeah, I like Buzz.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.200]   So I like the idea of Buzz.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.200]   I was in.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.000]   I like the idea because unlike Twitter,
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.200]   where you can't really have a conversation on Twitter,
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.400]   you can try, but it's not intended for that.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.760]   Even with messaging, you can't do it.
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.600]   Yeah, it's really hard.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.400]   But Buzz, he's threaded, you bank a post,
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.040]   somebody can comment, I mean, it worked.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.480]   So I put a lot, I really put my heart and soul
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.480]   into that thing.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.800]   And I, in fact, this is the thing that really kills me.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.400]   When I start a show, as I just did now,
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.840]   I would put it on Buzz.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.800]   I would say the show's starting,
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.120]   you can discuss it here, you can watch it here.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.480]   And that would automatically go to Twitter.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.320]   Sure.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.280]   So I was kind of counting on Buzz to do all this
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.920]   without my knowledge.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.120]   Well, you did something.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.280]   You did something to yourself.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.120]   You must have said--
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.720]   I think I bose out myself out.
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.760]   There must have been a filter that caught something
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.360]   and then you, boom, you got ended up on the bozo filter.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.720]   Well, then the next thing that happened is I got--
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.720]   I figured out what it was.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.520]   Well, I wrote a blog-- no, well, here's what happened.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.960]   I wrote a blog post late last night.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.000]   I should never write blog post after midnight.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.840]   Has nobody--
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.840]   Nobody should.
[00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:11.840]   Nobody should.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.840]   Coolioity ever write late, late, late blog post
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.200]   that you regret.
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.400]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.480]   I think the thing that I regret most is at the end saying,
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.120]   screw you, Buzz!
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.440]   But I thought the title was quite clever.
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.680]   Did you-- you found my lipstick?
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.040]   Because I've been looking for that as well.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.200]   Yeah, I was just doing it here.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.960]   What the hell?
[00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:28.960]   Who left there?
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.440]   Anybody-- they may missing--
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.040]   It's one of your--
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.160]   We have females in the studio.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.880]   Yeah, I think it was a little weird.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.920]   Oh, I think that's Sarah Lane's shade.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.760]   Let me just move on to my collar.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.960]   Interesting.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.960]   All right, so--
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.600]   I hear a collar.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.600]   Let's get a little attention.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.000]   That's straight out of mad, man.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.160]   Do you ever watch that show?
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.400]   Yeah, I'm addicted to it.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.200]   Me too.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.880]   It's the greatest show.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.120]   It's funny because Jason has a thing where they
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.960]   synopsize the plot of a show.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.320]   I don't know.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.160]   It's a mahalo thing.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.800]   And I read the synopsis of the plot.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.760]   And I realized the plot has absolutely nothing
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.440]   to do with the show.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.440]   You don't watch the show for the plot of Mad Men.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:06.960]   No, of course not.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.920]   You watch the show for the silences.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.280]   They're like, what the hell was that?
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.160]   Last night on Mad Men, last Sunday.
[00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.120]   Don't tell me I'm just--
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:14.520]   No, I'm not--
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.360]   I have seen this.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:15.400]   No, I'm not.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.440]   It's not a spoiler.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.160]   But at the end of the show, it's the last scene of the show.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.400]   You watch it carefully.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.120]   There's a little old lady walking down the hall.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.360]   It's Don Draper's apartment building, walking down the hall.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.400]   And the guy at the end says, did you get any pairs?
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.080]   And she doesn't answer.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.520]   He says, did you get any pairs?
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.560]   She doesn't answer.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.560]   Did you get any pairs?
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.240]   And she says, well, talk about it inside.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:36.720]   And they go in.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.280]   And that's it.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:37.760]   That's it.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.560]   That's the scene.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.880]   That's why I love that show.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.880]   My daughter likes the show.
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.200]   Really?
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:44.760]   How old is she?
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:45.320]   She's 16.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.240]   That's amazing.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.480]   That's showing some real taste.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.360]   Well, she likes the show.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.400]   Seriously, she likes the show.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.280]   She likes the character.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.680]   She likes the kind of non-action and the development.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.800]   It's subtle.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.840]   So the thing in the lipstick on the collar,
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.640]   that's very out of the '60s.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.480]   The ad guy goes in the Manhattan, comes back,
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.920]   has got the lipstick on his collar.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.600]   My wife likes her only because Robert Morse, who
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.320]   was, by the way, in San Francisco last week,
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.720]   and I went and chatted with him.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.280]   Really?
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:08.520]   Yeah.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.400]   He was the star of how to succeed in this business.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.360]   But he plays one of the characters on that.
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.200]   He's Sterling--
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.040]   Sterling Cooper.
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:16.760]   He's one of the two.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.240]   He's one of the original ad agents.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:18.720]   He's a guy.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.320]   He's a real character.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.200]   He doesn't wear shoes.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.840]   He says that the guy who produced that,
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.920]   who produced the Sopranos and a bunch of other stuff
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:29.840]   was seriously hurt by the fact that HBO wouldn't pick this show up.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.360]   Well, HBO made a big mistake.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.400]   Yeah, I think it was the stupidest thing they've done.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.560]   Best show on television.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.680]   Julio, you're still there.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.560]   Yeah, we're born just deaf, Julio.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:39.480]   You ever watched TV?
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.640]   So, Leo, I got a question for you.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.960]   I read your blog post.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:42.880]   So here's--
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.760]   I'll also emphasize it very quickly, which is,
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.080]   I've been posting for three weeks.
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.560]   And OK, Buzz is broken.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.840]   But that's not the real point.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.080]   The point is, no one noticed that it wasn't getting published.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.920]   I didn't even notice.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.000]   So clearly, this is not my failure.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:58.680]   Buzz is failure.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.880]   This means social media is mindless.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.600]   Drivel.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.640]   Nobody's listening.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.200]   It's an echo chamber.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.440]   But here's my question.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.600]   This is the first time I'm hearing this from the horse's mouth.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.160]   I was at work.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.960]   I read a couple of stories about this, another site.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.280]   And the gist of those stories is that you're
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.960]   down on social media in general.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.280]   I can understand the buzz complaint,
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.240]   but are you extrapolating to social media as a whole?
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.080]   Well, don't you think-- now let's be honest.
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.600]   I think the chat room has it right.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.280]   What do they say?
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.680]   I've been right about this all along.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.760]   Yeah, John was right.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.760]   And I hate to admit it.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.160]   And you know what?
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.840]   I really hate-- OK, so I think there's
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:39.560]   a continuum on the internet between the traditional old way
[00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.520]   of doing it, which is a blog post, which is what I wrote,
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.480]   where it's your site.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.280]   People come to your site, participate with you on your site.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.800]   And then there's the other side of the continuum,
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.360]   which is Twitter, which is their site.
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.520]   You're posting on their site.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.280]   It's a public square where everybody's posting at once.
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.400]   And it's cloud.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.640]   And so, yeah, it's cloud.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:58.800]   Well, it's all kind of cloud, but at least I can back up
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.680]   the cloud.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.800]   So there's the continuum.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.160]   And it strikes me that neither side is exactly right.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.320]   You don't want to just post in your own little corner
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.520]   of the world.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.000]   But nor do you want to just put everything
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.480]   that you do out on somebody else's site where you don't
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.200]   control it.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.760]   And it basically turns into ephemera,
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.680]   because once it scrolls off Twitter, it's dead.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.520]   It's gone.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.720]   So I'm wondering if there's something in the middle.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.680]   And then I'm thinking, oh, my God, I hate to admit this.
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:25.880]   There is something in the middle.
[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.760]   It's called Facebook.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.120]   And God, I can't tell you how much it
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.880]   calls me to admit it.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.920]   But Facebook is you've got your own Facebook page, right?
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.320]   Which is your thing.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.280]   When you say you like something, you have a circle of larger,
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.080]   ever-winding circles of friends all the way out
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.720]   from everyone to intimates.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.000]   You choose who gets to see it.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.600]   People can interact with you on your page.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.080]   But when they do it, it shows up on their page.
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.280]   So it's kind of like the public commons.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.480]   So anyway, Julio, go ahead.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.120]   What is your reaction to this?
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.680]   So I'm trying to understand your point.
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.520]   Well, you're not alone.
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.600]   But I look at this in a slightly different way.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.480]   I just heard you say that if you pull something on Twitter,
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.840]   it's ephemera advantages.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.080]   Well, you wrote a book on Twitter.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:13.280]   So you defend Twitter.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.880]   Well, yeah, I'm going to defend Twitter here.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.480]   I don't look at Twitter as a location.
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.520]   I have a home page.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.560]   I'm setting up a home page at ojesap.com.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.600]   I have a Facebook page.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.640]   I hate Facebook, but I have a page.
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.560]   My high school class is planning.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.400]   It's next for you and you.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.040]   And they have a page for that on Facebook.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:36.040]   I get all that Twitter and by extension buzz, I think,
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.240]   is different.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.400]   It's not about the place online.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.840]   You're not sticking a stake in the ground.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.280]   And this is my place on Twitter.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.600]   That's not really the point.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.360]   The point is the relationships that you forge,
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.200]   the friendships that you make.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.520]   OK, I hear people say that.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.200]   But do you really forge friendships?
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.000]   Do you really have conversations on Twitter?
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.720]   Let's put aside buzz where there actually
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.960]   are threaded conversations.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.560]   You can't really have a conversation on Twitter, can you?
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:07.280]   Well, Twitter has been one of the single most rewarding
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.400]   elements of my life in recent years.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.880]   I can't overstate the fact.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.200]   Forget that I wrote a book about it.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.080]   That's not really the point.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.720]   My personal experience with Twitter
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.400]   has been hugely rewarding.
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.720]   I made profound professional connections.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.560]   Very good friendships.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.680]   I constantly find people on Twitter
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.040]   that happen to live nearby that I make a lunch date with them.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.600]   Forge these incredible friendships.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.640]   It's all about the relationship.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.280]   If you go to a party, you meet people, you make friends with them.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.360]   The venue is not important.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.480]   The party can be anywhere.
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.840]   The venue, the location, is not the point.
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.600]   Point is the connections you're making with people.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.760]   Those connections that I've made with people have been amazing.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.760]   I saw like a big Twitter cheerleader,
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:53.560]   but as somebody who's married, who has a child,
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.400]   who's got responsibilities at home,
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.280]   I don't have time to go out into the physical world
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.840]   and physically make friends.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.160]   I just don't have to bandwidth or the time where
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.440]   the ability to do that Twitter has been an incredible substitute
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.120]   for me.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.480]   And it's been one of the single--
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.520]   I can't overstate it.
[00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.520]   It's been one of the single most rewarding things
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.480]   in my life as of late.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.480]   I can't decide whether that's good or bad.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.920]   I'm not kidding.
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:19.360]   I met up with a bunch of guys in Portugal using Twitter
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.120]   as a tweetup with a bunch of local--
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.720]   OK, there's some fun I want to put in place.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.480]   --valuable use for--
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.200]   -- shooting photographs with some professionals,
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:25.880]   and we had a good time.
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.520]   I would have never seen these spots in Lisbon
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:28.960]   if it hasn't been taken around.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.320]   Yeah, no, I think absolutely.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.320]   And there's some value to it.
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.480]   I'm not saying it's valueless.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:39.520]   I just want to-- I have to rethink what its value is,
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.000]   because it isn't really a place to put and create content.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.280]   Is it or is it, Julio?
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:44.720]   Is it--
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.760]   Absolutely not.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:46.680]   OK.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.080]   Well, maybe I thought it was.
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.760]   I thought it was a microblog, a little blog.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:51.520]   No, no, wait.
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.480]   Well, let me back up.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.920]   As a journalist, as a writer, I take enormous pride
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:00.840]   in crafting a perfect tweet that a hike like poetry
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.480]   of writing a tweet.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.760]   In fact, if I've been known when I tweet something
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.160]   and notice a grammatical error, I get frantic.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.440]   I erase the damn thing and rewrite it.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.120]   And people get mad at me because they see me tweet twice.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.480]   But I'm just a perfectionist when it comes to writing tweets
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.200]   as I am writing anything.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.280]   But it's not a microblog.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.760]   You're not publishing content in the traditional sense.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:24.080]   But your blog is for that is what Facebook is,
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.880]   to a certain extent.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.840]   Twitter isn't that at all.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.880]   In fact, I'm not all that bent out of shape about--
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.800]   my Twitter's disappearing, although I hear that Twitter
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.640]   eventually will allow you to go back and get all your tweets
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.480]   in our comments somehow.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.760]   Right now, it's only 3,500 posts back.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.400]   Right, right, right.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.760]   But I'm not-- I just-- I throw tweets out there.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.640]   It's like having a conversation with somebody at a party.
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.640]   You're not worried about keeping your record of everything
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:52.920]   you told that person.
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:54.360]   That's not really the point.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.400]   It's sort of the end result.
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:57.720]   All right.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.160]   All right.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:15:59.400]   That's resolved.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.320]   So let's move on.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.120]   So let's find a news article.
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.360]   What's this about Apple's unknown hardware?
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.760]   What are you-- where are you looking?
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.720]   Look, some of you sent this on the-- in the chat room.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.640]   Apple's unknown.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.000]   Well, read it to us because I don't know this.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.720]   Apple's unknown hardware be a new bait of Apple's iOS mobile software
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.400]   reportedly boasts references to a fourth generation iPod touch.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.840]   So people watch their server logs.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.720]   And anytime Apple's got a new product or is testing
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.600]   a new operating system, they see on the server log's
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.520]   unusual identification strings, unusual browser agents, things
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:31.160]   like that.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:36.160]   And an unnamed product has started to surface on logs
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.120]   in the last couple of weeks.
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.800]   Now, we're pretty sure Apple's got an event.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.400]   I think it's official September 8.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.360]   But they always do that because they announce new iPods.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.320]   I'll tell you what it is.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.480]   I know exactly what it is.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.360]   Well, I was assuming that the iPod touch new version with an
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.880]   nice screen is coming up.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.440]   But is it going to be what I still think they're going to
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.520]   have to do eventually with an Apple TV?
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.480]   It's what it's going to be.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.040]   You hit the nail.
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:58.160]   You hit the nail.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.000]   Yeah, like a screen.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   No.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.520]   Yeah.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:00.680]   That's one of them.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:01.360]   You think it's a screen?
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:01.720]   No.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.760]   I'll tell you exactly what it is.
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.160]   And I think the rumors have talked about this.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.320]   They've called it ITV, even though that is not a name Apple
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:09.800]   has a use of.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:10.520]   I don't think they can.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:11.560]   That's--
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.880]   There's a Rupert Murdoch or something.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.240]   There's a British IT piece.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:14.720]   They can't use it.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:18.800]   But anyway, whatever they call it, it is a slim line box
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.760]   with no storage.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.680]   It will run iOS for the new iPhone operating system.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:24.880]   And that's critical.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.680]   And in my opinion, but Kevin Rose has a great post.
[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.320]   In fact, I tried to get Kevin on the show, but he
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.000]   hasn't responded.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.880]   Yeah, he's got a quantum rock.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:35.000]   He's busy digging.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.320]   But Kevin says Apple's ITV will change everything.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.520]   And I agree with him.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.920]   I think you're going to see this fall.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.600]   We're going to see two big important announcements--
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:45.560]   Google TV and Apple TV.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.240]   OK.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.640]   Why is this going to change anything?
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.320]   OK.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.480]   I'll tell you what-- apps.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.680]   One word, apps.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:51.920]   So--
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.360]   Do I need a screen?
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.920]   You can hook it up to a screen.
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.120]   But you don't need-- but why-- look, I don't want to buy my TV
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:57.640]   from Apple.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.040]   I got a TV.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.320]   Can you roll around?
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:17:59.840]   Yeah.
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.800]   Oh, remember what Apple released a couple of weeks ago?
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.400]   The Magic Trackpad.
[00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.400]   What is that?
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.120]   A Bluetooth wireless trackpad.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.560]   Big enough to make a keyboard if it's on the screen.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.560]   Big enough to pinch, zoom, rotate.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.320]   It's wireless.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.400]   So it hooks up to the ITV, which is sitting next to your--
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.360]   So basically, this is going to be a moused TV without a mouse,
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.760]   but it's going to be using the hand--
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.800]   It's going to TV with the iPhone interface.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.760]   And apps.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.320]   And this is why Google TV is important to my opinion,
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.760]   why ITV is important.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.760]   Because if you want to add Hulu to your TV,
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.640]   you just buy the app.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.720]   You want to add HBO.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.920]   HBO makes an app.
[00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.600]   You want to add HBO to your TV.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.480]   You just buy the app.
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.480]   HBO Bypasses the cable company, sells direct to you
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.880]   for a monthly subscription.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.160]   You can add functionality as simply as downloading
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.440]   an app on your iPhone.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.320]   This is why Google TV is going to be important too.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.160]   Julio, you agree?
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:48.440]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:49.880]   In fact, I'll tell you what I did.
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.520]   I got the Magic Trackpad, and I spent about a couple of days
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.160]   trying to use it as a computer peripheral.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.440]   Absolutely didn't like it.
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.960]   The mouse is the right device for that.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:06.360]   But I have a 60 inch plasma to me in my office.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:11.360]   And I've been playing with a variety of pointing devices.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:14.880]   Lenovo has some nice hardware in that category.
[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:19.120]   But I took the Magic Trackpad and started using it
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.400]   as a living room device.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.280]   I sort of have a simulated living room in my office
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.960]   with an easy chair and so forth.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:29.920]   And I use that as a television input device.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.520]   It's absolutely fantastic for that.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.120]   That is the use for that trackpad.
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.000]   I'm surmising that that's exactly what Apple is thinking.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.760]   It's what they call the sit back experience
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.800]   as opposed to lean forward.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.040]   Lean forward to your computer, sit back to your TV.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.680]   You're sitting at the couch.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.480]   So that's a great experiment, Julio.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.480]   So it worked.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.400]   Well, I'm running Mac OS 10.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.120]   I have a Mac Mini.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.680]   I'm running Mac OS 10 on the TV.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.840]   But as you know--
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.160]   Wouldn't it be better with an iPhone?
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.400]   But as you know, there are a variety of third party solutions.
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.840]   I'm drawing a blank on the names right now.
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:06.680]   XBMC, Boxy--
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:07.520]   Plex.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.920]   Plex is great.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.800]   Plex-- you know, that has a similar model.
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.080]   You put that interface on it.
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:15.960]   But then you can add services.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.360]   You can sort of pick and choose, sort of pull in
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:20.520]   different elements, different services, different kind of content.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.920]   But they're plugging.
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.680]   Well, yeah, it's exactly what you're talking about.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.720]   You're going to be able to sort of customize experience
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.960]   with pulling in different things.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.680]   Is that apps per se?
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.160]   But it's sort of the same general idea.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.840]   I totally think this is what's going to happen.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.320]   And I think it's going to happen September 8.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.440]   And I think it might set the TV world on its keyster.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.320]   Because, well, John, you and I know a little bit
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.040]   about the cable television model.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.240]   And I think we both know that cable companies do not
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.480]   want to be data companies.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.760]   They want to be premium service companies.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.840]   No, they want to make that extra easy money.
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.160]   But we also know that HBO would love to disintermediate
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.480]   and sell directly to us.
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.880]   Well, there's always been the thing that's always fascinated
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.040]   me about some of these business models that start one way.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.840]   Cable business began a CCTV, which was they were like--
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:07.360]   Right.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:07.480]   --bigging.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.680]   And then all of a sudden, they got so much leverage that they
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.720]   could say, hey, by the way, do you want to be on our cable
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.240]   screen?
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:15.800]   First, I were doing them a favor by spreading their--
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.960]   They were begging them.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.680]   Yeah, begging them.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.200]   Can we do?
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.800]   And then they said, well, we got like half your audience.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.200]   Have you ever seen an antenna anymore, buddy?
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.160]   And then they said, maybe you should give us money
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:25.560]   to put you on.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.080]   Exactly.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.960]   So they did the switcher route.
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.120]   These companies would love to do the switcher route back.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:31.840]   In other words--
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:32.360]   You bet.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:32.720]   You know?
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.160]   Screw you.
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:33.600]   You bet.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.120]   Screw you.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.520]   I think-- I remember Will Hurst talking about this
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:38.640]   with At Home.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.200]   In fact, remember how he got kind of screwed
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.520]   by the cable companies?
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:42.640]   We did, yeah.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.520]   And I think that that was when he started-- what was the name
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:45.680]   of it?
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.240]   Was it Moxie Mojo?
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.960]   No, they did replay TV.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.040]   Replay, which was one of the--
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:54.440]   The whole idea was, why should a company like HBO--
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.480]   why should even better-- why should a company--
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.480]   like Warner Brothers even have to deal with HBO?
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.280]   Why shouldn't there be a Warner Brothers app
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:05.360]   that you pay Warner Brothers directly?
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.000]   And the reason this platform is so successful
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.360]   is because you can add apps.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.120]   So Warner Brothers could create an iPhone 4 app.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:14.120]   There's the store models already set up.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.040]   Or I think it would work with Google TV as well.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.840]   The store models already set up.
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.360]   You say, oh, you know, hey, honey,
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.000]   wouldn't you want to get some movies tonight from Warner
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:23.200]   Brothers?
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.640]   Let's see what the Warner-- you pay $10 a month, $20 a month,
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.160]   whatever it is.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:26.720]   You get Netflix.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.440]   Netflix model.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.440]   It's a Netflix model.
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.400]   And you go direct.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.080]   In fact, it actually jeopardizes Netflix.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.200]   It jeopardizes Blockbuster.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.800]   Yeah, it puts a lot of people in jeopardy.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.800]   Now, the thing that's interesting about this idea
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.560]   is that I don't think it's--
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.680]   they won't have the guts to take it to the extreme,
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.520]   to the extreme, which is what you can--
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:47.800]   if you go to C-bandos, old-fashioned big giant dishes,
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.640]   they have 4D TV now, which is HD coming across, which is really--
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.640]   4D?
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:53.160]   4D?
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.520]   No, the thing is called 4D TV, which
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.280]   refers to classic HD.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:57.960]   Oh, OK.
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.360]   You get a really good HD signal.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.600]   Oh, it's less compressed.
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.840]   And what's cool about it is you can find a bunch of programs
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.400]   out there where you can go to somebody's website
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:11.480]   and subscribe to HBO for one movie.
[00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.360]   Yes.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:13.480]   And you pay the guy like 50 cents.
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.680]   That's exactly it.
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:17.600]   And you get-- you're on HBO, or you get 24 hours of HBO
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.920]   for a buck instead of like 30 bucks a month.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.720]   And so you want HBO on Friday, because I'm going to watch--
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.440]   It's on demand.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.040]   Because why am I paying?
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:26.840]   And I ask you--
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:27.520]   You get a lot of crap.
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.360]   You just want mad men.
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.440]   Why are you paying for the rest?
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.520]   Do you want to--
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:33.080]   Why am I paying for HBO, Showtime, and all of a sudden,
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.240]   I watch one movie a month.
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:34.760]   Right.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:36.720]   I should just pay for the movie.
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.200]   Now, here's the problem.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.040]   How do we get this data?
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:44.000]   We get this data through Comcast, through Verizon,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.840]   through companies that really don't want to be bit pumps.
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.360]   They want to sell TV shows.
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.240]   They want to sell cable.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.000]   They want to sell movies.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.040]   So they're going to have to give up the idea.
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.560]   So what happens?
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.560]   How do they push back?
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.440]   Is this why that you've seen this Google Verizon do this?
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.720]   They're going to have to buy some of these other operations.
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:01.360]   I think that's why Comcast wants to own a network.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.440]   They're going to say, look, we're
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.960]   going to have to get out of this.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.640]   We're going to be the pipe, but we still
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.800]   like the content business.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.960]   So let's just buy some content companies
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.040]   and just give up on the idea of stealing money.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.760]   Julio, are content providers in the driver's seat here?
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.880]   Well, not necessarily.
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:24.400]   There's been some recent news about Verizon
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:28.000]   sort of getting into app development.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.760]   I'm sorry, I'm referring to Comcast.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:34.200]   So I can very well see Comcast developing an app that
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.640]   will give people the same content that Comcast now provides
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:41.200]   on its-- it has a web-based service
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.200]   where you can access a great deal of the content that's
[00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.160]   also available on your television set.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.400]   So they already have-- they are halfway there.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.400]   All they have to do is provide the app that sort of replicates
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.680]   that laptop web experience.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:58.240]   So I fully expect Comcast to play along with this.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.480]   Well, I've got to figure out a new business model.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.640]   I think it's interesting if they become content creators.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.680]   Ultimately, this is good for content creators, right?
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.360]   What you buy is you buy a pipe.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.960]   Then you buy an ITV or a Google TV that
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.520]   lets you access that pipe, search for content,
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.840]   buy it directly from the content creator.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.320]   And if the content creator is really sharp,
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.240]   this is why Hulu is going to have a big IPO.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.960]   They're going to go public any day now, right?
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.360]   They're going to have a huge IPO because this is the play.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.280]   I have Hulu Plus right now on my iPad.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:28.960]   It's ridiculous.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.880]   It's $10 a month to watch TV shows.
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.600]   It doesn't make a lot of sense on an iPad,
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.360]   but it does make a huge amount of sense when you're thinking
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.680]   this is maybe on an ITV.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.680]   A lot of people under the age of 26--
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.080]   That's how they watch TV?
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:43.920]   My son doesn't it.
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:44.840]   He just refuses.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.880]   No, why should I do that?
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.400]   I got a video screen.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.240]   Why do I need this other stuff for?
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.120]   Well, you know that the real competition, of course,
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.760]   is a bit torn because your son's smart enough
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.760]   to get this stuff for free.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.920]   My 12-year-old son discovered the Netflix app
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.560]   and shortly thereafter I introduced him to Dr. Who.
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.880]   Oh, you must be very happy.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.080]   I'm very, very, very happy.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.240]   My son made a Dalek at a legos in the whole thing.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.680]   Oh, my God.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.640]   But here's the thing.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.080]   My son said, oh, Dr. Who.
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:18.400]   And then, first he went to Comcast on Demand,
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.360]   and they had five episodes.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.040]   It's like, OK, I'm done.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.440]   But then he got on the Netflix app
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:28.000]   and worked his way through all the recent era
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.920]   of Dr. Who episodes.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:30.960]   He got obsessed.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.800]   He watched them all in the span of two weeks.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:37.920]   And that is the kind user that is going to really thrive
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:38.960]   with this new model.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.520]   Well, and that's of course who all these companies
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.040]   are building for.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.320]   They're not building for us.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.800]   They're building for our kids.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.080]   Yeah, they don't care about us.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.920]   JC Wayne said, well, if that's the case,
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:51.000]   why does Hulu keep fighting all the people like Boxybox
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.560]   who are trying to put it on their device?
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.600]   I'll tell you why, because they want to put it--
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.040]   they want to charge you for the app,
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.120]   and they want to charge you rental.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.680]   They want to control it.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.320]   They don't want just a connection to the website.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.440]   They want to control it.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.480]   All right, we're going to take a break
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.480]   and come back with more John C. Devorak.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:06.880]   Is here?
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.880]   Thank you, John, for the bottle of Leo Villuine.
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.360]   You're conceding a little early.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.440]   I gave up on the idea of--
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.960]   besides that, if I didn't bring that in,
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.120]   I probably would have drunk it and then
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:16.960]   reneged on the bet.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.280]   John and I, Julio, had a bet.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.800]   When the iPad came out, I said, oh, this is going to be huge.
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.280]   They're going to sell 5 million units in the first year.
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:24.800]   Remember that.
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.320]   And I was a little low, I think.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.760]   I think they're going to probably do eight, right?
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:28.200]   Eight or nine?
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.120]   I don't want to talk about it.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.920]   And the bet was a bottle of wine.
[00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.280]   The bet was a bottle of Leo Villuine.
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:35.600]   Very nice, Sporto.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.040]   So I thank you.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.560]   And we're not going to drink it today, Julio,
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:39.560]   because you're not here.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.560]   So when you come out, we'll drink it.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:42.400]   Thank you.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.600]   And I'm just kidding.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.080]   We're going to drink it right after the show.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.520]   Sorry, Julio.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.040]   Before we go any further--
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.480]   No, actually, I think, John said we have to let it sit.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.440]   Yeah, we'll drink it, no one--
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.200]   It's on its side.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.400]   Should I have it slightly tilted?
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:54.760]   Should I?
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.280]   No, it's fine.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:59.040]   I want to set them into 52 degrees centigrade?
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:27:59.400]   No.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.160]   It said it made you have a poo.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.640]   Boom.
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.960]   52 degrees Fahrenheit.
[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.880]   I often confuse those.
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.440]   And right now, I want to talk a little bit
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:14.240]   about our friends at Ford and the great Ford Fiesta.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.480]   Have you seen a Fiesta yet?
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.880]   They're really-- you can't miss them.
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:17.880]   Actually, they're pretty nice.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:18.880]   They're really cute little cars.
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:19.600]   They're not that little.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.240]   They're pretty--
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.760]   No, inside they feel great.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:22.280]   I said the best.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.760]   I don't think it's that small of a car.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.360]   It's a compact car, but--
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.960]   What would you estimate?
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.280]   The mileage on that thing.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:28.840]   Just guess.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:29.320]   80?
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:30.040]   80 miles to the gallon.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:30.440]   No, come on.
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:30.920]   Stop it.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:31.600]   You know, really.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.120]   Honestly, it's a--
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.280]   I would just say 32.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.320]   40 miles a gallon highway.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.880]   409 miles a distance between LA and San Francisco
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.960]   and a single tank of gas.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.680]   Yeah, which is-- make that drive.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.160]   And you know, I will.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:42.560]   I will.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:42.920]   You know what?
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:43.760]   I will.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.000]   You know, when I was-- when we were in a deer barn
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.120]   at the Ford test track, they were showing me
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.280]   the auto park feature of the Flex.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:52.000]   And they had set it up so that there were cars all around.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:52.920]   I heard the story.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.240]   And I ran into the Fiesta.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:55.240]   You banged into it.
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.280]   Pretty hard.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:56.800]   Because I--
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.160]   Didn't the guy tell you you got to have your foot on the brake?
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.680]   He didn't tell me that after it parks,
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.320]   you might want to turn-- either turn it off
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.720]   or put your foot on the brake, because of course,
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:06.120]   the car will continue on in idle.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.200]   But I wasn't paying attention.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.760]   So boom, I hit the Fiesta.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:09.920]   This is a big heavy Flex.
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:12.960]   It's the Fiesta, not a scratch.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.480]   That's more miles per gallon highway than the Toyota Yaris.
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.880]   And it could save you up to $182 a year in gas
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.600]   over the Honda Civic.
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:21.680]   Now you know about engines, John, so you know what this means.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:26.920]   It's a DuraTech engine, 1.6 liter DuraTech I4 engine.
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:28.200]   That's good, huh?
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.040]   I don't know what that is.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.320]   I actually like the SHO engine that's in the--
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:32.680]   That's the EcoBoost?
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:33.840]   Yeah, that's the engine.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.520]   That thing, you hit the pedal.
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:36.600]   Boom.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.000]   That is a rocket ship.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.920]   The front strut suspension is McPherson.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.320]   McPherson struts.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.120]   This isn't the Fiesta.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.520]   Front sway bar, it's a twist beam rear suspension.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.320]   It really handles beautifully.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:49.360]   It's very peppy.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.480]   I want you to check out the new 2011 Ford Fiesta
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.600]   with its best in class.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.400]   Fuel efficiency, it's incredible performance and handling.
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.360]   And I think a really good-looking interior and exterior
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.600]   design you want to see for yourself.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.200]   They're just into the Ford dealers right now.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.560]   So head on out.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.560]   Drive 1 today in a Ford dealer near you,
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.080]   the incredible Ford Fiesta.
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.760]   And we think it's just so great.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.400]   It's just so great that a company, a big real company,
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.480]   like Ford supports this little old podcast.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.840]   Yeah, little.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.240]   I'm very grateful to them, John.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.920]   Not a million listeners.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.040]   Oh, Leo, can you get sink in the castle?
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.960]   Julio, I'm so glad you asked that.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.920]   Yes, of course you can.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:30.680]   I won't buy--
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.440]   Got a value add on these commercials.
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.280]   No, that's why they buy it.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.080]   I'll tell you what, we drive--
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.240]   my wife drives a Toyota.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.520]   We got that a couple of years ago.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:42.240]   Highlander, and I've convinced her
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.680]   she's going to trade in for the Flex.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.640]   The Flex is an interesting--
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.040]   Flex is a great little car.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.320]   And the thing is little.
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:48.800]   No, it's a big car.
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.280]   It's like the soccer team car.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.440]   Yeah, soccer mom.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.520]   And the thing is, I can't drive without a Flex,
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.000]   without the sink anymore.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.280]   The Toyota GPS, it's like horrible.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.000]   You can't figure out how to use it.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.760]   The sink, it's so easy to use.
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.360]   And then now you can do Pandora and Stitcher and stuff.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.440]   Boy, I worry about terrestrial music.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:10.720]   Sounds to me is what you're going to get into an accident.
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.480]   We already know I will.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.080]   So I want to turn the conversation
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.760]   to the topic that you probably discussed.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:17.520]   But I wanted to--
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.000]   Let's do it.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.520]   Because you kind of mentioned it and passed it.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.620]   It's OK because I've got Glee on my Hulu iPad
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:23.240]   plan right now.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:23.880]   Glee?
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.920]   I just love Glee, don't you?
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:27.880]   Oh, man.
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:28.760]   It's such a good show.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.800]   I need to get up here more often straighten this guy out.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:35.760]   Google Verizon deal needs yet another gaping loophole.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:36.440]   What's that?
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:36.960]   I don't know.
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:38.360]   It's just somebody wanted in the chat room
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.520]   sent this thing.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.960]   Well, click on the link and tell us.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.000]   Because I think that's a big story.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.200]   One of the people are worried that if the Google Verizon
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:48.640]   net neutrality proposal has too many exceptions,
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.200]   the recording industry is worried
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.000]   that it doesn't have enough.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.640]   In a letter sent today to Google CEO Eric Schmidt, the RIAA
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:59.080]   and other music trade groups expressed their concern
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:03.160]   that the riddled with gaping loopholes policy framework,
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.160]   nevertheless, might put a damper on ISP attempts to find
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.320]   and filter practical material flowing
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.760]   through the internet's tubes.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.320]   Oh, I know what they're talking about.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.320]   Because it's very clearly says that there's
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:16.720]   net neutrality for legal content, which
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:21.600]   is a huge loophole for Comcast because they say, well,
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.360]   you know, bittarts often illegal content.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.320]   They boom, they kill it.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.760]   So it's net neutrality only if the content's legal.
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.520]   And it's really not defined what that means.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.520]   That's what that's the loophole they're talking about.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.800]   I got another one for you.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:35.960]   You're going to like this.
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:36.440]   Google Verizon?
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.320]   No, you're going to like this.
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.600]   A long running dispute between radio broadcasters
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:44.240]   and the recording industry over the music royalties
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.800]   has taken an unexpected turn.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:50.760]   Here's the proposed settlement that every new cell phone--
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:51.880]   they want a federal mandate.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.080]   This is the Recording Industry Association of America.
[00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.720]   They want a federal mandate that every new cell phone
[00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.800]   come with a built-in FM chip.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.000]   Oh, yeah, I heard this.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.880]   So you must have some thoughts on this
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.280]   because it makes no sense to me.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.160]   Well, I could tell you I didn't bring it up on the radio show
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.040]   because I am on a lot of FM stations.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.800]   But come on.
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.400]   Come on.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.840]   Mandating, requiring that every mobile device that's
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:19.120]   made from now on in the US have a radio in it?
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.720]   That's like saying every Ford sold
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.120]   should come with a buggy whip.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.120]   What do you think, Julia?
[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:29.920]   Well, for a long time, I was really, really mad at Apple
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:33.000]   because they wouldn't put FM radios in the iPods.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.360]   I was like, "Pierious about that because I love Minnesota
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.000]   public radio.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.640]   I'm an addict."
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:40.200]   But the world is changing.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.720]   Now, for instance, an iPod Touch or an iPhone,
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:47.120]   I can drop it into a speaker dock in my kitchen.
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.360]   And I have all these audio apps.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:53.720]   I have the Minnesota public radio app and PR app to an app.
[00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.960]   Anything I want to listen to is available in app form.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:56.520]   In fact, I have an app.
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.360]   Which, by the way, Julio, is why I love this ITV Google TV
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.760]   thing because we could be an app, too, can't we?
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:02.520]   The Twitter--
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.520]   No, you will be.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:04.280]   Yeah, oh, yeah.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.880]   We are.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.200]   I love you guys on the Roku box.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:07.800]   Bye, bye.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:08.400]   Thank you.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.160]   Love it, too.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:14.200]   But here's-- the punch line is--
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:16.160]   I just suddenly dawned on me the other day.
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:18.160]   The speaker dock that I was using in the kitchen
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:21.440]   has an FM radio, which I could have very well tuned
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:22.600]   to Minnesota public radio.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.640]   But I was listening to Minnesota public radio in app form.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:28.440]   I had trained myself to lead the whole radio thing
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.600]   behind and go into the app future.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.880]   And so I'm a complete convert in this regard.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.960]   And so this FM radio requirement proposal
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.160]   just strikes me as ludicrous.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:38.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.440]   Well, try the NPR app.
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:41.120]   Who's behind it?
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:41.880]   Do we have any idea?
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:43.560]   The RIAA.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.560]   Now, Gary Shapiro--
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:45.080]   The one I wrote.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.960]   Because they want to save radio.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.040]   The Gary Shapiro, our old friend, the head of the--
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:51.720]   This is radio.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:52.800]   No, no.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.000]   They want to say a terrestrial radio, dude.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.080]   They want you to have an antenna in every device.
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:58.680]   And you're right.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.440]   I mean, Julio, the NPR app is absolutely the best
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.360]   way to listen to NPR that you can put together
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:07.080]   your own a morning edition with just the stories you want.
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:09.640]   I mean, it's infinitely better than listening to the radio.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:10.760]   Especially on the iPad.
[00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:16.400]   Gary Shapiro says this is two old media industries,
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.560]   recording industry and the radio industry.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.880]   It's like requiring everybody-- if you're
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.080]   going to make a record, you also have to make a 78.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.560]   Yes.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.040]   You must make an 8-track.
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:27.840]   This is two old media--
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.440]   By the way, I have an 8-track recorder.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.080]   Recorder?
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:32.120]   Not player.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:32.720]   Recorder?
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.800]   Yep.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.240]   Was that-- now--
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:39.200]   I bought an old Akai reel to reel,
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.040]   and it has an 8-track recorder built into it.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:43.520]   Was that unusual in those days?
[00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:45.360]   I never saw one before until recently.
[00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.000]   What did you do in the war, Daddy?
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.080]   This is two old media industries
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.880]   attacking the new wireless broadband industry,
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.600]   said Gary Shapiro, head of the Consumer Electronics Association.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.760]   This is a battle that doesn't involve us.
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.960]   We don't think Congress should accept a backroom deal,
[00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.440]   and I sound like Marty Frickert, on how an iPhone should
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.320]   be designed-- sorry, Gary.
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.120]   We think consumers should choose, and companies should choose.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:11.040]   Gary's a good guy on this one.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:11.560]   I know.
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:12.400]   He's a good guy on this one.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.200]   Yeah, what do you think?
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.880]   He'll make us sound like an old fart.
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.880]   He is an old fart, but he's a good old fart.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:17.240]   OK.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.240]   Well, there you go.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.560]   Gary, I tried.
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:20.800]   I tried Gary.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:23.600]   No, I like Gary, and he's absolutely right in this case.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.960]   But he's representing Apple and all these other guys
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:27.960]   who make the boxes.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.320]   They're saying, we're not going to put--
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.440]   you're telling us we have to spend another $0.25
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.680]   to put an FM radio in this?
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.520]   Look, I have an FM radio in my Android phone.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:36.840]   I never listened to it.
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.520]   Julio, do you have an FM radio in your phone
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.640]   or any of your devices?
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:43.320]   Well, yeah, some of the Android phones I have FM radios.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:47.280]   But here's why this is so ridiculous to me personally,
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:52.440]   and to probably a lot of other people younger than myself.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:58.280]   I never listen to anything, radio or television live.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.280]   I never, ever do that.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.280]   I'm a big fan of Minnesota Public Radio.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.280]   Listen after the podcast.
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.280]   Yeah, the podcasts.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.880]   I just subscribed to all the podcasts.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.480]   I told Minnesota Public Radio, there
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:11.160]   are a lot of shows of yours that I like.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.160]   But if you don't provide them in podcast form,
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.240]   I'm not going to listen to them.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:17.040]   I don't have the time to schedule around you.
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.320]   We're big believers in live.
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:21.280]   Look, we spent a lot of money to stream everything we do live
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.000]   over the internet.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.040]   I think live is great because we can take questions.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:26.280]   It can be interactive.
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.400]   There's something about it.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.000]   It's more lively and fun.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.120]   But you don't have to have a radio to do that.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.600]   You can do it over the internet perfectly well.
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.800]   Yeah, and most people still take it recorded.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.560]   Absolutely.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.200]   By far.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.080]   90% of our own issues.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.360]   No, the only reason you do it, because we actually
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.440]   do this on no agenda.
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.040]   I mean, we took it.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:43.720]   You do it live, too.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:44.560]   Yeah.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.480]   Only for that reason, because the chat room
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:50.720]   goes off and the chat room is essentially a Greek chorus.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.240]   Right.
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.160]   And they have their opinions of things.
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.440]   And there's always evil doers in there,
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.880]   but they tend to be wiped out by the rest of the group.
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.880]   And it's very useful.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.440]   I mean, right here, I'm basically only using the chat rooms
[00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:04.800]   information.
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.200]   Yeah, you stopped looking at anything else.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.480]   You're just watching the chat room.
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.720]   I'm still seeing what stories they want us to talk about.
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:10.920]   It says it should be.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.120]   You are the voice of the people, John C. Devorah.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.680]   I am representing them well.
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:15.520]   I hope.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.520]   So Mitch, Mitch--
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:20.680]   Leo, to just digress, I just want to tell you something funny.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.440]   I listened to all your podcasts, but all of them
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:25.440]   in audio form, they go on my iPhone.
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.040]   I listened to it on your form, even though they're
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.320]   available in video.
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.040]   But something funny happened the other day.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:34.560]   I was trying to listen to iPad today in audio form.
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:38.120]   The first to quit podcast that just absolutely does not
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:38.840]   work as audio.
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:39.680]   Oh, really?
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:40.120]   You have to watch it.
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:40.720]   Isn't that funny?
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.200]   That was the first one.
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:45.000]   That's the first one where I had this completely sucked.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.200]   Oh, which episode was it, though?
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.120]   I think it was the productivity one.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.400]   See, that's what I worry a little bit.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.240]   Just because sometimes you overdo the visuals.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.960]   Yeah, that's how I'm worried a little bit that we might,
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:58.720]   because-- and this is-- TV is a harsh mistress to coin,
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:02.000]   to paraphrase Roberta Highline.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.240]   The pictures start taking over the ideas.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:05.520]   They start taking over the words.
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.080]   And that isn't what I want.
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:11.560]   By the way, Nightflyer has found on eBay in a CHI X1810
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.760]   real-to-reel recorder with eight-track player.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:16.120]   That's the one that's the unit I've got.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.480]   How much is that?
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.640]   How much is that on eBay?
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.320]   I want one too.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.760]   If John's got one, Nightflyer, give me the price.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:25.000]   So Mitch Bainwall, who is the chief executive
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:26.880]   of the Recording Industry Association of America,
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.720]   says, now he's the guy she took like Marty Frickert.
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:32.520]   Nothing is locked down yet.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.640]   But we're on the pressure pitch of an historic breakthrough.
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.440]   He said, and historic breakthrough, by the way.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.720]   Well, you don't have to do.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.080]   No, in fact, it's optional.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:41.960]   I can't say--
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.360]   I say, and historic.
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.000]   Yeah, I do too.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.440]   But apparently, I'm an prehistoric person,
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:49.720]   because nowadays it's considered a gosh or--
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.720]   To say, and historic.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.120]   Or an anachronism.
[00:39:52.120 --> 00:39:53.560]   It's anachronism, yeah.
[00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.720]   I ask Grammer Girl.
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.240]   She said, no, you shouldn't do it.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:56.920]   She would say no.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.240]   She would say, a historic.
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.720]   But it's hard for me to say, a historic.
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.680]   I like an historic.
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:02.480]   It sounds better.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:05.520]   An historic breakthrough.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.320]   I remember when piano rolls were about to eat our lunch.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:12.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:14.000]   I think there's no way.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:20.600]   There's $50 shipping, $150 for this tea act, for this--
[00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:21.240]   a kai.
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:21.740]   Yeah.
[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:22.720]   That's a good deal, John.
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.080]   I could make my own eight tracks.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:24.920]   Should we-- OK.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:25.680]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:26.800]   I'd like to ask the Twitter audience--
[00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.320]   You've got to buy the blank eight tracks.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.160]   That's the hard part.
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:33.840]   Is it like, to it to be available in eight track form?
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:34.640]   It's about time.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.080]   There's probably a couple of guys out here.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.320]   Does your idea have an old Lincoln?
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:41.080]   My question is, would we distribute more versions
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.400]   on eight track or agivorbis?
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.400]   Probably eight track.
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.400]   But eight track would be agivorbis, just barely.
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.600]   You have to go Edison cylinders, Phil.
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:50.680]   There you go.
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.080]   We're agivorbis.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.240]   Everybody says they want the eight track.
[00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.080]   This is an example of why sometimes it's
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.880]   not good to ask your audience what they want.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.640]   Because they'll say things like, oh, no,
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:01.920]   we'd listen on eight tracks.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.200]   Yeah, they wouldn't sell one.
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:04.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:09.240]   You could charge us $15 a month for that.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.160]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.120]   John, find another story from the chat room, would you?
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.680]   That is, yeah.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.560]   Something good.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.400]   Chat room.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:17.680]   Chat room, we're asking you for the--
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:18.680]   it's all on you now.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:21.920]   And while I talk about our friends at Carbonite and Carbonite
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:26.720]   Pro, which is an example of a company listening to its consumers,
[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:29.840]   its users, and saying, hey, hey, there's
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.280]   something we could do here.
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.280]   It's carbonite.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:33.080]   I've talked about it before.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.000]   It's that online backup.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:34.640]   It was automatic.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.840]   You put it on your Mac or your PC.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.840]   It automatically backs up to the cloud using AES-256 bit
[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:41.120]   encryption, 128-bit SSL.
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.000]   It's always there.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.080]   You can get to your backup from any machine, any machine
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:46.800]   anywhere you log on to your Carbonite account.
[00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:50.560]   They even have an Apple iPhone and a BlackBerry app for free.
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.600]   So you know you got a backup.
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:53.880]   You can look at it on your iPhone.
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.600]   You can access it.
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:58.880]   So everybody loves Carbonite, the consumer version.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.480]   Carbonite started talking to its customers,
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:03.640]   and they found out that literally hundreds of thousands
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:06.360]   of their Carbonite consumer customers were businesses.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.600]   We're small businesses saying there's
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.040]   nothing equivalent in business.
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.960]   This is such a good solution.
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:16.240]   We're going to kind of misuse it in business.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.800]   So they said, well, we could do better than that.
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.480]   And they came up with Carbonite Pro,
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:22.040]   and I got to tell you, this is a great solution.
[00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:25.320]   Go ahead, and I invite you to try to look for other comparable
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:25.800]   solutions.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:27.560]   You won't find anything as good as this.
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.360]   I know I've looked.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.960]   I was sitting with Ken last week, and we were saying, well,
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.040]   what are some-- no, no, that's too expensive.
[00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:35.000]   No, that won't do it.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.040]   No.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.920]   Carbonite is amazing.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:38.480]   Here's the deal.
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:40.600]   Go right now to CarbonitePro.com.
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:43.160]   Just sign up for free for 30 days.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.960]   You'll really get a sense of what it can do.
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.360]   Now, the way Carbonite Pro works is there's a centralized
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:47.840]   dashboard.
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:50.440]   He's Windows only right now, I should say,
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:53.320]   which is probably fine for small business at this point.
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.240]   Mac version is on the way, I promise you.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.720]   But right now for your Windows machine.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:59.360]   So you get a copy for every machine in your office,
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.640]   however many machines you've got.
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:03.160]   You have a centralized dashboard,
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.360]   so you can see which machines are backed up, which aren't.
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.960]   Here's a nice thing.
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:11.840]   Your users, your employees, can restore any time they want.
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.520]   So they don't have to make that perp walk down
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:15.440]   to the IT department.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.920]   I erased my spreadsheet.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.120]   Can you get it back for me?
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:19.480]   They can do it themselves.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:23.480]   And as I said, they can do it from any computer they log on.
[00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:24.240]   Now, here's the beauty.
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.520]   You don't pay a per-seat license.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:27.880]   You just pay for the storage you use.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:31.080]   There's no setup fee, no hardware to buy, no training.
[00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:34.080]   You just install Carbonite, and you're done.
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.480]   It just starts backing up.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:38.400]   Very affordable too.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.840]   I'll give you some examples.
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:42.760]   20 gigabytes to 50 gigabytes is $25 a month.
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:46.680]   That means if you had 10 users, five gigabytes each,
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:48.540]   25 bucks a month, that's all.
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:52.800]   The prices are great.
[00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:54.640]   The software is great.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:56.600]   It works so well.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:59.120]   I highly recommend you try it,
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:00.280]   and you could try it free for a month.
[00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.040]   Just go to carbonitepro.com.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:04.280]   You don't have to use any offer code.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.520]   They'll know to its sentium.
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:09.240]   Your data is secure.
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.120]   It's encrypted.
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:11.040]   It's private.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:14.920]   And it's always, always safe.
[00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.640]   Just imagine what it would cost if you lost all your data.
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.720]   Would you still be in business tomorrow if you didn't?
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:21.240]   I know we wouldn't.
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.400]   Carbonitepro.com.
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.120]   We're thanking for their support of this week
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:24.960]   in tech.
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.040]   John C. Devorak is here.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:27.760]   Channeldevorak.com.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:30.000]   He's also the host with Adam Curry,
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.880]   who we did invite to be on this show.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:33.680]   About three minutes before we started.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.680]   (laughs)
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:36.520]   He's buying a car.
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:37.440]   He thinks you hate him.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.920]   I don't like him, but he can be on the show.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:41.000]   No, I like Adam.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.960]   You know where Adam and I went a little bad?
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:46.280]   That whole Callie Lewis thing.
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:49.200]   But now that he hates Callie, it's okay.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:51.680]   No, you know, I'm the only one who still likes Callie apparently.
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:55.080]   I love Callie, Callie, and I never had a problem.
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:57.680]   So Callie did a post in which she said, oh-
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.280]   Oh, you're the one who began this because of your,
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:02.880]   your political inclinations.
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:03.880]   No, no, no.
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.880]   Callie tweets, I can't believe,
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:07.680]   it turns out it wasn't Callie, it was Neil, her husband,
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:11.200]   but Callie was very loyal and never said this.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:12.600]   She could have thrown Neil to the wolves,
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:14.360]   just like Apple could throw ATT to the wolves,
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:16.120]   but they didn't, she didn't.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.200]   Neil posted, I can't believe anybody believes
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.280]   this hoax of global warming.
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:24.240]   And I said, well, you know, you could dispute
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:26.480]   whether it's man-made or not, but I don't think it's a hoax.
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:29.120]   And I think that you could, so I posted this on our blog.
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:31.400]   Just a comment on our blog.
[00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:33.600]   And you know who stirred the pot?
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.160]   Your friend and mine, Adam Curry,
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:38.480]   who started playing clips of me from the show,
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.760]   started, he really wanted to get it revved up.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.320]   And I just ignored it and it went away.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:44.200]   Well, apparently it didn't.
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.280]   Well, I remembered it.
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:47.680]   See, I don't forget anything, any slight,
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:50.880]   any time you hurt me, I will.
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:53.400]   You have a long memory, long, evil memory.
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.240]   Behind you.
[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.960]   And do that thing with the knees.
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:58.200]   Knee, right there and knock you over.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.800]   That's very Puerto Rican, if you leave.
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.320]   (laughing)
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:03.960]   Now, wait a minute, just want you to know,
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.320]   holy hell, he's Puerto Rican.
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:07.160]   So he can save that.
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:08.000]   He can save everyone.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.760]   So, okay, so every, but like three or four people
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:11.040]   sent this one thing in.
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:13.880]   Virgil Mobile USA Unlimited Pre-Pain Mobile Broadband.
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:14.880]   Yeah, people are excited about this.
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:15.880]   So you can go to my five.
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:17.600]   Why is the mobile broadband for four?
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.240]   You can get a MyFi from Virgin.
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:20.800]   They're, they're a sprint, by the way.
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:22.160]   I thought they were just gonna.
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.000]   Who's Sprint?
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.080]   Virgin Mobile is Sprint.
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.720]   They're using the Sprint network.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.560]   Yeah, they're in the own by Sprint.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.240]   No, they are on by Sprint.
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.880]   I think Sprint, yeah.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.760]   Sprint bought, Sprint brought the majority share
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.400]   from Richard Branson of Virgil Mobile.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.400]   Virgin was originally not Sprint.
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.880]   They are on by Sprint, yeah, so okay.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:38.880]   So the chat room agreement.
[00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.560]   It was an MVNO Sprint bought out, Richard.
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:43.040]   Not too long, maybe a year ago.
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.080]   No, I didn't, I missed it.
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.640]   In any of, well, I did too, it doesn't matter.
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:47.040]   The only reason I know that is somebody in the chat room
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.200]   told me that once years ago.
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:50.280]   So, here's the deal.
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:53.040]   You get that MyFi card, we all love the MyFi card.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:56.360]   Normally 60 bucks a month from Verizon,
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:00.880]   60 bucks a month from Sprint, 40 bucks from Virgin Mobile.
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:02.560]   And if it's the same as the other Virgin Mobile stuff,
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:04.400]   I think it's no contract, it's months to month.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.560]   Is it month to month chat room?
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:07.360]   That's what it sounds like in this article.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.400]   That's a good deal.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.920]   But you know what I prefer,
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.120]   and I think it's really the way to go
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:15.360]   is using an Android phone to tether.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:18.080]   I only paid 20 bucks a month to Verizon
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:19.600]   for tethering the Droid X.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.440]   And that turns this into a Wi-Fi access spot.
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:22.280]   So I got rid of my Wi-Fi.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.680]   That's an HTC, what is that?
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.160]   This is the Motorola Droid X.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.000]   Oh, I have to say that.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.320]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.160]   Baby, it's sweet.
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.280]   This is the one you moved to?
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:30.120]   This is your latest basis.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:31.120]   That's my phone.
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.080]   So you dropped the Nexus One.
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:33.920]   I still have it.
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:35.000]   I like the Nexus One.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:35.840]   If that thing ran--
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:37.400]   This thing is huge, but it's light.
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:38.880]   It's huge, but it's light.
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:39.720]   Julio, are you okay?
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.200]   Did you fall over, sir?
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.360]   Oh, he's getting his.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.360]   What are you using, Julio?
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.200]   Wait a minute, let's get these.
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.640]   He's gonna get the headphones back on.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.240]   He doesn't know we're watching him.
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.280]   This is interesting.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.120]   So what do you,
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:51.160]   you went and got your phone, Julio?
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:53.600]   Hello.
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:54.600]   First to Julio.
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:55.600]   Yeah, I'm here.
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:56.600]   Sorry.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:57.600]   Did you get your phone?
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:58.600]   That's the way for phone.
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:00.600]   Yeah, we were watching, but was that to get your phone
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:01.600]   or just because you had to go back from?
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.600]   Well, I wanted to, I just, since you mentioned Verizon--
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:04.600]   I thought so.
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:05.600]   What do you use?
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:06.600]   Is that the Droid II?
[00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:07.600]   Is that the Droid II?
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:08.600]   Show it to the camera.
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:09.600]   There we go.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.600]   Looks just like the Droid I.
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:15.600]   The keyboard is night and day improvement.
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:18.600]   The keyboard on the Droid I was completely--
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:19.600]   Unusable.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.600]   The keyboard on the Droid II has more texture to it.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.600]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:25.600]   I can really, really fly on the thing.
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.600]   It has a refined appearance.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:33.600]   They did away with the little track pad, the little dial thing that they had on the right
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:35.600]   of the old keyboard.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:42.600]   It's not a quantum leap over the Droid I, but it's an incremental improvement that actually
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.600]   makes the thing fully usable.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:46.600]   Well, it comes with the--
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:50.600]   In the physical keyboard and the on-screen keyboard, where with the original Droid I never
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:52.600]   heard used the physical keyboard.
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:53.600]   No, I'm with you on that.
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:54.600]   I hated that one.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:55.600]   So why doesn't it do the thing?
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.600]   I turned that off.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:57.600]   I don't like that.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:58.600]   He's saying, why doesn't it rotate?
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:48:59.600]   And I just turned that off.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:00.600]   No.
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:03.600]   But I just turned it off because it confuses me.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:04.600]   Sometimes it's sideways.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:06.600]   So it's 2.2.
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.600]   It's the latest version of Android.
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:09.600]   So you can tether it.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.600]   It's a gigahertz processor in there, right?
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:13.600]   So you got this thing.
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:14.600]   So you can tether this one?
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:15.600]   No, I'm not talking about that.
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:16.600]   I'm talking about Julio's phone.
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:17.600]   That one's 2.1 still.
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:18.600]   Oh, you haven't gotten a 2.1 still.
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:19.600]   No.
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:20.600]   So the Droid II is 2.2.
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:22.600]   2.2 is a huge improvement.
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:24.600]   No, they say any day now for the Droid X.
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:25.600]   I love that phone.
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:26.600]   And look, I got little fishes.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:28.600]   Yeah, it's kind of creepy, actually.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:29.600]   I got an aquarium in there.
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:30.600]   Look where I go on.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.600]   You scroll over and you can feed the fish.
[00:49:32.600 --> 00:49:33.600]   You want to feed the fish?
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:35.600]   Okay, now tap the top of the screen there.
[00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:38.600]   A couple of times, a little fish food will come down.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:40.600]   And the fish will go eat it.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:41.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:42.600]   Yeah, pretty cool.
[00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:43.600]   Look, see, they're all eating.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:44.600]   It's ridiculous.
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:45.600]   This is the problem with America today.
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:46.600]   [laughter]
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:51.600]   Come on, a minute, John, you love that.
[00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:52.600]   You don't have to do that.
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:53.600]   Well, not that bad.
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.600]   Do you use a live wallpaper, Julio?
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.600]   Oh, yeah, I love the galaxy.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:49:58.600]   Yeah, that's a pretty one.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:49:59.600]   This is stars going by.
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:01.600]   This one is a paid thing.
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:02.600]   It's called aquarium.
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:04.600]   How many screens you got on this thing?
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:06.600]   Well, I'm using a different launcher.
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:08.600]   It's called launcher pro gives me 7.
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:11.600]   But that's actually, as you can see, I'm not filling them up.
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.600]   No, they're all empty.
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:21.600]   But the Dry 2 is hands down the phone that I would use if I prefer an iPhone.
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:24.600]   But if I had to not use an iPhone, the Dry 2 would definitely--
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:27.600]   How is your iPhone reception in the Minneapolis and the Twin Cities?
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:29.600]   I don't really have a problem.
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:34.600]   I was able to duplicate the antenna issue with the iPhone 4,
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.600]   but then I stuck it in a Griffin case and I was fine.
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:41.600]   And it's, you know, service in the Twin Cities is fantastic.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:47.600]   You know, they're reporting ironically that the Dry 2 is having the same kind of dropped calls
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:53.600]   and antenna gate style attenuation on the phone.
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:55.600]   I don't know if that's true.
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:58.600]   This is coming from mobile crunch, but that's pretty funny if it does.
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:50:59.600]   You haven't seen that?
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:01.600]   I haven't been able to duplicate the iPhone.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:02.600]   It's a nice phone.
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:04.600]   Look, Android is now--
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:10.600]   Google announced last week that they are now installing 200,000, 200,000
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:13.600]   Android phones a day.
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:15.600]   The scanner is extremely quick.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:16.600]   Yeah.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:17.600]   Well, so, yeah, this is a nice phone.
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:18.600]   I just scanned this thing in the chat.
[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:19.600]   Yeah, Fezzorama, yeah.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:20.600]   Interesting.
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:23.600]   200,000 is a day that's 1.4 million a week.
[00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:28.600]   And if my math is correct, that's over 5 million a month.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:30.600]   New Android phones.
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:36.600]   Yeah, there's an interesting new Android angle that sort of come up recently.
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:39.600]   Android phones are starting to filter into the prepaid space.
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:41.600]   You mentioned Virgin a little while ago.
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:47.600]   Boost mobile, and I think one or two other of the prepaid carries are starting to carry
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:49.600]   Android phones and blackberries as well.
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:50.600]   That's interesting.
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:51.600]   It's very interesting.
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:55.600]   They don't-- they're not really great Android phones.
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.600]   They use an old version of the operating system.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:58.600]   They're a little bit more likely to use.
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:03.600]   But prepaid used to be associated with really crappy phones.
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:05.600]   That's starting to really not be the case.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:07.600]   All right.
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:08.600]   Now in another story.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:11.600]   I love your sense of timing, my friend.
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:17.600]   So, did you see-- what's your thoughts on this crazy story about the-- oh, the virus got
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.600]   into the computer and the airplane crashed or we didn't have the record of the-- you
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:21.600]   know about that story.
[00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:22.600]   No.
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:23.600]   Oh.
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:24.600]   Are you talking about deep water?
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:29.600]   No, this recent thing where they just said they-- Mac, if you want these virus companies,
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:31.600]   there's some MD11 crashed recently.
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:32.600]   You don't know anything about it.
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:33.600]   Oh, can everyone--
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:34.600]   I can read it.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.600]   Is this something I might have heard on No Agenda with Adam Curry?
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:39.600]   We did talk about it, but somebody brought it up in this topic here.
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:41.600]   Were there black helicopters anywhere in the problem?
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:44.600]   No, but a saucer came in and the grays walked out.
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:45.600]   So, by the way, I didn't finish this.
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.600]   Adam is welcome on the show anytime.
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:48.600]   Okay.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:49.600]   That's all he wants me to do.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:50.600]   He says, "You've got a big Leo to let me on."
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:51.600]   Why would he want to be on?
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.600]   He says he's got some points to make and he wants to--
[00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:55.600]   Oh, dear.
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:58.600]   And he wants to-- actually, you know what the real reason is?
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:52:59.600]   What?
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:00.600]   He wants to plug his app.
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:01.600]   What is this?
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.600]   Oh, yeah, the application app.
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:05.600]   That's a really good idea.
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:09.600]   So, in an application, there's another example of how apps are great for content.
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:10.600]   No, that's really the only reason.
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:11.600]   He doesn't care about--
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:12.600]   He doesn't give a damn.
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:14.600]   You can come in and just have him plug his app and then he will--
[00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:17.600]   I don't know, look, you got to sing for your supper, John.
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:18.600]   You can't just come in and plug something--
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:20.600]   Whatever I do, I'm digging myself into a hole here.
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:23.600]   I'm just telling you, Adam wants to do this show.
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:29.600]   So, the Span Air Flight 502 to crashed moments after taking off from Madrid,
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:35.600]   Barajas International Airport in 2008, 154 souls lost.
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:39.600]   New documents from an investigation into the incident are showing.
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:46.600]   This is according to MSNBC that a malware infection may have been to blame.
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:51.600]   Now, I understand why Intel paid $7.68 billion from a cafe.
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:56.600]   According to the investigation, the computer system used to monitor technical problems on the plane was
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:59.600]   infected with a Trojan.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:00.600]   Sounds like bullcrap.
[00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:01.600]   You shouldn't use windows right there.
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:03.600]   That is the problem there.
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:06.600]   As a result, there were no alerts or warnings for three technical issues,
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:11.600]   which, had they been detected, may have prevented the plane from taking off.
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:15.600]   The investigations is still not completing authorities to determine just how the malware
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:16.600]   got into the computer system in question.
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:18.600]   Wow, that is quite a story.
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:19.600]   Yeah, that's a weird story.
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:21.600]   It's a ground computer, by the way, not a plane-based computer.
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:22.600]   Right.
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:26.600]   So, I'm going to go back and discuss the issue with why Intel bought Maccathy.
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:34.600]   I've been saying for $7-plus billion or almost $8 billion, you know, when you get to the B's,
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:41.600]   $7.68 billion, that's $6.68, doesn't sound like it, but that's $680 million.
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:43.600]   So, let's not, let's not, this is cash.
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:51.600]   This is an even stock, $7 billion, $680 million for a washed up antivirus company.
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:55.600]   That's why I'm asking you, what do you think?
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:56.600]   I think, I think-
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:57.600]   Why did they do it?
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:58.600]   They're goofballs.
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:54:59.600]   Why?
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:00.600]   They're goofballs.
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:01.600]   Isn't that the right answer?
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:03.600]   That's the reason that Intel does everything.
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:06.600]   Intel, correct me if I'm wrong, what do they sell?
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:07.600]   Chips.
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:09.600]   Do they sell software?
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:10.600]   Not that I know of.
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:11.600]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:13.600]   Do they sell computers?
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:16.600]   Maybe some development machines.
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:20.600]   Yeah, but no, no, really what they do is they sell chips to people who sell computers.
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:22.880]   They don't sell software.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:25.160]   They don't bundle software.
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:28.600]   You know, you don't get a copy of McCaffee when you get a court to duo.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.600]   Who will now?
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:33.200]   Is it Julio?
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:35.600]   Could they build an antivirus into the chip?
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:42.640]   Well, that's entirely possible, but my reaction to this story was essentially, you know, good
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:43.640]   riddance.
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:49.960]   I can't recall the last time I installed a Norton or a McCaffee security suite on my computer.
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:54.920]   So security essentials, which is absolutely free, is, you know, more than sufficient.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:56:02.480]   And so this is a big number and it has some interesting implications, but it's just, it's
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:03.480]   irrelevant to me.
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:05.680]   I don't really care about McCaffee or Norton anymore.
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:07.640]   Well, it's bizarre that they would buy.
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:13.600]   Go ahead and get that while I give you this word from answers.com.
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:16.360]   McCaffee is pronounced McAfee.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:18.840]   Yeah, McAfee.
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:19.840]   Thank you.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:20.840]   You looked it up because I said McAfee.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:21.840]   And you said it right.
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:26.560]   No, no, somebody in the chat room said, just so you know, it's not McAfee.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:28.200]   No, it's always been McAfee.
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:29.520]   McAfee's claimed to fame.
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:35.720]   And I think he's a marketing genius for this was to create a newsletter and a subsystem
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:38.840]   to promote the idea that you're going to be attacked by viruses.
[00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:40.440]   This is before they became popular.
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:44.080]   And this was after Peter Norton said, there's no such thing as a computer virus, if you
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:45.400]   recall that.
[00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:47.000]   And they're just unimportant.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.280]   And McAfee started doing this newsletter.
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:53.080]   It was called the, there was some security newsletter and nobody was selling antivirus
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:54.360]   software at the time.
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:57:00.480]   So he rolled out the stuff with all these crazy viruses that these kids were mostly developing
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:02.440]   for old DOS machines.
[00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:06.360]   And the next thing you know, there was a couple of outbreaks, some crazy things happened where
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.000]   people's hard disks were erased.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.040]   Because in those days, the deal was you were raised a hard disk.
[00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:13.960]   And the next thing you know, that's right.
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:14.960]   That's right.
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:15.960]   That was our day.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:21.040]   And the next thing you know, he's got an antivirus software company and he's a billionaire.
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:22.840]   I mean, I just thought this was the way to do it.
[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:28.960]   He created the market for viruses, promoted it and then sold the, the, the antidote.
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:34.000]   He was a programmer at NASA's Institute for Space Studies in New York City, went to Univac
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.960]   as a software designer later as Xerox as an operating system architect.
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:40.320]   He joined a 78 computer sciences corporation.
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:43.280]   This is from his bio on Wikipedia, which we know is authoritative.
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:44.280]   Absolutely true.
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:48.920]   As a software consultant later, while employed by Lockheed in the 1980s, he's John, we could
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:49.920]   have done this.
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:50.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:52.840]   No, we would have been contenders.
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:58.040]   He received a copy of the Pakistani brain computer virus, very early virus and wrote the
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:00.680]   first antivirus software.
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:04.120]   He used the shareware business model was one of the first to do so in 1989.
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:06.480]   It's 89 as recently as 99.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:11.320]   He quit Lockheed and began working full time at his company, McAfee Associates, which he
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:13.680]   operated from his home in Santa Clara, California.
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:14.680]   So there you go.
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:20.640]   Now, when Intel bought it last week, it was doing two billion a year in revenue.
[00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:23.200]   So it means it's worth two billion actually, maybe four.
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:24.200]   What is the multiple?
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.200]   One year, two years.
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:26.200]   One.
[00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:30.680]   But you know, for a growth company, it could be two, it could be up to 10, but for a business
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:33.560]   like that, it had to figure any virus is not on the upstairs.
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:35.840]   Two years since Microsoft offering free.
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:37.840]   I have no idea why they paid so much.
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:39.840]   It's bizarre.
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:46.520]   McAfee's in August 2009, the New York Times reported that McAfee's personal fortune had
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:47.520]   declined.
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:53.200]   He was worth $100 million, but the effect of the global financial crisis and recession,
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:55.000]   he's only worth four million now.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   Oh, really?
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   That's sad.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   It happens.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   But anyway, Peter Norton's got a whole museum.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   Yeah, Peter.
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:06.360]   Well, Peter became a, he's a real good deal and he's always been an art collector.
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:07.480]   Yeah, an art guy.
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:11.560]   And so he started collecting before he even sold his company.
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:16.320]   If you were Intel and you were running around with $7.68 billion, burning a hole in your
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:17.960]   pocket, what would you spend it on?
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:19.880]   I would buy you out, Leo.
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.400]   You know what?
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:24.120]   They could have given me just the point.
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:26.760]   Just the point 768 I would have taken.
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:28.200]   I don't know why they paid so much.
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:30.440]   That's why I think there's something behind this.
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:31.440]   They have a patent.
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:33.400]   They had their some screwball thing.
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:37.400]   There's something in the background lurking and they've been Intel now owns it.
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:38.400]   And they're going to leverage it.
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:39.960]   That's the only thing I can think of.
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:45.440]   I do also think that the operating system is no longer the vector for viruses.
[00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:49.640]   I think that both Apple and Microsoft have pretty much figured out how to lock down
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:50.640]   the OS.
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:55.320]   Yeah, we're still seeing exploits, but, but virus authors are moving on to either third
[00:59:55.320 --> 01:00:03.480]   party software like Flash, Adobe Reader, or I think the future in young man, Go Mobile
[01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:04.480]   young man.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.480]   The future for malware is going to be on these little devices.
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:07.480]   Yeah, I'm waiting.
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:10.080]   I just I can't believe we haven't seen a big malware attack.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.720]   That's going to happen soon.
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:12.720]   You agree, Holia?
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:15.680]   So, no, later, yeah.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.680]   Why not now?
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.480]   I don't understand what's taken them so long that we've seen a couple.
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:25.600]   There was a Trojan that was distributed a wallpaper app for Android that I think sent text messages
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:28.080]   to a premium text service.
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:30.640]   So you'd get billed for 20 bucks or 50 bucks or whatever it was.
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:31.640]   That's a good bit.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:34.400]   That's a good that's an old fashioned idea that still would pay off.
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:36.400]   No, that's a good one.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.400]   I've got a question for you.
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.840]   You're you're a big Android proponent.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.240]   You love the openness.
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:44.000]   It's a wide open platform.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.280]   Apple has its platform locked down.
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:52.040]   It takes very great care in what it allows into its ecosystem.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.840]   My question to you is, you know, doesn't that make Android more vulnerable?
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.400]   Oh, that was such a softball thing.
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:58.880]   I want to thank you.
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:01.920]   Julio Ojeda Zapata for making my life easier.
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.200]   Just throw me a softball.
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:10.080]   See, Apple, Apple distributes the illusion of security because you cannot look at hundreds
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:14.800]   of thousands of apps and say with any certainty that those apps are safe.
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.520]   Notice Apple gives you no guarantee.
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:21.600]   And in fact, we know very well that apps sneak through the Apple vetting process and do things
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:26.840]   that Apple didn't intend, whether it's an Easter egg or that app that was unlocking people's
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:30.120]   iTunes accounts and sending their passwords out to the developer.
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.120]   These things do happen.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:35.920]   So, yeah, Apple vets apps, but I don't think that that necessarily makes you any safer.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.440]   I think it's purely the illusion of safety.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:42.800]   I mean, truly, do you think Apple can find every bit of malware and every program it
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:43.800]   looks at?
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.920]   It's a camera plus situation.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.360]   Is that perfect example?
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:53.200]   Yeah, there was a flashlight program that had tethering, would enable tethering if you
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:54.200]   knew the Easter egg.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:56.160]   That stuff sneaks by all the time.
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:00.000]   You cannot, unless you're looking at the source code and even then it takes real expertise,
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.200]   you cannot truthfully certify that an app does everything that it says it does and nothing
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.520]   that it doesn't say.
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:07.680]   You can't.
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:10.520]   So I don't think that that gives you any security.
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.880]   We're just, it's just a matter of time before somebody writes an app.
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:16.360]   And if you could do that execution thing that we saw with the, you know, let's jailbreak
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.360]   slide.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.360]   Well, exactly.
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.360]   That shows you the thing is wide open for abuse.
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:20.920]   Now, Apple has patched that, of course.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:23.160]   The 4.2 are patched, but that's you right.
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:24.600]   I'm sure there are others.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:29.400]   So another story that's floating around seems to be something about Google the movie.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.040]   Yeah, that's just a joke.
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.040]   Oh, is it?
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.240]   Now, we can talk about the social network.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.720]   That's the Facebook movie that's coming out next month.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:37.720]   Yeah.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.920]   And apparently Mark Zuckerberg is not happy.
[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:45.120]   Elliot Shragg, the director of communications at Facebook saw the movie and said, we don't
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:46.120]   like it.
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.120]   I'm sure they don't.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.120]   Is it?
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.120]   Well, they're women though.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:51.680]   Normally Hollywood won't they make a deal with the public figure that they're going to
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:52.680]   cover?
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:55.520]   I mean, I guess, you know, Richard Nixon.
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.200]   Time to face on a book.
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:58.200]   Yeah.
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.080]   Can I catch off the hook?
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.080]   Yep.
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:02.080]   It does.
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:07.560]   Yeah, if you're true to the book, they have to sue the book.
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:08.560]   I don't know.
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:09.560]   I think that would be worth watching.
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:13.560]   So you saw the trailer, the original, the trailer for the social network, right?
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.400]   The Facebook movie.
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:16.880]   You've seen that, right?
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:17.880]   John?
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:18.880]   No.
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:19.880]   Have you not?
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:20.880]   Oh, okay.
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:21.880]   Well, okay.
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:23.640]   So in order to set up this Twitter movie, we've got to set it up with the Facebook one.
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:25.480]   So let me show you the Facebook.
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:26.880]   You mean the Google movie?
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:28.760]   Well, I don't know about the Google one.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:29.760]   There's a Twitter one.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:30.760]   What's the Google?
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:31.760]   This is a new meme.
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:32.760]   Let's get back to the Hitler movies.
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:33.760]   This is a new meme.
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:37.680]   This is replacing Hitler because the Hitler thing you can't do anymore.
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:44.360]   So this is the new meme is to make a parody of the social network trailer.
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:48.800]   So in order to see, in order to understand the parody, you've got to see the, let me
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:52.520]   play the trailer if I can find it here for the social network, which I'm excited about.
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:53.680]   I think it's going to be good.
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:54.680]   I don't know.
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:55.680]   You don't think so?
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:57.680]   Yeah, I doubt it.
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:00.080]   This is the social network.
[01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:05.320]   This is the upcoming movie written by Aaron Sorkin, by the way, about Facebook.
[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.720]   And I'll read you any sort of...
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.600]   Oh, he sounds like a Sorkin movie.
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.120]   Yeah, you can hear it.
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:12.120]   Yeah.
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.120]   It's like the West Wing.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:14.120]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:15.120]   Is this it?
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.120]   This is noted.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:17.320]   You know, I hate it.
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.320]   That's wonderful.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:19.320]   Is this it?
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.320]   It is it.
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.320]   There are several trailers.
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:22.320]   Okay.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.320]   This is wonderful.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.320]   This is terrible.
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.320]   It's not so good.
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:28.400]   Before they had a movie, they were just using stills.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.400]   This is...
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.400]   Huh?
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:34.400]   There's a trailer that shows scenes from the movie.
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.640]   Yeah, let me see if I can find that one.
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:37.640]   So this is...
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:38.640]   This is an early trailer.
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:39.640]   This was a teaser.
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.120]   Let me see if I can find...
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.120]   That's on Yahoo.
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:45.480]   You can probably go to Apple's website.
[01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.640]   Apple has all of these, don't they?
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:50.160]   Full trailer for Facebook movie.
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:52.120]   The social network hits the web.
[01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.800]   All right, let's see this one.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:55.800]   This is from TechCrunch.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.400]   TechCrunch would never lie to us, would they?
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:58.640]   No, just like the wiki.
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:04:59.640]   All right, here we go.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:02.480]   This is the theatrical trailer.
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.240]   The terror trailer.
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:07.680]   Go fullscreen on this one.
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:08.680]   I'm my own producer.
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:09.920]   So I tell myself what to do.
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:10.920]   Go fullscreen.
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:13.680]   If this is the same thing, I'm going to be mad.
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:14.680]   It's definitely the...
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:15.680]   TechCrunch line.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:16.680]   It looks the same thing.
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:21.040]   All right, I don't want to hear this lame music anymore.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.240]   Okay.
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.240]   Never mind.
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:31.120]   But there's a trailer of the Zuckerberg character sitting at a large table with university officials.
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:32.120]   I think they are.
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:33.680]   And just being a snotty ass.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:34.680]   It's a headless sound.
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.720]   It looks like a really good movie.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:39.240]   So here is the Twitter...
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:40.240]   Somebody made a parody version.
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.600]   This is Twitter, the movie.
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:46.160]   ♪ I don't care if it works ♪
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:48.520]   Twitter, what's happening?
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:50.200]   My hair is sad today.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:52.360]   There's Floyd.
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:54.680]   My computer's being a fart, but right now.
[01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:55.680]   Per 47.
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:56.680]   ♪ We don't love what we love ♪
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:58.280]   Totally forgot what I was going to type.
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:05:59.280]   Oh, now I remember.
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.320]   Nah, lost it again.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.200]   The Dallas Cowboys just asked me out.
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.200]   Kim Kardashian.
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:07.280]   Whoever threw that water bottle at me, I forgive you.
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.280]   Justin Bieber.
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:10.880]   I wonder what Matt's doing right now.
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:11.880]   Ben Affleck.
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:13.800]   My dad just died.
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:16.760]   Dancing with the Stars finale starts in five minutes.
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:18.120]   Just left my white men kids.
[01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.120]   What?
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:24.640]   I need to create a way to blog that is as random and incoherent as writing on a bathroom wall.
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:25.640]   Why?
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:29.840]   Because normal blogging is tedious and dumb and mixed to fully formed ideas.
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:33.760]   People want to have narcissists at conversations with total strangers about the everyday minutia
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:34.760]   of their lives.
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:36.560]   Why not build them a service that does that?
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.480]   Twitter restricts you to only 140 words post.
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:40.480]   Characters.
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:41.480]   Room 40 characters.
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:44.640]   You're saying that Twitter is nothing but a bunch of idiots?
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.480]   I love it that he looks like Kevin Rose.
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.960]   He looks just like him as hilarious.
[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:48.960]   Is it true?
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:49.960]   The bail mail is showing up.
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:50.960]   What?
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:51.960]   No whiteness, the bail will.
[01:06:51.960 --> 01:06:54.960]   Why you always don't live when we have fights?
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:58.960]   If you keep a T.W. from any word, it makes it infinitely cool.
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:06:59.960]   Check this out.
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:02.960]   Hey, can I get it?
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:03.960]   Twisty.
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.880]   I didn't ask for Twitter.
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:09.960]   If Twitter was as useless and as boring as they say, then somebody would have tweeted
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:10.960]   it.
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:16.200]   Your retreats could have seriously confused all of my followers.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.200]   Our followers.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.640]   You're being accused of intentionally dumbing down the internet.
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:21.640]   Hashtag!
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:25.200]   And enabling individuals to annoy their friends without any consequences.
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.200]   Call 911!
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:28.200]   Do they have a Twitter?
[01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:30.200]   Ask for the charges.
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:32.960]   I would like to respond to the next public tweet.
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.960]   The baby just pooped.
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.200]   Hashtag, turdler.
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.200]   I'm sorry?
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:39.200]   Yes.
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:42.400]   I don't understand what you just said is completely idiotic.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.400]   Exactly.
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.400]   That's the point.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:45.400]   Little part of Twitter.
[01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:46.400]   It's cute.
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:48.400]   I wish they didn't call it the Twit Network.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:49.400]   But other than that.
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:50.400]   Yeah, really.
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.400]   Geez.
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.400]   I'll give them that.
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:57.040]   Oh, maybe people maybe they'll actually help the business.
[01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.040]   You know.
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.040]   Nothing can help the business at this point.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.040]   So here's another one.
[01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:01.040]   Let's just...
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.040]   Yeah, let's move on.
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:04.200]   Google buys Visual Shopping Engine like.com.
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.200]   Yeah, this is a...
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:06.200]   You know, I know these guys.
[01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.680]   Ria made a really powerful engine there.
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:09.680]   But they were up in Toronto.
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:11.120]   We interviewed them on Call for Help.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:15.120]   They made a very powerful face recognition engine which nobody could use or want it
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:16.120]   or bought.
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:19.280]   So then they made it a shopping engine where you take a picture of a vase and then you'd
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:20.280]   find a similar vase.
[01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:22.760]   It was really good software.
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:24.480]   Google ended up doing the same thing from another...
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:27.240]   They bought a technology from another company in Picasa.
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:32.480]   For some reason they've now also bought the Ria spinoff called like.com.
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:34.840]   Well, what's Covid-19?
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:36.080]   That was boring.
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.320]   I can't believe what a boring story that was.
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:39.320]   It is.
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:40.320]   But I don't know.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:42.080]   Why did Google fire the chat room?
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.880]   Well, let me go back and see what else they got.
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.520]   Well, I'm a big fan of Google goggles.
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:48.520]   I love goggles.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:49.520]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:50.520]   What does Google goggles do?
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.440]   You're like, "I'm quite possibly...
[01:08:52.440 --> 01:08:56.420]   Quite possibly this technology could sort of be built into that to allow for greater recognition
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:57.420]   than it does."
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:01.760]   No, in fact, Google said when goggles came out, people said, "Well, can you do face recognition
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:02.760]   with it?"
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:04.560]   They said, "Yes, you can, but we've turned it off."
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:05.560]   Why?
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:08.760]   Because they don't want people walking down the street taking pictures of hot chicks and
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:09.760]   finding their address.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:12.360]   Oh, I never thought of that idea.
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:13.360]   Oh, he says.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:14.360]   So the idea of goggles is...
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:16.160]   He's turning it back on.
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.960]   Well, you know this is my point.
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:19.440]   The government already knows how to do that.
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:21.600]   So why shouldn't I be able to do with my phone?
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:26.160]   Books and DVDs, landmarks, logos, contact info, artwork, businesses, products, barcodes
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:27.160]   or text.
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:32.520]   You take a picture of something and like if I were in front of the Eiffel Tower, I could
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:33.520]   take a picture of the...
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:34.520]   What the heck is that?
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.360]   What is that?
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:39.160]   And then I would know what it is.
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:43.400]   Now it won't work, it says, "With animals, furniture or apparel."
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:47.640]   That's why they bought Like.com because Like.com does work with furniture and apparel.
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:48.640]   Oh.
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:51.480]   And you can also use goggles to translate text from a foreign language.
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:52.480]   That's new.
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:54.560]   Wow, that's amazing.
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.120]   So I could take a picture of...
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:10:00.040]   Let's enable search history because I think Google needs to know more about me and we're
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:01.040]   going to get started.
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:02.160]   So what should I do?
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:06.560]   I need to find a picture of some foreign language text.
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:07.880]   Where would I find that?
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:13.640]   Probably on the ball of Leoville.
[01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:16.280]   I bet you a Google search for the word "kalliente."
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:18.280]   I don't know.
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:21.160]   No, that didn't work.
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:23.720]   There's some sort of joke I'm missing there.
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:24.720]   No, there's no joke.
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:31.920]   I thought maybe if I took a picture of something in Spanish, oh look, when I entered "kalliente,"
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.040]   this is what showed up.
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.200]   But that's not in a foreign language.
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:37.600]   It looks foreign to me.
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:40.240]   Okay, let's move on.
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:41.240]   You got another...
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.240]   I'm so sorry.
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.440]   Julio, would you like to come back in another episode?
[01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:45.440]   I'd love it.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:52.360]   But one point about goggles and Google Voice has the two things on the Android platform
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:55.560]   that I get frantic are not properly implemented on the iPhone.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:56.560]   I just...
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:57.560]   Oh, and the driving directions.
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:01.600]   Those three things on the Android platform are absolutely killer.
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.560]   You might as well get used to it because there's...
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:08.480]   Google's not going to implement stuff as they get more and more powerful here.
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.640]   In fact, okay, I'm going to try this out on you.
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.400]   I keep trying it out and people know what he likes it.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:16.360]   But don't you think, John, we're coming back to that day where it was Mac versus Windows.
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.160]   Now it's iPhone versus Android.
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:19.160]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:20.160]   That's the fractal.
[01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:21.160]   Yeah.
[01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:22.160]   Call it right.
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.160]   You should be so fractal if you couldn't miss it.
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:24.160]   It's happening again.
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:28.280]   And you're going to see far more installed copies of Android.
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:30.720]   You can see far more Android phones in a lot of different hardware.
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.560]   And the iPhone will always be a little better.
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:35.240]   It'll be a little niche product on one piece of hardware.
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:37.440]   No, that's not going to be as big as Android.
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:38.440]   No, I know, but it says...
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:39.440]   I wouldn't call it niche.
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:42.600]   Well, it isn't niche yet, but I think we're not far off.
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:44.400]   Now here's where the turning point is going to happen.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.400]   When developers...
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:49.440]   The iPhone hasn't happened yet, but developers start saying, "Hmm, iPhone or Android, I think
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:50.440]   we better develop for Android.
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.440]   That's where all the people are."
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.720]   Yeah, that's what happened with the PC.
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:54.720]   Yep.
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:55.720]   Well, it wasn't all over for the Mac.
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:57.720]   The Mac hung in there and you...
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:58.720]   No, I agree.
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:11:59.720]   You're looking around here.
[01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:00.720]   Everything is a Mac.
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:01.720]   And Apple's comfortable with that.
[01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:03.720]   You know, 10% or 20% of that.
[01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:07.480]   You like the superior and small kind of a Napoleonic thing.
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:08.880]   Here's some foreign text.
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:09.880]   I found some.
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:10.880]   This is Norwegian.
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:18.200]   All right, so I'm going to just take a picture of something in Norwegian.
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.200]   Fly-kitting...
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:21.800]   I think you're going to get anywhere speaking it.
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:22.800]   Okay, well, let's...
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:23.800]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:24.800]   You're probably right.
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:25.800]   So let's hear.
[01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:26.800]   I'm going to get my goggles out.
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:31.800]   And I'm going to take a picture with goggles of this foreign language stuff.
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:40.720]   So let's say I'm on the Metro in a Norwegian city.
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:41.720]   And I don't know where I am.
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:42.720]   It happened?
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:43.720]   So I'm going to take a picture.
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:45.000]   This will mean you get connections.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.800]   And guess what I got?
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:47.800]   You didn't get anything.
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:53.160]   I was going to link to Terence County College.
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.040]   This doesn't look like it works.
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:58.040]   It should...
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.520]   Bang head here.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.360]   Is that what that says?
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.520]   Seems unlikely.
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:03.520]   No.
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:04.520]   Text.
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:05.520]   Here it is.
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.520]   Here it is.
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:07.520]   Okay.
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:08.520]   Text.
[01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:09.520]   That's it.
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.520]   Yup.
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:11.520]   Yup.
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.520]   Translate.
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:13.520]   Okay.
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:14.520]   So no, no, no, here it is.
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.520]   This is what this says according to Google.
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:18.480]   "100,000s of new approaches.
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:24.720]   Sunday 1CR than C.Nuts Buildker from Pakistan here."
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:25.720]   Makes sense.
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:32.160]   "Read his 1000 ULL to 160,000 solutions."
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:33.800]   I think that that's what it says.
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:34.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:35.800]   Okay.
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:38.640]   We're looking at the article.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:42.880]   It's about helicopters rescuing Pakistanis stuck in the flood.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.360]   This is not the babblefish.
[01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:45.360]   Let's put it that way.
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:46.360]   Well, it doesn't seem to work.
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:48.080]   So somebody on the chat room sent me this link.
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:49.080]   Okay.
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:51.080]   Thedannychu.com culture.
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:53.040]   You know what it is?
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:54.040]   No.
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:14:00.360]   It's a CNNYCHOO.com and it's apparently a, it's a portal to Japan.
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:01.360]   They're pranking you now.
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:02.360]   You think so?
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:03.360]   You know that, right?
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:04.360]   I can't believe they do that.
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:05.360]   They're pranking you.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:11.840]   This is as seen on G4, BBC, CNN, NHK and LCI.
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:13.640]   It's a portal to Japan.
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:15.000]   Oh, it looks like...
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000]   This isn't news.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.280]   This manga, a manga and all kinds of news.
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:19.280]   Isn't news?
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:20.280]   Well, I don't know.
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:21.280]   This is what they...
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:22.280]   This is the link I got.
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:25.480]   This is you come here bearing wine and you do this.
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:26.640]   Well, this is what you do.
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:27.640]   What you do?
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:28.640]   The chat room set me up.
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:29.640]   You were set up.
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:30.640]   I set me up.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.680]   They tried, they're trying to screw me.
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:39.560]   H.P. tablets with palm operating system do early next year according to an H.P. executive
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.480]   Todd Bradley.
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:48.000]   He also said on a earnings call yesterday that Microsoft based tablets will soon hit
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000]   the market.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000]   And then OS2.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:55.200]   They can take every dead end they can find and they're headed in that direction.
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:59.560]   But don't you think it's a little after the horses out of the barn?
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:01.520]   Why do a palm OS?
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:02.520]   Well, they own it.
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:03.520]   Yeah, I know.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:04.520]   But why buy them to then do it?
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:05.520]   I mean, this is like a double...
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:06.720]   I mean, this is like crazy.
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:07.720]   Double indemnity.
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:09.760]   You think this is bad as buying a Maccaffee?
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:10.760]   Maccaffee?
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.920]   At least it's bad.
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:17.240]   So do you think that at come Christmas time we're going to see hundreds of tablets on
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:18.240]   the market?
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:19.240]   Best buy thinks so.
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:22.880]   I don't think there's going to be as many as everybody likes to believe.
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:24.640]   I don't think that there's a market there.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.880]   I think there's a market, but I don't think they're all going to be hitting the market
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:27.880]   just before Christmas.
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:31.720]   By the way, if they tell you in the chat room to search for Cameron Diaz, don't.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:33.720]   They've already done that twice.
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:35.320]   I got three or four things opened up under...
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:36.760]   She's the most on your machine.
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:38.000]   Oh, thank you.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000]   She's the most.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000]   According to Maccaffee, she's the most dangerous celebrity to search for.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.320]   Yeah, she passed up Jessica Beale.
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:50.680]   The Gaga about to pass up Britney Spears as the number one Twitter member.
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:54.800]   By the way, not to mention this, but when Twitter was first starting up and we were
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:57.520]   talking about it, I said, "There's a whole thing's going to be destroyed."
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:00.520]   The number one Twitter person is going to be Britney Spears.
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:01.520]   You were right.
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:02.520]   I can find that.
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:04.520]   It's almost two, three years ago.
[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:05.520]   I believe it.
[01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:10.960]   You said, by the way, I think I remember when that happens, the apocalypse.
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:13.520]   They're the end of the world.
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:14.520]   End of the world.
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:17.920]   Lady Gaga, though, is about to steal.
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:19.840]   Go to Twitter.com/LadyGaga.
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:21.480]   Let's just see.
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:31.080]   According to FameCount.com, Lady Gaga, as of Friday, had 5.6 million followers.
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:35.480]   Actually, she had 5,635,460 followers.
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:39.920]   Spears had 5,646,028 followers.
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:44.800]   Any minute now, in fact, probably already Lady Gaga will have surpassed.
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:45.800]   Stop the presses.
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:46.800]   Has she?
[01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:47.800]   I don't know.
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:48.800]   She's got...
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:50.600]   Right now, she's got 5,728,170.
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:51.800]   Oh, she's way...
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:53.360]   Okay, that's Lady Gaga.
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:56.440]   Let me see if I can remember how to spell Britney Spears.
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:57.440]   It's something weird.
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.440]   We are IT&EY, I think.
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:00.320]   Oh, yeah, you do know how to spell.
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:06.560]   Britney Spears has, ladies and gentlemen, 5,697,824.
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:11.520]   She is no longer the number one Twitterer.
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:14.520]   Lady Gaga, how's John Meyer doing?
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:15.520]   Because we have a John Meyer experience.
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:16.520]   I don't care.
[01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:19.200]   I don't care about Lady Gaga or Britney Spears in this report.
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:20.960]   Can you believe there's a site called Fame?
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:27.360]   Why does Lady Gaga have listed in 106,000 sites on our list?
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:28.360]   A list.
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:31.280]   Because everybody says, you know, this is my favorite celebrity.
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:36.280]   I really seriously doubt that Lady Gaga is following 148,000 people.
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:38.320]   Oh, oh, yeah, that's interesting.
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:39.320]   So...
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:40.320]   Seems unlikely.
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:41.320]   According to Twi...
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:42.320]   Let's see, top.
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.320]   How many Twi...
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.320]   So that works towards worldwide.
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.320]   Which one do you have up?
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:46.720]   This is Fame count, Doc.
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:47.720]   Okay.
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:53.640]   Without looking at the screen, how many tweets do you think Lady Gaga's made to achieve 5.7
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:54.640]   million?
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:55.640]   Oh, must be.
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:56.640]   You know, many of my friends...
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:57.640]   I've tweeted three or 4,000 times.
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:59.760]   Many of my friends have tweeted 10s of 1000 times.
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:03.040]   I guess she's fairly new, maybe 3,000 times.
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:04.040]   464.
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:06.040]   So she doesn't even use the thing.
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:09.200]   Could you read us a sample of Lady Gaga's Twi...
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.200]   Well, they seem to be...
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:13.080]   I'm looking at them and they're all like, "I'm going to be playing here.
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:14.080]   I'm going to be playing there."
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:18.240]   But this one here says, "Portland, New York, Kiss, Tacoma, 22 Hours.
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:20.400]   No worry, Little Monsters on the plane.
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:21.880]   Wouldn't miss the ball."
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:22.880]   Next one.
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:24.960]   She calls her fans, "Little Monsters."
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:27.120]   I think she's talking about screaming kids on an airplane.
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:31.360]   I haven't left the studio, each song I write, I feel closer to you.
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:32.360]   Oh, please.
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:34.080]   Miss you, Little Monsters, and you're right.
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:36.480]   Little Inspirations X.
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.160]   Little Monsters Rule.
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:41.640]   Vegas Tonight, gambling and inappropriate attire to ensue.
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:46.000]   Why am I so jealous of strip club stage productions?
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.000]   Why do...
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000]   Okay.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.680]   See, people, this is kind of underscoring my point.
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:53.480]   The Twitter is really just kind of this...
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:54.480]   I don't know.
[01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.320]   I know Julio, you made many friends on Twitter.
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:57.920]   I'm happy for you.
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:03.200]   Well, see, Twitter has gotten so large that it's no longer a single ecosystem.
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:05.160]   It's very segment.
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:06.160]   There is no one here.
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.160]   Yeah.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.160]   No, I agree with that.
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:09.160]   It's true.
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:10.160]   There's no...
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:12.160]   Just as there's no one internet or one in... when US.
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:13.760]   Hey, I want to talk about Google Places.
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:15.960]   That'll be our final story of the week.
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:20.160]   What do you think about Google getting into the geographic check-in space?
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:22.280]   We're going to do that in just a second before we do, though.
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.520]   I want to mention our friends at Audible.com.
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:26.800]   Hey, we kind of missed them over the last couple of weeks.
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:27.880]   I'm glad to get them back.
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:29.240]   Must be because you were here, John.
[01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:30.240]   Yes, it.
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:32.240]   I listen to audiobooks religiously.
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:33.960]   I listen to them in church.
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:34.960]   No, no.
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:36.240]   I listen to them at the gym.
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:38.400]   I listen to them when I'm driving.
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:41.840]   I'll even actually volunteer for Carpool.
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:45.160]   That's how much I love audiobooksfromaudible.com.
[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:47.240]   Well over 75,000 titles now.
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:49.960]   Really, pretty much everything that comes out.
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:54.480]   We're now to the point where almost everything that comes out is available in audiobooks.
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:57.760]   And if it's available in audio, it's available at audio.audible.com.
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:02.320]   I'm going to give you a couple of choices here because you can get two free books with
[01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:07.000]   our special deal if you go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.440]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:11.920]   You'll sign up for the gold account.
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:13.400]   That's two books a month.
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:15.680]   Oh, I just got my new two books.
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:16.680]   I'm so excited.
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:18.640]   Let me see what they are.
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:19.720]   Two books a month.
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:21.840]   And you can cancel it anytime, but those books are yours to keep.
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:23.200]   So they're free, free forever.
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:25.280]   Oh, I just got the girl who played with fire.
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:26.720]   That's the second in the Millennium Trilogy.
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:30.960]   I really loved the first one, the girl with a dragon tattoo.
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:35.320]   And Andy Inaco recommended this one, Operation Mincemeat.
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:38.000]   Remember the movie The Man Who Never Was, John?
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.680]   That was a great World War II movie.
[01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:40.680]   No.
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:46.960]   They took a dead body and they planted plans, phony plans for a D-Day invasion, somewhere
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:48.680]   not Norman D. Beach.
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:52.840]   And it was, I mean, great detail and great attention went into this to trick the Germans
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:56.160]   into thinking that the D-Day landing would happen in Greece.
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:57.160]   In fact, Greece.
[01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:58.160]   Greece.
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.160]   No, of course it wasn't.
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.160]   No, I know.
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:05.360]   I'm saying Germans move their forces from Sicily to Greece because they believe this
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:06.360]   dead body.
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:08.120]   I thought there was another place.
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:09.120]   It was a fake place.
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:13.280]   Dressed as a Royal Marine officer carrying false information about a pending Allied invasion
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:14.280]   of Greece.
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:18.560]   They let the body wash up on a Spanish shore near the town of a known Nazi agent.
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:19.560]   An amazing story.
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:21.960]   Andy just loves this operation.
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:25.960]   But this is the book I was thinking maybe I would like to get as my next book after
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:26.960]   those two.
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:32.800]   The Big Lie, Spying Scandal, an ethical collapse at Hewlett Packard.
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:33.800]   That's got to be a good story.
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:34.800]   That's got to be the one about the--
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:35.800]   The pretexting thing.
[01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:36.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:37.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:38.800]   That was good.
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:39.800]   Good.
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:40.800]   That was good juicy stuff.
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:41.800]   Was that Carly Fiorina?
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:42.800]   Yeah, that was--
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:43.800]   No, but no.
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:45.720]   She was-- she led left and it was the-- it was the--
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:46.720]   It was the woman who--
[01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:47.720]   It was the woman who was the--
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:48.720]   In between.
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:49.720]   No, no, she was the chairman.
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:50.720]   Shh.
[01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:52.360]   And never mind.
[01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:53.760]   Just go on with your ad.
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:56.640]   I'm just teasing you.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.760]   A fascinating story.
[01:21:58.760 --> 01:21:59.760]   This would be a great one.
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:02.120]   Anyway, the point is there are many, many to choose from.
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:06.400]   You could pick two and get them for free at audible.com/twit2.
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:07.880]   They play on all the devices.
[01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:11.520]   The Zoom, the Kindle, of course, all the Apple devices.
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:15.960]   The iRiver, even on many GPS devices.
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:17.720]   I just love Audible.
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:18.720]   I know you will too.
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:19.720]   Give it a try.
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:25.880]   Ooh, Neil Stevenson's Baroque cycle, complete and unabridged, is now unaudible.
[01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:28.280]   That's going to take a while to read.
[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:29.280]   Holy cow.
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:31.720]   Oh, I'm so happy about that.
[01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:33.720]   Quick Silver King of the Vagabonds and Oedalisk.
[01:22:33.720 --> 01:22:36.720]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
