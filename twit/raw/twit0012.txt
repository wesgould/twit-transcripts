[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600]   This is Twit, this week in Tech, episode 12 for Sunday July 3rd, 2005.
[00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:25.520]   [Music]
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.680]   Welcome to this week in Tech.
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.800]   We're back again for another fine blended recording.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.240]   Leo Laport is off in Europe on a cruise with Mac,
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.960]   Affixianados, and Digital Photography Enthusiasts.
[00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.320]   I'm Patrick Norton joining me here in the Interweb Land of Voice
[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.360]   Conferencing, Voice Over IP, whatever you want to call it,
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.400]   is Kevin Rose and Robert Herron.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.240]   Gentlemen.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.880]   Yes, hello.
[00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.880]   Hey, Leo's needing to be in Trekkies too right now.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.680]   Let's not forget.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.280]   That's what I heard.
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.960]   So he's on, yeah, he's basically trapped on a cruise ship with a boat.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.080]   Trapped.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.120]   Well, have you ever been on a cruise ship?
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.720]   Yeah, I have.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.680]   I actually enjoy him.
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.480]   I love cruises.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.680]   I've been on one, and it was me and a bunch of people
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.080]   who were just really way too happy to be locked into a boat.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.320]   Obviously, I was on the wrong boat.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.160]   Is that during your drinking days or no?
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.920]   No, no.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.400]   I think I probably would have enjoyed it much, much more
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.800]   if I had been drinking.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.720]   I was going to say, that's part of the fun.
[00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.960]   Yeah, see, the problem is I think sober, it's a bit much
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.920]   to take wandering around a boat from one end to the other going,
[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.440]   there's the other end of the day.
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.040]   Buffet style dining.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.080]   No, we didn't have buffet.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.560]   We had the full seated dining.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.240]   It was the food was pretty good, but it definitely
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.280]   had that chicken for 800 kind of feel to it.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.400]   A lot of bouncy stuff.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.600]   But yeah, so Leo's in Europe.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.080]   Big announcement we've talked about, which we can finally
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.880]   talk about is that AOL is going to be carrying our feed.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.360]   And AOL has, quote, "more bandwidth than most countries
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.240]   available for its podcast downloads."
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.520]   So the podcast should get a lot easier to download this week.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.000]   So if it was much faster, you now know why.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.240]   The other thing I have this week is iTunes started its podcast
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.280]   coverage, or as you say, Apple's finally integrated iTunes 4.9
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.600]   with podcasting.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.360]   What was that?
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.080]   Dude, I'm sorry.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.640]   That's my neighborhood right now.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.640]   It is the 4th of July weekend, and every 15 seconds,
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.280]   somebody has some prick of firecrackers going off.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.440]   It's pretty impressive right now in my neighborhood.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.480]   The-- so yeah, iTunes is now supporting podcasts.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.280]   We're actually-- we've been floating around number seven
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.320]   last night check, which is pretty exciting.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.920]   I've had some problems, though.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.200]   I've been messing around with some of the RSS
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.320]   that they've put into the--
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.000]   they actually introduced some new tags for RSS
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.440]   to define your description, the author,
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.840]   all the relevant information so that you can be listed correctly
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.120]   within the iTunes directory.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.800]   Have you messed around with that at all, Pat?
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.280]   Have you seen how we don't have our own tool?
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.040]   We don't have an official logo or anything.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.320]   Yeah, because I thought we had to actually talk to them
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.880]   to change it.
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.600]   But it looks like we're going to have to actually
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.320]   change the way our RSS feeds are run.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.720]   Yeah, it's kind of a pain because we're
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.680]   going to have to rewrite some custom code or something
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.640]   to write out those feeds correctly.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.960]   Well, actually, you know, we go all through Feedburner, though,
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.480]   right?
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.560]   So Feedburner, I know that they're working on it.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.360]   So hopefully in the next week or so, we
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.800]   should see iTunes compatible feeds coming directly
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.560]   from Feedburner, so that'll help out quite a bit.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.640]   That'll be cool.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.480]   They said a million subscriptions since they launched
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.680]   the 4.9 to two different various podcasts out there,
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.080]   which is pretty impressive.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.680]   Are they still listed about 3,000 podcasts?
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.440]   I don't know.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.680]   I'd have to look again, but it's quite a few.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.160]   Have you used the service yet on iTunes to search for podcasts
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.160]   and how easy is it?
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.640]   Just started to play around with it.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.920]   It's--
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.400]   Podcasts, Dally, right now has a little over 4,000 listed.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.200]   Yeah, that sounds about right, 4,000 to 5,000.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.240]   I'm up at-- I should point out, I'm up in Leo's office
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.920]   by myself.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.760]   So I've already sorted, like, through all the drawers,
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.640]   looking for valuables and contemplating taking
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.960]   your own with me.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.240]   Either that or the Matisse print, it's a tough call.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.640]   But yeah, it's very quiet up here in Title Luma right now.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.680]   The compound, baby.
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.240]   Got, like, three big stories this week.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.560]   We've got AMD suing Intel.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.080]   We've got the Grokster, MGM versus Grokster decision
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.960]   in the Supreme Court.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.720]   And the RIAA is suing another 784 Swappers.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.600]   What do we want to hit first?
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.200]   Wow, we're all just so tired and sad about it by now.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.000]   Let's see.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.800]   Here's what Robert's take is on the AMD versus Intel,
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.360]   because I read some of the different articles around there,
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.800]   and I really don't see--
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.320]   I don't know.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.000]   I've really seen--
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.960]   AMD's been gaining market share all along.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.040]   So what are they really complaining about?
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.680]   I understand what exactly is happening here.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.000]   Darn your question, really.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.200]   I mean, does anybody even know what this suit is about,
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.920]   exactly?
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.360]   There it is, AMD sees upside in court battle against Intel.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.800]   Matisse Micro Devices, Incorporated,
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.120]   is filed abroad antitrust lawsuit against Intel Corporation
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.880]   claiming illegal to be claiming Intel illegally
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.320]   maintains monopoly in the PC processor market, AMD,
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.600]   which announced a suit on Tuesday,
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.680]   offered a long list of examples in which it says Intel
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.320]   is used its position, including its ability
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.240]   to offer product rebates or dole out funds
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.480]   to influence PC makers to limit the purchases of AMD chips.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.240]   The suit filed Monday afternoon in Delaware
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.440]   claims to intel violated the Sherman Anti-Trust Act,
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.440]   the Clayton Act, and the California Business
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.840]   Professional Code by influencing the product plans
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.000]   of computer makers and therefore limiting consumers'
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.880]   ability to choose between different types of products
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.000]   AMD said in the statement.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.080]   And I should point out that I just read that
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.360]   from extremetech.com.
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.760]   It's pretty a unique story up there.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.040]   And I point that out so that they don't sue me
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.120]   for reading their copy off of their site.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.360]   Basically, I mean, it's kind of funny.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.680]   Some of the pundits have been pretty funny about this
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.200]   as pointing out that, like, Microsoft
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.520]   gets slammed all the time for fairly predatory practices
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.800]   within the marketplace and talking about how nobody really
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.760]   goes after Intel.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.640]   Now AMD actually is.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.240]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.600]   It's just, for me, it just seems like, well,
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.680]   it's AMD whining a bit.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.160]   And odds are, you know, is it simply--
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.840]   is it Intel's fault that they can dump chips so cheaply
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.800]   to manufacturers and create incentives?
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.560]   And I'd be curious to see what incentives they've
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:46.400]   teamed up with Microsoft to co-bundle for these OEMs.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.840]   And if anything exists there, if that's the case,
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.840]   AMD may have a strong suit in the courts.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.560]   But otherwise, this is probably nothing more
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.400]   than them trying to raise awareness of the fact
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.120]   that, look, there are longstanding deals in place.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.920]   And with the pricing structure the way it is,
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.960]   the way that Intel can dump a chip or in AMD
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:12.120]   is maybe less able to match that price or take such a cut.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.480]   It's really hard to say one way or another.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.000]   Right.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.360]   Well, I don't know.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.080]   It's interesting, because if you start
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.120]   looking at the Sherman Act, the basic idea
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.440]   is to prevent supreme concentrations of economic power
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.000]   so that, like, one corporation-- like, standard oil
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.240]   is like the classic case of trust busting.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.400]   The idea that they just had far too much influence
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.560]   over what was going on.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.560]   I don't know.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.680]   Kevin's all silent over there in the corner.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.280]   No, I'll just see what happens when this case actually
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.640]   opens up, because it is interesting,
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.040]   because I've heard several times that Dell was considering
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.560]   to actually introduce AMD chips in their desktop lines
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.920]   and their server lines.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.240]   And as we all know, AMD makes some of the best processors
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:57.800]   out there.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.840]   And the reason why they haven't done that, I don't know.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.400]   Maybe there was some behind the scenes stuff going on
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.640]   that we don't know about.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.280]   Certain price breaks that they wouldn't get
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.600]   if they introduced AMD class chips into their line of machines.
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.400]   So we'll see.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.240]   Yeah, that's my good feeling about the whole situation
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.960]   is that, look, AMD saw what prices Intel was trying--
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:22.240]   was able to provide for some of the top tier vendors.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.640]   They couldn't match it, and they found it cheaper
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.960]   to simply put this case in the courts
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.280]   and raise awareness of being able to just bring it out
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.400]   into the public light a little bit.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.720]   I don't know how much I apologize.
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.280]   That's my speculation, totally.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.120]   There's definitely-- if you talk to some people,
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.440]   there's always been-- you hear people talking
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.360]   about their relationship with the Intel rep.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:42.200]   I remember talking to insert name of giant PC
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.440]   manufacturer here, where they talked about introducing
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.840]   AMD chips.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:51.000]   And they got such a sweetheart deal from Intel
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.760]   that they agreed to withdraw a product that they literally
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.720]   were like 72 hours from shipping.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.200]   And I've seen that happen at one of the three largest
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.980]   USs, or at the time it was the second or third
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.720]   largest US manufacturers of PCs.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.840]   Intel certainly wields a lot of power.
[00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.080]   And they also-- if they decide to not
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.640]   offer you the standard rate or decide
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.440]   to up the prices they're charging you,
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.840]   they can pretty much destroy a company's ability
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.280]   to be profitable, or at least harm it, quite a bit.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.680]   Definitely.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.880]   Perchip costs, too.
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:26.480]   It has a lot to do.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.160]   I mean, a lot of the cheap systems
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.840]   that you'll find out in the marketplace right now
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.920]   are based on a seller on design, something
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:35.280]   that's very inexpensive for Intel to punch out.
[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.720]   And for most people, I think a lot of it--
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.000]   in this whole Intel versus AMD thing,
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.560]   for a lot of consumers, they simply
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.400]   don't need the latest and the greatest processor
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.160]   to do what they do on a daily basis.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.280]   And they can get away with an extreme value part
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.760]   in that sector, in particular, where
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.040]   you have these cutthroat pricing schemes
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.440]   for just powerful enough CPUs.
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.040]   I think that maybe that's where AMD is trying to move into
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.800]   more and finding it very, very difficult to compete with.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:07.520]   Intel's just grasp on established vendors.
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.840]   That requires vendors to make a switch, too.
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.000]   And some of your top tier vendors,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.160]   I mean, I'm thinking of PC gaming boxes
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.040]   that you can buy from high-end vendors.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.520]   They always give you a choice, which ship do you want.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.240]   But when it comes down to those ultra-value machines,
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:27.000]   nowadays, it's typically an Intel-based system.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.560]   Interestingly, when you ask for processors from Intel
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.960]   for evaluation, it's almost impossible
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.200]   to get their low-end parts.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.040]   They only want to send you the very best, which is something
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.280]   they tend to help.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.520]   That's how they focus on the review community a little bit
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.280]   and try to direct them in a certain way.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.680]   Man, it's a pre-recorded decision that came out this week.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.320]   Grokster, or MGM versus Grokster.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.320]   Grokster gets smacked down.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.520]   Well, didn't that center on the fact
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.560]   that they advertised that they were going to become
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.760]   the best pirate program ever?
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.200]   It specifically had the wording and their advertising.
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.280]   The court rule that was--
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.800]   They could get anything for free or something like that.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.360]   Yeah, basically, the Supreme Court said
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.040]   there are a lot of legal and legit--
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.120]   basically, it's like the Betamax decision.
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.320]   A lot of legal and legitimate uses for services like Grokster.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.840]   But that the companies could be helped criminally
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.640]   responsible if they push the idea that you can snag
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.960]   copyrighted material without paying for it.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.560]   So what didn't happen is they didn't define what the--
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.080]   Is Grokster inducing copyright infringement?
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.800]   The court didn't define or send any legal standard
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.400]   for what inducement is and sent Grokster back
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:44.640]   to a lower court to decide whether Grokster was trying
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.920]   to push people to violate copyright law.
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.200]   That's pretty interesting.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.120]   Did you see how Bram Cohen from BitTorrent came under some
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:54.880]   fire as well?
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.440]   Because I guess they just recently, just last week,
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.040]   uncovered an old agenda on his website that said--
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.560]   And I quote, "He creates programs to--"
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.000]   Well, the quote actually starts here--
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.400]   "commit digital piracy."
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.200]   Well, what's interesting is he said about that.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.360]   He's like, I was young.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.960]   It was a joke.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.960]   I thought the manifestos, people were writing,
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.280]   were pretty funny, so he wrote his own.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.080]   And the last--
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.360]   I don't know, man.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.320]   That's got to be scary for him that there might be some legal
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.040]   pressure pushed upon him because of this.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.920]   He's been claiming all along that BitTorrent was created
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.440]   for legitimate reasons.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.920]   And now to see something like this uncovered, I don't know.
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.320]   It's not good.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.480]   Well, it's interesting.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.520]   It's like, that's the only place anybody's ever seen anything
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.840]   from him that makes him sound nefarious.
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.400]   I mean, the RA and MPAA would probably
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.360]   like to see him beaten with a stick.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.840]   OK, but you can go ahead and code away
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.160]   these incredible programs that help us share files,
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.080]   as long as you never, ever utter the words,
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.560]   I'm supporting piracy, or in any way do I condone this activity.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.400]   As long as you do that, I don't know.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.480]   It's such a fine line, yes.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.600]   Well, it's a thin, but it's an important line.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.280]   And the idea-- if you're telling people, like, hey, sign up
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.680]   for our service, and not only will we make money,
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.240]   you'll be able to get a lot of stuff without spending money.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.280]   That's pretty sleazy.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.200]   You look at that.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.760]   It's like a thin legal line where it's
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.560]   OK to make it something--
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.440]   I mean, you can kill somebody with a hammer, right?
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.880]   But we don't make hammers illegal.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:26.120]   I found that the oddest part of this whole thing.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.880]   It's like, as long as you say the right thing,
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:31.840]   you can pretty much do the same thing.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.280]   Another person can do.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.160]   But if you cross the line and say, oh, yeah, by the way,
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:39.560]   this type of technology can be used to pyromogas and whatnot,
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.800]   we're not encouraging it.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.600]   Well, it makes him seem less squeaky clean than he was.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.080]   Right.
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.600]   I mean, there's a lot of people get really upset at the ACLU.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.240]   They're defending people who are saying nasty things.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.800]   But it's like, hey, you know what?
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.880]   First Amendment rights.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.200]   The thing about the First Amendment freedom of speech
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.480]   means that people who you don't agree with get to speak
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.920]   and people who create content that you don't want to watch
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.400]   get to create their content.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.840]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.040]   It's tricky.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.000]   Well, the good thing that's coming out of all of this
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.600]   is that, at least in the last couple of years,
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.320]   it's very noticeable how all of the content owners
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:18.200]   are finding alternative ways now of getting us what we want.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.000]   And I'm even hearing whispers now.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.480]   We talk about the granddaddy of video being 1080p.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.040]   I'm actually hearing of content producers
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.680]   thinking of broadcasting that format,
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.680]   be it over the earth through satellite.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.760]   And hopefully, they'll finally get the message.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.920]   I mean, we have actual-- you can go online and buy music now.
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.240]   You can download it cheaply.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.960]   And the amount of music that's being legally downloaded
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:41.640]   is growing rather quickly.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.520]   And video is going to follow the same path.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.520]   The more it becomes convenient, I think,
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.720]   everywhere really becomes a convenience thing for us
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.800]   is when we have enough bandwidth,
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.800]   the word isn't such a big deal to move that kind of data
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.560]   from one place to another.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.440]   Well, we've heard talks of people
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.960]   like Netflix offering compatible devices
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.760]   where you'll plug in ethernet cable from the back
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.000]   or wireless and instantly be able to, rather than rent
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.680]   your movies, just have them downloaded directly
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:07.360]   to your TV, which would be awesome.
[00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:07.640]   Yeah.
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.800]   Well, I mean, cinema now has been out for a long time,
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.800]   which allows you to essentially download.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.240]   I mean, you look at the front page.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.920]   Look at the Incredibles, Hotel Wanda, Oceans 12,
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.320]   sideways, closer.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.160]   I mean, it's a little funky.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.160]   You start downloading and then you wait
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.800]   while more downloads before you start.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.400]   See, there've been some attempts at that, too,
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.760]   with a set-top box that uses an over-the-air antenna
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.960]   that pulls in digital content right into the box itself,
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:36.280]   using broadcast hours like you'd receive HDTV over there.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:40.280]   And those said using the Blanking interval for carrying that?
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:40.680]   You know what?
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.840]   No, it was just downloading a transport stream.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.400]   I mean, it's like up to 20 megabit,
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.960]   and it would just simply record that information
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.960]   in your hard drive, and it had their own DRM built in.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:52.080]   But that was a very-- I mean, it would just constantly
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.680]   fill the thing throughout the day.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.640]   And then at the end of the day, you can just go through it
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.720]   and pick and choose what you wanted to see in here.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.240]   And you know what?
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.960]   If they can do that over-the-air,
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:07.000]   why can't they give it to us in the best quality possible then?
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:07.720]   Good question.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.040]   They may not want to-- you know, they may be afraid of letting
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:10.880]   it loose on the air.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.800]   I mean, it's interesting to look at, like, cinema now
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.640]   is unless they've changed it, they're still using Microsoft
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:17.880]   Video.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.480]   Right.
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:19.560]   Same with the movie link.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:23.200]   But those offer good forms of protection, I believe.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.360]   I mean, there are plenty of protected Windows media files
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.120]   out there where you can only view it on this site,
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.680]   or you can view it one time with the proper license.
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:36.320]   Like, especially-- what is it with the Terminator 2 desk?
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.320]   When you actually go to watch that,
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.280]   it's awful the way it's hacked in there.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.400]   But it actually goes online and pulls a one-week license for you.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.840]   And then during that week, you don't
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.400]   have to have the computer connected again.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.840]   But in that time, you can watch it in the highest quality,
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.640]   up to whatever resolution you want, 1080p, I think,
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.640]   is the maximum.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.400]   So if broadband--
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.640]   That's an interesting way to do it.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.680]   I mean, I always wonder-- I always thought
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.520]   like the part of the reason the studios were behind--
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.840]   were so supportive of movie link and cinema now
[00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.600]   is because they want to forget about HD, DVD,
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.920]   forget about Blu-ray.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:11.440]   The idea of having a software codec
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.320]   and an online transport system for movies,
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:18.960]   they can keep changing the encryption
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.800]   and constantly just updating that to make it harder and harder
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.800]   to actually crack and liberate the content.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.640]   So it was really just a matter of how
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.920]   you're going to move that information, depending
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.680]   on the quality.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:30.560]   If the quality is low enough, the compression is good enough.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.560]   You can do it over current broadband
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.600]   that people have right now.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.120]   But for really good quality, most of us
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.480]   really need about five times what we currently have
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.320]   in terms of broadband speeds.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.040]   Well, we often need servers that can feed content that fast.
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.000]   True.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.200]   In other words, never a big giant pipe and nothing to do with.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:48.680]   No.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:49.840]   That sounded really rude.
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.360]   And I'd like to apologize for everyone
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.480]   with 30 imaginations out there.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.080]   Just you, man.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:59.400]   I just feel naughty all of a sudden.
[00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.840]   It's the long weekend, I'm telling you.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:04.440]   What are you guys doing for July 4th?
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.680]   I'm going to Vegas.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.440]   Going to Vegas?
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.720]   Is the family?
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.760]   Lies.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.080]   Yeah, get away.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.040]   Probably take off.
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.160]   Leave it later tonight or tomorrow morning sometime.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.840]   Just hang out, shoot off some fireworks.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:15.680]   You know, have fun.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.440]   That's nice.
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.760]   If you leave for Vegas from LA any time between 10 and 6,
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.840]   you're going to be driving for nine hours.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.480]   I know.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.240]   That's the problem.
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.400]   Got to wait until late night.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.440]   That's the best time to do it.
[00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.280]   But I'm taking it easy.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.720]   I'm trying to get back on Battlefield, too.
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.360]   If that's what I want to go play.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.200]   Have you stopped?
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.600]   I love to hate that.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.080]   Have you stopped playing that at all yet?
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.840]   Only when it crashes me to the desktop or I cannot find a server
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:45.120]   that me and a couple of buddies can't join together.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.720]   Or the crappy in-game browser just locks up.
[00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:49.200]   Or let's see what else.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:54.880]   There's so much that game is-- and so it needs a patch so badly.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.040]   It's not even funny at this point.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.240]   But I'm still playing it.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.320]   It is highly addictive.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:02.160]   And I think it's a fun team game right now.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.680]   Lots of variety, lots of strategy.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.240]   Pretty damn cool.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:07.840]   That's funny.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.120]   I actually just upgraded my system.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.600]   I put a new power supply in it to replace the one
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.440]   that I fried a couple weeks ago.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.000]   Right.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.040]   And I got the ant tech.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.320]   Dude, I'm all about ant tech right now.
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:20.920]   Nice where?
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.480]   I can't believe it's the true power, too.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.120]   I can't believe how quiet it is because my old--
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.480]   That's-- I have a 550 I picked up.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.200]   I've bought two of those because I ran into all these problems
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.080]   with that last box I built where I literally replaced
[00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:33.960]   every component.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.400]   And finally, I got to the power supply.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.200]   These two brand new power supplies,
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.920]   we're just not doing it.
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.800]   So when I got the true power two,
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.840]   I think it was a 550 watt.
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.520]   And the system just fired right up as soon as I plugged that in,
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.760]   I was just like, thank you.
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:47.360]   That's it.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.360]   I'm done.
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.560]   I'm really fine with this brand.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.160]   That are power PC and cooling, I think.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.560]   Yeah, I'm just going to say I'm a PC power and cooling guy.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.360]   I love that power supply.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.080]   They're just-- but they're so expensive.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.640]   They're just so pricey.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:00.360]   Well, I just--
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:00.840]   I'm serious.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:03.320]   I'll never spend less than $100 on a power supply again.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.120]   That's just like a line in the sand at this point.
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:09.520]   Yeah, I got like a 470 watt power supply for $70.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.160]   It's--
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.200]   That's OK, too.
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:11.720]   Well, it's fun.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.000]   That range.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.080]   For what I'm running, I mean, I've got one hard drive,
[00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:16.560]   I've got one TV to Eburner.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.440]   Although I did just add a ATN and 800 XT,
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:24.960]   which is so much faster than my long-suffering G4's 5200.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.400]   Although, I got to admit, the 5200 was playing Battlefield 2,
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.720]   800 by 600.
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.640]   It was a little twitchy at 10 by 7.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:36.920]   But I was kind of happy that it was actually playing it.
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.120]   OK, you got to let me know, man.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.360]   I have better video cards than that.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.640]   Just laying around the house to look up.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.440]   I just like the idea that I got for free what Dan Heuert is
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.920]   going to be paying off on his credit card
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.280]   till like the year 2030.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.760]   He's still paying on that one video card.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.240]   He still hasn't paid it off?
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.400]   No, he hasn't paid it off yet.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.080]   Oh my god.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.640]   Is he going to buy the 7800, the new Nvidia card?
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.120]   I think he's going to hold off for a while.
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:03.080]   I think he learned his lesson on that one.
[00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.520]   It's so harsh.
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:06.640]   Yeah, it's been amazing because, yeah,
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.200]   I just reached people at somebody else's system.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.960]   And they threw a third hard drive into the system.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.520]   They basically had a choice between--
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.440]   looked at it like, OK, you can either not boot your DVD
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:21.920]   ROM or not boot your audio to your Audigy 2 control panel
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.280]   on the front or one of the hard drives,
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.360]   because it just was an enough juice and the power supply
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:28.320]   to keep everything running.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.840]   Oh, that's frightening.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.840]   Well, it was like--
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:31.520]   That's a bad scene.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.280]   It was like a 330 watt power supply.
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:35.880]   So I don't know.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.880]   I just couldn't believe it.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.920]   I couldn't believe I had two bad brand new power supplies
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:39.520]   in a row.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.920]   Or not bad, but just they just weren't enough
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:42.800]   from what I was doing.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.040]   And it seemed incompatible with the motherboard combination
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.000]   I was using in the CPU combination.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:48.560]   I don't know.
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.640]   Have you seen the new ATX connectors,
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.560]   the big ATX connectors with the ATX--
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.280]   24 pin.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.360]   Yeah, the 24 pin.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:59.400]   I actually had to basically shave off the IT--
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.680]   excuse me, the ATR G was--
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.040]   I'm going to say--
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:03.800]   The extra four?
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.080]   No, I didn't have to cut those off.
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.920]   The IDE connectors on my--
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.120]   the IDE ports on my motherboard were so close
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.600]   to the ATX connector.
[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.760]   I actually basically shaved off the--
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.000]   cracked off the plastic off the port on the motherboard
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.080]   and shaved the plastic off of the cable.
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:22.480]   And that was the only way I could actually get both my hard drive
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.040]   and my new power supply to connect in at the same time.
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:25.840]   Oh, man.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.080]   Oh, that's crazy.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.440]   Well, I don't think anybody expected when the board I got.
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.160]   I don't think anybody ever expected the extra pins
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.040]   to show up on the power supply.
[00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:34.400]   So it's like--
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.680]   But at least on the plug itself, those are removable too.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.160]   So if you do have the old 20 pin--
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.240]   I'll go back and take a look at it.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.520]   And I'm pretty sure they don't detach.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.240]   If they detach, I'm going to be really bummed out
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.960]   that I was like--
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:44.760]   Because I almost did that.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.840]   I couldn't figure out what was going on.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.920]   I'm like, wait a second.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.600]   Then I just said, oh, it unclipsed cold.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.400]   I'll ask the four new pins.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:54.120]   Now, the power supply fan in my system
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.680]   doesn't sound like a jet taking off.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:58.120]   I can now hear the hard drive cycling.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.760]   And I can't believe how loud the fan is on my processor.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.320]   I think the loudest sound in my current gaming box, which
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:08.840]   is soon to be my old gaming box, is the North Bridge fan.
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.440]   I'm moving into all the boards.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.120]   It's a tiny little 7,000 RPM fan that sounds like a little jet.
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.000]   Now, it's just like, what is that sound?
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.040]   I'm looking through all of my fans
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.800]   are running as slow as they can.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.080]   And then I just--
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.320]   I look at a clock speed or a fan rotation speed
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.280]   of that one little fan.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.880]   I was turning around at 7K.
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.600]   I was like, OK, that's got to stop.
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.640]   So it's got the really high pits.
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:30.600]   Oh.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.920]   It was crazy.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.400]   Sounds like the vacuum cleaner from hell.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.840]   I mean, I wear headphones for the most part when I'm computing.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.680]   So it's not such a big deal, but still.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:42.920]   It's not a system I'd like to just leave running daily.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.960]   But yeah, I'm hoping for the battlefield tube patch.
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.160]   That's what I want to get back to this weekend.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.920]   I got a couple extra days off.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.800]   And I got another bachelor party coming up this Friday.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.600]   Got to go back to Vegas, baby.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:55.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.480]   So I'm preparing my body and mine for that.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.000]   Actually, we're going to Lake Mead.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:00.560]   I'm just going to go--
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.080]   Oh, no.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:01.600]   Wait a minute.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.840]   Let's just take a step back.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.880]   How is playing battlefield tube,
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.880]   preparing your body and mine for Vegas?
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.240]   Is it the whole simulated combat environment?
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:10.720]   Ah.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.640]   So you're game playing in general, comes me now.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.640]   Makes me relax, so.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.840]   I'm going to jump in Vegas.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.360]   I'll antsy.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.720]   Well, you're going to be antsy about three seconds
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.880]   after you get into Vegas.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.000]   Or do you no longer get excited in Vegas, Robert?
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.320]   Avoid the gaming floor.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.200]   Stay away from the alcohol and other distractions.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.200]   Oh, I try.
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.080]   I try.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.840]   It's basically as soon as you land there.
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.200]   Well, you walk out into the terminal
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.520]   where all those slot machines are.
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.080]   But the last time I was in Vegas, it was really cool.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.280]   It was the first time in about five or six years
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.200]   that I was there where I didn't have to work.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:48.640]   Right.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.800]   So it was like I was there purely on a pleasure event.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.040]   And I had actually pretty good time.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.040]   I think it's stuff outside of the strip, too, which was nice.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.200]   Yeah, that's key.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.200]   Last time I was there, we found a one-mile-long cart racing
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.600]   track that was just awesome.
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.880]   It was like 15 minutes, right outside of Vegas.
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:10.600]   And we went and did a couple of four or eight-lap sessions.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.680]   That was just exhausting.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.280]   I mean, you're just going through these corners
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.160]   at crazy G-forces.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.760]   And they had three classes of cars all
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:19.160]   up to the full 120-mile-an-hour shifters
[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.440]   if you were that good.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.960]   But I didn't want to die that day.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.360]   So I bagged off of that one.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.080]   But we had a blast doing that.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.840]   And then what was the other thing we did?
[00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.760]   It was a country club that was a sketch shooting,
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.080]   like a trap-shoot place.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:31.520]   Really?
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:35.440]   And they had 20 holes, quote-unquote, 20 traps set up.
[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.720]   You drive around in a golf cart for like a mile-long course.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.120]   You stop at each one of the stations.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.880]   And it's a custom-done automated sketch shooting session.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.440]   They supply it with the guns and the gear protection
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.360]   and there's a shell manufacturing facility right there
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.560]   at an ammunition manufacturing place, though.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.240]   They just had cases of ammo.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.360]   And we were out in the middle.
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.600]   It's on the way to Boulder out in Vegas.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.720]   That one was about 25 minutes outside of town.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.280]   But it was beautiful.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:00.800]   You've got to find--
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:05.120]   You're up in the hills and shotguns and great courses
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.400]   to go shoot trap in.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.120]   And we had a blast.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.440]   It was just highly recommended.
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.560]   You're going to have to get the URL and send that out
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.080]   for the--
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:12.760]   Oh, definitely.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:13.240]   Definitely.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.240]   Definitely.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.400]   It's like one of the things you always
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.800]   do at DEF CON is just the shooting range in Vegas
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.920]   where you can basically rent a submachine gun.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.240]   Shooting trap is great.
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.120]   I mean, it's fun blown away with those clay pigeons.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.120]   It's just-- it's fun.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.280]   And plus, you're in a beautiful environment, too.
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.760]   So it's really mellow.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.000]   Stuff is all guns and gear protection, thank you.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.680]   I've worked enough in Vegas to where the strip is not
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:43.720]   like a vacation spot that first comes to mind when I think
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.600]   of places to go.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.840]   That's one thing.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.640]   Head out to Red Rocks.
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.200]   There's a lot of great climbing out there.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.680]   And some good hiking and stuff.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.200]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.240]   That's nice.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.680]   Hey, guys, I got a tech story.
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.080]   You guys want to talk about tech?
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:55.440]   Sure.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:55.920]   No.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.440]   It's the 4th of July.
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.920]   Yeah, of course.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:03.920]   In gadget has some interesting pictures of the next--
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:09.520]   are actually the first iTunes phone from Motorola,
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.720]   which is pretty interesting.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.000]   So are they actual picks?
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.520]   I mean, because people have been floating around with picks
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.560]   on that for a while.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.360]   Yeah, these are actually the picks of it working.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.640]   They actually show a screenshot of iTunes 4.9
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:21.080]   that supports the phone.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.440]   And it shows a little phone icon, and that it's actually
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.320]   connected.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.720]   But I guess, originally when I heard about the phone,
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.720]   I thought that you'd be able to connect to the iTunes music
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.840]   store and actually download via the phone.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:33.400]   But actually, it's only with syncing with iTunes
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.160]   that it supports.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:37.200]   So basically, your phone basically
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.560]   is yet another iPod.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.040]   Well, that's probably version 2, then.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.080]   And then the phone doesn't have a camera on it.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.160]   I don't know.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.120]   I'm not sold on this one.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.160]   It's just like any other phone that can play mp3.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.960]   It's like, who cares at that point, right?
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.560]   But it's got the--
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.840]   So it's a secure USB syncing phone
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.480]   that's compatible with iTunes.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.680]   Exactly.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.920]   And OK, so hopefully, it'd be nice
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.640]   if you could actually browse the iTunes store for free
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.560]   and pull stuff in right onto the phone.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:05.000]   That would be cool.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.200]   You know, a five gig to storage on your phone.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.360]   I'm just looking for a podcast.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:11.920]   I have to carry a separate iPod player and a cell phone.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.160]   And the other basics that I carry around with me daily.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.080]   Just talk to Kevin.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.880]   Kevin, oh, it's like buys every new multi-function phone
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.560]   on the market.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:21.840]   I do indeed.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.720]   Well, I love cool phones.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.320]   My phone is actually right now.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.360]   It's a Samsung from Verizon.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.160]   And it has a 1.2 megapixel digital camera built into it.
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.960]   Oh, you got the 8,000?
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.560]   I don't even know what model is, man.
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:35.080]   I switched models so off.
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:41.080]   It's the-- no, actually, it's the SCHA890.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.440]   Yeah, from Samsung.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:42.800]   I like it.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:43.400]   It's nice.
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:43.800]   Oh, you know what?
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.800]   I'm thinking of the LG as the next step up for mine.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.000]   Man, I just want a big OLED screen, an MP3 player.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.720]   Camera, camera, whatever.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.240]   Bluetooth support.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:57.760]   Maybe a VOIP ready.
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.360]   I don't know if I buy into the whole view.
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:01.600]   Like the VoIP ready cell phone thing.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.240]   It's an interesting idea, but it's--
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.240]   I don't know.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.280]   Just one more avenue to hack the damn thing.
[00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:08.800]   I don't know.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:09.960]   I've had-- you're like-- you're funny.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.600]   You mentioned OLED for the screen.
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.560]   So I've had three people ask me this week.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.600]   So when am I going to be able to use my cell phone screen
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.360]   outdoors?
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:19.800]   I'm like, when they have LED screens?
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:20.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.200]   Or very, very bright back lights.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.720]   The problem is a really bright back light
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.360]   tills off your battery life.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:28.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.120]   Those transflective screens, you don't see those much
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.000]   in use anymore.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.120]   Or am I wrong?
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.400]   Not on cell phones, I don't think.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.880]   Yeah.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.280]   What was it?
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.880]   The Fujitsu Notebook.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.640]   It had like a day runner or something like that,
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.040]   where the screen-- you could literally
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.840]   use it outdoors and direct some of it.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.440]   They turned it--
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.800]   Robert, go ahead.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.200]   Tell me what happened to OLED.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.720]   Like, seriously, we started seeing them appear
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.480]   in digital cameras and whatnot.
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.400]   Now I don't see them anywhere.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.520]   Like, what's the deal?
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.600]   Why aren't they hitting my best buy?
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.480]   Well, the initial problem was blue.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.760]   That had a very short longevity for the colors.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.760]   And that has recently been addressed.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.600]   And now it's just simply scaling up the size.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.760]   And I think what was it?
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:09.880]   Samsung last month?
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:13.560]   Showed off that 40-inch OLED, which
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.160]   was the largest I'm aware of the date.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.280]   I personally have seen-- I saw their 20-inch one.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.480]   I think it was sharp, actually, that showed it off
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:21.280]   a couple years back.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.160]   And that was pretty fascinating.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:27.600]   But until they get the manufacturing cheap enough
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:33.520]   and they can pump them out in sheets big enough to cut up
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.760]   without having-- oh, actually, it's
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.280]   a printable picture technology, isn't it?
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:39.120]   I mean, part of the reason you saw so many--
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.640]   you saw OLED for a while, because basically, it's
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.040]   the first OLED camera.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.840]   And there's like 42,000 press releases around that.
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.880]   I think it's picked up everywhere for a while.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.520]   And those were small displays, like in the 2-inch, 2-1/2-inch
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:50.880]   category.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.720]   They are beautiful, though.
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.880]   They look so nice.
[00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:53.320]   Yeah, they do.
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.960]   It's an emissive where the light is being
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.560]   generated right on the surface.
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:02.400]   A, they can be very, very thin and be either brilliant looking.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.440]   But it was also the electronic-- A, creating a design
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:07.040]   that you could do moving imagery on that was convincing.
[00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:08.600]   For cell phones, usually you're not
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.360]   looking at full motion video on your cell phone.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.080]   I mean, nowadays, that's changing a little bit.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.840]   But you could get away with degraded quality,
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:17.360]   with high-speed video on a cell phone more than you could
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.360]   say on something somebody's going to put in their living
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.040]   room and watch TV on.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.200]   It's an interesting thought.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.040]   I mean, the idea is solid.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.080]   I mean, the LEDs should be cheaper to manufacture
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.520]   than LEDs.
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.080]   They should be able to do flexible.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:34.000]   It's going to be lower power consumption.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.040]   For small devices, I think you're going to see that be
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.720]   adopted rather quickly.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.680]   Or even the electro luminescent, the EL technologies.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.120]   They're getting full color down now to where that's affordable.
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.360]   And it's already bright.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.240]   And I like displays that are made with that, too.
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:53.880]   For big displays, it's still, to any of those technology,
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:54.720]   you're still too expensive.
[00:31:54.720 --> 00:32:00.640]   And you have other technologies like SEDs or Flat Tube
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:03.080]   technologies.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:05.000]   Was it Surface Electron emitter?
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.720]   I think it is.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.980]   Basically, you're creating a tiny array of small picture
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.880]   tubes, each one driven by its own electron emitter, which
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:15.480]   is--
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:18.880]   those are both competing for this whole new category of 40
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.880]   inch TVs roughly or larger that are an inch thick.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.800]   And in that category, I think you're
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:27.080]   going to see that in the next couple of years just explode.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.080]   Because everyone's poised to do several things.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.600]   I mean, LEDs finally mature to the point
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.240]   where they make good big displays.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.640]   But they're still expensive at the high end.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:36.640]   Plasma is great, but it just--
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:39.720]   they can't do the resolution to match what they're doing
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.720]   with LED right now in the same size.
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:46.520]   And it scales larger, sure, but it's prohibitively expensive
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.720]   right now.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:52.000]   Kind of a semi-segue into a fewer question.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Jason wants to know he's going to buy an LCD TV
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.120]   after the holidays.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:58.800]   I would like to stick around a 25 inch with recommendations.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.320]   I know you'll have Robert Heron help with this question.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.920]   It's all good.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.040]   The last one I think I saw in that range was from NEC.
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:10.160]   And in my opinion, they make some of the best glass out there
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.840]   in terms of displays.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.040]   Very-- it has all the features you want like tuners and stuff
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:15.560]   built in.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.160]   It really depends what you are planning to use this for.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.080]   If it's going to be a natural TV that you're
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:23.720]   going to have sitting in your bedroom,
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.880]   make sure it works at low light levels.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.920]   I mean, be sure to check it if you can by turning down
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.560]   the brightness and contrast a little bit
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.680]   and see if you still like the picture quality.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:34.520]   Because that's one of the problems I find with LEDs.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.880]   Make sure it at least has a dim viewing mode
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.080]   because they can put off so much light.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.560]   Sometimes at night in your bedroom,
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:42.320]   you're literally finding yourself with the lights turned
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.200]   down, squinting at your own TV set.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.000]   And that could be a bit annoying.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:48.680]   That's one thing.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:51.240]   The other thing too is that it's not a bad time
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.480]   to be looking in that category because those are--
[00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:57.040]   there are some great values from a variety of companies.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.280]   And so--
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.240]   So you said you like the NEC?
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.760]   What's the difficult price for an NEC?
[00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.320]   You're on a 25-inch.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:07.800]   I'm going to say probably around $1,100.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.320]   Probably less than that now.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.040]   That was probably the least price I'm thinking of.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.880]   So you could probably get it for $700, $800.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:17.560]   Probably the price you could find like a 35-inch tube TV
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:21.760]   or 34-inch tube TV in HD format.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.960]   So it's not bad.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:25.440]   Make sure it has all the inputs you need to.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.040]   That's the big kicker for me.
[00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:30.200]   Some of these displays only come with one set of component
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:30.720]   inputs.
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.400]   If you want to do a game console, and a DVD player,
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:37.640]   and a satellite box or something that offers HD.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:40.840]   You see that size though, HD is almost a secondary option.
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.240]   It probably supports HD resolutions,
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:47.480]   but you're probably not planning on watching a lot of content
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.520]   in HD on a 25-inch TV anyway.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:53.960]   So you want to make sure your standard F content looks good.
[00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.200]   And it has good scaling modes too for standard F.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:00.000]   If you want to stretch it out, the fill with 16 by 9 frame.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.400]   Make sure the scaling hardware looks good when it does its thing.
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.920]   NEC, who else would you recommend?
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.640]   Oh, you know what?
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.480]   There are only five panel manufacturers in the world.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.920]   Major ones anyway.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.800]   So odds are it's going to be based on somebody's.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.960]   Who else?
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.280]   Samsung's-- I don't know.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:19.880]   What is Samsung?
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.840]   Have a 25-inch sharp?
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.800]   If sharp does something in 25-inch,
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.520]   definitely go with them.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:27.560]   Another one of my favorites.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.880]   I'm finally getting-- I had to get a replacement for that
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.680]   45-inch LCD that they sent me.
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:35.960]   I had a little shipping fiasco with that and needed a new one.
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:37.400]   So I have that coming in.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.160]   I can't wait to get that done.
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:40.800]   But who else?
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.840]   Like I said, Samsung's probably my favorite LCD manufacturer.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.440]   LG.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.480]   It makes pretty beautiful displays too.
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:51.120]   NEC, like I said, name-bearing companies.
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:53.680]   But if you're in the store and something does get your eye,
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.240]   like I said, run through a few of those basic tests,
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.480]   really consider what content you're
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.560]   going to be looking at it on and try
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:02.280]   to mimic that where you're standing or looking and comparing.
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.720]   What do people like to let you walk in with a DV player
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.520]   so you can start looking at stuff?
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.280]   Yeah, if you have one of those portable DVD players
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.440]   and a DVD you're familiar with, that's definitely
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:11.000]   one way to do it.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.640]   And it's like, look, realize if you plan on flipping channels
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.680]   nowadays, most of the content's still
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.360]   formatted for a 4x3 display.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.560]   So either you're going to have pillar bars on the sides
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.960]   or you're going to scale it out.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.480]   And that's where you're going to want to take a look
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.440]   at the scaling hardware and actually look at it
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.280]   and see if the image is acceptable.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.760]   Because that varies significantly
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.400]   among the different manufacturers.
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.720]   That's really one of the big differences between somebody
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:36.640]   who has a display custom built or not custom built
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:37.760]   but just thrown together.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:41.480]   And it's like, OK, who makes the cheapest scalar out there?
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.120]   Put that in.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.680]   That's why this TV is so inexpensive.
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:46.000]   Or another display where you can look at standard definition
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.320]   and it looks pretty damn sharp when it's stretched out
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.880]   and blown up to a bigger display size.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:56.320]   But in 26 inches, again, that's not such a concern.
[00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.600]   And you could probably get away, depending
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.080]   on what your tuner is.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.720]   There are a lot of PC displays out there.
[00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:05.040]   Like the Dell's are selling a 26-inch display reasonably.
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:06.880]   You can probably get it refurbished with a warranty
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.400]   and things like that.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.640]   You could also look at PC displays too that just simply
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.320]   off the inputs you need, a component input,
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:16.240]   or probably will have a DVI or a VGA input at the very least.
[00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.720]   I mean, DVDs look pretty good when you scale them up
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:19.800]   on a PC display.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:23.440]   What about how do you get the best NTSC regular television
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.840]   content on a PC display?
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.480]   So you're depending on the tuner.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.600]   And that's really where it varies.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.640]   To be honest with you, for over the ear reception,
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:35.240]   I'm still using a boom HD box that received--
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:36.000]   I don't think it is.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.680]   It had to build in over the ear HD tuner.
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.320]   And it turns out that tuner that was built into that box
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:44.400]   that it still works is one of the best tuners I've ever seen
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.880]   it pulling in very weak signals.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:46.400]   Really?
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:49.080]   So is that for regular TV or for HD?
[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:53.280]   That was for the air broadcast digital TV, which includes HD.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:56.960]   You still like that car from ATI, the HD card?
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.040]   You know, I want to see what else people are doing,
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.520]   other brands, but yeah, that's the one I use the most.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.440]   With their latest driver updates,
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:06.600]   I find it pretty stable and easy to install,
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.400]   which car does it.
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.360]   They have a four-part package right now for installing the thing.
[00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:12.880]   And it requires the original CD.
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.880]   That can-- I can fender my skin a little bit when I--
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:15.880]   Oh.
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:19.720]   Hunting for a disc, but otherwise it works.
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:20.160]   What is that?
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.720]   I'm on eBay right now.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.040]   And they got the Voom receivers, brand new receiver,
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:27.600]   with HD antenna for $40, closes in 30 minutes.
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.200]   That's a sensitive receiver.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.040]   I'm telling you.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:31.520]   That's not a bad deal.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:33.200]   I use that receiver, that over the ear
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:35.600]   receiver that's built into that to compare it to other TVs
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.880]   that have the tuners built in.
[00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:39.400]   And it's surprisingly different.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.960]   I have a couple of problem channels in San Francisco.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.560]   And one receiver, the Voom, seems to pull it in crystal clear.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.120]   And I've had a lot of other receivers choke
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.760]   on a particular channel that I was tested with.
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.840]   The cheap antennas usually still work the best
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.360]   for getting the HDTV.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.920]   Whatever you need, yeah, starting.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.640]   I mean, there's no reason to spend more in you have to.
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:59.520]   So start with pair of rabbit ears and then move up from there.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.160]   And if you have that old school, you know, UHF, VHF,
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.280]   antenna from Radio Shack strapped up on the roof still,
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:07.080]   that's ideal because once you get
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:09.080]   appointed in the right direction, it's
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.920]   going to be the rooftop UHF antenna, right?
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:14.600]   You like the Christmas tree looking thing.
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:15.440]   Yeah, no, I know.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.120]   It lays flat.
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.280]   Yeah, in my jargon.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.360]   All over the technology.
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.240]   Somebody slapped me.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.040]   It's a mama's eye pull, metaphoric, right?
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.240]   Bite the wire with your teeth and put your hands out.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:32.320]   Start there.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:35.680]   I wish I hope broadcasters really embrace the over the air
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:39.520]   stuff just because the bandwidth is there.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:39.960]   Right.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.800]   It's almost unlimited to what you can do with it.
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.760]   And you don't have to worry about compression and things
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:44.120]   like that.
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:45.240]   But at least--
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.840]   You know, it's such a small market, relatively speaking.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:51.120]   And it's, you know, you have to physically put something
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:52.640]   in every place, not like a satellite
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:57.880]   that you can be in across a huge swash of land or cable,
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.880]   where it's just, you know, our signal through our pipes
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:01.560]   type of thing.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:01.920]   I don't know.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.920]   I'm still thinking of one of my friends who--
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.800]   we went through this kind of like--
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:06.720]   he just moved.
[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:10.360]   And we moved his DLP, his rear projector.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.720]   And he was terrified to move it.
[00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:13.680]   He was going to hire our professional movers
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.920]   just to move the television until he lifted it and realized
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.040]   it wasn't nearly as heavy as he thought it was.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.080]   But it was laughing with the-- like the first week he got it,
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.960]   he goes, I'm watching soccer.
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:23.440]   I'm like, uh-huh.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.760]   It looks amazing.
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.880]   I'm like, uh-huh.
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:28.400]   I hate soccer.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:29.760]   So why are you watching it?
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.200]   Because I can see the blades of grass.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.280]   And I was just like, oh, no.
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:38.800]   It's just-- I don't know.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:42.520]   Over there, content can get kind of scary.
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:45.680]   I find myself paying more attention to camera work with HD.
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:46.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:49.720]   Which cameramen really are good at focusing,
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.640]   maintaining a smooth, steady image, things like that.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:56.160]   Because everything becomes highlighted when you have six
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:59.680]   times the resolution and, you know, shaky cam and things
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.560]   like that really start to make you sick and on big,
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:02.640]   big screens.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:06.480]   If somebody's swinging a camera too hard or jerking it.
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:10.400]   Or you realize the person looking through the viewfinder
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.880]   isn't focused on something right.
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.960]   And it just-- and you're like, ah.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.720]   Have you got an HD yet, Pad?
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.080]   Do you get yourself an HD TV?
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:18.400]   Nope.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:21.320]   We're actually-- we're just moving to the new house.
[00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.240]   And sometime in the next month, I
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:25.560]   think I'm going to buy an HD TV.
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:28.000]   It's kind of-- I mean, I'm kind of wary.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.520]   Because, you know, I figure anything I buy now,
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:32.960]   I'm going to have for a few years.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:37.800]   And I'm kind of amazed, like Craigslist.org, the online
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.200]   classifies in San Francisco.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.760]   I guess they're all over the country now.
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:41.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.720]   It's a-- like, you remember that I
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:45.440]   did a search for HD TV on that.
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.960]   And it's amazing the number of, like, last year's HD TVs
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.720]   that people are selling already.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:52.760]   That was a cool search link you sent me.
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:55.400]   That was-- was that using just Craigslist engine?
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:58.240]   You were able to send me a list of, like, HD TVs
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.760]   in certain categories.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:02.040]   Yeah, that's available currently on Craigslist.
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:02.880]   Yeah.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.280]   And basically just did a basic search.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.000]   And I was amazed at how many of them
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.520]   were being sold used already.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:09.960]   Which for me is, that's kind of like--
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:10.920]   you know what I mean?
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.000]   Some new gadget comes out.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.080]   It's like Kevin's cell phones.
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.760]   Like, either way, for Kevin to sell me,
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.520]   like, the cell phone is good or bad.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:18.400]   Or he can keep an eye on Craigslist or eBay.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.400]   And if they start showing up used, left and right,
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.880]   you know, they're not hanging really well.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.320]   That's true.
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:28.200]   So-- but yeah, I'm actually-- I'm kind of torn.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:32.480]   Actually, Robert's been convincing me to get a LCD,
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.600]   like a 30-inch LCD.
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:36.000]   I was thinking about getting a 35-inch CRT.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   I love to do it.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.880]   I'm not dealing with that weight anymore.
[00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:40.240]   You know?
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:43.320]   I have a 30-inch CRT, and I just can't take it.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:45.080]   I got to get rid of it.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.600]   Why did you need it so much?
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:49.400]   I'll take it, moving it one more time.
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.400]   I'm moving to San Francisco.
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.080]   I don't want to glove that thing around, man.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.000]   It's freaking cut 100 pounds.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.160]   Well, I don't carry my television all that often.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.880]   Well, I like the nice thin, you know?
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.080]   But I'm going to hope it'll offer a little while.
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.240]   Well, it's just like-- I look at it.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.640]   If there was more content, I mean, you know, OK,
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.680]   if I get a decent DVD player in upscale as well,
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:14.280]   or I do a feed off of a media center box with HDMI output
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.600]   to the back of the monitor, I could probably
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:18.600]   get decent upscaling on DVDs because I watch a lot of DVDs.
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:20.360]   It's my number one favorite thing to do.
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:24.240]   And unless everything's-- I just want--
[00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:26.200]   I want the movies to look really good.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.480]   And I'll be honest with you.
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.080]   I've had the 27-inch television for the last couple years.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:34.280]   And, you know, it's kind of interesting.
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:36.560]   I'm kind of looking forward to getting something bigger.
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.960]   But, you know, I'm still-- to me, 35 inches
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.840]   sounds like a huge screen.
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:43.440]   And, you know, just sitting in front of a 50-inch television
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:46.000]   is just a little bit much for me at this point.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:46.680]   Although--
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:47.180]   Nah.
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:48.080]   It's 16 by 9.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.880]   It's thinner.
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.480]   You have to make up for it.
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.680]   And then there's the kel factor, right?
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:55.200]   The higher the resolution, the closer
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.200]   to the television you want to sit,
[00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:58.720]   which is kind of scary.
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:43:59.960]   I don't believe any of that.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:01.640]   You don't believe the kel factor?
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.200]   Dude, you can lick your television
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:04.160]   when you're sitting in front of it.
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.400]   I've seen you.
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:05.900]   No.
[00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:07.120]   I don't want to sit that close.
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:09.400]   I'm sitting back.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.200]   The sound-- audio is more important to me.
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.200]   Audio is as important to me as the video.
[00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.560]   Yeah, and that's the best part, though.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.200]   I think, honestly, you should spend the same on both.
[00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:19.920]   I'm pretty stoked because the place we're moving into,
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:23.400]   I've actually got basement access to the living room floor
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:25.760]   so I can run cables for the satellite speakers
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.480]   on the surround sound.
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:31.160]   But I have to put a carpet over them or run 42 feet
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:32.800]   around the outside of the room.
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.920]   So that, I'm looking forward to decent surround sound,
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:35.400]   new cal--
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.480]   That's convenient.
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.080]   I don't know.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.300]   I'll keep looking because it's going to be another probably
[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:40.920]   six weeks before I buy a television.
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:44.000]   So I'm hoping somebody comes with the great new product
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.320]   between now and then.
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.240]   See, but get your audio squared away.
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:49.880]   Make sure you get your 5.1 ready to go.
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:52.560]   Yeah, well, right now, we're basically-- until we buy the TV,
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.960]   we're going to be watching DVDs on a 20-inch monitor.
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.120]   And it's just not cutting it.
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:56.880]   They're smooth.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.400]   It's a lovely progressive video.
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:44:59.560]   But--
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:02.760]   That's for the audio kicks in.
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:03.200]   God, I think--
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:03.880]   No, I hear you.
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:08.440]   Fire is saving private Ryan and scare the neighbors again.
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:09.360]   I want a projector.
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:10.720]   I'm dying to get a little projector.
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:11.400]   You know what?
[00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.680]   I have some great walls in my new apartment.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.320]   I'm just dying to take advantage of them.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:15.680]   Do you have a mouth to take advantage of them?
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:16.720]   Where you're going to mount the projector?
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:17.360]   You're going to mount it up?
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:18.680]   Because that's like--
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:20.880]   With the projectors of--
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:21.960]   Oh, man.
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.720]   Can you hear me like straightening the babble at this point?
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:25.760]   The projectors are so cheap that they're getting so good
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.560]   in that $1,500 price range.
[00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:30.080]   It's just--
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.000]   That's the way to go.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.440]   Yeah, something kind of portable that I'm not
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.400]   going to worry about too much because I would be moving it
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:37.840]   around depending on what we're doing in the room that day.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:40.600]   But something very portable like that that a cook up--
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:41.280]   It has a much fun--
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:41.560]   It has a much fun--
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:42.760]   --from a moody Nigel put.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:43.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:43.800]   Totally.
[00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:44.320]   So you get that like--
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:45.920]   Get a bunch of friends together.
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:46.880]   It's a great time.
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:47.280]   Well, I don't know.
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:50.120]   The only thing is if you don't have a fairly permanent place,
[00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:52.120]   like a shelf on your back wall to mount it,
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:54.040]   you spend all that time playing with the key stony
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:54.880]   and getting the--
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:55.440]   You know what I mean?
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:56.640]   You can't put it on a coffee table
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.440]   because then every time somebody walks by and they walk
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:01.240]   in front of it or people move it around
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:04.000]   and you end up with the big giant wrong-shaped
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.600]   parallelogram screen.
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:06.960]   Yeah, but if it's for once in a while,
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.800]   it's awful fun to be able to whip the thing out
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:09.440]   and just set it up.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:10.720]   And just--
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.800]   And the problem again, you run into is audio.
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.720]   And hopefully, if you have a hump theater set up already
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:18.480]   going, it's not that hard to run the audio from the video
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.040]   source into that.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:21.920]   But that's the one thing I run into.
[00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.240]   Usually, I'm stuck looking for projectors
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:26.600]   that have a little bit of speaker built into them.
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:27.960]   So at least I can--
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:28.720]   You know what?
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:29.960]   Especially for console gaming.
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:31.040]   That's what I love it for the month.
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:33.600]   There's so many good portable speaker systems.
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:37.200]   I mean, just get an Altic Lansing or a Eclipse portable system.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:40.120]   I mean, you get a desktop notebook or a desktop speaker
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.120]   system and just take that with you.
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.160]   A little bit.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.400]   Actually, I'm using an old set of PC speakers from my TV
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:49.200]   right now, just because I like the sound of those better.
[00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:49.720]   Nice.
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:53.560]   Then the speakers that are built into it.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.920]   And I think I need a new TV badly.
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.360]   I am in the HDTV market.
[00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:00.080]   You're even worse than me.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.040]   I want a 50-inch plasma, damn it.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:02.560]   Oh, man.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:02.880]   Let's see.
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:03.080]   That's--
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:04.720]   Oh, LED.
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:08.080]   So it's going to be a few years before the OLED.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:08.680]   I don't know.
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:10.000]   So you're going to sell your television cabin?
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:10.480]   Are you going to hold on to the--
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:10.980]   Yeah.
[00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:11.640]   I'm going to get rid of it.
[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:12.640]   I'm going to dump it on a crack
[00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.720]   as this before I move.
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:14.220]   Do it.
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:15.080]   So what are you going to do?
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:17.720]   It's an HDTV, but it's a Samsung.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:19.160]   It's a CRT.
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.680]   I mean, I bought it for like a grand.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:24.320]   So I'll probably just see if I can get, you know, $600 for it.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.320]   That'd be nice.
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:26.000]   And I don't know.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:26.840]   I'm going to hold off for now.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:28.680]   I really don't watch that much TV, to be honest.
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:30.480]   Like, I'm mostly DVDs.
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.280]   And I don't know.
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:35.960]   Occasionally, I just mostly watch stuff from my computer.
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:37.960]   Right.
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:38.480]   I don't know.
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:39.920]   We've been looking at--
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.600]   actually, we're actually going to get--
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.320]   I haven't had a cable connection or even rabbit ears
[00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.000]   connected to my television in like three years.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.560]   So we're actually going to get--
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:49.800]   direct TV, get satellites.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:52.360]   We want to watch Deadwood as it comes out.
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:54.640]   No.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:58.200]   Rejoin the television cultural references thing.
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:00.080]   I don't know.
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:01.720]   So what else is going on?
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:06.000]   What's the next episode of--
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.360]   system coming out?
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:07.880]   Sorry.
[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:09.440]   Yeah, it's coming out soon.
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:11.520]   We're busy working on it.
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:13.720]   The problem is we're doing these big projects that just
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.800]   take a lot of time to build.
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:20.640]   It's cool on one hand because we put out some pretty unique
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.760]   creations that you don't see anywhere else.
[00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:25.680]   But on the other hand, it just takes a long time to actually
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:27.400]   create these things and build circuits.
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.720]   And it's a little harder than we originally thought.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:33.280]   So we're working on some ways to get out more content.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:37.560]   I just got done shooting another pod/video cast
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:41.640]   with Alex Albrecht, the older host with me on the G4 Tech
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.440]   TV version of "Screen Savers."
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:44.240]   Cool.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:46.640]   Yeah, he's a cool guy.
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:47.960]   I love Alex.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:50.320]   And so we're doing a little weekly thing where we cover
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:51.440]   kind of like--
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:55.480]   it's more like geek culture type news stories.
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:58.440]   And it's called "Dig Nation."
[00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:04.360]   And so you can check that out at diggnation.com.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:07.840]   And basically, we're taking all of the top dig stores from
[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:10.600]   dig.com and kind of repurposing some of them and just
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.960]   talking about them and putting on a little video each week.
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:15.400]   So let's just kind of kick in it.
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:16.560]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:18.000]   It's cool to get back together with him.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.640]   He's a lot of fun.
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.080]   Nice.
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:22.640]   Yay.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:25.520]   You guys want to have a couple more questions?
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:26.320]   Go for it.
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.440]   Do it.
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:29.800]   I'm helping out a church get an LCD projector set up,
[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.440]   speaking of something we all covet.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:33.560]   And we're all looking for using balings--
[00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:36.160]   excuse me-- looking into using balons for really long audio
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:37.800]   video and VGA signals.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:41.760]   Any thoughts, opinions, or feedback on balons?
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.800]   Like, balons or blondes?
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:45.360]   That's a really good question.
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:46.360]   I think it's blond.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:47.400]   Blondes?
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:48.320]   Blond.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:51.320]   Like a blonde without the D.
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:57.480]   The capital B, lowercase, A, L, U, and S. Blondes.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:58.960]   Well, that's actually what we had used to have.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.760]   It's like blond, but blond.
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.040]   I'm guessing.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:04.840]   We used those in tech TV a lot.
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:06.440]   They had the entire-- we should do every-- basically,
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:10.280]   every cubicle in tech TV was wired up so that they could
[00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:10.960]   plug--
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:15.120]   and they're wired up with Cat5 Cat6 so that you could
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:17.120]   actually have television.
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:19.560]   So you can watch what was being edited or shot over at the
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:22.720]   studio in any cubicle or office.
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:26.000]   And they worked amazingly.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.880]   They worked extremely well.
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:32.160]   It's not particularly cheap, but they're pretty good.
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:35.960]   Sorry about that.
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:36.400]   And obviously--
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.400]   He's typing.
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:38.480]   That was me.
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:39.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:40.640]   I'm not--
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:41.640]   Are you chatting with somebody else?
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:42.640]   No.
[00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.160]   I just went to Wikipedia real quick.
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:47.080]   Yeah, that was actually a nice Troy who sent in that last
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:47.440]   question.
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:49.040]   One more question.
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:51.080]   Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, pink.
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:58.080]   Wow.
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:50:59.560]   Here's the classic--
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:01.080]   the definite classic question.
[00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:04.440]   I have an external hard drive, a Sony Vio PC, and an IMACG5.
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:06.640]   External hard drive is USB and Firewire ports.
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.320]   I want to be able to hook it up to both computers at the
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:12.320]   same time so you can access the drives.
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.040]   Everybody wants to do that.
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.600]   That's from Leanne in Ajax, Ontario.
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:17.800]   That's actually-- yeah, I mean, I've heard that question like
[00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:19.840]   40 times in the last three or four.
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:22.400]   The easiest way to do that is to get yourself an external
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:25.440]   hard drive that you can hook into the network, plug it in via
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:28.520]   those networkable drives now, and then just set up shares
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.000]   for both computers and you're good to go.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.840]   But you won't have the speed.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:33.440]   Well, you can throw it on a gigabit if they support a gig
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:35.000]   a bit, but yeah.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.280]   I know what you're saying.
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:39.960]   There's actually a really good one I just saw that I was
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:41.840]   thinking about buying because we have a lot of--
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.840]   obviously we have a lot of video that we want to back up
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.040]   and kind of keep off site.
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:49.840]   Maxter's new network drive looks pretty interesting.
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:51.960]   Have you guys had a chance to play with that one again?
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:52.960]   No.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.720]   It's like the OneTouch, but it's the network version.
[00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:58.640]   You mean the one that's been out for like a year and a half?
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:51:59.480]   Not the OneTouch.
[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:02.120]   I think that was the one I checked out last because it had
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:04.480]   Firewire, USB built in, had some cool lighting system
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:05.880]   built on it, and some good--
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:09.720]   I think it was RetroSpec software for doing backups and--
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:11.640]   RetroSpec is awesome.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:12.920]   Is there actually-- that's another question.
[00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:17.360]   Is there any decent free backup software?
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:18.320]   That's a good question.
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.480]   I always use RetroSpec because it does nice
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:23.240]   incremental backups.
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:25.520]   But that comes from OneTouch drives.
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:30.320]   For backing up your personal data, I'd say buy RetroSpec,
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:31.320]   buy something that works.
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:32.320]   Don't screw around.
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:33.160]   Yeah.
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:34.680]   I feel the same way.
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.680]   Just be done with it.
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:38.180]   When a lot of it-- I mean, it's not like RetroSpec
[00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:39.920]   because it's-- I mean, obviously they have very expensive
[00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:41.840]   versions, but a lot of that stuff just comes bundled
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:43.800]   with these hard drives when you buy them now.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:45.680]   If you don't want to take the time to burn off a folder
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:49.200]   full of data to some CDs and scatter them to the wind,
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:53.280]   safe places, get some software to automate it for you.
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:54.000]   Here's the driver.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.920]   Here it's the Mac store, shared storage family,
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:02.080]   200 and 300 gigabyte versions.
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:05.400]   Just RJ45 connector, boom, you're done.
[00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:06.240]   They have routers, though.
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:07.240]   It feels like a little NAS.
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:09.680]   USB connection start there.
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:14.040]   We can just plug in any USB mass storage device right into it.
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.480]   Boom, becomes network shared.
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:17.040]   They're actually supposed to be-- I mean,
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:19.320]   the original ones that came out were really good.
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:22.960]   I don't see whether the bigger capacity ones wouldn't be.
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.720]   What was that-- is it--
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:27.480]   I met a-- what was that one disk that we reviewed a while back?
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:28.320]   They made some--
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.040]   That sounds familiar.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.600]   The net disk from-- My question is,
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:34.800]   does it matter then what file system
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:38.200]   you use on a shared drive between those operating systems?
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:39.960]   Are you stuck with like FAT32?
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:43.000]   Well, the G5's going to be able to read the--
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.640]   the G5's going to be able to read the Windows formats.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:49.240]   So either that or you could separate part-- no,
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:51.000]   because you couldn't access a separate partition sound.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:51.440]   You know what?
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:51.920]   Kevin's right.
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:54.680]   Get it-- you're both right.
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:57.120]   Create networked in that, attach storage,
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:59.200]   or even just download NAS Lite or something
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:00.200]   and create--
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.840]   Something.
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:04.600]   Yeah, a lot of these boxes just have little internal Linux
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:05.160]   kernels on them.
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:07.280]   They run a little Somba, a little sharing between,
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:10.760]   so you can access any device or any share that you want,
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:12.040]   depending on what platform you're on.
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:14.120]   So they're nice in that way.
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:14.520]   I don't know.
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:16.520]   For me, I run into file size issues
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:20.080]   where multi-gigabyte files.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:23.000]   And as long as the file system supports that, it's cool.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.440]   Otherwise, I take measures to break the files up a little bit.
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:29.680]   But I hate having to think about that sometimes.
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:35.800]   Check out Zymetta, ximeta.com, their net disk.
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:38.160]   I know, Pat, you reviewed this one a while ago.
[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:39.120]   Yeah, what I reviewed--
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.240]   It changed them quite a bit.
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:43.640]   Yeah, it was a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.
[00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:47.520]   That's a big bear's no resemblance to what I reviewed.
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:49.400]   Actually, the thing I've been playing around with it at home,
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:52.200]   basically, I'm setting up a smooth wall router
[00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:54.400]   and then I'm setting up a NAS Lite box, which is server
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:55.960]   elements.com.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.560]   And they're doing some pretty cool stuff.
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:59.240]   It's basically a customized Linux
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:01.800]   district to create a file server, to create a little network.
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:02.640]   Yeah, I've seen that.
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.080]   That's pretty awesome because you get yourself
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:05.080]   a nice little cheap box.
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.920]   It doesn't have to be anything expensive.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.400]   And then go out and buy yourself whatever size capacity
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:10.160]   hard drives you want.
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.560]   You're done.
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:14.320]   Yeah, the thing I would say to avoid
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:17.440]   is anything that combines storage and a firewall,
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:20.240]   and a mail server, and an intro.
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.880]   I've seen a couple of those out.
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:22.720]   It's a cool idea.
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.280]   It's like, run everything for your small system off white box.
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:28.080]   And I'm like, all I can think of is like, one,
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:31.600]   concentrated point of failure.
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:34.120]   Why do they have to bundle everything, man?
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:35.000]   It's driving me nuts.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.760]   It's like when you go to install the security suites,
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:40.120]   when you get them pre-bundled with a new machine,
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.640]   you have the McAfee or the Norton security suite.
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:46.080]   And it's like email blocker, pop-up blocker, firewall.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.360]   All this crap, man.
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:50.200]   I just want anti-virus, and that's it.
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:51.640]   Don't give me any of your firewall crap.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.960]   I don't want any of that other stuff.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:56.120]   That's so true.
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:56.960]   You know what?
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:58.360]   I don't miss that from new systems.
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:00.440]   I can't do the last system I purchased outright.
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:01.640]   Short of a notebook.
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:03.640]   Even then, if one of the first things I'll do with a notebook
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:05.520]   is blow it out completely.
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:06.080]   Exactly.
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:07.440]   I got an IBM ThinkPad.
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:09.160]   And the first thing I did was blow it away
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:11.160]   and do a fresh cleaning install.
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:14.640]   Shame more people aren't comfortable doing that.
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:15.680]   It's not their fault either.
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:18.000]   It's just something that it shouldn't be that complex.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.720]   It should be a lot cleaner than it is.
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:20.720]   Well, it's just like, it's not--
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:22.080]   It's like, if someone should do that, a lot of people are afraid.
[00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:23.240]   I'm not going to get tech support.
[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:25.440]   They're not going to talk to me.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:27.440]   If it generates a phone call, I guarantee
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.840]   the company that built the machine doesn't want that to happen.
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:32.680]   So I do everything they can to prevent it.
[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:34.640]   You know what sucks is that they don't bundle Windows
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:37.240]   installation CDs with these new systems anymore.
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:41.640]   Or if you want that, it costs you significantly more money.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:45.240]   It's funny because the Windows XP professional key
[00:56:45.240 --> 00:56:48.080]   is like, stickered on the bottom of the laptop.
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:49.680]   So I have a copy of XP Pro here.
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:51.200]   I'm like, I'm thinking, oh, OK, I'll just throw it in,
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:53.000]   use that key, and I'll be good to go.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.040]   So I put it in, and it won't let me install.
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:57.200]   And there is no desk.
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:58.600]   Obviously, you have to pay extra for that.
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:56:59.840]   So I'm not like, screw it.
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:01.920]   I just put a pirated version of an XP on this laptop.
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:05.720]   And if anything ever happens, I have a freaking key.
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:06.640]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:08.960]   Of course, does not promote pirating Microsoft.
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:10.160]   No, I'm just saying, man.
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:12.880]   Microsoft certainly would not think the Twitcast was
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:15.200]   promoting such nefarious things.
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:16.200]   I'm not pirating though.
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:17.200]   I'm not saying building your own system.
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.920]   He just said you had a pirated copy of XP.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:19.280]   No, no, no.
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:20.400]   I own XP.
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:22.240]   I just couldn't use that particular key.
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:24.680]   I own-- I have a valid license key.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:25.640]   It just wouldn't take it.
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:28.600]   So I had to use one that was done from a nice little generator.
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:30.120]   I just wanted to check.
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:32.560]   Make it there.
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:34.480]   Hey, remember that's another reason to build your own systems,
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:36.240]   because when you're shopping for parts,
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:39.040]   you pretty much buy any part that goes into a computer,
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:42.600]   and you're eligible for an OEM version of the operating
[00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:43.600]   system.
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:45.200]   It's substantial discount.
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:47.840]   I have to get in the story of the other day, I saw XP Pro.
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:52.120]   Gisk in hand with a key is like $130, $125.
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:54.760]   Yeah, I'm all about the gray market OEM versions.
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:55.560]   Oh, for sure.
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:56.240]   Buy on a hard drive.
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.040]   You're buying a DVD burner.
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:58.760]   You're buying memory.
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:00.760]   Any of that in tightbills, you don't know an OEM version
[00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:01.880]   of software.
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:03.600]   It's legitimately--
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:04.760]   People need to--
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:05.200]   It's not more fuzzy.
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.880]   We need to tell people to discover computer fares, man.
[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:10.800]   If there's a computer fare logo like close buy,
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.800]   that's the place to go when you're buying parts,
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:13.800]   because I don't know, man.
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:15.960]   If you go to Best Buy, you just get robbed.
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:18.400]   Well, there was a ton of crap at those shows, too.
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:19.720]   I mean, there's people selling garbage,
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:20.720]   but if you know this--
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:23.880]   This people's selling garbage at a premium price at those shows,
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:24.200]   too.
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.480]   But I mean, you can find this.
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:26.800]   You go to your local big box store,
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:28.880]   and you'll find the same thing, where it's like, wow, it's
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:29.840]   a G5200.
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:30.480]   You know what?
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:30.720]   It's like a tough--
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:32.280]   The only way about the computer fare, though,
[00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:33.800]   was the CRRTs they had available.
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:37.040]   You'd get like a 21-inch CRT that looked pretty darn clean
[00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:38.920]   for like $70.
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:40.120]   And what's this like?
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:41.200]   Wow.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:44.160]   And it's like, as is no warranties of any kind.
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:46.560]   But hey, it's plugged in and running right in front of you.
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:48.040]   And it didn't look damaged.
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:48.360]   And that's the--
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:51.480]   That's where I got my DVD burner for like $15.
[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:52.480]   Love that.
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:54.240]   Yeah, just make sure it's plugged in and running,
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:55.440]   so you can see it.
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:56.160]   I'll totally--
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.760]   You go the first day of the fare.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.760]   That's the key, because then if anything breaks,
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:01.560]   you can take it back, because otherwise those guys just
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:02.840]   disappear.
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:05.160]   I mean, some of them are pretty good, where they'll actually--
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:07.880]   if they have like a printed receipts and business cards,
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:09.840]   they're either really highly evolved scanners
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:12.480]   that know about Kinkos, or I should say FedEx Kinkos,
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:15.400]   or they're legitimate business people.
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:18.160]   Because some of them you can just smell like--
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:23.080]   that's the funniest looking Microsoft logo I've seen on this XP.
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:24.080]   Is this legitimate?
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:26.720]   And it's just like, I'm going to the next booth.
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:27.720]   That's right.
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:28.680]   So yeah.
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:29.800]   But yeah, you have to get knives to do.
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:32.960]   And the ass with the S being a dollar sign.
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:34.640]   Knives camping equipment.
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:35.560]   Isn't that crazy?
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:36.840]   Like you go to a computer fan that's
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:38.760]   like swords and stuff with like snakes on them.
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:39.440]   It's awesome.
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:40.200]   Well, it's--
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:43.160]   It's all part of looking out all of this stuff.
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:44.160]   Actually, you know what I really miss?
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:47.480]   The whole sort of survivalist bent around the year 2000,
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:48.360]   like all the computer.
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:52.240]   Maybe like anywhere you went before the year 2000.
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:53.920]   But it's going to kill us all.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:55.560]   That was so crazy.
[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:58.760]   I had so many friends in the IT industry that just were so--
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:01.560]   they had no fun that night.
[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:05.600]   Up 24, 36, 96 hours waiting for the day to go wrong.
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:08.520]   I pointed and laughed, but I thought they're pain.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:09.080]   Oh, man.
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:13.320]   Here's a question on our way out as we end this week's
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:14.040]   Twitter cast.
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.760]   What's the biggest computer failure you've had recently?
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:20.360]   I'll start out.
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:24.000]   Mine was shoving a piece of metal to stop the fan
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.920]   and the power supply on my desktop machine,
[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.800]   because it was too loud, which is why I have a new Antech
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.800]   power supply that I went out and bought, which is quiet,
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.760]   because I short-circuited mine.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.880]   You should see the fuse, actually,
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:38.680]   the actual fuse inside the power supply exploded.
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.400]   I should take a picture of it and post it online.
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.280]   I've never seen it.
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:45.200]   You see a fuse melt usually, but not usually like--
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:48.760]   you don't usually see smokey glass and a big giant piece
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:49.600]   of it missing.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.040]   You ever hear an LED explode when too much current
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:53.120]   thrones through it?
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:53.520]   That's awesome.
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.160]   That's a snap.
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:55.680]   What happens?
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.040]   It's a little bomb going off.
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:57.840]   What does it look like?
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:58.560]   Is it like brown and--
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.600]   It goes-- it almost vaporized.
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:02.280]   At least I've never found the fragments.
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:03.800]   I've never tried to catch them either.
[01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:06.240]   But just the noise alone, though.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:08.520]   It's like the ultimate electronic firecracker.
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:09.880]   That sounds a little scary.
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:12.240]   I mean, do fragments blow out of the thing,
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:12.760]   or does it--
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.000]   I mean, it's resin.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.520]   So it's just like a little piece of plastic.
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.200]   Hopefully, I can't tell if it's burning,
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:20.040]   or it just explodes into lots of little pieces,
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.680]   or if a chunk actually ends up somewhere.
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:23.600]   I've never found the parts or any--
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:29.120]   Don't plug the LED, the 120-volt LED into the 220 or 440-volt
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:29.600]   socket.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.960]   Just follow the directions and don't overdrive those poor things
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:32.800]   too far anyway.
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:37.480]   Oh, so you're saying you did this by turning up your graphics
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:38.720]   card too high, or what did you--
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:39.360]   No, no, no, no.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:41.120]   An LED itself, like a light.
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:41.280]   Right.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.480]   It was like in a flashlight working on electronic project,
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:46.520]   where it's like, OK, this thing's rated to one watt,
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:49.120]   and we're trying to put like five, seven, eight watts
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:49.480]   through it and just--
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:49.980]   OK.
[01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:51.040]   --now with no--
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.680]   I was trying to figure out how exactly you managed
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.200]   to pump the voltage through this--
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:54.680]   I'm sorry.
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:56.800]   I could have totally like figured a display,
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.000]   or something like that.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.160]   The LEDs, as in the light emitting diode itself.
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.800]   250,000-twit listeners immediately
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.960]   began running in fear from their beloved LCD panels.
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.960]   My 17-inch flat panels got to explode.
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:13.760]   Right.
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.640]   This is how rumors start.
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:19.320]   The most hard wear well was just that power supply weirdness
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.240]   I went through that just reminds me to always--
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:25.960]   And the battle field too, blue screening.
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:28.960]   And then I also want to thank my buddy Jeff for just taking
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:31.720]   the time to literally take every component out,
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.520]   strip it down to like the bare essentials,
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:36.000]   and put one thing in at a time until we rolled everything out.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:36.440]   Nice.
[01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.920]   And then we realized, hey, you got two crappy powers
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.880]   of blizzard row.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.520]   Fix that.
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:43.000]   Yeah, I just--
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.840]   I'm going to knock on wood on this one,
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:47.480]   because I haven't had anything for a long time, which
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:48.120]   is good.
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.640]   No software crashes?
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.320]   Well, I mean, that happens every day, man.
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.680]   Firefox has crapped on me today.
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:53.640]   I have no idea why.
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:55.280]   It's like the first time it's ever done that to me.
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:55.780]   Really?
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:56.520]   Did you have a full set of--
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.040]   Very few problems with that browser.
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:58.520]   Oh, no, no.
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:02:59.600]   I have no problems with it.
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:02.040]   For some reason today, just freaking died on me.
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:05.000]   It's a damn battlefield, too.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.920]   That's my big, boned-a-pick.
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:09.040]   And you know what?
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.240]   Google Earth.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.720]   When they launched the app, at least on my notebook
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:15.520]   and a couple other computers, as soon as I closed out of it
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.760]   and I wasn't looking around at satellite imagery anymore,
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.920]   it seemed my whole system would slow down for browser use
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:21.440]   with Firefox.
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:22.280]   That's weird.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.680]   And until I rebooted my whole system,
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.280]   the snappiness was gone.
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.920]   Do you have a plus piece of that, by the way?
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:29.600]   What?
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:32.000]   Did you get a plus key for that, like the paid version?
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:32.520]   Oh, no.
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:33.020]   Uh-oh.
[01:03:33.020 --> 01:03:34.080]   I haven't checked it out yet.
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.800]   But it is back up, the free version.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:36.680]   Oh, it is back up.
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:37.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:37.680]   Down for a while.
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:38.360]   OK, cool.
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:39.360]   I'm going to go on there and--
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:40.960]   I have a free version.
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:43.520]   But I want to pay for the $20 one,
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:46.360]   just so I can play with the GPS connectivity.
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:50.320]   Everybody I know is either a home shopping or--
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.000]   more-- you can send bookmarks, basically,
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.320]   for the Google map or the Google Earth location
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:57.560]   and the satellite image you're looking at.
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:59.120]   So I have friends who just bought a house
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.240]   and they sent the link out.
[01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.120]   So you can see the satellite image from the roof
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:03.720]   looking at the new house that they just bought.
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:07.160]   Or we're all talking about going to Cabo in a couple weeks.
[01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:09.760]   We're all looking at the coastline down there.
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.800]   It's just such an intuitive, fun interface.
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:13.760]   And if you have broadband, broadband being
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:16.760]   in big B capital letter, don't even bother
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:17.560]   if you have a modem.
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:20.040]   But it's really one of the neatest apps out there right now
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:24.280]   for just visualization and map browsing, I think.
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:24.920]   Yeah, it is going to--
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:26.000]   The maps is really good, too.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   Wow, that was a conversation killer.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   I didn't hear you cut out what you said.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.880]   It was like Google Maps is really good, too.
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:37.160]   And all of a sudden there was--
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.280]   Oh, I was like, ew.
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.320]   I'm sorry.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:40.840]   OK.
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:42.160]   The interface is just great.
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:44.360]   I'll use something else.
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:46.120]   I love what people are doing with the little API, too.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.400]   They're connecting everything, like weather information,
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:51.320]   like stockings, like you name it, like--
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.400]   have you seen this stuff where you can pull up the maps
[01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.640]   and pin point every little thing?
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:55.640]   It's great.
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.960]   That's awesome.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.040]   Is there like a page that links those?
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.240]   Yeah, actually, Wired just came out with an article showing
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:02.760]   all the Google Map Hacks.
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:03.920]   So check that out.
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:05.800]   And they have just a bunch of different ones
[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:07.720]   you can click on where they tie all different types of
[01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:10.800]   information to the map data.
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:12.680]   Hey, Google Map this.
[01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.840]   All right, I'll put that in the show notes.
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:15.520]   Nice.
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:16.680]   Map Hacks on crack.
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:19.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.760]   Sorry, that's a really good title.
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.840]   What else?
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:26.040]   I think that about does it, gentlemen.
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:27.600]   It's 8 o'clock.
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:29.040]   We got a late start today.
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.200]   Yeah, sorry about that, guys.
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:32.680]   I had no idea the traffic was going to be that bad.
[01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:34.080]   And no worries.
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:35.960]   Plus, I had to go to the dump.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.320]   We got rid of 650 pounds of stuff.
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:39.800]   Yay!
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:41.000]   That was pretty out of control.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.680]   That's always an adventure.
[01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:46.880]   God, yeah, the dead washer and dryer went bye-bye.
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:47.680]   Those were sad.
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:50.920]   They lasted me like eight years.
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:53.600]   Some caterpillar drivers going to have a fun time
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.280]   running that over and crashing down.
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.400]   I was telling Kevin about that.
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.640]   I'm like throwing stuff off the back of my truck.
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.320]   And I hear this, wham!
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:01.880]   And I turn around and there's one of those.
[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:03.920]   Because for people who've never--
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:06.000]   you've gone to the dump, essentially,
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.560]   the sanitation and recycling center in San Francisco.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:11.120]   It's a big giant warehouse.
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:13.280]   And they tell you to back your vehicle up.
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:14.760]   And where you back your vehicle up,
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:16.400]   they have a row of posts.
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:17.480]   And on the other side of the post
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:19.160]   is a couple of really happy people
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.200]   on the biggest caterpillar attractors
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.760]   you've ever seen in door, smashing things flat
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:26.720]   with a front loader, and sweeping by, picking stuff up,
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:30.080]   and throwing them into dumpsters, which
[01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:32.080]   get hauled out really rapidly.
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:34.320]   So it's really done in a warehouse in San Francisco?
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.680]   Yeah, well, they used to do it outdoors.
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:40.840]   And it's really funny because somebody who used to work there
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:43.600]   used to grab all the strange objects to art.
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.440]   So there's this hillside behind where it was.
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:50.240]   And you see garden gnomes and somebody's plaster
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:54.160]   of Paris version of Atlas holding the world on his shoulders
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.440]   and a nine-foot-long tiger.
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:59.680]   So there's this little army of weird stuff up on this hill.
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:00.400]   But--
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:01.160]   Pretty funny.
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:03.160]   Well, the wind never stops blowing in San Francisco.
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:06.200]   So I guess garbage would end up over half the state.
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:08.120]   So they moved it all indoors.
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:11.640]   So you get your vehicle weighed in, and you drive around.
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:13.040]   And they assign you-- they basically
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:15.080]   look to make sure you're not getting rid of nuclear waste
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:16.440]   or toxic waste.
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.960]   And they tell you to back up somewhere.
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.360]   And then you're so you're inside this football field-sized
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:22.040]   warehouse and you start hucking the stuff off
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.640]   of the back of your truck.
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.640]   And while the giant earth-moving machinery
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:30.640]   is smashing things flat and sweeping things by you,
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.280]   they're obviously having a ball.
[01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:34.240]   And I should point out that the stuff is recycled
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:34.880]   at that point.
[01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:38.920]   And only the non-recyclable bits are buried.
[01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:39.360]   So--
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.200]   Push down to the bay.
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:41.960]   I hope not.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:42.960]   That'll be really fun.
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:43.960]   Pargent.
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.320]   No.
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:46.200]   Five miles out.
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.120]   Goodbye.
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:48.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.640]   No, that's not funny.
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:56.120]   I hope it's not true, but I suspect it is.
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:57.920]   No, I'm pretty sure it's not true.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:58.920]   OK.
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:02.280]   I think you can imagine what a nightmare ocean beach would be.
[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:02.780]   Oh.
[01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:07.280]   It's bad enough that people you run into just running
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:08.840]   through the dunes, let alone--
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:11.800]   It's the flesh of the shore.
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.760]   Hey, that's my neighborhood you're talking about.
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:14.960]   I used to live up there.
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:15.840]   I miss it.
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:18.400]   I miss the wackiness.
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:21.400]   The world's largest gathering of happy people burning fires
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:23.920]   on public property.
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:25.760]   The beach that hardly anyone uses.
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:26.920]   Ah, I shouldn't say that.
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:28.880]   No, because I'll tell you what, if you get a sunny day--
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:29.880]   This time of year, yeah.
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:31.400]   That is a packed beach.
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:33.120]   You get a lot of half-- because nobody
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:36.440]   gets sun in San Francisco in June or July.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:38.440]   Just remember that, Kevin, lay out in the sun
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:40.320]   as much as you can while you're down in LA.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.320]   Oh, dude.
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:44.680]   You'd have missed the foggy cloudy weather of San
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:45.520]   Francisco.
[01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.440]   I really do.
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:48.320]   Oh, East Bay rules, man.
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:49.720]   10 degrees warmer.
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.640]   I get more sun.
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:52.840]   Gentlemen, I think we're done.
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:54.840]   I think we're toast.
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:55.360]   I think we're toast.
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:57.080]   So this is the part where I get to figure out whether or not
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:09:00.440]   A, I can actually manage to upload this to the FTP server.
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:05.200]   And B, if we can get the new feed through AOL up and running.
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:07.840]   So if you hear any like whimpering and crying
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:10.120]   from the Petaluma area, it's me fighting with the fire.
[01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.160]   Are you just going to dump it raw?
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:12.400]   Are you going to do an edit on it?
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:17.480]   I'm going to see if I can find the naughty bits.
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.200]   We didn't have to record that one, right?
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:20.720]   We did the Solivius guy.
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:23.520]   Basically, we either have a really fine podcast
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:26.400]   sitting on the Marantz recorder at the other end of this bench,
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:28.600]   or ice cream up royally.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.080]   And we're going to do this all in Canada.
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:31.600]   So it was like, get you guys to Canada.
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.720]   See you tomorrow.
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:37.240]   This flaming mess was brought to you by Patrick Norton.
[01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:37.680]   Now hopefully--
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:39.640]   Please support us.
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:41.640]   We're really sorry.
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:44.800]   Hopefully everything works out.
