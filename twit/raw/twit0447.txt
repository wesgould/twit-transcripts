[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.160]   Tech news. Welcoming a new panel panelists on Twit. I'm very happy to have him. Farhad
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.080]   Manju has written for salon for slate for the Wall Street Journal. He's currently at
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.560]   the New York Times where he's taking David Pogues place and is right doing great stuff
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.560]   as always always to me and I was telling you this before the show one of the most insightful
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.520]   writers in technology today. So good to have you on farhad. Hey, good. Thanks. Good to
[00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.960]   be here. I've been a fan and I'm happy to be here. Oh good. You're traveling. Are you
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.200]   going to some great conference or something? Something exciting? No, I'm going. My wife
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.000]   is a doctor and there's a medical conference here in San Diego. So I'm just tagging along
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.440]   with her. Even better. The doctors get the best junkets of all. Even better than New York
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:57.600]   Times. I'm hoping to get some fancy doctors. Samples. Just samples. Also with his Larry
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.880]   Meggad from CBS News. Larry is a regular on the show and we always welcome him with open
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:10.760]   arms. Nice to have you. Oh, it's fun being here. Connect safely.com. Sorry.org. Safekids.com
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.880]   and we're pleased. We've kind of roped Alex Lindsey in here. So I'm wandering through
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.200]   the studio. I said, come here. I wasn't quite ready. I was just just wandering through
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.040]   picking up some stuff. It's real to have you Alex. I think the last time I was on
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.040]   Twitter, we were in the old house. What? I have. I'm not. Oh, that's just wrong. Alex
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.040]   is a regular Mac break weekly, but goodness gracious. You should always be on. Good to
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.880]   be back. I have to say weird. Anybody. These I'm looking at our great geek audience. How
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:45.240]   many of you here for RSA? Not one. The big security conference was this week in San Francisco
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:52.600]   and nobody came. I was there. Did you go Larry? I went for the keynote. A lot of the security
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.440]   experts said ever ever ever since the story that RSA had accepted $10 million from the
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:07.680]   NSA to compromise its recommendations for encryption so that the NSA would have back
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.640]   doors into what we but one would hope would be secure encryption. Now everybody's kind
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.320]   of turned their back on the RSA. Funny thing about that story is that it was only I mean,
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.280]   if you're going to sell out sort of the backbone of your company, why would you do it for only
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.400]   $10 million? Right. It was like the interesting thing about the interesting thing about RSA
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.080]   conference is that every single keynoter ranted and ranted about the NSA. So it was
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.600]   kind of this ironically the place where the NSA got trashed from the stage. Did you go
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.600]   to a Colbert's keynote? Because he closed the thing out. No, I didn't go to Colbert.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.280]   I just went to the first day. What I can't imagine what he had to say. It's very confused,
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.560]   frankly. I don't know if Stephen Colbert is really the right guy. A lot of people said
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:58.440]   he should have turned it down. But he said, I'm not the check clears. I'm here. And of
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.800]   course he plays, you know, I believe he's a liberal comedian playing a conservative
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.120]   commentator on the Colbert report. And apparently his talk was a mixture of both. It wasn't
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:20.560]   really clear. Oh, yeah, who he was and so forth. It's really, I understand the need
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.440]   to boycott it. I mean, it really is appalling that they would for a mere 20 pieces of gold
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.800]   in effect. I think essentially you have to look to NSA and say, well played, well played.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.680]   Yeah. But yeah, I think that that is the, I mean, I think we're going to keep on seeing
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.800]   these pieces come out of, you know, this was a perfect situation for the NSA, you know,
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.400]   as far as what they what they needed, you know, and being totally tied into what people
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.480]   are assuming is going to be secure. There was a competing conference trustee con.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:59.040]   Which I don't know if it really took off, but it was organized by people who said, don't
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:05.960]   go to the RSA conference don't don't in any way encourage them. The metrian where they
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.400]   were supposed to be was trying to kick them out because RSA warned the metrian. That's
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.920]   the that big mall next we've done stuff. Well, that's right. And typically, I mean, this
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.400]   is actually pretty common. Anything that happens in the Moscone Center, they'll pretty much
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.440]   shut down any place that you can have an event anywhere near that one. That's not specific
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.400]   to this. That's specific to any conference. That's kind of a that that's part of the not
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.720]   allowing people to set up parallel conferences, which, you know, I have attempted to do myself.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:40.280]   So according to the bits blog on the New York Times, there were T shirts made for folks
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.800]   from the electronic frontier foundation featuring the NSA logo, except that the eagle was using
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:52.600]   its talents to plug into the American telecom network, prom prominently labeled AT and T
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.160]   and AT and AT executive who was at RSA said there are many of us at AT and T were disturbed
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.840]   by what we've heard at the about the NSA. But when you see those T shirts, a conversation
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:11.720]   becomes impossible. There's nothing more to say about it. I just thought I'd mention
[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:17.120]   that and I was curious if anybody was here for RSA. And you know, in years past, audience
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.240]   jammed with people here for RSA. Right. So I think that's telling. I think that that
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.120]   really shows that they've come to get a seat there. They were plenty of empty seats to
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:32.400]   keynote. Yeah, that's sad. Breaking news this afternoon from Cara Swisher at recode.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:38.800]   Tony Bates who was joined Microsoft when Microsoft acquired Skype a couple of years ago and Tammy
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.960]   Reller who's executive VP of marketing, leaving the company according to numerous sources close
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.680]   to the situation. When Satya Nadella was picked as CEO, it's not surprising. We even speculated
[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:55.400]   on Windows weekly that Tony Bates and others who were in the running might in fact leave
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.800]   the company. Well, I now know where the glass ceiling is for them. I mean, you know, once
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:04.000]   you have a young CEO, you know that if you if your plans were to become a CEO at Microsoft,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.800]   those are those are Tony Bates was a CEO. So but Skype. So but he you know, if his path,
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.800]   he's now at the highest point in his path, you know, so absolutely. And I wonder frankly
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:22.640]   about Stephen Elob. Any thoughts on that far? I mean, I think the whole Nokia acquisition
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:31.440]   seems questionable. I mean, I think that's like the biggest the biggest decision that
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.760]   you know, Nadella will have to make is what to do with the hardware strategy. And I think
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.800]   Nokia plays a big part of that. And I think, you know, if they keep it around or if they
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:44.320]   keep it as a big part of it, I think that's a good thing for Stephen Elob. So I mean, you
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.920]   know, he could be ahead of that strategy. But but yeah, I mean, it sort of all depends
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:55.240]   on what their bigger bigger strategy is regarding hardware regarding smart phone hardware. You
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:00.120]   know, I think that seems still up in the air. Well, it certainly became a big question
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:05.760]   this week at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona where Nokia still not a Microsoft company.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:11.840]   We're waiting for regulatory improvement from China, but imminently becoming a Microsoft
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:20.240]   company. They bought the mobile phone business from Nokia announced new phones based on
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:26.880]   Android. Right. The Nokia X, the Nokia X plus and the Nokia XL look just like Windows
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:34.960]   phones and use Windows Microsoft services being in one drive. But they are based on Android.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.320]   They don't support the play store, although I've seen hacks already that allow you to
[00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:43.400]   add the play store to these phones. They have a special Nokia store.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.160]   Yeah. You know, it's the same. It's a great idea. I mean, it's a great idea. It's brilliant.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:52.360]   It's the same thing as Amazon Kindle Fire, right? Because Amazon, you know, controls
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:57.000]   the hardware, but more important, they control the services, they control the stores, and
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.480]   they understand where the money is. And I think Microsoft realizes that operating systems
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.360]   are really not the future of its business. I mean, they've settled over and over again.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.320]   It's devices and services. And if they can get people to use their services instead
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:13.720]   of Google services on their devices, then why should they care who wrote the underlying
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.200]   code that's at the bottom of the operating system?
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:23.040]   Isn't there a risk though, Farhad, that this ascends a message that Microsoft is not 100%
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:27.960]   behind Windows phone, that it may be even Microsoft itself will shift to Android?
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:33.880]   Oh, yeah. I mean, I think that's the risk. But I don't think that's a risk. I think
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:41.720]   they shouldn't be 100% behind Windows phone. I mean, Windows phone is a very long shot
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:47.960]   game. And sort of doing it this way, kind of getting Microsoft services out to people
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:54.600]   through other operating systems seems like a much smarter play. I mean, it's what every
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:02.600]   other tech company does. They recognize that Android is going to be around, that iOS is
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:07.160]   going to be around. And instead of trying to defeat those, they get their services on
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:12.960]   those platforms. If there was office for iPad, that would be wonderful for Microsoft.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.800]   And there will be. We know that. It seems like there will be at some point, but the fact
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:22.600]   that it's been yours since we've had the iPad with that office on it is because Microsoft
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.920]   sells operating systems. And if it didn't have that strategy, we would have had office
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:33.200]   faster. And I also think I think that the Nokia phones are incredible hardware being held up
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.480]   by its up until now being held up by its office.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.880]   Cool. Let's hasn't said, geez, I'd love to get one of those 10 twenties or those 15 twenties.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:45.320]   If it's only ran Android, yeah, and the folks at Nokia have to be clamoring at the weekend.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:51.080]   We have to move it. I'm going to defend Windows phone though. I mean, Windows phone is a great
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:56.600]   operating system. It's slick. It's fast. It's easy to use the only negative as far as I
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:00.280]   could tell. And I don't use a Windows phone for this reason. It just doesn't have the availability,
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.320]   the app availability. And if I Android can. Yeah.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:10.080]   Right. I mean, I think that if you were like, if you were about to buy any phone for the
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:17.840]   Lumina 10 20 is a great thing to choose. But it's not so much better that you can sacrifice
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:23.000]   the, you know, all the all the apps that you're getting on the other platform. It's just
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.080]   good enough. But then it has this huge shortcoming. And Eli made a very big deal at the announcement
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:33.160]   that develop Android developers are being wooed. He said it said they can simply move
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:37.800]   their products right over the store. Within hours, within hours, they can make it so.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:43.240]   So clearly that's their strategy. Now they've got an operating system or a platform that
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:48.280]   supports hundreds of thousands of apps, which is would take forever on Windows. You know
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.640]   who I feel sorry for and it's fortunately as a small group is the Windows phone developers
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:59.920]   who are now saying, well, crap. I mean, we bet on it on this platform and Microsoft's
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:05.360]   basically throwing us to the wolves. Did what actually is it Microsoft? That's the question.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:11.000]   It's Nokia. Did Satya Nadella wink and nudge when Stephen E. Lop said as he must have,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.400]   we're going to do this? Look, he's going to about to become a Microsoft employee. He'd
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.920]   be crazy if he didn't talk to his overlords or his future overlords. He's not allowed to
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:24.720]   if I'm not mistaken when an acquisition is in process. He's not allowed to go to the
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:31.560]   new owner and say, what do you want me to do, sir? Right. I mean, I think there must
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:37.600]   be but this must have been a long enough term project that they might have known about it
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.200]   before. But, you know, the well, some say that was the threat. That was the threat that
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.880]   Nokia said, if you don't bias, we're going to make an Android phone.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:52.400]   All right. I mean, it seems like this is a good way to play it though, right? If you're
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:57.000]   Nokia and you want to keep the Android, if you want to go into Android, you do it right
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.040]   before the acquisition. So they can't stop you.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:06.800]   And there's plausible deniability. Right. Satya could say, well, I didn't know that and
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.800]   fire. Yeah, right.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:12.840]   The Nokia, according to Stephen E. Lop, at speaking at the event at Mobile World Congress,
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.080]   the Nokia X is a feeder system for Lumia.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:20.320]   Lumia is the Windows phone version. It takes people to Microsoft's cloud, not Google's
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:26.480]   cloud. That's one of the big problems really is Microsoft wants to be on the cloud platform
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:33.560]   business and Google is a direct competitor on cloud. Forget operating systems. The cloud's
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:37.400]   where it's all going to happen, right? So it gets people to Microsoft's cloud, not Google's
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:43.160]   cloud says E-Lop. We are deliberately using Android, but substituting Nokia services.
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.040]   This is a gateway to Microsoft. Incredible?
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:52.240]   I think it's slightly credible. I mean, there's one question, right, which is if you get one
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.480]   of these phones and you get a whole bunch of Android's apps on it, then like you can't
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.120]   then move to a Windows phone because your Android apps won't work on it. But you will
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:04.040]   be a part of all the rest of Microsoft services.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.800]   Get them hooked on one drive, the renamed Sky drive, get them hooked on Bing, get them
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:13.920]   hooked on Microsoft services. Maybe it won't be such a big transition to leave the Android
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.120]   apps and come to Windows phone.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:21.640]   But I think that obviously the danger here is that it creates so much uncertainty within
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:26.840]   the market, which when people buying the phone, people developing for Windows, people buying
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.320]   Android apps on these phones, that the question is, is that going to overcome any kind of
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:36.200]   advantage they were going to get by kind of trying to create some kind of feeder system.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.960]   We should also point out, Paul Thorett was furious. Paul Thorett was a heck on Twitter.
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:46.320]   But he pointed out that the Lumia 520, which is Nokia's low cost Windows phone, is pretty
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:51.400]   much the same specs, the same price, in fact, is even a little less expensive than a Nokia
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:57.240]   X. So Nokia already has this gateway drug, this entry level.
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:03.920]   And it's one of their best selling phones. It's a great phone. Yeah, it's a huge seller
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:09.120]   worldwide. This is the phone when you hear Stephen Elop and others say, "You know, Windows
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.120]   phone is outselling iPhone and, you know, market X, this is the phone they're buying
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:17.680]   in Russia." Right. I mean, I think their high-end devices aren't doing well at all,
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:22.600]   but those low-end devices are doing really well. And it's because of, right, all those
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:28.280]   countries where the low-end devices sell well, and this is sort of competing well against
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:33.760]   the cheap Android zones. So question for the panel. Presuming China
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:38.680]   approves the Nokia acquisition in the next month or so, Nokia becomes part of Microsoft.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:47.120]   Does Sachin Adela kill the Nokia X far ahead? No, I don't think he kills the Nokia X specifically.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:55.200]   I think that they might, I don't know, I think that deciding what to do with Nokia generally
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:59.840]   will be his first decision, but I don't know. I don't think he kills this project specifically.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:05.680]   Is it going to be kind, Larry Magadot, are they going to kin it?
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:11.720]   No, my sense is if they're smart, they will embrace it, and they will really push a Windows
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:18.080]   looking UI. They will really approach Microsoft services, and they'll think about the potential
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.400]   to actually really build a platform. I think they'd be, you know, he may be stupid, he
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:27.200]   may say, "Hey, wait a minute, it's Windows, you know, all about Windows, but if he's smart,
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.520]   he'll stick with it." I think it's actually a brilliant move. And maybe for legal reasons,
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:36.040]   Microsoft had nothing to do with it, but I'd like to think they were smart enough to
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:40.520]   encourage that. It's Jujitsu. Do you think that the Microsoft then drops Windows phone?
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:45.560]   No, I think they continue Windows phone at the high end, but I think ultimately it's
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.520]   going to wither on the vine.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:52.960]   That's a mess. They already, I mean, Microsoft's already bemoaning the multi OS problem that
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.200]   they're in. But I think they will. They'll keep, they're not going to kill Windows phone.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:00.840]   So they have one more OS, what do you think? I think they don't kill it eventually, but
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:05.440]   they eventually kill one of them. You know, like, they both of them aren't going to last
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.000]   forever. They're going to let them both run for a year or two, and then they're going
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.240]   to start allowing one of them to not get updated.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.240]   I predict this.
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.480]   But they're going to add a lot of value to the Android phone. They're going to make this
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:21.800]   Android phone look just like Amazon did. It's going to look and act different enough that
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.600]   it will still have a unique Microsoft signature or unique Nokia signature on it.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:30.440]   Well, I mean, I think if it starts at the low end, if it starts on their low end devices
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:35.360]   and they see it doing well, they might sort of, you know, expand it up the line. And then
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:42.360]   if you have a Lumia type phone that comes in Windows and comes in Android, you might
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.920]   get the Android one because, you know, it runs the apps.
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.600]   Right. We all have more from Mobile World Congress or
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:54.600]   Solona in just a bit. We've got Larry Magget here. Oh, by the way, I didn't give you my
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:19:01.800]   prediction. I predict the day that Stephen Elop walks in the door in Redmond. They kill
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:07.600]   Nokia X immediately. It's gone. It's Microsoft's done it before. The kin lasted one month.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.560]   They don't kill. They don't mind.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:14.480]   And I think they kill it immediately. I think while I agree, it's an interesting strategy.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:19.680]   It's just too much of a mess. And what's sad is the damage is done. Windows developers
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:23.080]   are already going to be very nervous about this.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:27.680]   You wrote an article, Larry, on Larry's World dot com, Microsoft's bold new Android strategy.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.000]   It's Nokia's. I'm not sure it's Microsoft's.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.320]   No, give him credit. We shall see.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.480]   Yep. We shall see credit. Alex Lindsay is also here from the Pixelcorpixacore.com. Great
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:42.320]   to have you. And what is his hat? After we could digital media academy? That's your
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:47.280]   school in Rwanda? Yeah. That's awesome. Let's talk more about that in a bit. Farhad Manju
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:52.600]   enjoying the free drinks at a doctor's conference in San Diego.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:57.200]   Pre-drugs too. Right. It's the thing on the hook, great. He also.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:06.240]   I'm quite about that. The Oxycontin table in the back. Very popular. He. But more importantly,
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:12.160]   he writes for the New York Times where he is that now the guy, the guy, and Molly Woods
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:19.200]   joined you, which is awesome. What is it? What is Molly going to be doing for you over there?
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.520]   She's going to be doing some more stuff. She writes about, I mean, she was going to be writing
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.560]   reviews. She's going to be covering personal personal
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.640]   tech in the same way. The Times went through kind of an audition, kind of a
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:32.600]   re-gis-and-kelly style audition process where they had various people taking David
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:39.360]   Polk's blog and writing for it. But I'm very pleased with the choices that they made.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:45.360]   It's really good. Times is, by the way, I should point out, one of the examples Mark
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:52.240]   and Driesen used just this week as a traditional property that's made the transition to a
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:57.680]   digital quite well. Yeah, very well. Yeah. I have to say, so I went, I mean, I just started
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.960]   a few weeks ago. I had this picture in my mind of people at the New York Times being
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:09.200]   old newspaper people. I went there and they were very savvy, smart digital people talking
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:18.760]   about the web in a way that I imagine people everywhere else talking. It was just sort
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.680]   of a culture shock. I didn't expect that they wouldn't be kind of wedded to print.
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.840]   Yeah, it was not exciting. I would actually talk about this and Driesen post on his blog
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.200]   and Driesen Horowitz, "The Future of the News Business," a monumental Twitter stream
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:37.040]   all in one place. That's the blog post where he mentions that the New York Times is getting
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:43.520]   it right. Among others, we'll talk about that. And a lot more news from Barcelona.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:49.240]   There's Bitcoin news. I don't know what to make of that. Maybe what I use can explain
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:53.400]   what's going on at Mt. Gox. And a lot more. I showed you they brought to you by our friends
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:57.120]   at Stamps.com. I can tell you one thing. You don't want to be going to the post office
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:01.920]   right about now with the new postage rates. Of course, everybody's going into buy stamps.
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:08.600]   If you do mailing for your business, if you do fulfillment for your business, it's crazy
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:13.760]   to bring arm-loaded packages to the post office. The cost of the stamp just went to
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.960]   49 cents. And a lot of people are at the post office to buy new stamps. When you could
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:23.280]   just be sitting at your desk, printing out postage like crazy on your computer, your
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:26.760]   printer. I'm not talking a postage meter. I'm not talking special links. I'm talking
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.400]   stamps.com. With stamps.com, you actually pay less for postage than you will at the post
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:36.160]   office. Whether it's first-class mail priority or priority mail express packages, they have
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:41.000]   discounts you can't get at the post office. It's very easy too. You can actually print
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.240]   if you want. They have the labels to print stamps or whatever. You don't have to go
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:48.000]   to the post office. But you can also print right on the envelope. So if you do mailers
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.080]   in your business or invoices, your logo, the return address is automatically added. The
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:58.720]   address for the recipient is taken from your QuickBooks. It just spits them out. It couldn't
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:03.360]   be easier. And of course, the postage is printed right on it. They keep the rates up to date.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.080]   There's no additional charge. Sometimes these postage meters actually charge you
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:11.440]   to update the cost of postage in the postage meter. That's crazy. If you're shipping packages,
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.440]   it'll do the labels effect. I'm going to show you how you can get the USB scale. You put
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:18.680]   the package on the scale. It automatically prints the right postage, the right label.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:23.280]   It even calculates. It even does things like calculate the costs to do priority express.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:27.400]   If it's international, it'll fill out the forms for you. And then you still don't have
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.960]   to go to the post office with this arm load of packages. The mail carrier comes and gets
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:37.040]   it. And I don't know if you know this. I found out when I was mailing some books out. The
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:39.960]   post office, if it's more than 13 ounces, you're supposed to bring it in so they can
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:45.320]   look in the nine and you look suspicious, not with stamps.com because of the way stamps.com
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:49.920]   works. They trust you. They come. They get it. There's even a big button on your stamps.com
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:54.040]   software that says get the mail carrier out here. Even if you missed the pickup. I love
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:59.000]   it. I want you to try it. We use it here. Just go to stamps.com and you'll see a special
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.920]   $80 bat value. Don't don't fall for that. Click the microphone in the upper right hand
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:09.120]   corner. We can make this better. Please use our offer code TWIT in that $80 special. No
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:15.120]   risk trial turns into a $110 bonus value. You're going to get $55 in free postage to
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:20.160]   use over the first few months as a stamps.com customer. We will throw in that digital scale.
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:23.280]   It's worth 50 bucks that you do pay shipping and handling. I think it's about five bucks
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:27.880]   on that. But they make it up with a $5 supply kit and of course a four week free trial of
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:35.560]   stamps.com. Please go to stamps.com. Click the microphone and use the offer code TWIT and
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:41.320]   stop going to the post office. Start using stamps.com. You're watching Twit this week
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:48.040]   in Tech. Samsung scared us a little bit. They're a galaxy or they're I guess they call unpacked
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:54.000]   five event which was earlier this week in Barcelona. The Mobile World Congress started
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.840]   7 p.m. in Barcelona. First day of the Congress. People are tired with a chamber music orchestra
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:06.400]   playing Soperific music to the assembled journalist. Farhud, you didn't go to Barcelona this year.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:12.520]   No, I didn't go. Yeah. I would have been asleep. And I was reason I was worried is because
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:17.720]   after that horrible Broadway show that they did for the Galaxy S4, which you were at that
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.000]   one, Larry? I was in New York for that. Yeah, that was bizarre.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.760]   I thought Symphony Orchestra, I'm thinking, oh boy, here we go again. I was just waiting
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:31.240]   for them to roll the sets on stage. So they went in the other direction? Very tight set.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:36.800]   Yeah. They just, yeah, it was simple. They had their executives come out. They showed
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:43.800]   the Galaxy S5. They didn't show very much of the Galaxy S5. They showed none of the software
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:48.240]   features and they were done in 45 minutes. Yep. And they streamed it, which was nice.
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:52.960]   Yeah. We did our live coverage of that action we had gotten up early in the morning. Like
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:59.600]   we were there 1130 p.m. Mike Elgin and I covering the Nokia event as well. And I thought Stephen
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:04.520]   Eelop knocked it out of the park. He was concise. He did it all in 45 minutes and asked five
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:10.600]   new phones in 45 minutes. Was able to position. Yeah. And was able to position them quite well.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.760]   Samsung did announce new watches as well. They don't call them the Galaxy gears anymore.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:19.040]   Just the gears. There's the gear. Neo, which I guess is basically like the old gear. There's
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:25.840]   the gear and then the gear fit. Fitness, which has got to look better than this. I mean, it
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:31.240]   looks this is the, you're wearing a gear? Oh, you got a fit. No, I say, but compare it.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:36.040]   The gear is so much classier than this. I thought the gear fit was pretty nice. Yeah,
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:41.920]   it was very nice. I like to. I want to get one of those. So it's, it's, I mean, a lot
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:45.560]   of ways the gear fit looks a lot like some of the rumors for where, you know, the directions
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:52.400]   that Apple looks a lot more going, doesn't it? With the curved super AMOLED screen. It's,
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:56.640]   it's a fitness watch. Now the big old gear, by the way, this is the one that they're replacing.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.840]   This is the ugly old gear compared. Yeah. It's actually not bad. It's still look better
[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:05.200]   than the fit. But it's, but the, the new gear is much, much nicer looking. I don't have it
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.760]   yet. They don't have the camera anymore in the new gear though. No, there is a camera.
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.400]   In the, in the old gear, the camera is in the, I don't know if you could see it. It's in the,
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.200]   the band. It looks like a suction cup coming out of the band. That means you're locked into
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.920]   this band. You can't swap out the band because the camera's there. The new gear, I believe
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.280]   the camera is actually in the body, the watch itself, which means you can talk about. How
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:30.960]   do you see what you're shooting? You don't. You just kind of roughly do this. Yeah, you
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:39.600]   wear it like this and you kind of smile. It also has its own memory, which is nice so
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.680]   that you can put music on it for what do they say? Four gigs of memory. So you could put music
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:48.400]   on it. You don't have to have the phone if you're working out with it. This is the, the
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:52.200]   gear fit, the curved. Oh, no, I'm sorry. That's the Huawei. Let me go back a little bit. This
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:56.480]   is the gear Neo. Did they announce prices on the gear on any of the gear? They did not
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:28:00.320]   in fact, they didn't announce prices on anything or availability on anything. Yeah. I want
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.640]   to know what the gear fits going to cost. I think they implied it would be less than
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:11.720]   the old gear. Did they not the JK Shen not say for less something like that? Well, the
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:16.080]   fit ought to be less since it's not a full fledged smartwatch. I mean, it should definitely
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:21.120]   be it should be 200 or less. It's better looking. Yeah. That's for sure. And then the
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:26.840]   S5 and what we've also learned, even though they didn't talk about all the companion software,
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:30.720]   the touch with stuff, that there's even less free space in the Galaxy S5 than there was
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:38.920]   in the Galaxy S4. The S4 came with roughly nine gigs free out of 16. If you buy a 16 gig
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:44.560]   S5, you'll have eight gigs free. That only means more cruft to me.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:52.360]   Now, did we talk about the OS on the on the? Yes. So the watches are not Android. They're
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:58.600]   not Android. This is their internal developed operating system. Right. I mean, my problem
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:04.720]   with Galaxy gear is you have to marry it with a Galaxy phone. I mean, if I could use Galaxy
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:08.960]   gear on my choice of phones, I'd be a lot happier with it. I actually wore the Galaxy
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:14.120]   gear to CES and I describe it as a $1,000 per-dometer. That was all I used it for. And
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:18.400]   between the gear and the phone that you needed to use it, it was a $1,000 investment. Do
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:22.560]   you like the Pebble better? The Pebble at least is open. You can use it on any phone. Yeah,
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:26.640]   I do like it better. Or for that reason. No, I mean, for that reason, I like it. I mean,
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:31.440]   if I were going to buy a smartwatch test to when I would buy at this very moment, because
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:35.840]   you can use it with me. Would you buy one? No. I bought one, but that was because I
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:41.040]   was on Kickstarter and I didn't know any better. Yeah. I buy everything on Kickstarter. Kind
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:45.800]   of a Kickstarter sucker. You can buy a pedometer for 10 bucks. And for my practical purposes,
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:50.980]   I'll submit all I use these things. My pebbles in the drawer. Someday I'll find it. Chad
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:59.560]   wants it. Someday I'll figure out what drawer it's in. And I'll be a bequest to Chad in my
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:08.040]   will. And to Chad Johnson, my loyal employee, I give a guy who runs the video switchboard
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:13.600]   during Twitter. He gets my pebble. I don't really want it. I think it's an old Pebble
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:22.240]   Watch. Use it in good health, Chad. Far, how do you wear any of these watches or bands
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:28.480]   or anything? I do not. I had a fitbit for a while. I had a couple of fitbits for a while,
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:36.080]   and I lost each one. Me too. Yeah. Me too. But I think I like to fitbit best of all of
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:41.040]   them, mostly because it seemed like the least hassle-free. But even that, like the fact
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:45.680]   that I, after I lost them, I didn't replace them because they just weren't adding that
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.560]   much to my life. I actually just found them. Actually, the funny thing is I lost this thing
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:53.520]   for the problem with the Fitbit is they come with these ridiculous, I don't know if you
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:59.360]   can see this, they come with these clasps that break. Yeah. And so I swapped out Velcro,
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:05.500]   which actually was even worse. But it looks even more nerdy. It's possible. It worked
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:10.200]   better. I have used duct tape. So I heard though that you could send that back and they'll
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:15.000]   give you a nickel. No, wait a minute. That's wrong. They have nickel, then they'll make
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.680]   your skin itch. And if you send it to them in eight weeks, they'll send you a...
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.640]   But it is amazing that you could have an incredibly high-tech product and screw it up
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:28.600]   with an incredibly bad low-tech band. Yeah. I mean, you think Apple would not get that
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:34.040]   wrong. So is Apple gonna release one of these things? Everybody's room-ring this.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:37.880]   They've got a lot of people working there on it. So I mean, the rumors are, I mean, they
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.080]   have 50 or 60 people working on something. The embarrassing if they don't. Yeah. But
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:44.400]   you know, they've definitely been reports. Apple has definitely worked on things where
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:49.160]   they do... They spend $100 million on something or $50 million on R&D and then they throw it
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:53.080]   away because they've decided it's not what they want. So I mean, it's not... It's definitely
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.720]   possible for Apple to work on something they're not gonna release if they can't find a compelling
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.840]   solution. But they have an awful lot of people working on it.
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.760]   Is there such a thing as being too late to the party or does Apple get to reinvent the
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.080]   party no matter when they come in? They're very late for the phone party and seem to
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.680]   work out okay for them. Right. I think they get to re-invert this. I mean, especially
[00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:17.280]   if there's is much better and offers are compelling reason to use it. But that's the
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:23.320]   hard part, right? The offering enough here that you want to keep using it all the time.
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:27.960]   That's something that I haven't found with any of these devices. They seem kind of cool
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:32.240]   for the first three or four days and then you get tired of them.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.480]   The other problem I have is that the other watch that I occasionally wear when I travel
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:40.000]   internationally, I think the battery lasts 10 years. And the fact you have to one more
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.440]   thing to manage and keep charging. I don't know. That just somehow doesn't work for me
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:47.920]   for a watch. I want to watch to... I don't want to have to manage my watch and remember
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:56.000]   to plug it in. Yeah, I agree. I mean, just like having so many devices to keep charging
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:04.680]   is the worst thing now. I mean, a laptop, an iPhone or phone. And I barely have a tablet
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:09.880]   charged anymore because it's just another thing. It does mean it's hard to get home. At the
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:14.400]   end of the day, the get home ritual becomes very much more elaborate where you take everything
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.760]   out of your pockets and you plug it in. Oh, I get in. And the other thing that kills
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:22.600]   me is at least on most of these things, they have proprietary chargers. Oh, yeah. So I haven't
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:26.200]   lost my devices, but I've actually lost the chargers, which means I may as well throw away
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:31.640]   the devices. And if they can only at least come up with a micro USB or something non-proprietary,
[00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:37.280]   that would help. But I can't manage all of these charging stations and cables. I mean,
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:43.480]   it just... Yeah, I know for me, if it's not micro USB and it's not the lightning that
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:47.640]   Apple makes, I pretty much won't buy it. Exactly. It does the only two that I have my
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:52.000]   bag now at this point. Exactly. Well, these have micro USB, but you still need the proprietary
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:58.840]   charger to get actually into the watch itself. Same thing with the Samsung Gear. It's a proprietary
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:03.400]   cake cradle that you have to remember to bring with you. So you can't just plug it into it.
[00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:09.560]   You really can't just plug the micro USB into a charger and it won't charge it at all.
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:15.880]   No, I actually have lost the cradle too. That's the problem. These companies send me these things
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:19.880]   and they want them back. And I gladly send them back, but I've always lose all the pieces that
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:24.040]   goes with it. Right. Chad made a real point. If I give them the pebble, I have to give them the
[00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:28.600]   charger. I can't promise that, Chad. I really... It's a request. I was probably, I guess.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:35.400]   The charger. He's in my will for the... I was like Slingshee. I was waiting for the macro.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:39.640]   It can be Quith, a pebble charger. Talk to Chad if you want to work together.
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:45.160]   I think for this Internet of Things, we would really take off if we had, you know,
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:50.600]   widespread, compatible wireless charging. Do you guys like G? Do you guys like wireless charging?
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:56.920]   Like G? It's not great, but it's okay. I mean, it works when you have it nearby,
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:03.320]   but if wireless charging worked everywhere, if I had a wireless charger thing in my car and
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:07.400]   like every coffee shop and you could just put stuff down on a table and it would work.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:14.280]   I think we should just send massive inductance waves. You're testing around the whole world all
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:21.720]   the time and things would just charge. That's what we should do here at the Brickhouse Studios.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:25.640]   They will all have cancer in four years, but our stuff will be charged.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:30.040]   All right. I think Edison claimed the Tesla's technology was going to electrocute all of us.
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:33.640]   Did he kill the elephant? Who killed the elephant? Tesla killed the elephant.
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:38.600]   No. Edison killed the elephant. Edison killed the elephant with Tesla's technology.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.560]   That's right. An enormous amount of it. It's kind of like...
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:45.160]   I'll never forgive him for that.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:54.520]   Speaking of elephants, the self-described conservative think tank, NCPPR,
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:59.400]   came to the Apple shareholders meeting and demanded that Apple disclose the cost of
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:05.480]   its sustainability programs, that they be more transparent about their participation in
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:10.040]   hippie liberal ideology. They didn't say that, but you might as well have.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.320]   That's what they were thinking.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:15.720]   Tim Cook said, "If you don't like it, stop investing in Apple."
[00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:22.920]   He said, "There are many things Apple do because they're right and just. Return on investment is
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:28.360]   not the primary consideration on such issues." I didn't see this. I don't know if there's video
[00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:32.440]   of it. I want to see it. He says, "When we work on making our devices accessible by the blind,
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.280]   I don't consider the bloody ROI. I think he was pretty angry."
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.880]   Yeah. "Be free for him."
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:42.680]   Yeah. His body language change, according to the Mac Observer, his face contracted.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:48.520]   He spoke in rapid fire sentences. He's kind of a southerner, so that's unusual.
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:53.320]   He also looked directly at the NCPPR representative and said, "If you want me to do things only for
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:56.120]   return on investment, you should get out of this stock."
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:59.000]   I think Apple needs to say that more often.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.600]   Wow. Get out of my stock.
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:06.840]   I think you could also make a good argument that it does help the stock.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:11.720]   I mean, it helps some of the products. These are premium products. You want them
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:18.280]   to kind of people who buy them think about those kinds of things. If you turned out that these were
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:24.520]   horribly polluting, but you were still paying a premium price for them, people would wonder about
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:28.280]   that. I think that there's an argument to be made in the opposite direction that Apple, in fact,
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:31.640]   is pretending to be eco-friendly when, in fact, it's not.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.120]   That's very real.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.120]   That's very real.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:38.280]   Complaining there's probably 10 eco-activists standing out in front, complaining Apple isn't
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.480]   doing enough.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:42.280]   Some of those trade organizations are run by Apple.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:47.080]   I don't know.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:49.720]   Let's face it, this stuff is crap. It's ruining the environment.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:53.080]   They're made by slave labor.
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:54.920]   What are we going to do?
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.600]   It's a dirty business.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.200]   I think it's continually getting better, but it's pretty messy.
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.720]   We should call them to task. I'm glad that Tim.
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:05.480]   I think the people, I think more and more of this stuff.
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:11.160]   When you look at social media, when you look at the decentralized media process,
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:16.760]   I think that it is more important than ever for companies to have the glow of them at least
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.760]   trying to do the right thing, or at least moving in that direction. I don't think that they can't
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:25.240]   just spin it with a handful of media organizations and have it all go the right direction anymore.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:28.680]   They have to actually keep on moving down this path, or it will affect their bottom line.
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.600]   There are plenty of people keeping an eye out for that. They can't get away with
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:36.200]   too much these days with all the activist groups out there watching them.
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:38.840]   I say good for the activist groups.
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:43.800]   Too bad we don't have Pournail on the show. He'd probably be saying it.
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:44.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.800]   You know, I can channel him.
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:53.800]   As Robert Heinlein once told me, you guys are full of poop.
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:39:01.160]   Then we love Jerry. We love Jerry. We try not to get too political here, but Jerry would probably
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:07.720]   have something to say. There is a new book. I haven't looked at the excerpts of this book.
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:16.120]   I saw it on Jim Dowrymples, The Loop. There's a new book out, I think by a Wall Street Journal
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:22.920]   writer about Apple. I actually like the name. Let me see if I can find this here.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:31.400]   Something like Haunted House, Haunted Empire, Apple after Steve Jobs.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:35.560]   The author, Yucari Cain, do you know her far on?
[00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:40.760]   I don't know her personally, but she was at the journal until recently.
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:41.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.680]   Left to write this book.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:46.360]   Dowrymples says the excerpt is well written. It's certainly interesting.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:50.600]   My only gripe is it seems a little one-sided and one-dimensional. It dehumanizes Tim Cook.
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:55.160]   Focuses on anecdotes of Painem as a harsh taskmaster.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:58.280]   If you're the CEO, go ahead.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:02.520]   I didn't think so. I read that excerpt and I thought it was really interesting.
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:06.600]   I thought that I learned more about Tim Cook from it, particularly,
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:14.840]   I mean, it sort of filled out the kind of the stereotype public image that we have of him is
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:22.520]   that he's very sober and level-headed compared to Steve Jobs, but kind of a little bit soulless.
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:27.400]   And this made him seem less soulless. I didn't know this. One of the first things he did at Apple
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:31.400]   was to start a charity matching program.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:31.880]   That's right.
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:35.800]   He became CEO, which is something that Jobs had long ignored.
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:40.360]   Written more than ignored, refused to do. He did not want to get involved in corporate giving at all.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:47.000]   Yeah. And I thought the excerpt was really good. I look forward to reading up.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   Meetings with Cook, she writes, could be terrifying. He exuded a Zen-like calm and didn't waste words.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.240]   Talk about your numbers. Put your spreadsheet up, he'd say, as he nursed a mountain dew.
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:04.360]   I like touches like that. Some staffers wondered why he wasn't bouncing off the walls from the caffeine.
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:08.840]   When Cook turned the spotlight on someone, he hammered them with questions until he was satisfied.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:12.120]   Why is that? What do you mean? I don't understand. Why are you not making it clear?
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:17.560]   He was known to ask the same question 10 times in a row. He called himself the "atilent the
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:22.360]   hunt of inventory." But that's what he was always known as a brilliant operations guy.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:33.240]   And I have... I read the Brad Stone's book about Amazon, the Everything Store. Very similar stuff,
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:39.080]   claims Jeff Bezos would browbeat employees and say, "You're ruining my company. I've heard the
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:44.840]   same thing from Steve Jobs many times." I mentioned your... It seems to me maybe to run a big company
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:50.200]   like this, you kind of have to do that. I think that you definitely have to create some movement
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:55.240]   and energy. I think that if you run any company... And call people on the carpet, make them
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:42:00.760]   responsible for their stuff. You can't just say, "Well, you missed your goals this week." It's okay.
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:09.480]   Come back next week. I don't know. I do that to my employees. Right, Chad? That Teble Wash is on
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:15.000]   the line. Johnson, just remember. You're not here on time. You're ruining this company. I need
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.960]   the pebble. Have I ever said to you, "You're ruining my company"? No. Yeah. Lisa, have I ever
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:30.520]   said that to you? Never mind. She could answer yes. As long as we're talking Jim Dalrymple at the
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:36.680]   loop, he has squashed the idea that Apple might have a new Apple TV. We've been talking about it
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:45.640]   quite a bit. He quotes Salvador Rodriguez in the LA Times saying that this $25 iTunes gift card
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:52.440]   being offered right now at, I think, Target is part of a promotion that could signal a new Apple
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:59.720]   TV is on its way to which Dalrymple says, "Nope." So there you have it. It's official.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:06.280]   Interesting. Well, the question is simply can Apple do anything that really
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:10.360]   changes the nature of TV in a way that we're all going to say, "Wow." I don't think they're
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:14.920]   talking about television set. I think they're talking about a new Apple talk. Oh, I see. A new...
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:18.680]   Yeah. No, I think we've all agreed now that the television set was somebody's fever dream.
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:26.040]   I mean, why would they do a new Apple TV set-top box? The one they have now is pretty much perfect
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:31.240]   and they can always just update it and add more features. They need to clean up the UI because
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:36.200]   what's happening is as you add these channels, you're getting page after page of channels.
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:39.560]   But that's software. But I can do that. That's just software. Yeah, that's easy. I think they're
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:43.560]   also... I'm very interested. I mean, beyond whatever we're using it for now for updates or people using
[00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:49.080]   it for hacks, the USB connector is to me very interesting in the... It still does nothing, right?
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:52.760]   So does nothing. I mean, the thing is, is that I think that there are a lot of opportunities
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.560]   whether this Apple TV can handle it or not. I mean, we have to remember, number one,
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:44:00.760]   this Apple TV is basically an iOS box. So, you know, what we... You know, I think the idea of opening
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:05.160]   up games, for instance, who cares about the media stuff immediately, but you open up games on the
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:09.240]   platform where your iPhones are controlling, you know, our controllers. I mean, Apple is like two
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:12.280]   inches away from doing that. I think that... I'm not saying that's just the thing came out. I know,
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:17.400]   I know. And... But I think that these are the things that I think that they can still be doing
[00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:22.120]   that could move forward. I think that also being able to hook up a webcam to my Apple TV and be
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:26.520]   able to use my TV as a way to talk to my kids. Talk to my grandparents is very compelling.
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:29.880]   You know, I think Google is way ahead of them on that. You know, I think that they're...
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:33.320]   That's Microsoft. Yeah. In the sense of the Xbox One.
[00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:37.800]   Right. Right. And I think that they're getting... And those ones are much more expensive, much more,
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:43.320]   you know, that process is much more expensive to get into. I mean, having something that's
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:47.800]   inexpensive that doesn't do much more than that, I think is a much more, you know, compelling
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:52.280]   solution. I mean, obviously there's manufacturers that are building these cameras into their...
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:59.480]   into their TVs. But I think that the... Right now, there's, in my opinion, only one sensor that
[00:44:59.480 --> 00:45:04.200]   you want to have on a webcam. So... So it's... You know, I mean, the only people that are figured
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:09.240]   out is Logitech. But what surprised me is Apple TV apparently get about a billion dollars or more
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:13.240]   than a billion dollars worth of business in 2013. So it is more than a hobby. I mean, they are...
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:16.280]   Yeah. They're actually selling these things and making real money. And they have a whole
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.560]   section now that they've opened up. I mean, obviously they've changed their store. I mean,
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:24.040]   it seems like it becomes less of a hobby when you start giving it a whole section to...
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.120]   You know, it seems like they're going to start moving something down the...
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:29.960]   Yeah. And I wonder if... That was the weirdest news story of the week, two weeks ago.
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:34.920]   Apple adds tab to website. What does it mean? Well, I mean, it definitely means that it's a
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:39.960]   lot more serious than just a... than a hobby. I guess. I think we maybe are watching Apple a
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:43.720]   little too closely when we start saying, "Oh, look, there's a new tab in the store."
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:49.560]   Isn't that the soda that came up before Diet Coke tab or am I...?
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:51.560]   Yeah. That's it. Fresca. There's an awful...
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:52.040]   Fresca. There's an awful...
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:55.080]   ...shop Apple TV. You're going to need more popcorn.
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:46:02.200]   Oh, so Apple's offering the $25 gift card as well. I don't know why there's a tab,
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:06.360]   because all they sell is the Apple TV and a cable in this particular section.
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:09.080]   That's why it doesn't make any sense. And that's why people pay attention to it,
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:12.840]   is because it's... You know, you think that they're going to add more.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:17.560]   What? What could they add? I don't know. accessories.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:24.280]   All right. Let's take a break. Come back with more. Farhan Manju is here. He is, of course, now
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:28.600]   in charge of the Bitz Blog. Are you in charge of the Bitz Blog? Are you the star of the Bitz Blog?
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:32.760]   No, I contribute to the Bitz Blog. He contributes to the Bitz Blog.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:39.640]   I don't want it. He's Mr. Digital at the New York Times in a very, very good hire, if you ask me.
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:45.080]   It's great to have you on after all this time farhan. As I said before, the show, a huge fan.
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:49.080]   You've probably been the most quoted on the Twitch for years.
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:55.320]   Yeah. Yeah. Anybody who gets in a fight with Frank Shaw...
[00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:58.040]   Yes, exactly.
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:05.000]   Gets my vote. Frank Shaw, the communications guy, actually, what is he? He's the marketing guy at
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.920]   Microsoft. What is head of communications? Yeah, he's the head PR guy. He wrote you a nasty letter.
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:22.360]   What's that all about? I don't know. I think he haven't totally thought about it.
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:29.240]   Apparently he wanted to put it in the commenting system at the times for your first column,
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:35.560]   which was a great column in which you'd said, which I agree, how to survive in the future
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:44.520]   of mass extinctions in technology. The best bet is Apple hardware, iPhones, iPads, and Macs,
[00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:50.040]   Google services, Gmail maps, and search, and buy your media from Amazon, movies, books, and music,
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:54.680]   which I completely agree with and have been doing for years. Those seem to be the three,
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:59.880]   and they interoperate. You're not stuck in anybody's ecosystem. The Amazon movies will work
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:07.800]   everywhere. You also said Dropbox was good, but no Microsoft on that list. I think Frank did.
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:11.960]   He got a little angry at that. Frank said, "Why? Why?"
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:21.400]   The funny thing was his response was he was saying that I was betting on the big guys,
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:26.920]   but he was kind of... We're just a little guy. Yeah, the underdog.
[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:29.880]   Yeah, a little little Microsoft. Don't forget us.
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:35.560]   If your mom and pop are Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates,
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:43.240]   I love that. I think your column was right on. I just think it's cool that Frank Shaw wrote
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:48.920]   your letter saying, "Was it on paper?" It was not on paper.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:49:01.640]   Welcome to the big leagues. That's when you know. When you get on the Microsoft enemies list,
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:07.960]   Larry Maggitz has been there for years. Larry Maggitz writes and talks for CBS News, and of course,
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:13.560]   you can go to Larrysworld.com to see all of his stuff. Great to have you, Alex Lindsey,
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:17.000]   from the Pixel Core, who has never received a heated note from anyone.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.360]   Well, no comment. Because they all love you, Alex.
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:24.280]   I spent a long time in the Apple penalty box. Did you? Yeah.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:28.680]   A little back and forth. No, you're nothing if you haven't spent time in the penalty box.
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:32.520]   Yeah, I go back and forth on that box, too. It's a rite of passage.
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.320]   Yeah, I haven't been in a long time, but it was in the early days.
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:39.400]   Yeah, I just... I saw you indirectly quoted, "Where was that?"
[00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:46.040]   Because they referred to the fact that Steve Jobs was known to fire people on elevators.
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:49.800]   And as far as I know, you're the one and only source of that anecdote.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:51.880]   Oh, no, no. I don't think I was the source of that anecdote.
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:54.680]   Oh, yeah, yeah. I wasn't you. No, no, no.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:56.120]   Yeah, yeah. You can see it.
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:57.800]   And the rumor is that you only fired one.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:59.480]   One guy. It was one guy.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:00.520]   One guy. Worked on some team.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:05.000]   There's lots of colorful stories.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.560]   Those guys picked up. It said he'd been fired by Steve three times.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:09.960]   Yeah.
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:10.600]   Those person picked up.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:12.440]   Just follow him behind him. Just going, "Just go back to work."
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:13.160]   Just...
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:16.520]   I don't remember. Just that way.
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:19.560]   We're going to get him a Snickers bar. He'll be much better later.
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:22.440]   Our show today brought you by Warby Parker.
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:24.040]   Well, let me show you my Warby's.
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:29.720]   So if I say to you, you could buy glasses online.
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:30.920]   You might say, "Well, that's crazy to talk."
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:34.040]   Oh, I need to buy glasses. My kids just snap mine into half.
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:34.360]   Right.
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:37.800]   There are... I got to tell you, I don't want to name names,
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:40.200]   but there's one big company that really pretty much owns everybody.
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:43.640]   And their monopoly keeps prices high.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:47.480]   Warby Parker is about to change all that.
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:51.480]   A startup that's decided that you can buy glasses online.
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:58.360]   You can get away from overpriced bland eyewear for amazing prices
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:01.560]   if you just don't participate in that.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:03.000]   And this is Warby Parker.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.240]   And this glasses started in $95.
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:08.040]   That includes the prescription lenses.
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:10.600]   And you might say, "Well, I can't do this at home.
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:11.800]   How am I going to do this at home?"
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:12.840]   This is how they get around it.
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:17.480]   This is the Warby Parker Trion Kit.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:20.280]   You know, I need this because I'm not kidding.
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:22.120]   My kids killed my glasses.
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:23.080]   Yeah, so go to Warby.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.040]   Look at all the glasses.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.960]   They've got some new ones that are really fantastic.
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:27.800]   Did you buy vocals or whatever you know we have?
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:29.160]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:29.640]   Of course.
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:32.840]   And by the way, 95 bucks includes anti-reflective
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:35.320]   and anti-glare coating, a hard case and a clean cloth.
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:37.080]   It's not some budget thing.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:40.200]   So what they do is this is the free home Trion program.
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:42.680]   Five days to try five pairs.
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:43.880]   What you do is go to Warby,
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.640]   go through all of their different glasses.
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:47.720]   They have glasses for men and women.
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:50.600]   Really some nice designer.
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:52.520]   If I look at this new spring line,
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:56.920]   eight new shapes, six new colors, all kinds of moods.
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:59.320]   So I picked a few and I got them.
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:00.840]   And they come in this nice little case.
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:01.800]   That's awesome.
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:03.560]   With the return postage and everything.
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:05.480]   So you just, you can send it back.
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:07.560]   And then you try them on and you, you know.
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:08.600]   They're not the prescription there.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:09.320]   That's just the triathlon.
[00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:10.200]   These are just, they're clear.
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:11.880]   And then they build a glasses for you.
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:13.160]   Yeah, and you pick out, pick out.
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:14.920]   No, that's a little small.
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:15.640]   Yeah.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:20.040]   Mr. Johnson, I wish to speak to you about your productivity.
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:21.000]   That's not going to work.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:21.720]   I like these.
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:22.920]   Those are good.
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:23.480]   Those are very nice.
[00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:24.520]   I look like an intellectual.
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:25.480]   Yes.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:25.800]   Yes.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:26.680]   Smart fellow.
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:27.640]   Anyway, you try them on.
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:28.040]   I don't know.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:28.520]   I don't know.
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:29.000]   I don't know.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:29.400]   I don't know.
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:29.960]   Huh?
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:33.240]   I just had 20 IQ just by wearing them.
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:35.080]   And then you upload your prescription to them
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.200]   and then they build it for you.
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:38.280]   So you pick the glasses you want.
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:39.640]   You pack it back up.
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:40.520]   Send it back to them.
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:42.120]   Returns are fine.
[00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:44.120]   Even after you do this for 30 days,
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:45.880]   you can return anything you want.
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:46.920]   Very nice selection.
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:49.320]   They partner with nonprofits like VisionSpring
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:51.400]   to give pairs to people in need,
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.720]   which is nice when you buy glasses.
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:55.400]   For every pair of glasses,
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:56.600]   you buy from Warby Parker.
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:58.200]   They're going to give another pair
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:59.480]   to somebody who needs them.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:01.880]   It's great.
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.400]   They have a place where you can take the photos of it
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:05.480]   and share your pictures with people and say,
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:06.040]   what do you think?
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:10.200]   The special frame box prepaid shipping label
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:13.320]   and everything, it's all absolutely free.
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:15.160]   So I want you to visit WarbyParker.com.
[00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:17.080]   I've been trying to get the monocle.
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:19.400]   The monocle I think is out of stock.
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:22.680]   They sell a monocle and I really want that.
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.440]   We've been trying, right?
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:26.920]   You know what's interesting though?
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:30.120]   I mean, not to hone in on your advertising,
[00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.960]   but this notion of disrupting
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:34.120]   how different industries are being disrupted.
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.960]   That's what I love about the internet.
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:36.680]   Yes.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:39.640]   How many industries are there that are just having to change?
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:41.720]   So let's disintermediate.
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:43.720]   Let's break this monopoly.
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.800]   And half a million glasses now have been distributed
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:47.240]   to people in need thanks to Warby,
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:52.040]   which is really, I just think a wonderful idea.
[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:53.400]   Buy a pair, give a pair.
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:59.800]   So I invite you to go to W-A-R-B-Y-P-A-R-K-E-R.com.
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:03.880]   They do have storefronts in New York, L.A. and Boston.
[00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:07.800]   So you can go see the glasses if you like in person.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:12.200]   But frankly, I think the whole idea of the free home try on it,
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:13.720]   to me, I want to buy everything online.
[00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:14.920]   I don't want to buy anything.
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:17.880]   I don't want to go, I don't want to get out of my chair.
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:20.120]   This is a great idea.
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.240]   Not that we're lazy or anything.
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:23.160]   Great little startup, WarbyParker.com.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.960]   In fact, do we have a deal?
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:27.960]   Let me see when I'm going to go back to the ad here.
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:29.320]   I hope we have a deal because I'm on the site.
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:31.240]   We always have a deal of try-ons.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:31.960]   Where's the deal?
[00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:35.560]   Go to warbyparker.com/twit.
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:38.600]   Ah, you get three-day shipping free on your frame.
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:39.800]   Please give them a try.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:42.040]   I think you will like them.
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:48.040]   Mark Andreessen, who I don't normally think of as a media critic.
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:52.360]   He's the guy who created, of course, Netscape before it.
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:56.440]   He was a graduate student at the University of Illinois,
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:59.480]   Urbana, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications,
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:00.520]   wrote Mosaic.
[00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:01.240]   Was it Mosaic?
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:02.680]   Yep.
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:03.640]   That's it.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:04.120]   And the day.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:04.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:06.680]   Well, not the day, but I remember when he did it.
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:07.720]   I remember the day.
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:11.560]   I remember the-- because Mosaic was the first browser to support animated gifts.
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:13.640]   Now, I remember when I first thought I was blown away by it.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:15.560]   I mean, I thought, oh my god, this changes.
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:17.320]   Because, you know, I had just written a book called
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:19.480]   Larry Maggots Guide to the New Digital Highways,
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:22.200]   and exciting products like Source and the CompuServe.
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:23.560]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:26.280]   And in the UNIX, the internet, which was all UNIX,
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:29.080]   and to see a graphical interface actually.
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:30.040]   Am I boggling?
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.480]   It was my name.
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:34.760]   Remember, the backgrounds were all gray, which was weird, right?
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:36.920]   They didn't have white-- I don't know why it gets easier on the eyes.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:39.400]   And then I remember the first time I saw-- I remember very well,
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:42.200]   the first animated GIF I ever saw, it was a compass,
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.160]   and the needle was turning.
[00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:45.720]   And it was-- so I'd been used to static text.
[00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:46.920]   And all of a sudden, I'm looking at a web page,
[00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:47.640]   and the needle's turning.
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:50.600]   I'm going, that's bizarre, but it blew me away.
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:51.880]   Yeah, right.
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:57.080]   Anyway, Mark then, of course, starts very famously, starts.
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:59.800]   Netscape, the big IPO in '97, I think,
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:01.480]   which was the beginning of the internet.
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:02.520]   Bubble made a little money.
[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:05.960]   He's now a venture capitalist, Andres in Horowitz,
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:07.400]   and a very outspoken one.
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:11.480]   It has been engaged in a Twitter debate, 140 characters at a time,
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:13.160]   over the future of journalism.
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:14.840]   That's a lot of Twittering.
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:16.680]   It's really good and engaged.
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:17.320]   A lot of people.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:20.120]   It was really-- P-M-A-R-C-A is his--
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:23.640]   I'm not sure what the P stands for.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:28.360]   Maybe his first name is Paul, really, and his P-Markah anyway.
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:31.640]   But he finally wrote a blog post, thank goodness,
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:33.400]   on the future of the news business,
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.240]   a monumental Twitter stream all in one place.
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:37.960]   But he talks about-- and I think he's right.
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:40.520]   He says, "I'm more bullish about the future of the news industry
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:43.480]   over the next 20 years than almost anyone else I know.
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:46.840]   You will see it grow 10 to 100 times what it is today."
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:51.720]   And people have been promoting the future of journalism.
[00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:55.640]   This, to me, is really good news.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:57:01.480]   And while I don't think he is necessarily a brilliant media analyst,
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:03.720]   I think he's right on in almost everything he says.
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:07.720]   He says, "Distribution is going from-- thanks to the internet,
[00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:09.640]   going from lockdown to completely open.
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:10.920]   Anyone can create and distribute.
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:14.840]   There's no monetary premium for control of distribution anymore."
[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:17.640]   That was the thing that kept a lot of publishers in business.
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:21.160]   Formerly, separate industries are colliding on the internet.
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:24.920]   It's newspaper versus magazine versus broadcast TV versus cable TV
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:27.000]   versus wire service they all compete.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.600]   And those two factors drive down prices at the same time.
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.360]   Market size is exploding.
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:34.920]   And this is the one people might disagree with.
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.120]   But I agree with 100%.
[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:38.120]   We are essentially a news operation.
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:40.360]   More people are consuming news now than they were before.
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:43.000]   And Leo, you are actually one of the poster children.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.480]   I've actually had conversations with media executives
[00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:48.280]   from great big networks who are absolutely amazed
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:50.280]   how you were able to build your own network
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:53.560]   without having to sign up with one of the big ones.
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:55.800]   So just like you were saying earlier,
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:58:00.040]   the brand can be the individual or the small business no longer need.
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:01.880]   I mean, I happen to be associated with CBS,
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:03.080]   which is one of the big networks.
[00:58:03.080 --> 00:58:07.000]   But you don't absolutely need that to have an audience anymore.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:07.720]   No.
[00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:10.200]   Well, and this came up before the show where I was talking to Farhad,
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:12.920]   saying, "I can't remember where I read your stuff,
[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:13.880]   but I read your stuff."
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:16.360]   So I remember your name and read your stuff.
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:18.520]   And don't tell the times this,
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:22.200]   but where it is on the web is secondary to the actual content.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:24.760]   And that is very...
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:25.960]   Go ahead.
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:30.920]   It's because I can promote my stuff on Twitter and Facebook.
[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:36.760]   And that, I think, is sort of the key advantage for people like me.
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:40.840]   But it's also, I mean, I think the big question that Mark didn't address.
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:42.360]   I mean, I mostly agree with what he says.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:46.600]   I'm mostly more bullish now on the media than I've ever been.
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:48.920]   And it's always been this kind of doom and gloom business.
[00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:50.920]   And I think for the first time it doesn't feel that way.
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:56.840]   But I do worry about the power of Facebook and the power of Twitter less than that.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:59.720]   Mostly the power of Facebook, because Facebook can sort of
[00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:03.400]   kill entire industries by itself.
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:06.360]   I mean, everybody that I know who works in web publishing,
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:09.880]   they get a huge percentage of their traffic from Facebook.
[00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:13.880]   And if that turns off, which Facebook has been known to do,
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:18.200]   various changes to its algorithm, that affects their business profoundly.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.640]   Just to ask up, Worthy.
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:21.560]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:26.920]   Although I can't say I'm crying over the loss of traffic to Worthy.
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:31.880]   In fact, you can blame Worthy because they carefully crafted what they were doing
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:36.440]   to precisely game Facebook, don't you think?
[00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:39.400]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:45.000]   I mean, they like a lot of people kind of just determined that they could
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:46.840]   think, you know, crack the code and they did.
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:49.560]   They cracked the code and then Facebook changed the code.
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:52.840]   Right. And I think that's the danger there for all these sites.
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:56.120]   Well, I think in the end, what really matters is creating great content.
[00:59:56.120 --> 01:00:02.280]   I mean, you can definitely try to engineer ways to get better search results on Google
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:05.560]   or get better search results on Facebook.
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:10.840]   But in the end, I think most of the upstart organizations that have not been part of the
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:15.960]   mainstream media that are doing well, what they do more than anything else is consistently
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:20.280]   create great content and find ways to interact with their readers, with their viewers, with their
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:22.280]   followers. I agree.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:26.600]   I mean, I think they create great content and also are doing the other thing that Mark
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.880]   focused a lot on is experimentation in the business model.
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:33.880]   So, you know, in the past, it was just basically one way to pay for media.
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:37.640]   And now there's a whole bunch of different ways beyond advertising.
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:41.400]   I think that's the thing that is really the most interesting in this post, I agree.
[01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:46.680]   He says advertising and of course, we're ad supported. So I agree with that. But he also
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:52.280]   points out subscriptions, a paid tier of premium content on top of free ad supported content,
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:55.240]   conferences and events. That's what TechCrunch does so well.
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:01:02.280]   Cross media. He says Tina Brown was right, but too early with talk news is a key source of
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:06.840]   material for books, TV and film, which also happen to be growth businesses. So in other words,
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:13.160]   you can take advantage of other businesses need for your content. Crowdfunding is huge right now.
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:20.280]   I look at Patreon just raised $21 million. This is a crowdfunding platform for podcasts
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:27.320]   and other similar audio content. Bitcoin from micro payments. And then he also points out
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:36.440]   philanthropy and that that's of course, pure, Omidyar throwing $250 million into his startup.
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:39.720]   Although I'm not sure that's philanthropy. That may be. I think he wants to make money from
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:45.640]   the media business. Yeah, and Jeff Bezos. There's definitely not charity to buy the Washington
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:53.320]   post on the other hand, ProPublica clearly is philanthropic in nature. Yeah, it's exciting. He
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:58.440]   points out a number of very successful. He says, people and companies are doing it right in non-tech,
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:03.080]   the Atlantic, BuzzFeed, I might disagree on that. The Guardian for sure. Yeah.
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:11.640]   Politico, search engine land, the Verge, Vice, Wirecutter, Wired, he mentions his own investments.
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:18.360]   And then he also mentions, and finally, The New York Times. It's great to see the times
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:22.680]   as evidently cracked the code on the transition from print to digital after extremely hard effort.
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:30.680]   So I think that very interesting blog post. And the issue is, in the chat rooms raised this,
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:37.400]   absolutely. It's not that the distribution doesn't exist or the means of funnings is,
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:43.560]   well, the issue is quality. And I agree with you, Farhad. The risk is that companies like Facebook
[01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:49.880]   become so powerful in determining what is news that they can undermine the quality equation.
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:52.840]   I think Google's safe because Google's kind of algorithmic.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:59.160]   When you say it's content, Google absolutely surfaces content. But we don't know what Facebook
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:03.800]   and Mark are. But again, what you see people do is they'll try to manipulate Google's
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:06.200]   algorithms. And over time, Google will figure it out.
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:10.840]   You cannot build a business around manipulating algorithms. You can build a business around
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:15.240]   a bench. I think we've found that that was a problem for bankers too.
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:22.360]   The difference between Google and Facebook is that Google is very transparent about,
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:27.800]   I mean, they have this whole arm that talks to webmasters about what works,
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:33.160]   what doesn't, what not to do, what you can do. And Facebook is very opaque. Like they just change
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:41.560]   the news feed algorithm. And they don't really talk to publishers as much about what not to do
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:47.080]   and what you should be doing. Look at Matt Cuts at Google who spends a lot of energy saying,
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:54.760]   here's what to do. I actually experimented in actually promoting a couple of my posts,
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:04:00.280]   paying the $7. And as far as I could tell, it had absolutely no impact on the number of people
[01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:03.240]   who liked it or commented on it. You're talking about Facebook's?
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:08.120]   Yeah, you know, they think anybody can pay seven bucks to have a post promoted. So I tried
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:11.560]   it a couple of times to see what would happen and it had zero impact. I mean, as far as I could
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:17.800]   tell. There was a great YouTube video. I wish he had written it because we could then talk about
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:22.840]   it. But you have to watch it. What is that? It's at Jadveritas? Yeah, Veritas someday.
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:29.960]   Veritas something like that. So he did a really interesting experiment where he bought Facebook
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:39.880]   likes, you know, spent that money. And then created he created a number of fake Facebook pages
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:48.760]   that nobody would ever really like. And then tried buying likes and so forth. But
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:57.400]   the key finding, I think, when you can buy likes from Facebook, you can buy likes from third parties.
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:02.600]   If you buy likes through third parties, you're going to illegal click farms. Basically, they hire
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:08.680]   people in mostly in poor nations to click likes, right? And you can buy a thousand,
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:14.040]   five thousand, they're very cheap. He then says he used Facebook's own algorithm. Here he is.
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:21.960]   Derek Mueller. He used Facebook's own algorithm. And what he found was that it's actually,
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:27.480]   there it is, virtual bagels limited, it's fake. He actually, and he 4,000 likes on something that
[01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:33.320]   doesn't even exist because he bought them. He then played around with not buying likes. And what
[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:42.440]   he found out is that the actual buying likes is actually a very bad idea. And it hurts everybody.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:47.160]   Because what happens is Facebook's algorithm, apparently it's news algorithm,
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:54.440]   surface is posts based on engagement. If you were going to put it in a capsule,
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:58.680]   it's engagement. And of course, these fake likes, and it's by the way,
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:05.240]   percent of engagement related to the number of likes. So these fake likes build up your likes,
[01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:12.600]   but generate zero engagement. So as a result, posts from those pages never surface.
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:18.920]   And here's the real risk. As a real page, these click farms in order to look like they aren't
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:24.360]   click farms have to go around randomly liking other pages. So he found that even when he didn't
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:31.320]   buy likes, he got a lot of likes from click farms. And that those phony spurious likes hurt his
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:39.160]   engagement, hurt his posts. So it's ruining the Facebook ecosystem that you could buy likes at
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:43.160]   all has ruined the ecosystem by creating this whole market of third party click farms.
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:46.680]   Not sure it's Facebook's fault, but it is definitely a problem.
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:54.360]   But I have noticed, I mean, I've never been able to quite predict what will surface. I mean,
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:58.760]   I'll post something and one day I'll get hundreds of likes and comments and I'll post something
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:04.520]   the next day and only get 10 or 20. And I have not quite figured out what it is that causes,
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:11.000]   I mean, Facebook needs a Mac cuts. It's what? Yeah, Facebook needs Mac cuts. Somebody who will
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:17.480]   step forward and say, here's how we're doing it. I mean, I think people, I know lots of people who
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:22.040]   don't understand this very basic thing about Facebook, which is that when you post something,
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:27.560]   not everyone who is your friend sees it, like people don't understand that it's basically
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:33.240]   that there's this algorithm that filters it. I don't think anybody except, you know, people
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:40.280]   watch these kinds of shows knows that. Yeah. Yeah. Your family doesn't. Your family, your mom assumes
[01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:46.520]   that if I posted it, Farhad saw it. Right. Not at all. Farhad sawed a lot of buzzworthy and
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:53.160]   upworthy, upworthy, buzzfeed and upworthy posts instead. Yeah. Apple is retiring snow leopard
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:59.800]   from support one in five max. Now vulnerable is Max Apple joining Microsoft and what a world
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:05.720]   we live in. And April 8th, Microsoft is abandoning Windows XP, guaranteeing it will be, you know,
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:11.240]   Windows XP users will become a hive, a hotbed of illegal activity. And now snow leopard,
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:14.680]   which is frankly not that old, four and a half years old is being abandoned.
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:21.640]   Right. I mean, I think this is the, like, they're not joining Microsoft. Microsoft let XP run for,
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:29.000]   what, 12, 12 years? 15 years. Yeah. I mean, I think this is the big difference between them,
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:34.360]   between Apple and Microsoft. Apple, Apple just doesn't after five years, you're done.
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:38.840]   I guess Apple's response would be, but yeah, but we give you the operating system for free,
[01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:43.400]   or practically, why wouldn't you upgrade except that a lot of older hardware can't?
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:47.240]   Older hardware, yeah. It's older hardware. And then some people, some people, you see some old
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:50.680]   version of Photoshop and, you know, there's lots of little bits and pieces that hang on,
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:54.440]   people hang on to because some piece of software wasn't upgraded to the next version that they use.
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:58.360]   The other difference is Microsoft tells you they give you a date. We know the date.
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:02.760]   Apple doesn't tell them. And also Apple, Apple has no qualms breaking apps. I mean,
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:07.160]   they'll break apps with an operating system upgrade all the time they've been doing it for years.
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:14.120]   I still can run VisiCalc on Windows 8.1. VisiCalc was written in 1981. 64 kilobytes.
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:19.320]   And I can still run it if I want to in a DOS box. I mean, that's what I'd want to use.
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:24.360]   I generally think Apple's approach is better in these cases. I mean, it's, it's, it's, the fact
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:29.640]   that they don't have to worry about backward compatibility as much has been pretty good for them. But
[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:33.800]   this is a security update, this latest thing. And it's, it's pretty bad to have one in five
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:38.840]   max, you know, software this. So they should have at least, they should have at least had a fix just
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:43.800]   for that part of it, perhaps not, you know, any other upgrades, but just that part of it seems,
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:47.480]   it seems like something wise to do. Was this the go to fail that they didn't patch?
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:52.600]   I think so. Yeah. Oh boy. Yeah. That was easy. That's a pretty bad one because that's the
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:56.360]   we've talked about that many times over the last couple of weeks. That's the flaw that
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:10:00.440]   means that Safari doesn't really pay any attention to certificates and just says,
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:04.520]   yeah, whatever you're, who you say you are, I'm sure I'm sure I could trust you.
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:08.760]   I have to admit that we keep most of our computers about one version behind on Apple,
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:13.400]   not two, but one like, well, most of our computers will be in 10 eight until Apple goes to the next
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:17.320]   version and we'll slowly move to 10 nine. Yeah. Yeah. Because there's still a lot of, you know,
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:21.000]   the only other thing in everybody time, and I suppose this is silly, but Snow Leopard was the
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.200]   last one to have Rosetta. So if you still have a power Mac,
[01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:28.120]   well, it also means that if you had, if you had the old version of Photoshop that you don't want
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:31.480]   to pay upgraded, you don't want to move to these other things. That was the last one that I think
[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:34.920]   you could run it on. Right. You know, and so there are some, I was literally talking to a guy that
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:41.800]   still is using an old version of Photoshop because Photoshop from 99% of the users, I would say,
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:48.520]   they haven't released an upgrade that was that the users needed other than operating system
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:54.120]   upgrades for at least a decade. Same with Microsoft Office. I actually am using, I think, a 2007 version.
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:58.920]   I actually downgraded because I liked it better than the 2013 version. I can't remember why.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:02.120]   I still like words. I can tell you why. One word, the ribbon.
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:07.240]   Well, no, yeah, they have to go back, I think, to 2003 to get rid of that dreaded ribbon. I hate
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:12.920]   the ribbon. And to this day, I still have to go to a help system to figure out things that I could
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:17.320]   do without, you know, any problems on the older version. I really thought it was all downhill after
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:21.240]   word 5.1 when they moved to five, when they were the six, I was like, actually the creator of the
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:25.160]   ribbon, Julie Larson Green, who was briefly running Windows eight after the departure of
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:32.760]   Steven Sonofsky has a new job at Microsoft. You'll be glad to know her new title sounds to me like
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:38.840]   it's completely made up. Chief experience officer of Microsoft's My Life and Work team.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:49.080]   Okay, so that's her punishment for inflicting us with the ribbon. We're going to talk about the
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:58.920]   massive one hundred one point one million player Pokemon game in just a little bit. But first,
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:03.560]   I know that's a tease. It's going to keep everybody stay tuned. First, let's hear from
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:08.840]   go to meeting our friends at Citrix make the simply the best online meeting software ever.
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:12.360]   We use it all the time. In fact, even if it's just a conference call, we always fire up go to
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:17.160]   meeting because maybe we want to share a screen. Maybe you want to turn on the camera, see the other
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:22.680]   person. It's so important to build a strong relationship, whether it's with your clients or your team.
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:28.760]   It's key. You need to meet and collaborate with co workers and clients on a regular basis to
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:34.120]   brainstorm to develop quality ideas and solutions just to work better. We love go to meeting with
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:40.840]   HD faces from Citrix. It just works. It's so easy to sign up on your computer or your mobile device.
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:44.600]   You'll be launching your first meeting in seconds. You could share the screen so you'll
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:48.760]   collaborate. You'll all be on the same page literally. Turn on the webcam. You'll see each
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:54.360]   other face to face. It's as good as a meeting in person better in some ways. And you can even

[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:19.000]   almost all day. A lot of groups that are not in the same room. You just keep it running because
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.560]   you don't have to pay for the six different accounts. We might have for when we're doing an event,
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:29.400]   we do these hangouts in the world. We'll have two or three different loops of different people
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:33.640]   in different sets of meetings. We'll have 20 or 30 people across all these loops to keep the event
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:40.760]   going. It would be really fun to see the behind the scenes of how you do all that stuff.
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:45.160]   I'm showing it. I'm going to be showing it at NAB. You're allowed to go public. I'm allowed to
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:51.640]   talk about it at NAB. I'm going to do a hangout talk on Sunday at NAB. It's going to be the first
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:56.040]   time I'm allowed to really show up all the details and talk about what we did.
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:01.960]   You talked about the hangouts you've been doing in Stu. We do a lot of high profile hangouts.
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:08.600]   Yeah. You know what we're talking about? If there's a high profile hangout, Alex Lindsey is in the room.
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:12.520]   Well, I don't know if it's all of them, but we do an awful lot of them. Is that Peter Jackson
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:16.760]   that time that you were talking about? Yeah, we did one of the included Peter Jackson.
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:22.280]   The thing is that hangouts obviously are extremely easy. You open up the computer.
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:29.000]   You have, you know, hands on a hangout right now. So what's great about hangouts is that it is so
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.600]   easy and that you can do it from everything. But obviously when you start turning into an event,
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:37.400]   you start at, you know, you might want to have a little bit more hardware. If for instance you had
[01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:42.520]   the leader of the free world on the hangout, you might want to have more of the webcam.
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:46.440]   Anybody who has nukes and the codes, you wouldn't really want to screw it up.
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:49.960]   Right. So I mean, I can't wait. So this is at NAB. You're going to do that?
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:54.840]   Yeah. Yeah. So we're going to talk about really approaching how to approach hangouts both from a,
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:59.560]   you know, and this is really for media folks. So again, the great thing about hangouts is they're
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:03.880]   easy. You can do them at home. What we're going to be talking about is if you're a media, you know,
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:09.480]   organization and you want to take full advantage of hangouts from and you feel like you've been
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:13.080]   limited in one way or the other and you're trying to figure out just how to, you know,
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:16.760]   make them all work as best as best possible. We'll talk a little bit about why to do hangouts,
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:23.080]   a little bit about the structure. And we've done about over 700 hangouts in the last two years.
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:27.400]   Wow. So and a lot of, and some of them can be as simple as we log in and make sure that everyone
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:34.680]   just just gets in there and has a good hangout to, you know, all kinds of, you know, crazy things.
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:40.280]   So, so we'll be talking about a lot at NAB. Can't wait. Will you stream that?
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:44.200]   No. Will you record it? No. But maybe I'll talk about it here. You better go to NAB.
[01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:49.800]   Yeah. Hey, if you missed any of our shows this week, you know, I think it was a pretty good week
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:54.280]   for a Twitter. Maybe we should just run a little bit of a minute long recap of what you might have
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:59.800]   missed this week on Twitter. Previously on Twitter. The bus goes right like that. Yeah.
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:05.960]   Tech news today. Is it dangerous to wear Google Class-wide driving? I know you've done it.
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:10.040]   Somebody said it best. You can't legislate common sense. Like don't go down the rabbit hole of glass
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:14.040]   and looking for more and more information from all your driving. All about Android.
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:19.960]   It has come down from the heavens and it looks a lot like the S4. Do you know what do you think of the
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:26.600]   S5? What's your take on it? Yeah. It's great. This week in Google, Google has determined that your
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:33.320]   GPA is worthless. Wow. The proportion of people without any college education at Google has increased.
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:37.240]   I'm telling you, I'm the best of all worlds. I went to Yale and I dropped out.
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:42.040]   Sorry. Go go. Just add water.
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:47.080]   Move the camera closer to the window. We were having so much fun the other day.
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:50.760]   This is. Again, again, again.
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:57.800]   You build a million dollar studio and that's what you get to do.
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:08.040]   That's a good moment. Do we have a what's coming up this week? Okay. Mike Elgin in the TNT studios.
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:12.680]   What's ahead? The big newsmaker this week is South by Southwest Interactive,
[01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:17.800]   which starts Friday, March 7th in Austin, Texas. Back to you, Leo. That was short.
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:25.800]   Is Mike, did Mike leave for South by right after he recorded that? And are you going to South by Farhead?
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:31.640]   Uh, no, I'm not. Are you going Larry? No, not going. Yeah. I'm going to Washington D.
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:36.680]   P. Yeah. Are you going, Alex? First time in a long time. I'm not. I'm actually scheduled to be in
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:42.760]   Rwanda right now. So is it over for South by Southwest? Aubrey Sabala,
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:45.320]   Aubs. We love Aubs. She was a producer of the
[01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:54.280]   Dignation events, amazing events at South by said, uh, it's it's you're going to South by sucker.
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:18:03.160]   Oh, wow. I, yeah, it's funny. I went last year and I, um, I thought it was really good. I liked it.
[01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:08.600]   I, I, it, it seemed, um, you know, there are a lot of last year was sort of, uh, you know,
[01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:12.600]   it was kind of the rise of Uber and other transportation things. And there were lots of new
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:19.560]   transportation systems and felt like a little bit like this, the future of a city, um, you know,
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:25.480]   how it would work when we were able to sort of hail everything. Um, I thought that was really cool
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:29.800]   to get like a lot of tech people in one place and like figure out those kinds of options.
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:35.640]   I think they're ebbs and flows. I mean, even CES or good years or bad years or periods. So,
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:39.400]   I don't know. I don't know if you can judge it from just one, one or two years. Give it time.
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:45.400]   Drew Olenoff who's been on a, uh, on a tweet many times, uh, tweeted as soon as bad marketers and PR
[01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:50.440]   people saw South by Southwest as a shortcut to growing an app. It all went downhill. It's true
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:54.680]   now that everybody goes, a lot of people go to South by Southwest hoping that the magic will
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:58.680]   happen. The magic that happened for four square and Twitter and other burning man.
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:04.360]   Yeah. I mean, I think that's a great part. I think saying that South by Southwest is, is, uh, is gone.
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:07.480]   It's kind of like saying no one goes to that restaurant anymore because it's too busy, right?
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:13.080]   It's too popular. You know, it's, it's, I think that, uh, it's, it's pretty popular. It's going to
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:17.080]   be popular. I mean, obviously it's got to find its way because now it's a much bigger operation.
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:23.080]   I mean, anytime anybody who's been there during the, the insanity, um, knows that it's, uh,
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:29.080]   is definitely grown up a lot since the early 90s, I think, when I conferences for saw it have a
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:33.640]   role, but they just have to redefine themselves and CES is still big. NAB is still big. But it feels
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:38.760]   like what really, maybe this is just us, but what it doesn't seem like news happens at conferences.
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:44.040]   You'd be crazy if you're a company that can have a press conference on your own to, to tie it to
[01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:47.960]   a conference. I was surprised to be the Samsung did it or no. You know, it's interesting because I,
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:52.520]   so I watched the Samsung press conference here in Palo Alto instead of going to Barcelona.
[01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:56.680]   And when they announced Galaxy gear, I happened to be in, in, in, in Berlin. I watched it in the,
[01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:01.640]   in the auditorium. It was a much better experience watching it at home. First of all, I record it.
[01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:05.880]   Yeah. Second of all, I could go on the radio immediately in my broadcast studio and report on
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:11.640]   it. I could blog about it. I was much more efficient. I probably scooped people in the room. I wasn't
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:15.560]   able to get the preview like they got the day before, but I probably scooped people in the room
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:19.960]   because I wasn't a much better position to report on it watching, watching it remotely than I would
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:25.160]   have if I were actually in the room. Nevertheless, the social element is huge. Yeah. It's just a
[01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:30.360]   luxury for a lot of us. I mean, I think that the one of the things that we love to go, I just can't,
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:34.760]   I just, I can't justify it. One of the things that we see bubbling up is because what we do
[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:38.520]   beyond Hangouts is just interactive events. You know, so if you have to tie a bunch of different
[01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:41.960]   locations together. And so one of the things that we're seeing a lot of people asking us about
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:46.920]   is trying to figure out how to have a conference that has a center, has a, has a heart, but then
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:51.640]   has, has small conferences that are occurring all at the same time, all over the world. You know,
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:55.560]   where, yeah, and so we're starting to see more people trying to, you know, we've been trying to
[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:59.560]   figure that out, you know, and we've got, you know, a lot of infrastructure that we built up around
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:04.280]   that, but it's, but it's one of those things. It's very hard to do well, but, but you want to have
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:07.400]   that social area. You want to have a South by Southwest, but what you kind of want to do is
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:10.920]   have a South by Southwest happening in Austin have a small version happening in New York and
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:15.160]   another smaller version happening in LA and being able to figure out ways people can kind of
[01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:19.240]   experience all of that where you have the real space interactivity with people that you might
[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:21.400]   actually see tomorrow. You know who's already solved that?
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:28.440]   Twitch TV. Anybody has anybody played Pokemon? Anybody played Pokemon Red?
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:34.680]   Chad, what game? What game is this? Is this an Nintendo DS? No, this is original Black and
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:40.440]   White Game Boy. Game Boy. Yep. So this is the Nintendo that I owned. Some of the Pokemon that
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:47.640]   really, a hacker. A hacker. Well, this is a hack. No, it's a, it's a port. It's a, it's a, it's a
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:56.520]   figure to create an A-R-C channel where, no, okay, he's using Twitch's embedded IRC. Okay.
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:22:02.920]   It's just the normal, and he's somehow tied this IRC channel to a game.
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:06.920]   Game of Pokemon Red being played on a computer, obviously not on a game. Right.
[01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:13.560]   And initially the way they did it was pure anarchy. Everybody in the chat room, and there were a
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:19.080]   lot of people. And that's what's going on now. Could tell what, tell Pokemon how to play.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:24.680]   Yeah. So basically anytime that, that the emulator could receive a key command, it would look to
[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:30.200]   see what the next one, A-A-A, up, up, up, down, down, down, left, left, left. What the next one in
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:36.440]   the chat would be. And so you can see them just scrolling past there, right? And it could be
[01:22:36.440 --> 01:22:41.640]   start, select. So you could type this into IRC. A, B, start, select, up, down, left, right.
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:49.240]   Any of those. And so let's tell you 1.1 million people played this game.
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:55.160]   And look at the names, Ababa, Tabavas, Devoop, is great. All over the world.
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:23:00.840]   And a huge community exploded around this. There's specific, how long does this go on? Three weeks?
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:07.160]   15 days. 15 days. Where did you know about this? Oh, absolutely. I was there at the end.
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:14.920]   I was, I was cheering on the Lord. Like after 15 days, Jesus bird, twitch, beat, Pokemon red.
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:22.680]   They random assortment of ups and downs, Abs, selects and starts actually beat the game of
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:29.240]   Pokemon. Yeah. It was pretty, it was pretty awesome. Is that kind of related to like a million
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:34.920]   monkeys typing? I think. Well, they wrote Hamlet. So they modified the anarchy mode because it
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:38.040]   eventually became impossible. People were, it was just all over the place.
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:43.240]   They created democracy mode where somehow the game would look at a majority. So if you look up
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:48.040]   here, you can see people writing in democracy and anarchy. And up at the very top, right now they're
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:53.160]   in anarchy mode. See how anarchy is bold. Yeah. That little line with the arrow needs to make
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:57.880]   its way all the way over to the other dotted line called democracy. And so you don't have to vote
[01:23:57.880 --> 01:24:03.000]   unless everybody votes for it. Unless if you're stuck and everyone's just getting super frustrated,
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.760]   you can all vote for democracy. We should run the country like sure. Sure.
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:12.040]   Sure. Everything's anarchy until everyone gets frustrated enough that they vote for democracy.
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:16.920]   Yeah. Actually, you actually would work. You are seeing the future of the United States government
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:23.240]   in this game. Right. It'd be like, let's have anarchy. There now people robbing my house.
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:29.720]   Let's have democracy, please. Yes. So how did it work when it was democracy? What is democracy?
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:34.680]   It would take a vote for 20 seconds and then whatever won during that 20 second vote,
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:39.480]   that would be the key press that has. So let's go to the end here because I presume that the only
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:45.480]   way this ended was when democracy took over. No, anarchy. Anarchy won? Yeah. The whole time.
[01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:51.160]   The thing is you need a huge majority of votes for democracy and lots of people love anarchy.
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:55.800]   And you'll have people that while you're walking around in the cave, they'll hit, they'll say start
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:25:00.680]   so that you get into the start menu and then basically everyone's presses are ridiculous and
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:03.800]   and they're not going to do anything to the game. This is the same as the Pokemon card game.
[01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:09.160]   This is Jesus bird that's out right now, by the way. They had nicknames for all of the animals.
[01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:14.280]   Oh, so these are not poster. These animals, the Pokemon have become memes.
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:18.760]   I mean, and everyone's now, I wish they had actually captured the chat room because the
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:24.520]   chat room was just exploding. I mean, there'd be silly things where people would hit start and
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:29.000]   then save the game and everyone just cheer like got to save the game. Everyone's excited that
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:34.120]   we saved the game. It's over. We won. Yeah. And everyone really, really, really freaked out.
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:43.000]   1.165 million uniques. This is not as uniques. 122 million commands.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:48.840]   But that the number of people watching dwarfs that nine million people watched.
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:58.360]   9 million people watched. Twitch.tv/ Did you get to play Chad? I mean, you know, it's funny.
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:02.600]   I don't think I ever entered a command. I would enter in like, oh my God, you know, this is going
[01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:08.360]   crazy. I don't know if I ever entered in a single command. I'm I hope I did. Peak number of
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:16.760]   simultaneous viewers, 121,000 people watch Twitch play Pokemon for over 1 billion minutes.
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:21.960]   Twitch had to make changes to its server configuration just to handle the views.
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:26.360]   I mean, of course, as a company that has live streaming, I was like, so what CDN did they use
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:30.360]   for that? So what were they? We don't know what they what they used to stream to.
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:34.440]   Well, you know, Twitch is Justin.tv. I think they've learned a lot about scaling. We're on
[01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:37.320]   Justin to that TV. Yeah. They've learned a lot of that scaling. Justin.
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:45.640]   They know what they're doing. Yeah. Wow. I didn't realize I didn't realize anarchy mode one.
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:51.080]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was really it's I never actually saw it get into democracy democracy mode.
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:56.280]   I think what happened from and this is this is unfortunately roundabout news. I heard this
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:01.080]   through a friend through a friend that they were in a position that they were stuck. Yeah.
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:07.160]   And they that's when they enabled democracy mode. But before that they didn't need to.
[01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:10.840]   I think it's better fanarchy wins. Yeah. Yeah. By the way, you will soon.
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:16.120]   So in anarchy, it was it just in anarchy, like were there a bunch of commands,
[01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:19.880]   I guess, that were just wasted, right? Oh, yeah. Most of them. Oh, yeah.
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:23.480]   I see. It wasn't chronological. You have to hit it at the right time. Yeah.
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:27.400]   Right when the emulator was looking for a command, it had to have come at the exact moment.
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.880]   But even when you're watching anarchy, you can see there's generally consensus.
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:34.280]   People are trying to win. Well, in that moment, they were there was there were
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:39.800]   nights that they were stuck in a cave for 24 hours. I mean, there there was there was moments that
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:44.680]   there were trolls. You know, can you can we do this? Can I mean, is that online or do you have to?
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:51.400]   Um, so guys do it. Did it? Yeah. So they're going to release a new something actually today.
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:57.160]   So we should actually check that out. I haven't even seen. Boy, if I were a twitch is not public,
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:28:01.400]   but if it were, I would buy stock in that company. They have they have nailed it. We've
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:05.800]   been trying to figure out how to do gaming my whole life, how to do gaming television and never
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:13.400]   figure it out. And they nailed it. They nailed it. By the way, according to ABC, Xbox one is going
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:21.640]   to get twitch viewing soon. So that's exciting. You previously, you could spectate on twitch streams
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:28.280]   and record game clips. But the founder of twitch, Emmett Sheer says full integration on the Xbox one.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:36.040]   So it looks like they have now upgraded games. And there is a new version of Pokemon
[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:43.480]   being played at the moment. I have to get through this to show you. But, um, and so you can kind of
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:49.560]   now understand what's what's going on here. This is at is basically finished. Um, and so people
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:54.200]   in the chat are saying what they want to do. So now we've upgraded Pokemon. We're on 13 hours,
[01:28:54.200 --> 01:29:00.040]   seven minutes early on. Yeah, this is early on the game. And so over here, people are saying like,
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:06.280]   who won? And there's a straw poll left, right? Right. And so and there's enough people talking
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:13.160]   that you kind of get a sense of community. Did you watch this for Chad? Uh, total? I mean,
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:17.160]   probably an hour or two. I mean, over the over the whole time that it would, you know, you'd
[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:21.400]   tune in and you'd watch 20 minutes of it and kind of figure out where they were. And it just makes
[01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:26.840]   me feel older and fish. But you know, what I think this gets back into what we were just talking
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:30.760]   about is that is that I think people do want to do things that are global that are connected,
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:35.400]   you know, and I think that if it's just playing Pokemon and when we talk about the, the, you know,
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:40.680]   the future of media, I think finding ways, um, as simple as the IRC chat that we have here,
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:45.480]   that is the key, I think is figuring out ways to incorporate the viewership. So it's not something
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:50.840]   that is just there's something going on. Yeah. I don't know what it is. But there's something
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:55.000]   going on. Uh, we're going to take a quick break. I know the Oscars are coming up. So we're going
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:59.240]   to wrap this thing up a little bit in just a little bit, a couple of quick stories and then we'll move
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:04.680]   on. Um, our show today brought to you by our friends at Squarespace. Square. I'm proud of you

[01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:16.840]   works squarespace.com is making the web a better place. Always know when we go to take someone
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:21.560]   down. We talked about someone on the web. We never take a site down. We cannot take a squarespace

[01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:32.920]   You know, always thought of you amazing. You know, you could hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:38.040]   We're getting there. Yes. This is not the SD card. This is a micro SD. That little tiny thing you
[01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:42.840]   could swallow. It's not much bigger than a hit of acid. And it's 128 gigs.
[01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:46.680]   You know what's amazing is if you have an Android, a lot of Android phones will take that, which
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:54.120]   means you can now have a 128 gigs plus 16 smartphone. The set, the announcement is more
[01:32:54.120 --> 01:33:00.120]   word Congress. The sad thing is that even Android phones really don't do a great job with external
[01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:05.000]   memory like this. You can store some data on there. Maybe you can put an app on there. It's just,
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:09.320]   I wish it were better. It's great if you have a GoPro. It's great for GoPros. It's a lot of
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:14.120]   videos. It's all I got to say. Great for GoPros. California Court has ruled it's okay to look at
[01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:20.360]   the map on your cell phone. Thank goodness. Just try to try to watch the road to folks.
[01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:26.440]   Fifth district court of appeals reversed the case to a Fresno man. He got a ticket in 2012 for
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:31.960]   looking at a map while stuck in traffic. He wasn't moving. He looked at his map on his iPhone 4.
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:40.920]   They gave him a $165 ticket. He appealed it. Here it is three years later or two years later.
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:50.040]   And $10,000 later. Yeah, imagine. He said it's interesting because his son broke, was hit by a
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:54.680]   driver, was chatting on a cell phone. So he's very much hands-free guy. He understands the danger
[01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:59.480]   is here. But, and he says, if you drive erratically, you should be arrested. But, you should be able
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:03.800]   to look at maps while you're stopped. So I'm not sure. This is the,
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:07.640]   go ahead. Isn't this kind of, it's going to be difficult, right, for the cops to tell?
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:13.320]   Right. Because you might be looking at your, you might be texting and then you can claim
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:21.640]   you're looking at your map. The CHP agrees with you for HUD. Yeah. Right. But the court said, look,
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:31.400]   good news. Freaks can get his $165 fine back. Is there a law looking at the built-in GPS,
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:38.360]   in your car, if you happen to have a GPS? No. Exactly. And, in fact, I have a, my Prius had the
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:44.040]   built-in GPS, which I never use because it is much more difficult to use than either an Android or
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:51.480]   an iOS phone GPS. So I would argue that you're safer using a smartphone with a good UI, and
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:57.000]   especially if you got Siri or Google Voice, Google Now, then you are with a lot of built-in ones
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:01.080]   that are supposedly designed by automotive engineers. Right. But, incompetent ones that
[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:04.120]   actually make them more dangerous to you. I don't even understand how to use my, my car
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:09.080]   UIs are awful. We, we, we, we, we want an RC RV and my wife, my wife is like, she really knows how to
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:12.040]   use it. But I get it on, I'm just like, take out my Google Maps. I don't want to touch it. You
[01:35:12.040 --> 01:35:16.360]   know, when you buy a car today, the technology in that car is probably five years old and the maps
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:23.160]   are ancient, you know, by the kind of rules. Great article in The Guardian. I'm not going to have
[01:35:23.160 --> 01:35:28.440]   time to go through it. But meet the seven people who hold the key to worldwide internet security.
[01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:37.960]   They say the reality is closer to the office than the Matrix. In El Segundo, California, about a
[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:48.200]   mile from LAX International Airport. The key holders, not Gozer, but the key holders meet four times a
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:53.000]   year, twice in the East Coast, twice on the West Coast. Yeah, Harold Ramis. So, you got, we all have
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:57.960]   to watch Ghostbusters one more time. My daughter thought it was amazing. How old is she? She's four.
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:02.200]   And she loves to go to. I guess it was one that when the, when the, when the ghost came out of the
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:07.320]   trash can, that's all she can talk about now. The ghost came out of the trash can. They control the
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:14.840]   DNS system, obviously. And the master key is a part of a new global look at these. They're actually,
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:20.840]   it's a traditional metal key to a safety deposit box, which contains a smart card,
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:24.760]   which activates a machine that creates a new master key. This is, this is ridiculous.
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:32.920]   But the idea is that each time they meet, they verify that the DNS is authentic. It's not been
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:42.520]   hacked. This prevents, I guess, hacking. 14 key holders. Then there's backup key holders.
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:45.960]   This is all part of ICANN. How do you become one of those key holders?
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:51.080]   Who are these guys? Yeah. I think that they're all part of the Illuminati, myself.
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:56.280]   I want to be a key holder, says Larry Maggiv. Why can't I do it? Exactly.
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:05.240]   The key holders, I guess, are security experts. All have long backgrounds in internet security
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:11.400]   and work for various international institutions chosen for geographical spread, as well as,
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:16.200]   I have spread, but that's not geographic, as well as their experience. No one country is allowed
[01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:21.240]   to have too many key holders. And they go to the ceremony at their own or their employer's expense.
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:26.360]   I think there's a whole like DaVinci code thing that this is awesome. I don't know what it is,
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:32.680]   but it's awesome. We think of the internet as being so decentralized and like,
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:38.920]   there's no hierarchy, but these are the guys. This is the hierarchy of the internet, DNS.
[01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:43.560]   Great article, and you can watch the video of them getting together and exchanging the keys.
[01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:49.880]   Are they part of the trilateral security precautions reminiscent of a bond film?
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:53.960]   They say it's a tightly scripted series of more than 100 actions
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:38:00.840]   all recorded to the minute using GMT for consistency. It's key cards, safe combinations,
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:07.240]   secure cages. You got to watch this. It's got to be a movie. This is total Tom Cruise.
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:08.040]   You think Jyn could have written the thing.
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:15.480]   Yeah. All but one of the 21 key holders has been with IKAN since the very first ceremony,
[01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:20.120]   the one who's gone, Vince Serf, the father of the internet. He's retired,
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:24.360]   but he was one of the key holders for a long time.
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:28.920]   That's just crazy stuff. Great article.
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:35.560]   Did you see the article about, I guess in GQ about Uber?
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:40.520]   The guy who actually, I guess, was talking about Uber.
[01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:41.560]   You heard that.
[01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:42.520]   I thought that was amazing.
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:43.000]   What?
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.960]   Well, he was one of the writer for GQ.
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:47.480]   Oh, he said it was sexy.
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:54.520]   Well, he went out for a week, but the thing that I had never occurred to me was he said,
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:39:00.920]   there's a heat map that they see, that the driver see of where the heavy Uber users
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:06.680]   are so that they can make sure that they're close, like that level of control.
[01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:11.320]   So they don't know exactly where you are, but they know that there's a lot of heavy users in,
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:12.680]   so stick around.
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:13.160]   Right.
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:13.640]   Right.
[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:16.120]   Well, it's the fact you're there.
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:18.600]   I mean, they start looking at that.
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:22.520]   The heat map is activated right when you open the app, right?
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:22.520]   Right.
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:24.520]   Even before you, you know,
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:25.240]   Well, that's interesting.
[01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:27.240]   So you have a request to anything, but they just know you're looking.
[01:39:27.240 --> 01:39:29.400]   And they know that you're a rat.
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:31.480]   They know that those people are in that area.
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:35.960]   And so like, because I was in Santa Monica, I couldn't figure out like earlier last week or
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:40.360]   whatever, and I could not figure out how there were so many Ubers right where I was.
[01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:43.960]   And, you know, because it was like, this doesn't seem like a kind of place.
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:46.520]   It's a lot of people picking up cars and Uber cab confessions.
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:48.520]   Mickey rap, and it's in the March GQ.
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:50.520]   It's sexy.
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:54.520]   That is dedication.
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:57.720]   Farhad Manju, it is so good to have you.
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:39:58.680]   You've got to come back.
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:02.280]   He is, of course, at the New York Times, but he's always been one of the great
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:06.360]   analysts, writers, a tech writer who actually understands tech.
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:08.360]   What a concept.
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:09.400]   Nice to have you Farhad.
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:10.760]   It was fun.
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:11.640]   This is good to be here.
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:12.680]   Come back soon.
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:14.040]   Next time you're in town, come up here.
[01:40:14.040 --> 01:40:16.120]   Bye, Scott.
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:18.760]   Larry Maggot, same to you, buddy.
[01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:20.040]   You come here anytime you want.
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:22.280]   Larry Maggot is at the CBS News.
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:24.520]   And of course, Larrysworld.com.
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:25.320]   You can read his writings.
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:28.360]   You were telling us something going on for you at Larry's World.
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:28.840]   What is that?
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:31.960]   Well, it's been a bit on Connect safely.
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:34.840]   We did the Safer Internet Day last couple of weeks ago in Washington,
[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:35.960]   DC went really well.
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:41.240]   And doing a lot of work around trying to get kids to be digitally literate.
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:43.640]   Did you go to Congress and you tell them that?
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:47.080]   We actually had Senator Chuck Schumer speak at our event.
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:48.120]   He's good, actually.
[01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:48.600]   Yeah, he's good.
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:51.880]   And I'm headed to Washington next week, and I will be talking to some folks in Congress.
[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:52.280]   Good.
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:56.520]   If you want to see more about Safer Internet Day, connect safely.org.
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:00.600]   This is a great site for lots of information, including,
[01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:03.880]   don't forget safety tips and advice for parents who are,
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:07.080]   you know, want to keep their kids a little bit safer.
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:08.920]   Some great parents' guides on there.
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:11.880]   Formation for everybody wants to keep safe online.
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:12.440]   Thank you, Larry.
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:13.480]   Great to have you.
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:13.880]   Thank you.
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:15.240]   Alex Lindsey jumped in here.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:18.760]   We were going to have Christina Warren, but her connection was failing.
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:19.560]   My connection was OK.
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:19.960]   Thank you.
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:19.960]   Thank you.
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:20.600]   Cable vision.
[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:21.400]   We'll chop you in.
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:23.720]   So your connection was perfect.
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:24.360]   Great to have you.
[01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:25.240]   Anything you want to plug?
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:30.760]   You can find me on just Alex Lindsey on Twitter and on G+.
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:32.520]   Thank you for saving my Mac Pro.
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:35.560]   We gave him my Mac Pro so he could benchmark it,
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:37.960]   because he was curious as to how fast did you ever get any benchmarks?
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:39.480]   No, because we had to go back to you.
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:45.160]   So now we installed stuff on it, but we haven't really pushed it yet.
[01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:46.600]   We need more RAM there.
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:48.920]   So 12 gigs, not enough.
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:50.360]   Why don't you get it up there?
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:50.760]   It'll be.
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:52.600]   So I had 16 gigs and they figured it out.
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:54.040]   It was really, you said it was haunted,
[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:56.040]   and I was having all sorts of problems.
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:59.560]   Turned out one of the RAM sticks had been scratched during installation.
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:00.520]   It's Keith Egel.
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:03.080]   Keith is our guy who was digging through that.
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:05.560]   He found it, pulled it out, and yeah, you can see the scratch.
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:06.520]   I sent a picture to Apple.
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:07.160]   They said, "Oh yeah."
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:11.640]   And as soon as we get some more Mac Pros and stocks sometime next year,
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:13.160]   you're going to get a new RAM module.
[01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:14.120]   So I just said, "Nah."
[01:42:14.120 --> 01:42:17.000]   I'll just buy it at other world computing.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:17.480]   They have?
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:19.720]   Once you get it, we'll throw it back into the test.
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:20.280]   16 F.
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:20.840]   Do some under it yet.
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:21.240]   What should I get?
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:21.480]   I'm going to get one more.
[01:42:21.480 --> 01:42:21.960]   16's good.
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:22.520]   16's good.
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:24.440]   All right, well, as soon as I put it in, I'll bring it over.
[01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:24.680]   Yep.
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:27.320]   Damn it.
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:28.680]   So close.
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:30.120]   So close.
[01:42:30.120 --> 01:42:30.920]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:35.000]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.800]   That's 3 plus 12 is 15.
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:42.120]   Test 8 is 2300 UTC right before the end of the day.
[01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:44.360]   Stop by and say hi during the live show.
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:45.400]   We love seeing you in the chat room.
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:48.760]   But if you can't, of course, on-demand audio and video, always available
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:51.560]   after the fact that twit.tv, that's true of all of our shows,

[01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:57.080]   Thanks for being here.
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:57.880]   I really appreciate it.
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:42:58.840]   We'll see you next time.
[01:42:58.840 --> 01:42:59.640]   Another Twit.
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:00.680]   It's amazing.
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:10.680]   [MUSIC]
[01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:12.680]   baby
