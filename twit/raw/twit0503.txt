[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.600]   has given us an all-female panel for this week's "Twit."
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.520]   I'm thrilled to welcome back Jill Duffy from PC Magazine.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.640]   Hi, Jill.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.200]   Hi, Leo.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.520]   Great to see you.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.720]   Yeah, great to see you, too.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.640]   You're in this New York City?
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.480]   No, I just moved to Washington, DC.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.520]   Oh!
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.320]   Yeah, so nice.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.520]   So, basically, I'm looking at the Potomac out my window right now.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.600]   Oh, I'm so jealous.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.440]   Don't swim in it.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.280]   I don't think they've cleaned it up yet, but--
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.760]   No.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.880]   Good to look at it.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.000]   Christina Warren was just in Washington, DC
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.360]   for a very important event.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.360]   Christina Warren's here from Mashables and your Tech Analysts.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.280]   Great to see you again, Christina.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.520]   Great to be here, as always.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.840]   And Katie Benner is here.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.160]   You've seen her on TNT.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.960]   She's on, I think, with Mike Elgin when he filled in for me.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.960]   She's a columnist at the Bloomberg View.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.760]   Nice to be here.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.260]   Thanks.
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.760]   Nice to see you, Katie.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.040]   I can't do what I do to Mark Milliam with Bloomberg
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.640]   week in Bloomberg View.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.880]   It doesn't lend itself to that, unfortunately.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.160]   No, you'll find a way to make fun of us.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.040]   Oh, y'all guarantee you that.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.720]   So I think appropriate to begin with the Ellen Powell decision,
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.280]   Ellen Powell, Sood Kleiner Perkins, one
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.600]   of the big venture capitalists--
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.280]   probably one of the biggest, best known venture capitalists
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.240]   in Silicon Valley, claiming discrimination, a jury trial,
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.240]   which she just lost.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.480]   But I really thought that Farhad-- we hadn't really covered it
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.400]   that much, frankly.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.480]   I thought Farhad Manju in The New York Times kind of nailed it.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.080]   He wrote, "Not only weeks of testimony
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.840]   revealed a collection of borish, unsavory, and at times,
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.560]   unwittingly misogynistic attitudes,
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.880]   but one of the tech industry's most
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.520]   storied financial institutions, the case
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.840]   has also come to stand for something bigger than itself.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.120]   It has blown open a conversation about the status of women
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.120]   in an industry that, for all its talk of transparency
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.600]   and progress, has always been buttoned up
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.680]   about its shortcomings."
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.680]   He says, thanks to Mrs. Mizz-Pau, not
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.840]   withstanding the jury's verdict.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.480]   The secrets are suddenly out in the open.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.000]   So not a victory for Ellen Powell, who, by the way,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.440]   is interim CEO of Reddit right now.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.400]   But I think even she felt like there was somewhat
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.360]   of a moral victory.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.800]   Do you agree, Katie?
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.000]   Yeah, I think that one of the things that's
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.840]   interesting about this trial is that a lot of other incidents
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.320]   have happened in tech, where women have felt
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.480]   like they've been harassed or they've been discriminated
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.320]   against, but most of them have settled,
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.120]   including a really horrible harassment
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.600]   case against a different venture firm called CMEA that
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.960]   happened about a year and a half ago.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.840]   And that was settled.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.960]   So because she decided to take this to trial,
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.560]   it really, really forced people to look at something
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.720]   that they've been able to avoid for years and years.
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.280]   So I do think that there was a moral victory here,
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.080]   or at least a sort of awakening about how we should be
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.800]   treating one another in technology.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.440]   Frida Cape Orklein, who is at the Cape Ork Center
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.680]   for Social Impact, said, "This trial
[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.680]   would become a landmark case for women in the workplace
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.360]   as important as Anita Hill's accusations, which
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.160]   also were fruitless against Clarence Thomas and his hearings
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.080]   to join the Supreme Court."
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.600]   I feel like--
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.560]   You know, one of the things I think is funny about this
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.760]   is when you get into the specifics of what she was actually
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.440]   saying happened, it was stuff like they literally
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.120]   didn't let her sit at the table.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.120]   I mean, that's just so ridiculous.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.520]   They made her sit in the back of the room instead
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.680]   of sitting at the board table with everybody.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.160]   She was excluded from an event where everybody was going
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.320]   on a ski trip, and they just said, like, no,
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.120]   we can't have any women.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.880]   I think their excuse was like, some of the men
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.040]   are bunking together, so we wouldn't have a female roommate
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.400]   for you, and therefore you can't come.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.280]   And then she had criticisms of her work
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.880]   and her performance that were really, really vague.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.720]   So it's such baloney stuff that's so clear and so obvious.
[00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.240]   And I'm glad that it's getting some attention in the media,
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.080]   and we should be paying attention to this.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.240]   I'm sad that nothing came out of it from the legal side,
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.120]   but it's just really ridiculous stuff.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.520]   - I feel like she was very brave,
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.040]   because these are hard cases to prove.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.560]   I mean, one of the reasons there's such endemic
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.320]   discrimination in the workplace for women,
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.160]   women don't make it the same amount as men,
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.560]   and for the same job, is 'cause it's so hard to prove.
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.880]   - Right, and I think that part of the reason
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.840]   it's hard to prove is because people don't speak up,
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.200]   and they don't talk about things as they're happening.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.280]   And if anything comes from this case,
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.640]   I think, you know, to Katie's point, and to Jill's point,
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.800]   too, you know, the fact that we're actually
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.680]   having this conversation is a good thing,
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.840]   regardless of the outcome.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.840]   And, you know, if she'd had more proof or had gone,
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.840]   maybe to people, you know, filed complaints earlier,
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.440]   I'm not saying that it would have made a difference,
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.240]   but I think that the more people speak up,
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.800]   and the more people talk about things,
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.080]   whether it's through lawsuits like this,
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.360]   or just actually getting HR practices to be on the ball,
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.400]   things like this can be better.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.920]   I mean, one of the things that's really,
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.000]   in case really highlighted was just how poor
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.680]   Kleiner Perkins HR strategy around any of this stuff was,
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.080]   you know, they didn't have anything to really address
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.480]   sexual harassment, or gender discrimination,
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.720]   or anything, and for a firm of its size,
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.640]   and, you know, the amount of money people are making,
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.400]   and the types of deals they're dealing with,
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.000]   that's shocking, that they didn't even have
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.280]   anything like that in place.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.120]   And so, if anything comes from this,
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.040]   I hope that it's A, women feeling more comfortable
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.200]   speaking up, and B, feeling more comfortable
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.680]   and speaking up earlier, so that there can be
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.800]   documentation for these sorts of things going forward,
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.440]   so that it doesn't have to become a,
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.160]   he said sort of scenario.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.560]   - Yeah, and actually while the trial was going on,
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.320]   we saw a lawsuit filed against Facebook,
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.000]   and then a lawsuit filed against Twitter,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.080]   which has the potential to become a class action lawsuit,
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.880]   if the plaintiff can find enough people.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.680]   And I think that this is, it's exactly speaks to your point,
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.000]   that maybe people will be less afraid to come forward.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.600]   I think that we've seen in other industries,
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.000]   whether it was media with Newsweek,
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   or Wall Street with Morgan Stanley.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.120]   Once you had these larger class action suits
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.760]   around racial discrimination and gender discrimination,
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.520]   it was much harder for tech companies
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.960]   to brush them aside, or to say,
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.120]   well, this is just one woman,
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.520]   and her story is problematic,
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.280]   and it's easier to pick apart one person's complaint,
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.240]   and it is to pick apart the complaint of 40 people.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.520]   - One of the things that's difficult,
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.640]   and this is, man, and I'll include myself here,
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.120]   tend to kind of be a little myopic,
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.440]   we don't even see it.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.680]   And there's this kind of interesting disconnect
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.240]   between men and women when we talk about this kind of thing,
[00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.880]   or man go, what do you talk about?
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.600]   And then women go, it's so,
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.400]   have you all experienced these kinds of things?
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.200]   Were the things Alan Powell talked about a surprise to you?
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.360]   - No.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.360]   - I feel like, I'd expect Kleiner Perkins
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.800]   to be a place where good old boys, it's a good old boy.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.280]   It's the old boy network.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.360]   - It sounds like politics in the '60s, '70s, '80s,
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.520]   and all of it today.
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.440]   You're literally not allowed in the room,
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.200]   there's no accommodations made for you,
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.480]   you don't have facilities and services for women available at all.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.160]   And we have to push for change in this,
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.200]   and it can't just be from women.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.080]   One of the things that I don't like
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.080]   about gender discrimination issues in the tech industry
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.920]   is we really focus on the women.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.920]   What do the women need, why aren't they getting it,
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.240]   why aren't they more aggressive,
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.480]   why aren't we promoting them?
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.280]   - Kind of blame the victim.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.120]   - And it should be the victim.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.080]   - Well, it should be, right, exactly.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.680]   It's victim blaming, and it needs to be more focused on the men.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.400]   What should men do, what should companies do,
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.560]   what policies need to be in place?
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.920]   I think it's in Sweden or Norway
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.800]   that they now have a law that says
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.160]   half of all boards of a certain size company
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.840]   need to be female by a certain date.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.160]   So slowly and progressively,
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.480]   they're putting this law into play
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:58.120]   that is forcing companies to do business differently.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.240]   - Wow.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.160]   And I think that if you want to,
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.840]   one thing you might want to read is go online
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.160]   and find a story, an essay that Sue Decker,
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.760]   the former CEO of Yahoo wrote,
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.040]   it was posted on Recode.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.280]   It's excellent, and she talks about the fact that
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.240]   she and pretty much every woman in the industry
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.960]   she's ever known has dealt with some sort of
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.000]   sexual harassment or discrimination,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.880]   but sometimes when you're working really hard,
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.560]   you're willing to put those slights away
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.200]   and just set them aside.
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.000]   Because you don't really understand how grave they are
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.280]   until you look back and with the benefit of hindsight,
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.600]   understand that taken all together, that they were unfair.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.200]   And I think the headline is something like,
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.280]   sometimes the fish are the last to notice water.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.280]   You're just swimming in it and you're working all the time
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.320]   and you don't really put it all together
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.600]   until years have gone by.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.280]   So it's a really interesting essay written by a woman
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.320]   who I think by all accounts has achieved so much.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:52.240]   Nobody would ever say that she was not successful
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.960]   and even she is willing to admit
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.520]   that she faced discrimination.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.880]   - What I do hope is that Ellen Powell
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.320]   doesn't now face discrimination.
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.440]   I don't think she will.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:05.840]   - I feel like that even though she lost the case,
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:11.160]   people have a lot of respect for her courage and bringing it
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.080]   and all you have to do is read into it to see
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.040]   that there was, certainly from her point of view,
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.120]   there was merit in the case.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.400]   - Yeah, and I think she's been in a good position
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.960]   at Reddit where she took over as interim CEO
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.160]   and I think they've kind of been waiting for this
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.680]   to get resolved to make that permanent and whatnot,
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.560]   but by everyone that I've talked to who works at Reddit,
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.160]   who's involved there, they went very quickly
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.560]   from kind of a toxic situation with their last CEO
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.880]   to a much better situation with her at the helm.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.240]   So I mean, I think that that's good too.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.720]   She's had the support of Reddit, which is good, but no,
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.840]   I mean, I hope to your point,
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.320]   she's not discriminated against,
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.680]   but at the same time, I think it would be hard for people
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.640]   to do that to her now because she has proven
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.520]   that she's willing to be so public about it.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.680]   We know who she is and there's something to be said about
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.880]   when you put yourself out there,
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.960]   you know, having a camera on things makes it uncomfortable,
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.200]   but it also means that people have to be accountable.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.080]   So it's gonna be much harder for people to treat her
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.520]   differently and to do this sort of systemic thing
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.360]   that maybe happened in the past,
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.760]   merely by the virtue of the fact that a lot more people
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.160]   know who she is now.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.440]   - I would be careful of the blowback issue actually.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.400]   I mean, I think one of the problems that happens,
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.040]   you bring up a case, you have the spotlight put on you,
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.640]   and then you're seen as a trail maker
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.240]   and nobody wants to take you on.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.560]   They won't explicitly say it's because you're a woman
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.040]   or it's because of past action,
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.320]   but they don't want to get involved with you anymore.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.840]   And I think we have to admit that Ellen Powell is,
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.280]   she knew she would be taking this risk
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.000]   when she went to the trail.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.480]   - And she did. - And that's very brave.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:44.640]   - Yeah, it is very brave.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.000]   And I agree with you completely.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.080]   I do think that it's important,
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.480]   at least in her situation,
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.120]   she already had a Hulandian spot.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.520]   You know, she was already on the board of Reddit.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.520]   She already had this interim CEO stuff.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.040]   She had, you know, her compensation package,
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.320]   even when she was let go,
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.080]   was considerably more than most of us.
[00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.200]   She's, without a doubt,
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.920]   I'm not trying to say that she wasn't extremely brave
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:03.760]   to bring this forward,
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.280]   but let's also acknowledge her great privilege
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:09.160]   in having the ability to even bring this case forward.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.280]   And I think that actually says a lot right there
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.880]   that it took someone with the means that she has
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.160]   and with the connections and with the stature
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.440]   to have to, it took someone of her stature to do this
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.880]   because I don't know if this issue would have gotten
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.040]   as much attention, if it was a lesser person,
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.000]   a lesser firm, I think that someone else would have just settled
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.200]   for that very reason that you point out,
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.400]   Jill, I think they would have been worried
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.320]   about the blowback.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:31.640]   She's at least in a position where it's going to be much harder
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.480]   for her personally to face that blowback
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.880]   because of the other things that she has going for her
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.400]   and because of, you know,
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.680]   the things she's built up in the career
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.440]   that she's established for herself.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.280]   - Well, there you go.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.120]   She lost, but she won.
[00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:46.200]   And I think some, there are people comparing her
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.880]   to Rosa Parks, especially 'cause she was forced
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.400]   to sit in the airplane,
[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.120]   that there's a certain similarity.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.640]   And so I think a lot of kudos,
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.600]   a lot of praise to Ellen Powell for fighting that fight.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.560]   And whether win or lose, I think was very important.
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.680]   We're gonna take a break, come back.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.760]   When we talk about, I wanna talk about the FTC report on Google.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.800]   We had a great conversation on Wednesday on Twig,
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.360]   the Wall Street Journal Through a Freedom of Information Act
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:18.000]   got a FTC report that was submitted,
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.600]   but kind of ignored by FTC commissioners.
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.200]   The commissioners two years ago decided not to go after Google.
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.200]   This report from the FTC attorneys said,
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.200]   you need to go after Google.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.160]   They are really acting monopolistically.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:34.000]   We'll talk about that and a lot more.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.400]   And I guess we can also say,
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.880]   we'll throw in a little Apple Watch news,
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.520]   'cause why not?
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.720]   What else is there to tell?
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.960]   Are you so sick to death of the Apple Watch?
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.360]   You just say, let's not talk about it until it comes out.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.640]   I think that's probably the sensible thing
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.480]   to do at this point.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.520]   Who's gonna buy one?
[00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.360]   - Oh, I am.
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.880]   Anybody with $10,000 to blow?
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.960]   - No, no, no, 350 bucks.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.480]   This is the great part.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.320]   - It is.
[00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.320]   - I suddenly realized the whole strategy.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.440]   Who was it that said,
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.080]   the great thing about drinking a can of Coke
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.240]   is you drinking the same exact can of Coke
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.760]   as a billionaire drinks?
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.760]   - Yeah, that was Andy Warhol.
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.360]   - Andy Warhol. - Right, yes.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.560]   - So if you buy the three,
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:15.960]   now seemingly cheap $350 Apple Watch,
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.720]   you're wearing the same exact watch,
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.680]   except for the outside.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.520]   - The outside, yeah.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.880]   - I buy the $17,000 Apple Watch.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.280]   - I'm not sure you have one way to look at it.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.120]   It's optimistic.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.280]   - I feel like that might be.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.280]   - Oh, completely.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:30.080]   - It's a little bit of a pricing too.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.280]   If you have a model that's $10,000,
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.640]   suddenly the $350 model doesn't seem so expensive, right?
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:36.640]   - If you had,
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.720]   I mean, the most expensive Android Wear Watch
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.280]   is only $250 or $300, right?
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.000]   - Right, and Apple's trying to build a luxury fashion brand,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.080]   and this is what you need to do.
[00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.240]   If you're Buttega, Veneta,
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.680]   or if you are, you know,
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.000]   any sort of high-end retail name,
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.200]   Stella McCartney, the idea is you create
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.840]   out of reach items that are for a select few,
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:59.560]   and then you can sell a lot of the more reasonably priced.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.880]   - We have $50 shoes,
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.080]   so you have like a couple of $2,000 pairs
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.840]   or $3,000 pairs of shoes,
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.800]   and then you have a bunch that are like $600
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.600]   that buy comparison until really reasonable,
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.920]   and they're luxuries within reach,
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.800]   and I am throwing out these numbers,
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.800]   'cause I was just at Barney's the other day.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:15.640]   - Right, right.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.600]   - Not shopping for myself,
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.080]   but just sort of this understanding
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.080]   that's the psychology of luxury fashion,
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:23.040]   and so if Apple wants to play in that game,
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.360]   there's a reason why they hired the women from Burberry
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.280]   to do this, like this is what you need to do.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.640]   - Isn't it funny because that's exactly,
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.440]   now that you mention it,
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.280]   exactly the same words that people say
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.600]   when they look at Oke Kocher,
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.120]   when it's fashion week,
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.320]   who would wear, who would pay $30,000 for that dress?
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.920]   It's not about that dress.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:42.760]   - No, it's not.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.440]   It's about what comes down the pipe afterwards,
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.640]   and then it exactly to Katie's point.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:50.240]   It's about getting from that $10,000 point
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.440]   to that $350 or $550 point,
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.960]   and then on top of that,
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:56.400]   having the accessories, having the bands.
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.880]   My big thing, I'm definitely getting one,
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.640]   and I know what band I want,
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:01.360]   but I have to make sure that it'll look good
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.520]   on the $350 sports watch.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.720]   If it looks like it'll clash,
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.000]   then unfortunately my ass is spinning $750 in the watch.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.280]   (laughing)
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.640]   Which, what about that?
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.260]   - Are you gonna get the Milanese loop?
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:14.100]   Come on, admit it.
[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:14.920]   - No.
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:15.760]   - No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:20.760]   The Milanese loop, no, but the--
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.080]   - Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.080]   I'm gonna get the Milanese loop,
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:24.680]   is it tacky, should I not get it?
[00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.040]   - No, it's not tacky, it's just kind of manly,
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.440]   and I want the light pink.
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.680]   Right, so for you to be perfect.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.680]   - I don't think I'll wear the light pink.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.520]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.680]   So for me, I want the light pink,
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.440]   and that's the band that I want,
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:38.360]   and so it's just gonna depend
[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.560]   whether it clashes with the sport watch,
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.720]   that medal, or if I'm gonna have to have
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.120]   the freaking stainless steel,
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.260]   and everyone that I talk to just says,
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.400]   "Christina, come on, you know you're just gonna get the--
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.640]   "You know you're spending $750 on a watch,
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.840]   "you know what's happening."
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.680]   And I'm like, you're right,
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.480]   and the way I'll justify it is like,
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.320]   I go, "Oh, well, you know, same way I do
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.160]   "when I'm at Tori Barch."
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.640]   I'm like, "Well, it's not as much as this."
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.000]   - Uh-huh. - You know?
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:03.840]   - Uh-huh.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.000]   - It's the exact same philosophy,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.360]   in case, dead on, that's exactly what they're doing to us.
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.480]   And I am nothing, if not a label whore,
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:12.360]   and a consumer, and a lover of tech,
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.040]   and so I'm all about it.
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.760]   - So Christina's getting the $10,000.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.760]   - I think we found our edition by you.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.080]   (laughing)
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.280]   I just wanna say, this shirt is salmon,
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:23.120]   and I think, salmon.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.320]   - Salmon, absolutely. - Salmon, right?
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:27.920]   - So Leo, you know I'm big into the fitness devices.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.720]   - Yes, you've worn every one--
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.120]   - I have, I have, my Twitter profile is in fact
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:33.800]   like a under one post, but I have this new one
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.000]   I wanted to show, this is the Garmin Vivo Active.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.800]   I'm trying to get the screen to show--
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.040]   - It's every bit as attractive as the basis was,
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:41.880]   but you like it.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.320]   - It's super thin, though.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.920]   It doesn't have any heart rate monitoring on the back,
[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.960]   but like it's super thin, and I really like how elegant it is.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.640]   And I feel like it's a good example of a watch
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.000]   that isn't too manly.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.640]   So Christina, you reminded me of that
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.920]   when you were talking about the strap options,
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.760]   but this one's really great, it has GPS,
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.040]   and I haven't charged it since Tuesday,
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.720]   and I took it on a couple of runs, it's still going.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.520]   I'm like totally impressed with this,
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.800]   and it does notifications too.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.200]   - Here's her picture, by the way,
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.120]   Jill E. Duffy on Twitter, every watch.
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:14.960]   - Yeah.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.120]   - I want you, I'm gonna give you an assignment,
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.560]   actually somebody gave me this assignment,
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:18.720]   I'm passing it on to you,
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.560]   to wear the Apple Watch with three or four
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.320]   of the other bands in the same arm
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.680]   so that you can compare the steps
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.440]   and the heart rate and all that stuff.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.280]   - Totally get mugged.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.120]   - I'm gonna see you have my heart rate
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:29.960]   goes while I'm making it.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.160]   - Get mugged, yeah, so you can get mugged, right.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.920]   - See, I wanna go to Chinatown and get,
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.440]   see I'm not gonna spend $10,000 on the rose gold
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.960]   Apple Watch, we'll just go to Chinatown
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.320]   and get one of those for like $50.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.480]   - Somebody's already selling a Chinese knockoff.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.600]   - Oh yeah, no, we found one at CES,
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.720]   one of our reporters found one at CES,
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.840]   that actually synced with her,
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.080]   that actually paired with her iPhone,
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.520]   but they already had them at CES,
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.960]   she bought one for, I think, $30 or something.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:55.960]   - That's crazy.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:57.600]   - Yeah, so they're gonna be out there,
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.520]   but I'm just looking forward
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.560]   to the rose gold ones in Chinatown.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.400]   (laughs)
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.400]   - I used to go to Canal Street,
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.200]   is that not the place to get $10 watches anymore?
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.160]   - Oh no, you can tell,
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.000]   Canal Street, they'll be all over the place there too,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.880]   I was like the edge of Chinatown.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.720]   - Yeah, it's kinda there.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.960]   - Exactly, it's right there.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:13.800]   - Yeah.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.160]   (laughs)
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.040]   - Our guests today, having a fun time,
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.240]   and I didn't wanna get a wise you with yelling
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.800]   how stuff, but I thought we haven't covered it,
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.400]   we really should cover it at this point.
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.760]   Jill Duffy from PC Magazine, Katie Benner from Bloomberg View,
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.480]   Christina Warren from Mashable.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.520]   More coming up in a second,
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.320]   if you are saving up for your Apple Watch,
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:37.120]   whether it's 350 bucks or $7,000 or $10,000 or $17,000,
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.840]   you probably wanna know about gazelle.com.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.280]   Here's a way you can raise money for your cause
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.880]   by selling your old gadgets.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.200]   Gazelle will buy your old iPhone iPad,
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.600]   they even buy broken iPhones and iPads.
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.360]   Samsung Galaxy phones,
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.240]   Microsoft Surface, Tablets, Nokia,
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.640]   phones, they buy a broad variety of gadgets,
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.120]   pay top dollar for it, and they make it easy for you.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.920]   You can go right now and get a 30 day quote,
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.400]   that quote locked in for 30 days,
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.320]   that means you don't have to decide right now,
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.960]   you can wait until the Galaxy S6 comes out,
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.920]   take a look at it, and then pull the trigger,
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.720]   but that quote is locked in for 30 days, and that's nice.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.040]   They'll also wipe the data if you forget to do so,
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.680]   so you don't have to worry about it.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.680]   And they make it easy because they pay the postage
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.000]   on anything worth more than a dollar.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.880]   So find all those gadgets,
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.560]   they're stuck in drawers and closets and underneath the bed,
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.160]   and pile them all up, get quotes from gazelle
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.240]   when you check out, they'll send you a box
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.840]   to ship it all over to them,
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.600]   they'll turn it around fast
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.480]   and give you a great price, you can get a check,
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:39.480]   a PayPal credit, or the Amazon gift card.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.920]   They have now paid out $200 million
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:46.680]   to many hundreds of thousands of customers,
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.840]   over a million customers, very happy people.
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.320]   Now you might wonder, well, what happens to the stuff
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.320]   I sell on gazelle?
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.760]   Well, they take the best of it, the creme de la creme,
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.480]   and they sell it right to you on gazelle.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.080]   Certified pre-owned gadgets, there's two conditions,
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.200]   certified like new and certified good.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.240]   If you really wanna save, get the certified good,
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.280]   they work just great, they just show some
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.760]   gentle signs of wear, kind of probably like the phone
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.480]   you broke or lost that you're replacing,
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.040]   but it's a great way to get a great device
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.240]   at a great price.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.520]   All devices have been put through a rigorous
[00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:22.720]   30 point inspection, they are 100% fully functional,
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.440]   and there's never any risk, they're all backed
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:28.120]   by a 30 day risk free return policy.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:33.120]   gazelle.com to sell or buy G-A-Z-E-L-L-E,
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.600]   and we thank them so much for their support
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:40.080]   of this week in tech.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.600]   Tim Cook says he's giving away all his money,
[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.480]   but don't get in line, it's to charity.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:48.520]   Great fortune article, Tim Cookworth,
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:52.600]   they estimate $785 million.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.760]   Actually, it's a writer's article that Fortune republished,
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.640]   and he said he's gonna keep a little bit of it
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.320]   to pay for his 10 year old nephew's college education
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.920]   and the rest goes to charity.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.120]   That's pretty sweet.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.920]   Who does, two thumbs up.
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:09.840]   Yeah. Very, very nice.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.600]   Bill Gates is doing this, he said,
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.160]   "I'll give away all but 5% of my fortune."
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.840]   In fact, Gates has joined with Warren Buffett
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.840]   for the giving pledge where billionaires,
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.640]   particularly in the tech industry,
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.080]   pledged to give away at least half their worth
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:25.920]   in their lifetimes.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.040]   Mark Zuckerberg's agreed, Larry Ellison of Oracle's agreed.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.360]   Cook is not in that group, but he said,
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.600]   "No, I plan to do it as well."
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:39.600]   The real challenge actually is how to do it correctly.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:42.280]   It's so easy to just throw money at things.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.640]   He told Fortune, he started donating money
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:47.400]   to unspecified causes quietly,
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.000]   but he is trying to develop a more systemic,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.960]   I'm sorry, systematic approach to philanthropy
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.280]   that goes beyond writing checks.
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.600]   Silicon Valley has not been known for its philanthropy,
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.480]   but I think now things are changing a little bit.
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.120]   In fact, very famously, Steve Jobs
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.040]   was really anti-charity.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.360]   Yeah, he really was.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.320]   Although his wife has done quite a bit.
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.800]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.040]   She's huge with it, which I think is,
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.160]   it is a being, his legacy won't be tied to him,
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.400]   but his fortune will probably largely be going
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.960]   to a lot of grateful and drop causes
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.880]   because she's really active.
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.120]   Tim is also one of the few CEOs who is openly gay,
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.800]   he came out not so long ago,
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:30.800]   tweeted on Friday condemning the Indiana
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.080]   religious freedom bill,
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:38.040]   that religious freedom bill allows Indiana businesses
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:42.280]   to decline, to serve gay and lesbian customers,
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.120]   Cook tweeted, "Apple's open for everyone.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.720]   We're deeply disappointed by Indiana's new law
[00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.840]   calling on Arkansas governor to veto it, HP."
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.440]   And he sounded at different dates in Indiana
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.640]   they've decided to clarify that law.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.880]   Once they realized there was going to be a huge blowback
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.440]   from the business community,
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.640]   they figured they have to backtrack somehow quickly.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.800]   And I think a lot of that was because
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.640]   the pressure brought to bear by tech companies.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.880]   Well, wasn't it Mark Benioff at Salesforce
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.800]   who said that's it, we're not going to ever have a...
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:12.640]   Exactly.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.000]   We don't want to have conferences,
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.600]   we're never going to have a Salesforce conference
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:16.760]   in Indiana because...
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.680]   And they have a big workforce in Indiana
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.920]   because they bought a company that was based in Indiana.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.720]   So he actually does have some clout there
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.520]   and it's been interesting to see the way
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:27.320]   that Benioff has been willing to wield that.
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.040]   And to be honest, he's been one of the few tech CEOs
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:30.880]   who's come out and said,
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.680]   "I think that we should be doing more charitable giving."
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.240]   People are very divided on Mark Benioff
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:38.000]   when it comes to his personality and his company.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.160]   But you have to admit that he's been one of the very few
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.080]   to take a stand on things like social causes,
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.720]   social issues and philanthropy.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.440]   Wow, I got to say right onto that.
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.600]   And especially if that carries some weight
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.160]   and has some impact.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.960]   So I want to say something a little bit controversial
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.800]   about this.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.120]   All right.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.400]   I agree with Salesforce.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.320]   I agree with Tim Cook.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.000]   I think that they are taking a stand for something
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.440]   that aligns with my values.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.440]   However, I know that businesses influences state
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.800]   and U.S. law all the time,
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.800]   but it's very disconcerting to me to think about it
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.760]   all the time when it doesn't align with my values.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:19.400]   So I'm kind of skeptical about what happens
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.840]   when businesses have so much influences
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:25.240]   that they do change state and federal law.
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.560]   So in this case, like I said,
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:28.920]   allows with my values, of course, I'm very happy
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.680]   about these companies pushing back.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.360]   But it's a tricky topic, I think.
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.440]   That's an excellent point, Joe.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:37.280]   I mean, what if it went the other way?
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.160]   What if they said, oh, we're not going to do business
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.400]   in Indiana because they have a gay governor?
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.760]   Well, didn't Russia say we're not going to buy
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.560]   any more Apple computers?
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.560]   I mean, that's sort of the rub, right?
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.880]   I mean, it can go either way.
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:55.000]   And I think we have to be aware of what that
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:55.840]   influence means.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.600]   I think Schill's point is great.
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.560]   But I mean, I think it's kind of a balancing act.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:03.480]   We've seen it go that other way for so long.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.080]   It's at least refreshing to see it.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.880]   It goes something more progressive
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.960]   and see people speak out in that extent.
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.160]   I think it's important to be aware of that
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:14.200]   and to question what that authority means.
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:17.120]   But at the same time, I guess maybe I'm just, you know,
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:22.080]   a bit cynical about it, where I figure it is, what it is.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.600]   Things are going to be influenced regardless.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:27.720]   We might as well embrace it when things are actually
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.400]   working towards some more progressive goals,
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.680]   especially in states that have a history
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.120]   of pushing back against anything.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.400]   Schill's a boy, I'm really glad you made that point, Jill,
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.160]   because it's one thing for Tim Cook to say something
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.880]   to speak out, that's appropriate.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.600]   It's another thing to, what is,
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:45.760]   Apple's, I know it's not closing, it's Indiana Apple stores.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:50.560]   We know the Supreme Court has said,
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.880]   corporations can act as individuals in this respect.
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.840]   - Right, they're treated as people.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.360]   Is that the phrase? - Yeah.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.920]   But I'm not sure that's always,
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.480]   I should, that's a good thing, come to think of it.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.480]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:06.640]   I mean, it happens so often that I think it's often
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.840]   invisible and not really discussed anymore.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.600]   We know that these big companies have a lot of influence.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.920]   They have lobbyists in Washington,
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:17.400]   but it's, yeah, I mean, it's something
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.600]   that I think should be troubling on some level.
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.440]   - Yeah.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.520]   And now I wasn't gonna talk about the Apple Watch,
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:28.640]   but nine to five Mac Mark Gurman,
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.480]   always on top of these things, he says,
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.560]   retail stock will be limited if you walk in the store,
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:39.080]   don't count on getting that watch of your dreams.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.960]   They're saying you should probably April 10th,
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.600]   the, you won't, you'll be able to pre-order April 10th
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.560]   online and in store.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.640]   Gurman's saying it'd probably be smart to order online
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:53.840]   if you can for April 24th delivery, just a tip.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:56.040]   Christina, if you want, if you really want that.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.880]   But so you wanna try it on, don't you?
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:59.160]   - Yes, well, that's the whole thing.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.960]   I mean, that's kind of the problem with this
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.680]   as opposed to some of the other launches,
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.060]   where it's, you're usually fine with just, you know,
[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:07.000]   pre-ordering sight unseen, but I do,
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.240]   I wanna try it on and I wanna see, okay,
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.800]   could I get away with the cheaper, you know,
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.200]   sport watch frame with the band that I want?
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.320]   Or do I really need to do what everyone
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.500]   in the brother knows you're gonna do,
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.200]   including my own mother and spend the $750.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.560]   Even my own mother is like Christina,
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:21.560]   what are you even talking about?
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:23.160]   Of course you're getting the Apple watch.
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.440]   - But wait a minute, you would get the $750 watch
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.320]   with the pink sport band.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.840]   - Well, that's, it's 750 including the pink sport band.
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:33.840]   Or it would be 350 for the basic watch with the,
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:37.160]   with the leather band, rather be 350 for the basic sport
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.760]   watch and then another 250 for the band on top of it.
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.480]   But I need to make sure the band won't clash
[00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.800]   with the sport backing.
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:47.280]   Otherwise I'm just going full hog and spending $750
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.720]   and getting the watch and the pink band.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.000]   - Christina, dare I say you're overthinking this?
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.080]   Maybe not.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.160]   - No, I'm not.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.040]   - It's a good point though.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.880]   I mean, this is a good point about wearables
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.000]   in general and women and women's knees, right?
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.960]   So we can do with some internet shopping,
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.400]   we can do with getting items sent to us
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.880]   and we try them on when they arrive.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.040]   Often we know the brands and how they fit.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.360]   But there is a concern that we wanna try stuff on.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.320]   We wanna make sure that a watch is not too big.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.080]   We wanna make sure that the colors are right.
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.400]   And I don't know what Apple's return policy is.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.280]   I don't know Christina if you could order the watch you want
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.080]   and swap it out for something different.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.600]   - Oh, I'm sure they would let me do that.
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:25.680]   I'm sure they would let me do that.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.520]   That'd be fine.
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.000]   But part of the whole thing with this
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.520]   is that they're supposed to be setting up, you know,
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.080]   ways where you can try this on
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.120]   and look at the different bands
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.320]   and look at the different materials
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:35.040]   and they're making it, you know, like going to brewery
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.640]   and trying on, you know, rain jackets,
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:41.200]   but we're going to try a version trying on shoes.
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.320]   And so I mean, I think that it makes sense
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.720]   they'll have more limited stock,
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.280]   but it's gonna be slightly different for some of us
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:49.680]   than the typical Apple experience
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.040]   because if so much of this really is about
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.160]   the experiential part of this,
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:57.080]   it doesn't lend itself quite as easily to buy an online,
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:00.000]   like you would with a Fitbit or something like that.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.960]   - Well, thank goodness for mixyourwatch.com.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.800]   Have you seen this? - I have.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.720]   - So you can pick the watch you wish,
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.320]   you're thinking aluminum,
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.600]   and you want the, you're not going with a floral elastomer,
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.080]   aka rubber band. - No, no, no, no, no.
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.720]   - You want a lither. - Exactly.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.560]   I want the light pink. - The classic buckle.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.280]   - Exactly. - Oh, that's pricey,
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:25.640]   isn't it, isn't the buckle gold?
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.800]   - Oh, no, that's if you, that's not the light pink,
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.320]   that's the salmon color. - Oh.
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.480]   - That one is, oh, yes, but that one.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.160]   - See, I'm a man, I don't know the difference here.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.920]   - Yeah, no, that one that you have, that particular,
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.200]   that would be my dream pick, that's beautiful,
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.280]   but that's only available. - That's 7,000 dollar band.
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:42.480]   - I know, you can only get the band
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.200]   with the Apple Watch edition.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.320]   - Oh, well, they, obviously, this sight sucks
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:50.920]   because they don't have the pink leather.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.600]   - Yeah, they do, it's on the classic buckle.
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:56.120]   It's the far right on classic buckle.
[00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.440]   - Right there. - This one?
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:00.080]   - Yeah, that's light pink. - That's pink?
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.520]   - Yeah. - Looks like white to me.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.000]   See, little do I know. - It's light pink.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.560]   - That's light pink, that's the one you want.
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:06.400]   - That's the one I want.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.840]   - That's gonna look good on your wrist,
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:08.840]   I think that's nice. - Oh, that's really beautiful.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.880]   - Yeah, go for that. - You can get that.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.920]   - Yes. - We can get this,
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.360]   you know what, we all support this person.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.800]   - You call these shopping books, you guys are pretty cheap,
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.000]   no. - Do we know?
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   Will all the bands work on all the watches?
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:21.880]   - Yes, they will.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.400]   - So it's the same attachment thing on all of them.
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.520]   - Attachment thing, they didn't make that clear,
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.520]   and I had to call Apple to confirm that,
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.200]   but yes, they all will work with all of them.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.520]   So now it's just, now will they all match?
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:34.640]   Not necessarily, you wouldn't necessarily want
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:37.160]   that Milanese band with the gold watch,
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:39.800]   but they will all work together.
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.680]   - Wait a minute, let me just look at the Milanese.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:44.600]   Oh yeah, you're right, that would be terrible, horrible.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.840]   No good, very bad.
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.800]   So I'm gonna, you think, can it work with the aluminum?
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.120]   Maybe. - Oh yeah.
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:52.160]   - It probably would look quite good
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.720]   with the aluminum. - I think it would.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.960]   - There's been, I've been debating with my fashion friends
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.880]   on Twitter about this, it's the few times
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.160]   where fashion Twitter and tech Twitter overlap
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:03.200]   is with picking out the right Apple band,
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.760]   Apple Watch band assortment,
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.400]   and but I need to see this in person,
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.840]   this is really what it comes down to.
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:10.760]   - Good news, you'll be able to make 15 minute appointments.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:14.280]   This is, by the way, 15 minutes is only
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.160]   for you buying the steel and aluminum.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.960]   Those of you buying the gold, well, call your broker,
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.160]   I don't know, it's just some other,
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.000]   is there some other system?
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.520]   You can make these appointments ahead of time.
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:26.160]   You can't try it as walk in,
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.760]   but there'll be limited accessibility.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.680]   You really should book ahead online
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:33.120]   on appointment starting April 10th.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:35.680]   They say the Watch Edition appointments
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.920]   could last up to 30 minutes,
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:41.640]   but it's one source, it's a total mark,
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.240]   it's not like we'll kick out the sport
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:46.440]   and stainless steel customers if they're taking too long.
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:49.000]   And I guarantee you, if you're looking at $17,000 watch,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.960]   you could take all the time you want.
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:53.880]   - Yes. - I'm gonna order online
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.000]   for April 24th delivery.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.600]   There is not the in-store pickup
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.480]   that we've seen before with iPads and iPhones.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:02.640]   You will not be able to, apparently, according to a 9-5,
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.000]   you won't be able to go into the store and pick it up,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.680]   but that may change as inventory becomes more available.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.440]   So just a little bit of a thing.
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.640]   - I wonder how they're gonna ensure
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:13.480]   if anybody actually tries to order the $10,000 watch online.
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:14.960]   Like, how are they going to ensure that?
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.400]   Because I would say-- - I think Tim Cuckle
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.040]   come to your house.
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.840]   - I would hope so. - With a briefcase
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.240]   and a mannequin. - But like all jokes aside,
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.880]   I mean, like, don't you think
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.440]   that somebody from FedEx or UPS,
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.960]   I mean, I don't know if, you know what I mean?
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.240]   Like, if you've got one of the delivery guys
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.360]   and they've got, you know, one of these Watch editions,
[00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.080]   I don't know, I mean-- - How do they do it
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:34.680]   if you order a Patek Philippe in the mail?
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:37.640]   Can you mail order at expense that you must be able to, right?
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:39.200]   - I don't even know. - I don't know.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.200]   - I don't think this is the club that's gonna--
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.240]   - You can buy extended insurance on shipping.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.080]   That's not a problem.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.560]   - And they make you sign and it's a, you know,
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.520]   plain brown wrapper.
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.280]   - Didn't that happen when the iPhone,
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:54.040]   I wanna say the iPhone 5 came out or maybe the 5S?
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:56.640]   There was this rash of like people's phones
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.560]   not showing up at their doorstep and they--
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.640]   - Yeah, they were getting stolen.
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:00.480]   - They were getting stolen. - Yes.
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.160]   - The cameras were stealing them, yeah.
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.000]   - Wow. - That's what I'm saying.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.800]   That totally was a real thing that happened
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.680]   and that's why I'm asking.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.000]   I'm thinking with the watches,
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.160]   young off chance that somebody might have actually
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.320]   been dumb enough to order a $10,000 watch through the mail.
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.320]   I mean, to me, I figure if you've got that much money,
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.520]   go into the store and get your ass kissed,
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.200]   that's part of the fun of spending that much money.
[00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.880]   - Ah, I think you're right. - I don't know.
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:21.360]   - I don't know. - No, I think you're right.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.200]   - When Google Glass came out,
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.320]   I know there was an option that you can go and pick it up
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:26.800]   at certain locations. - Right.
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.160]   - And they-- - But if you just ordered it,
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.120]   did they ship it to you? - Yeah.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:30.960]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.480]   - But I think that they wanted you to,
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.960]   especially early on when people cared,
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.920]   they wanted you to come in and they'd fit it to you
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.920]   and they had this whole retail experience.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:41.400]   - I guess that's, you know, a tenth of the price or so.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.600]   - Yeah, exactly, $1,500, that's nothing.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.920]   You don't deserve any. (laughs)
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.920]   Again, that economic view of something
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.560]   looking less expensive than-- - Well, somebody said,
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.760]   there's probably Renee Richie on "Mac Break Weekly"
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:56.640]   this week, but the market, in this market,
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.920]   the high-end $10,000 to $70,000 watch market,
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:01.840]   you're not, the people are buying that.
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.440]   - It is, it's about the experience.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:06.160]   It isn't about the thing.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:08.080]   If they wanna be costitive,
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.160]   they wanna come in and have a cup of tea
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.280]   and, you know, people who fawn over.
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.680]   That's part of the whole process.
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.920]   That's why you do that. - Well, I think Katie
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.240]   and Christina were both saying before,
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.760]   I mean, this is part of Apple's strategy
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.000]   of becoming a lifestyle brand, right?
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.440]   Like, it's not just about fashion,
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:23.840]   it's about that whole experience.
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:27.400]   And they've been on this track for at least a decade.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.480]   And the Apple Store is just a wonderful example of that.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:33.000]   So I think the Apple Store, I was reading about it recently.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   It was modeled after very nicely designed hotels
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.640]   that have high-end clientele.
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.360]   And whenever you surveyed a high-end clientele,
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.400]   they said, we love the concierge.
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:47.000]   Like, that's the best experience
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.520]   of going to a great hotel.
[00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:49.960]   You go up to this person,
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.960]   they take care of things for you.
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.080]   They're very quick, they're very efficient,
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.280]   they're very knowledgeable.
[00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.840]   And that's how Apple developed the Genius Bar.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.040]   So it's taking, you know, some idea
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:02.560]   that's already existed and sort of repurposing it
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:04.000]   into what we call the tech world.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.560]   But it's really the retail world,
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.040]   it's really the fashion world, it's a number of things.
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.880]   - Don't you feel like Steve Jobs is just spinning
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.720]   in his grave though?
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.320]   I mean, I've been reading,
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.440]   you don't think so, I've been reading the new book
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.560]   about him becoming Steve Jobs, which is a,
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.120]   I don't know if there's anything new in it,
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:24.040]   but it's a good read, I like reading about Steve.
[00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.240]   I feel like he was a hippie.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.160]   He, uh...
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.880]   - He was a hippie who evolved like most hippies
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:31.560]   and he was interested into a yuppie, right?
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.160]   I mean, isn't that kind of what happens?
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.160]   - He liked driving an expensive Mercedes,
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:40.160]   he really liked, you know, high quality products.
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.640]   So maybe in that sense.
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.520]   - I think more than anything he liked winning.
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:45.160]   And I think more than anything he liked.
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.000]   - Ah.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.400]   - You know, being the best company,
[00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.760]   most profitable company, biggest company in the world.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:52.040]   - But Apple was really an issue, maybe I'm wrong,
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:55.800]   'cause I'm a, maybe I'm a pie-eyed Apple fan boy.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:58.360]   But in the early days, when I was really an Apple fan,
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.400]   the company for the rest of us, it wasn't about,
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:06.400]   it was about humans and using computing to change the world.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:09.040]   Isn't that what he told John Scully,
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.080]   who was a marketing executive in Pepsi,
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.360]   but he tried to hire him, he said,
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.960]   you could continue to sell sugar, water to the masses,
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.600]   or you can come here and change the world.
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.680]   - Sure, but look at Google,
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.680]   I mean, they're slogan used to be don't do evil.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.240]   - Oh, great, everybody actually.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.960]   - Everybody changes once they become huge,
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.640]   multi-billion dollar companies with enormous market caps
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.480]   that all the largest investment firms in the world
[00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.560]   own pieces of and that, you know,
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:33.800]   our retirements are built upon,
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.080]   oh, we need that stock to go up.
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.520]   So yeah, I think that once companies get really large,
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.680]   that stuff goes away.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:43.440]   - Did you have anything, if you read that book,
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.440]   or is that on your--
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:45.360]   - Yeah, and I've read it.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.840]   I read it this week.
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.200]   Yeah, I did, did, 'cause I took most of the week off
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.560]   for Bobsperger's life, and so I read it.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:54.480]   - Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute,
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.960]   slow down. - That's great.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.880]   - You took the week off to go down
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.280]   to Washington, DC for the life.
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:00.600]   - I took the week off, I took three days off,
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:02.040]   I took three days off, yes I did.
[00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.200]   - Wow, that's commitment.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:06.160]   - It is commitment, and it was for my husband's birthday,
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.360]   Billy to birthday, it was a trip for that,
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:10.000]   and so I read it on the Amtrak.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.120]   It was a good book, but I mean,
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.680]   but I think that the case is absolutely right,
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.920]   he liked to win, but also, I mean,
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.160]   you could make the argument that you have a much better
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.120]   shot at changing the world with something like an iPhone
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.480]   or an iPad, then you do with, you know,
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.440]   kind of a hobbyist computer kit, you know what I mean?
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.520]   If you really think about how Apple has kind of changed
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.280]   the world, a lot of times it's with these more mass products.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.360]   Now that's not to say that a watch is going to change
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.880]   the world, but I don't think that it has to be either,
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.280]   or I think you can be both more consumer and kind of,
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.440]   you know, I guess not consumers the right word,
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:42.120]   I guess more commercially focused,
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:44.560]   and also have an impact to really change
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.080]   the way everything is going to work.
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:51.440]   - Well if you're Pebble Watch, you've done both.
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.480]   - Yeah, that's true, I'm getting one of those too.
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.240]   Pebble Watch closed its Kickstarter campaign
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.200]   for the Pebble Time on Friday.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.480]   They wanted, oh, maybe half a million bucks,
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.320]   they got 20 million.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.160]   - So bad.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.120]   - 30 days.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:10.320]   Pebble Time is color.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.160]   - Yep.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:13.360]   - Seven days battery life, a new interface,
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.840]   and of course, Pebble's the only watch
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.240]   that works on both iOS and Android.
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:22.000]   $20 million, $78,000 backers,
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.440]   but the thing that bothers me a little bit about this
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:28.320]   is it sort of turns Kickstarter into a store.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.640]   This was really about, I pre-order,
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.800]   not raise money so we can develop something cool.
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.160]   - Well, it's both, right?
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.120]   Because I think that they're a special case,
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.720]   they're kind of the exception that proves the role.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:40.720]   You know, they even were very upfront when I talked to them
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:41.840]   and they announced their Kickstarter,
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.680]   that they had the lines ready to go,
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.200]   that this was more one of those things
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.680]   to kind of go back to the community
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.600]   and let them get it on it early,
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:51.680]   be the first people to get the watch.
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.960]   You know, since they built their company truly on Kickstarter
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.160]   and I think they're one of the few companies
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:59.000]   that can say they genuinely, like VCs turned them down.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.600]   You know, Eric was not able to get VCs interested in them
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.360]   and then they raised, you know,
[00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:06.400]   almost $10 million in Kickstarter last time
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.720]   and finally had people paying attention to them
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.240]   and they managed to ship a product.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.800]   So I think that, yeah, I mean,
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.280]   it kind of turns it into a store,
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.400]   but at the same time, I think this is one of those few times
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:20.000]   where people get mad about how Kickstarter is being kind of,
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.600]   you know, taken away, taken over by the rich and the powerful.
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:27.480]   And I guess that's true, but I was interviewing people
[00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.840]   who were some of the first successful Kickstarter people,
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:33.120]   you know, more than four years ago,
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.960]   who, the ones that were really successful
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.560]   were people who had connections already in manufacturing
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:39.720]   and who knew what they were doing
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.800]   and who were basically using the platform
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.760]   as much as for marketing as for seed funding.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:46.600]   And it's really about being able to kind of do
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:47.760]   with the money, what you want
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.980]   without being beholden to other people.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:51.200]   So I mean, in this case,
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.040]   it does kind of turn it into a store in a sense,
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:56.440]   but I also feel like the community is okay with it
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:59.320]   because this is like the ultimate Kickstarter success story.
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:01.600]   So why not, you know, come back
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.760]   and double the amount of money they're doing
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.320]   and granted, you know, they have funding
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:07.540]   and they're doing well, but they're going up against
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:09.540]   humongous behemoths, you know, known as Google,
[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:10.760]   known as Apple.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:14.160]   So $20 million and 78,000 watches is fantastic.
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:17.520]   Well, let's not pretend that that's going to even be a dent
[00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:20.180]   in what Apple's going to do in their first hour
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:22.020]   of pre-orders.
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:23.260]   - I'm really curious, Christina,
[00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:26.060]   why do you think it is that we are seeing all these
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:28.900]   hardware companies continue to put out wristbands?
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:30.940]   I mean, jawbones trying, they still haven't gotten
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:33.220]   theirs out, what's going on there.
[00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:36.700]   But Pebble and Shine, you know, companies fit bit,
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:38.260]   they still really believe that there's a place
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:39.100]   in the market for them.
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:42.020]   And I've not been able to figure out why that is.
[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:43.940]   - Jill Duff is the queen of these things.
[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:44.940]   - Jill Duff is the queen of these things.
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.500]   - Yeah, I got a basis watch 'cause of you, Jill Duff.
[00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.200]   - So how do you like it?
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:52.240]   - It's in the drawer with my Nike fuel band
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.760]   and my jaw bone up.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.600]   - Yeah, okay, so this is where I think
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.400]   these devices are going.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.920]   Part of what they do well is they allow us to have
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:04.080]   a generation one device in our pockets or on our bodies
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:07.080]   that's collecting a lot of data from a lot of people
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:10.720]   that could effectively be used in health and wellness.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.360]   So there's kind of two angles to this.
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:15.160]   One is the mass collection of data.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.600]   Everybody's a little scared of that term,
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.560]   but if you think about research trials
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:21.640]   for things in medicine and health studies,
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:24.840]   we're often looking at like 1,000, 2,000 people
[00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:26.840]   over a very short amount of time,
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.360]   like maybe a year or two if we're lucky.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.920]   So you start to have devices like these
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:32.720]   that are collecting actual data.
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:34.560]   It's not self-reported.
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:37.580]   You can have user groups that are in the tens of thousands
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.180]   rather than one or 2,000.
[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:41.440]   Suddenly you have a lot of data to work with
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:44.280]   in research and medicine, which we've never had before.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.360]   So when you look at devices like Fitbits and Jawbone Ups
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:49.400]   and things like this, Misfit Shine,
[00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.000]   they're pretty limited in what they can do,
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   but we have to remember these are generation one devices.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.680]   So they're looking at our activity and our sleep,
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.320]   how much we walk, how much we move,
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.320]   how fast we move, things like that.
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:02.520]   Well, let's imagine now a generation two
[00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:06.040]   and a generation three device that can see exactly
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.600]   what we're eating and how many calories we're burning,
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.560]   our heart rate, our respiratory rate,
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:12.120]   our heart rate variability.
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:16.200]   Now we have a much richer data set that we can use
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:18.560]   to track people's health and come up with
[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.640]   really interesting correlations about health and wellness.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:24.000]   I think that's where it's eventually really, really going.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.800]   There's a couple of companies in the health sphere
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.800]   that are already doing this.
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:31.120]   There's a device called the Health Patch.
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:33.760]   It started out as something being used in hospitals.
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:35.880]   It's a little patch that you wear on your chest.
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:38.280]   It measures the same kind of things that Fitbits do,
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:41.800]   how much you walk, it has fall detection,
[00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:44.720]   which is just really a motion sensor,
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:46.760]   heart rate, breathing rate, things like that.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:48.320]   It also measures stress.
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.800]   So it takes some of the other data points that it has.
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.000]   It puts them into a stress algorithm
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.360]   and it measures your stress.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:56.480]   So what it did was it allowed hospitals
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:00.560]   who had patients post surgery or something like that.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:03.400]   They didn't really need to be in the hospital anymore.
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.360]   The doctors wanted to send them out,
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.960]   but the hospital really wanted to continue monitoring
[00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:09.080]   their vital signs.
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.680]   So with a health patch, you stick this thing on a person,
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:13.280]   you send them on their way,
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.920]   and the doctors still get a notification
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:18.800]   if something changes that we need to have
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:20.040]   some medical intervention.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.160]   - Is this time to a phone?
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:24.640]   What is, it must be Bluetooth to a phone now?
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:26.440]   - Yeah, it does have Bluetooth.
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:28.200]   I think it's going to a mobile phone.
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:32.120]   I think it can also go through a Hippo compliant network,
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.920]   via Wi-Fi to the back of the hospital.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.880]   Now I noticed they have FDA approval,
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.840]   and I know that Apple did not get FDA approval
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:41.120]   for similar capabilities in the Apple Watch.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:44.000]   I wonder if that's the point of research kit is to get...
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.200]   - Remember that this is Generation 1 stuff.
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.840]   I mean, this takes years and years and years
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:48.840]   to develop and get it right.
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:51.000]   I think the tech industry has gone for it.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.080]   Innovation, right?
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.280]   Like the push to do things faster.
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:55.880]   And anytime I've talked to companies
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.640]   who are working in health, they say like,
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:00.120]   oh, the FDA, they have really strict rules
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.880]   and regulations in the United States.
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:02.720]   - Hopefully so.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:03.720]   - And they're not doing that.
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.080]   Yes, exactly.
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.760]   But they have to clear those hurdles,
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:08.320]   they have to clear them well.
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.960]   And I think in my lifetime,
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:14.160]   we're definitely gonna see some really wonderful things happening.
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.080]   So the second point that I didn't really talk about,
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.960]   so one is this mass collection of data.
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:21.520]   The second point is if we have lots of data about ourselves,
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.920]   we can have what people are calling
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:26.320]   more personalized medicine, and often it's preventative.
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.480]   So let's say that in the last five years,
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.720]   I've tracked pretty much everything I've eaten,
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.840]   or at least a representative amount of food
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:36.160]   that I've eaten to get a sense of what I have day by day.
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:40.920]   The nutritional information that I consume.
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:43.200]   How much I walk, how much I move, how fast I move,
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.400]   what kind of intervals I do, what my heart rate does,
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.920]   how much sleep I get.
[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:48.440]   And now based on that,
[00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:50.800]   if I can get personalized information
[00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:54.560]   about what to do to say, lower the chances
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:57.920]   that I'm gonna develop arthritis in 20 years,
[00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:00.000]   that's gonna be really amazing.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.840]   So it's that preventative stuff that's very personalized
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:05.040]   because we have specific data about you,
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:07.160]   rather than data about 2,000 people,
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:09.600]   and we sort of know what happens with 2,000 people
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.480]   who follow X, Y, and Z.
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:15.440]   So I think, again, I think that's why companies
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.160]   like Fitbit and Jawbone know
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:19.120]   that this is gonna go somewhere else.
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:19.880]   - I agree with you.
[00:47:19.880 --> 00:47:24.000]   I think you nailed it because currently all health advice
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.960]   is based on a statistical model.
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:30.200]   Your chances are, but once it becomes personalized
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.960]   in that way, I think it could be so much more accurate.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:36.280]   We've talked about personal cancer drugs, for instance.
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:37.120]   - Yeah.
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:39.920]   - Drugs that analyze the genome of your cancer
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:42.920]   and instead of kind of mass
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:45.440]   and very dangerous chemotherapy,
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:47.560]   targeting that particular cancer
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:48.840]   with an appropriate drug.
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:51.880]   - Well, the Fitbits and Jawbones of the World Survive,
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.120]   I guess is my question.
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.960]   What, I'm curious as to why these companies keep on putting,
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:58.200]   you know, they put out products and they are--
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:00.040]   - Well, they're not gonna give up and go home.
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:01.120]   - But they're not gonna give up and go home.
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:05.960]   - And, you know, so what is their plan going forward?
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:08.240]   What do you think they should be doing at this point now
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:12.080]   that the Samsungs, the Googles, and the Apples of the World
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:13.520]   are all encroaching on their space?
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.800]   Should they be partnering or trying to get acquired?
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:17.800]   I'm really genuinely curious 'cause they're a lot of,
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.880]   this is a crowded, crowded industry.
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:21.800]   - Super crowded.
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:25.160]   - Jill, you're the expert.
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.640]   (laughs)
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:28.560]   - There may be some acquisitions,
[00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:30.040]   but I think they're also like,
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.760]   some of the companies that are making smart watches
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:34.440]   are definitely learning from the companies
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:36.280]   that are making the health and fitness devices
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:37.560]   and vice versa.
[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:39.440]   So that Garmin watch that I showed you earlier,
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:41.040]   it does smart notifications.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.960]   Like it works with iOS, it works with Android,
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:44.600]   you can get whatever notifications you want
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:46.480]   from your phone onto your wrist.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.440]   So Garmin knows people want that,
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:49.520]   people are interested in it,
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:52.440]   but Garmin has been doing this for a long, long time
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:53.360]   with runners watches.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.560]   So they're actually a very established company
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:57.960]   in the sense of knowing how to do the technology
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:00.760]   for measuring, not usually step count,
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:02.440]   that's something that's been newer to them,
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:04.600]   but your pace and your speed and your mileage
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:08.160]   when you run your bicycle or do any number of activities.
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:12.520]   I think right now we're still in the point
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:16.200]   where it's seen as a hobby, right?
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.880]   So that's, when that starts to change,
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:20.800]   I think that's when the market's really gonna shake up
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:23.720]   with either acquisitions or companies starting to partner
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:25.920]   with insurance companies and healthcare companies
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:27.000]   in places like that.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   I feel like to answer your question, Katie,
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.720]   it's always foolish in technology to assume,
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:37.240]   oh, here comes Apple or Samsung or Google,
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:38.800]   we might as well just give up,
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:41.720]   you just don't know where the winner is gonna come from.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:43.040]   It's true.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.320]   But you ask a very important question,
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:47.520]   which is where should you focus to attempt
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:48.440]   to become that winner?
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:52.000]   And I'm sure the fact that there's a diversity of choices,
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.320]   I don't think it's gonna come from a company,
[00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:56.200]   frankly like Garmin, because they've been around too long.
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:59.880]   I think it's gonna be an innovation out of nowhere.
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:01.200]   But who knows, right?
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:06.480]   That's what's exciting about covering technology.
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:08.640]   Garmin's doing interesting because they're a GPS,
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:09.880]   and this is where they have a disadvantage.
[00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:13.080]   See, they have an incumbent, they have a business,
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:14.120]   they're a GPS company.
[00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:16.160]   Well, we'll put the GPS in the watch,
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.400]   and Apple says, well, how should we put the GPS in the watch?
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.080]   You already have it in your phone.
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:21.480]   - Right. - We need to tie the watch
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:22.560]   to the phone. - But my mother's
[00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:23.640]   won't like to over- - Runners don't wanna
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:24.960]   carry a phone, I know.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:26.720]   - Yeah. - But that's one small group,
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:27.720]   is Runners. - I was gonna say,
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:28.560]   that's one niche.
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:29.880]   I have to wonder for regular people,
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.440]   like I love my Fitbit, I love it,
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:33.280]   my mom loves Sir Fitbit, but I have to wonder
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.560]   if I'm gonna be using my Fitbit after I get my Apple watch.
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:37.120]   If I'm being honest, I'm probably not.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:38.160]   - Sure, 'cause it can be smarter,
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:40.520]   'cause it ties to a huge computer in your pocket.
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.120]   - Well, and usually my Fitbit,
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.760]   I've got my phone with me anyway,
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:46.320]   and so it's kind of doing that wireless sticky and stuff anyway.
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:48.360]   So I mean, I wear a pedal and I like it.
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:51.160]   It doesn't do all the health and fitness stuff
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:53.520]   I would wanna do, but if I can basically get everything
[00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.720]   in my Fitbit, my Apple watch,
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:57.760]   I kind of don't know why I would bother
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.000]   wearing the Fitbit as well.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.040]   I mean, maybe if I was just doing a dedicated run
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:05.040]   and I didn't want to have a phone with me,
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:08.160]   but otherwise, I think for a lot of people,
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:10.520]   the activity tracker market disappears
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:13.360]   if you buy into the idea that most of us
[00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.520]   will be wearing smart watches,
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:17.040]   and that may or may not be true, but I do wonder,
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:20.200]   I mean, but obviously those two worlds are blurring so much
[00:51:20.200 --> 00:51:22.880]   that I think that outside of certain niches,
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:27.760]   it does become a thing where they kind of overlap
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.440]   to the point that you don't need both.
[00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:32.040]   - But would it be smart and would it preserve you
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:34.920]   if you perhaps worked with HealthKit?
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:35.920]   - Yeah.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:38.840]   - And so now you're gonna be a specific sensor
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:41.400]   for a larger ecosystem of sensors.
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.440]   Apple will get involved,
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:45.240]   but you still can survive as an individual.
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:46.680]   Maybe that's the way.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:48.320]   - Yeah, Apple Health is just not great.
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:50.560]   Like let's acknowledge that first of all,
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:52.560]   it is not great, it's very difficult to use,
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:54.400]   it's very confusing.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:58.600]   Fitbit does integrate with a lot of other devices and apps,
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:02.400]   and I think that's part of, right now, for me anyway,
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.640]   part of the decision factor about which device
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.000]   somebody might wanna buy.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.400]   The other thing, of course, is price.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:09.480]   So if you already have a smartphone,
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:12.000]   which most people do,
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   you can spend 350 to $10,000 on an Apple watch,
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.960]   or maybe if all you really want
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:20.720]   is something that's gonna track your runs,
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.400]   track your walking every day,
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.440]   you can find a device for $99 that's gonna do that.
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:27.040]   That's a much more attractive option.
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:28.680]   So I like having a lot of options,
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.040]   and it kinda reminds me actually,
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:31.360]   before the show started, Leo,
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.480]   you were talking about Mircat,
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:35.480]   and like, oh, it doesn't have all the features,
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:37.800]   you can't save your videos locally.
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:40.240]   Well, I think what Mircat is doing,
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:42.240]   which is kind of similar to what we were just talking about,
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:45.640]   is they're offering one set of options, right?
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.200]   So there are people who say,
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:50.800]   okay, the kind of live streaming that I'm doing,
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.520]   I don't wanna save those videos.
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:54.480]   I see this as an ephemeral experience.
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.920]   I see this as a here and now, quick and dirty,
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.320]   sort of be the thrill of the moment, right?
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:01.320]   So I don't want those other features.
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:03.960]   And I like when the landscape
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:07.720]   of a particular tech device or service plays out like that,
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:09.520]   where people have lots of options,
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:14.160]   and not everybody's offering the same exact feature package.
[00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.200]   - It's funny that you should say that,
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.120]   because one of the reasons we were talking about Mircat,
[00:53:17.120 --> 00:53:19.240]   we just concluded an interview with its founder, Ben Rubin,
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:21.360]   which will be on tomorrow's triangulation.
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:22.720]   And that's exactly what he said.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.040]   He said, there are all these verticals.
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:28.880]   We're in one vertical, the stream, he had a name for it,
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:31.600]   but that that's just one of many, and there will be many.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:35.640]   And he welcomed a variety of apps
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:37.160]   in this domain of live streaming,
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:38.640]   because there's many different ways to do it,
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:41.720]   and you're right, some people don't want it to be preserved.
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:45.520]   Do watch that interview, it was great with Ben Rubin.
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:47.720]   That'll be on tomorrow's triangulation.
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.280]   All right, talking Barbie coming up in just a second.
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:52.200]   We're having a lot of fun.
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:56.120]   The panel today, Jill Duffy from PCMag,
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:00.640]   Jill E. Duffy on Twitter, Katie Benner from Bloomberg View,
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:02.520]   and Christina Warren from Mashable.
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:04.520]   Great to have all three of you on.
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:07.080]   Our show today brought to you by Go To Meeting from Citrix,
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:11.800]   the powerfully simple way to meet the coworkers and clients
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.760]   and the convenience of your computer,
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:16.920]   or your smartphone, or your tablet.
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:18.960]   It's kind of like Meerkat for Business, really.
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:21.920]   Share the same screen, see each other face to face
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:23.720]   with HD video conferencing.
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:26.680]   You don't need to travel anymore to hold a meeting.
[00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:29.360]   You can use your iPad, you can use your iPhone,
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:31.000]   your Android device to meet clients,
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.720]   to meet coworkers online.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:34.280]   It's so great to start a meeting,
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:35.640]   it's so easy to start a meeting,
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:37.520]   and then you have the capability,
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:39.240]   you can share your screen,
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.800]   you can hear the audio from the computer,
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:43.280]   the microphone on the tablet.
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:45.800]   If you want to see each other,
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:48.080]   almost everything that has a webcam,
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:51.640]   you just turn it on, HD quality looks fabulous.
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:53.320]   It's flexible, it's easy,
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:55.960]   and you don't have to,
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:57.520]   if you want a client, for instance,
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:58.680]   you're gonna make a presentation of client,
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:54:59.960]   you don't have to make them jump through hoops,
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:01.960]   they don't have to have a Go To Meeting account or anything.
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:03.720]   They click the link, it's easy to create an email,
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:06.120]   they click the link, software downloads in just,
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:07.320]   you know, about 30 seconds,
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:08.720]   and suddenly they're seeing you,
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:10.480]   they're seeing your PowerPoint presentation,
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:12.280]   it's really kind of amazing.
[00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:14.360]   A great way to get work done in business,
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:17.640]   and I want you to try it today for 30 days free,
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:19.520]   all you have to do is visit GoToMeeting.com
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:21.120]   and click that try it free button.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:24.160]   If I had my choice, I wouldn't have any,
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:26.120]   I would only have Go To Meeting meetings,
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:28.360]   I wouldn't have any in person meetings anymore at all.
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:30.280]   Just, it's so much easier, it's so fast,
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:31.280]   you get the job done.
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:34.480]   Go toMeeting.com, click the try it free button,
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:35.880]   30 days free,
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:38.880]   Go To Meeting, Citrix.
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:41.240]   So a couple of weeks ago,
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:42.880]   actually more like a few months ago,
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:45.040]   I interviewed a guy named Orin Jacob,
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:47.800]   he is at Toy Talk,
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:50.440]   and they have a really interesting iPad app,
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:52.120]   actually they have several of them,
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:57.640]   that their experience has been that toddlers
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:59.640]   are now interacting with their iPad
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:02.440]   in a very interesting way.
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:04.800]   These apps have characters on screen,
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:08.880]   cartoon characters who ask open-ended questions
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:10.560]   of the toddler,
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:12.280]   and then the toddler responds,
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:13.240]   it's kind of like Eliza,
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:15.560]   and then the conversation continues.
[00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:17.440]   They have on their website some editors picks,
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:19.640]   they've got parental permission to put these
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:21.080]   on their website at toytalk.com.
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.560]   Here's an example of a character.
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:26.200]   - It's so good to sing sometimes, doesn't it?
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:28.560]   Come on, you listen patiently to me,
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:29.760]   now you sing something.
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:33.800]   - So that's a Loch Ness Monster character on the screen.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:34.640]   - Oh, it feels so cool.
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:36.120]   - I can't pause it, but I'll let it go through again.
[00:56:36.120 --> 00:56:39.280]   That is asking the child to sing,
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.240]   and listen to what happens.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.680]   - Well, here it goes.
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:47.040]   You need the friend, you need the friend,
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:48.720]   I will help you out.
[00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:51.440]   If you try to get me out.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:53.080]   - Now these are recordings that...
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.560]   - I'll help you out as much as I can.
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:57.960]   You need the friend, you need your friend, you need...
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:57:00.280]   - I've talked to parents who use this software on their iPad,
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:02.880]   they say the kid takes it, goes off in a corner,
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:06.000]   and it's like talking to the iPad.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.200]   Here's another one.
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:09.160]   - You cannot just fall in love,
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:11.400]   but that you can also fall out of love,
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:15.160]   like it is a nest or the mouth of a younger predator.
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:17.440]   And she says that I am having to think of ways
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:19.680]   to keep our love from falling out of her heart,
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:21.160]   or her heart from...
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:22.480]   - Every duty stuff.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:23.320]   - Out of...
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:25.400]   It's all very confusing, Sukiper.
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:27.840]   Please, tell me what I must do
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:30.560]   so that nobody falls out of love.
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:31.480]   For a fun girl.
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:33.960]   - You must be very kind to her.
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:35.600]   And bring her gifts now and then.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:38.600]   And remember her important dates, like...
[00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.440]   This is a kid.
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:41.720]   So the reason I bring this up,
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:44.800]   New York Times article today in the Sunday Times Toy Talk
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:49.800]   is creating a Barbie that will talk back to kids.
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:52.120]   There's Orr and Jacob right there.
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:53.120]   Fascinating.
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:56.360]   What they're saying is that kids today,
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:58.000]   not high school kids, younger kids,
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.800]   are used to talking to their gadgets
[00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:01.080]   and them talking back.
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:03.440]   This is part of how they have grown up.
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:05.640]   So for them, the idea of a Barbie
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:06.600]   that can have a conversation,
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:08.440]   this is not a pull the string.
[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:09.720]   Feed me, feed me Barbie.
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:12.040]   This is a Barbie that will have a conversation,
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:13.960]   like Siri will, it will analyze the speech
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:16.120]   and produce relevant responses.
[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:18.440]   Hello Barbie is a Wi-Fi enabled Barbie,
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:20.680]   which comes out this fall.
[00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:21.520]   What do you think?
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:24.920]   - I love it and I hate it.
[00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:25.840]   On the one hand, I love it.
[00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:26.960]   No, no, no, hear me out.
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:28.360]   So on the one hand, I really like it
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:30.320]   because I think that it makes sense
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:31.760]   for the way kids play with toys, right?
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:34.040]   They talk to them and they have these conversations
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:35.560]   and they be able to have a toy
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:37.480]   and have this smart interactivity
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:39.240]   where you can get intelligent things back.
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:40.320]   I would have loved this as a kid.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:41.600]   I think that's awesome.
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:43.400]   The thing that concerns me,
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:44.760]   and I know this is a weird thing,
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:47.280]   but in their privacy policy,
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:48.720]   basically because they record the data,
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.800]   the parents have permission to go through
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:53.000]   and listen to everything that the kid has told.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.280]   - And by the way, that's where we get these recordings
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:56.160]   from as their parents.
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.800]   - Right, and exactly.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:00.840]   And I don't know, there's something creepy to me
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:03.400]   about the fact that if I'm a kid
[00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:04.680]   and I'm talking to my toy,
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:07.440]   that my parents could be spying on me
[00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:08.520]   and listening to what I'm saying.
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:09.760]   I mean, on the one hand, I understand
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:11.600]   you want things for safety and precaution.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:12.440]   But on the other hand,
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:14.720]   like sometimes kids talk to their toys about things.
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:16.480]   They might not want to talk to their parents about.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:18.640]   And I don't know, I'm thinking back to me,
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:20.120]   if I were a little girl,
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:21.400]   if I would have wanted my parents
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:22.960]   to know everything I did with my Barbie dolls.
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:24.280]   To be perfectly honest,
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:26.040]   no, I wouldn't have wanted them to know.
[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:29.960]   - Didn't you, with your Barbie dolls have conversations,
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:30.800]   you would talk to them,
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:33.080]   but Barbie would talk to Ken.
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:35.160]   - Yes, I'd hire soap operas.
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:37.120]   I would recreate more of those places with my Barbie dolls
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:37.960]   all the time.
[00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:39.960]   I would recreate like the young other rest of us
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:41.680]   in more of those places with my Barbie dolls.
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:43.640]   And we'd have full conversations
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:45.720]   and love triangles the whole works.
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:48.080]   I don't know if I would have wanted my parents to know
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:50.000]   that what I was doing at nine years old
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.640]   was making my Barbie dolls have sex with each other
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:54.080]   and still each other's boyfriends.
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:55.960]   I don't know if I would have that.
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:56.800]   I'm just being honest,
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:57.800]   I don't know if I would have been a little girl.
[00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:58.880]   - I'm glad they know it now.
[00:59:58.880 --> 00:59:59.880]   (laughing)
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:02.680]   - But they don't care now.
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:04.280]   But at the time, you know.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.080]   - It's time I had a freaked out.
[01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:06.920]   - Exactly.
[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:09.440]   And it was just like healthy expression of me,
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.800]   living out my goal of being a TV writer or something.
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.560]   And so I don't know.
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.800]   I love it, but I am a little concerned
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.040]   with the privacy policy,
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.040]   which I know they're doing for the right reasons,
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:22.920]   but I'm kind of concerned with the idea
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.560]   that the parents can just kind of listen
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.640]   to everything their kids are doing with their toys.
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.520]   To me, that kind of, I don't know.
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.840]   That's my only quantity.
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:30.800]   - Can I just say as a parent,
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.480]   I would often sneak into the room and listen anyway.
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.320]   (laughing)
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:35.160]   - That's a good point.
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:36.160]   - We just didn't have the capabilities
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.960]   that modern technology gives us
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.680]   to bug our children 24/7.
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.320]   Here's hello, Barbie.
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.120]   Now, one thing, Barbie's been in trouble before
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.680]   for saying things like math is hard.
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.200]   Let's hope that they've gone beyond that.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:50.160]   - Do you love the York, do you?
[01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:51.000]   - Hey.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.680]   - Tell me what your favorite part about the city.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:55.320]   The food, the diet, and the site.
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:56.720]   - Food, fashion, our site's food.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.040]   - Food.
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.920]   - We like the food and the restaurants.
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:02.360]   - Wow, so this Barbie is working
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.960]   for the New York City tour in the world.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.800]   (laughing)
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:05.800]   - Seriously.
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.040]   - What's your favorite food?
[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:08.160]   - Favorite food.
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:12.120]   - So not every kid, this is not appropriate for every kid,
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:16.800]   but there are kids who have difficulty communicating.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:18.800]   - You have to take me to try a weirdo-doubt.
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.680]   - I think that this could be successful,
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:24.480]   and I'm sure there'll be kids who love it.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:27.480]   But it sort of falls into that uncanny valley territory
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:28.480]   for winter, which kind of does.
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:31.000]   - Things are just a little bit off, but you don't know why.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.840]   I mean, we had like Simon Says,
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:34.200]   is that what that thing was called?
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.200]   We've had toys that have talked before,
[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.400]   and at the end of the day for most kids,
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.400]   the great thing about being a kid
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:40.640]   is your imagination's really rich,
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:43.600]   and so your play time is much more interesting,
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:46.360]   exciting with like, inanimate stuffed animals and stuff.
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:47.200]   - That's actually true.
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.040]   - Because you can really,
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:50.160]   'cause my mom runs a daycare center,
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.040]   so I've watched little kids a lot
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:53.440]   in the way they play.
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:55.000]   - And they'll play with a machine for a while,
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:55.880]   and it's great,
[01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.000]   but the most interesting conversations they have,
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.200]   and the ones where you see them really engrossed,
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:01.960]   is when they're using their imaginations
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:04.360]   to make up scenarios that they control,
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:05.480]   and that they have fun with,
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:07.440]   whether it's alone or with friends or with toys.
[01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:08.280]   So I--
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:10.600]   - Let me quote Natasha Singer's article in The New York Times,
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:13.600]   a recent study conducted by researchers at Georgetown,
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:15.080]   compared two groups of toddlers.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:17.120]   One group played with plush toys
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:20.480]   that have been pre-programmed to say the child's name,
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.400]   and to say that they had the same favorite food
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.040]   and song as the child.
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:27.560]   The other played with plush toys that called each child, pal.
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:30.040]   Hey, pali!
[01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:31.360]   And they like different things.
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.880]   With the same toy character on screen,
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.640]   presented math skills,
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:37.960]   so they had the character then on screen
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:40.280]   presenting math skills like arranging cups
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:41.160]   in order of size.
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.440]   The first group of toddlers,
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:44.320]   the ones addressed by name,
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:47.240]   performed better than those addressed as pal.
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:48.640]   (laughs)
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.480]   - Sure, that's hilarious.
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.520]   My sister used to think that Mr. Rogers
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:53.600]   was talking directly to her.
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:54.880]   - Yeah!
[01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:57.040]   - She thought that she was his television friend.
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.040]   She thought that he was actually talking directly
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:02:59.880]   to her through the television.
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.160]   - That was actually the secret,
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:03.520]   I think one of the secrets to his success
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.480]   was he looked right at the camera and said,
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:07.080]   "Hey, friend, how are you today?"
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:08.720]   - I mean, she literally thought that she was
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.560]   his television friend that he was talking just to her.
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:13.200]   And I think it was probably once she discovered
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.720]   that reruns were a thing,
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:15.560]   but she figured out--
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:16.400]   - Wait a minute!
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.080]   - You said the same thing last week.
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:19.200]   - Right, right, right.
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:22.200]   I was never under any illusions that it was not television,
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:24.600]   but I did think Big Bird was human
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.120]   because he slept in a bed.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.840]   So that was my thing,
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:29.400]   is that I thought, well, of course,
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.440]   if he's sleeping in a bed,
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.240]   then he must be a real human.
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:36.040]   But no, I mean, I think that there is something
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.000]   to be said for having this personalization,
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.160]   but I think Katie's point is great.
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:40.440]   My mom's a child psychologist.
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:41.520]   She was retired now.
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.680]   And yeah, the way kids play with things,
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:47.120]   and I've observed a little bit of that.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.960]   Yeah, they tend to be a lot more verbal
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:51.320]   and get a lot more of their playthings done
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.680]   when they can create the stories.
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:54.560]   But when it comes to learning things,
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.040]   that's, I think, maybe where it's different.
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.560]   If you can customize it and personalize it more,
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:03:59.880]   the kid might be more engaged
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:02.000]   and more willing to go through the exercises
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.480]   and retain what's happening
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:04.920]   if they feel like they're part of it,
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:07.720]   rather than just, "Hiya, Sunny, hiya, pal."
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:09.320]   - "Pow, it's not a good choice."
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:10.840]   - "Pow, it's probably not a good choice."
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:13.480]   - "Hey, pal, how you doing?"
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:14.280]   A couple of weeks ago,
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.680]   the campaign for commercial free childhood
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:18.360]   and advocacy group in Boston
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:21.360]   asked Betell to shelve talking Barbie,
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:24.520]   saying the voice recordings amounted to eavesdropping
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.160]   and could be used to exploit
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.720]   the intimate feelings of children.
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:30.760]   Whatever the child says will be manipulated
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:33.000]   and used to insinuate these dolls
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.400]   further into girls' lives,"
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:36.920]   said Susan Linde, the group's director.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:40.960]   So anyway, what half the technology brought?
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:43.520]   At least Barbie can be a computer engineer.
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:45.280]   - Oh.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:47.920]   - Ah, don't get us started.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:48.960]   - That book was terrible.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.720]   - I know, but it was fun to laugh at.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.880]   All right, Google says it's not giving up on Google Glass.
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:57.040]   Eric Schmidt says the demise of glass
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:00.080]   has been greatly exaggerated.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:03.480]   - You're so full of it.
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:04.560]   - You think?
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:06.240]   - Yes, I do, completely.
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.560]   If it comes out again, they're not calling it Google Glass.
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:10.880]   And for one reason, one reason only, glass holes.
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.920]   - Glass holes.
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:14.600]   - The branding alone, if they do come,
[01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:16.160]   and I'm not saying that they won't come out
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:19.200]   with something new in that space, and it evolved from it.
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:21.120]   But you can almost guarantee that it will have
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:22.720]   brand new branding, because the current branding
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.560]   is just toxic.
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:24.400]   - Bring it.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.800]   - Now, they've run in Tony Fadel to oversee it.
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:29.840]   So, I mean, Fadel's of course the guy designed the iPod,
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.360]   went on to design the Nest thermostat, was acquired.
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.000]   His company was acquired by Google.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.960]   He's now overseeing strategy for glass.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.640]   That indicates that glass is not dead.
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.800]   - Yeah, sure that a lot of people are looking at a VR
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.240]   and kind of augmented reality.
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:44.680]   I mean, if they weren't looking into the space,
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:45.880]   it would be surprising.
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:47.840]   But I think that the idea that glass,
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.240]   the way that it's been presented,
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:51.000]   will continue on that level.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.360]   I mean, I have to think that Tony probably took,
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:56.600]   and I've only talked to him a couple of times,
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.000]   but I have to think he would take one look
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.400]   at the whole scenario and just go,
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:00.480]   "Okay, we're starting over.
[01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.400]   "We're starting over from the drawing board
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:05.880]   "because this doesn't work from a perspective
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:07.520]   "of people who are not embracing this.
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:08.800]   "It doesn't look good.
[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:10.200]   "It creeps people out.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:13.000]   "We attract the wrong type of early adopters.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.520]   "Let's try a completely different approach."
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.760]   - To me, glass is not a consumer experience.
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:23.160]   Glass is a brilliant and wonderful industrial device.
[01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:27.520]   So when you have it being used on oil rigs or in hospitals.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.360]   - Sure.
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:30.560]   - Places where people have a limited amount of ability
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:34.160]   to use their hands, like, it's so brilliant.
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:35.000]   - It is.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:35.840]   - I think--
[01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:37.400]   - Is it a hollow lens better than glass, though,
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:39.880]   the Microsoft augmented reality?
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:40.720]   - Maybe.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:41.560]   - It could be.
[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:42.400]   It could be.
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:43.240]   I think it's a little--
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.080]   - I feel like that's the one I want.
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:44.920]   - Yeah.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:46.200]   - So glass is really, let's face it,
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:48.920]   all glass is a monitor over your eyebrow.
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:49.760]   - Right.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:51.760]   - But it could be awesome in industrial situations
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.600]   in medicine.
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.160]   But in that case, I mean, you have a lot of people
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:55.000]   who are doing that,
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.840]   Epson's doing some amazing things with that sort of stuff.
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.680]   There are a lot of healthcare companies involved.
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:02.080]   - But augment in reality, I can look through,
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:05.640]   I can add a user interface or instructions
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.040]   to what I'm actually looking at.
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.880]   So if I'm on an oil rig and I'm trying to learn
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:12.080]   how to do something, it can actually show me
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:16.200]   with a little arrow, turn this knob, push this button.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:20.640]   I feel like augmented reality is what glass should end up being.
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.440]   - Sure, those products are still nascent.
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:24.880]   So I mean, what people will want is yet to be seen.
[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:28.800]   It's the thing that's so funny about the Google announcement
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:31.160]   is that consumers have already voted, they don't want it.
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:32.600]   - Yeah, that's pretty obvious.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:33.600]   - That's over.
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:36.440]   - And everybody I know who spent the money on glass
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:38.040]   is put it in a drawer anyway.
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:40.200]   - Yeah, one of the things I'm interested in
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:42.040]   that I think Apple Watch actually might be able
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:45.120]   to do is the sense of adding tactile experiences
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:46.560]   into our smart devices.
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:50.320]   So if your Apple Watch could, through a series of like taps
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:54.480]   and sort of suggestion motions, give you directions
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.840]   so that we're not relying only on our eyes
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.440]   or only on our ears, I think that's the more interesting
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:00.280]   music you can do.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.120]   - I think it's gonna do that.
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:02.240]   - It's a little bit less invasive too.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.240]   People don't wanna wear glass on their face
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.080]   and you don't wanna be staring at a phone all the time
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:09.960]   and you don't wanna have headphones on all the time.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:13.880]   - I think there are more ways to incorporate smart information
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:16.920]   that we're just not quite taking advantage of yet.
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:20.320]   - It's a specialized use but it was a really eye-opener
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:23.120]   when I was wearing Android Wear and we were in London
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:25.360]   and I had asked my phone for directions somewhere
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.600]   and then the Wear Watch takes over and shows you,
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.680]   it even buzzes you when it's time to turn.
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:32.600]   So it shows you where you are, it says turn left here.
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.560]   That is incredible.
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:37.240]   - Yeah, I think that's actually one of the great use cases
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:39.920]   for a watch and that's how I've actually gotten people
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.120]   excited, it's funny you say that about the idea
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:43.760]   of the Apple Watch or smart watches in general.
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:46.520]   It's when I tell them about, I use my pebble the same way
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.880]   for directions finding nearby train stops
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:51.560]   or buzzing when to turn and I think the glass,
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:53.200]   actually that was my favorite part of using glass
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.760]   was for any of the direction of things,
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:55.880]   kind of the overlay.
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:57.400]   So we'll see.
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:00.200]   - We're gonna take a break.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.000]   When we come back I still wanna do the FTC story
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   about Google and we have to talk about F8,
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.560]   Facebook's Developer Conference which I don't know,
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.680]   felt like kind of a dud but maybe you found some
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:13.560]   wonderful things, little gems in there.
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.600]   Christina Warren from Mashables here,
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:18.000]   Katie Benner from Bloomberg View
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.280]   and from PC Magazine Jill Duffy,
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:22.480]   great to have all three of you here today.
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:25.080]   I have been playing with my little bits
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:27.840]   and I've got to say it's fabulous.
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:29.280]   So glad to see little bits again.
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:31.440]   We were talking a lot about it during the holidays,
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:34.360]   perfect Christmas gift for people with kids
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:37.320]   and you know, one of the things I think is so important
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:38.880]   as consumers of electronics,
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:42.080]   as consumers of technology to kind of get kids turned on
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:43.960]   to the idea that they can do it too,
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:46.320]   that they can be makers.
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:48.040]   But sometimes especially for little fingers,
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:50.440]   things like soldering, that's a little scary,
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.560]   little bits is so cool.
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:54.920]   It's taking electronics design and creation
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:57.800]   out of the hands of experts and giving it to everyone.
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:00.440]   For kids, even for parents, for kids at heart,
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.240]   for coders, hardware hackers,
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.840]   with little bits you could do anything.
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:08.440]   Get your dog to send a text or make a robotic snack server
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:11.640]   and the nice things is it's so simple.
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:13.800]   There's no soldering involved.
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:16.120]   This is a little bits kit.
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:18.520]   We've made a few, last time we had them all,
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:20.120]   I actually made a little bits,
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:21.520]   we got a good one this time.
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.280]   Oh, look at all the little bits here.
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:25.800]   These all snap together magnetically.
[01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:27.600]   So there's no soldering involved.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.600]   There's components, there's over 60 components
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:32.560]   to do a huge variety of projects.
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.640]   The little bits kit will come of course
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:38.600]   with instructions and a project guide.
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:40.960]   Connect battery and cable to blue module,
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:44.520]   turn it on, pink modules, effect modules after them,
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:47.160]   green modules do something in the physical world,
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.320]   and then give you some great projects.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:51.480]   If you've been thinking, I want to get an electronic,
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:54.960]   I remember Heathkit, as an old guy, I remember Heathkit.
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:57.920]   And I just think teaching kids how this stuff works,
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:02.120]   put it together, to teach them things about logic,
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:06.080]   about mechanical interaction is so great.
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:08.480]   They enjoy it, it's better than a Lego,
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:10.720]   an erector said, it's building something
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.240]   that really works.
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:14.880]   There are a variety of little bits kits.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:16.680]   There's the base kit or the deluxe kit.
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:18.560]   I think this must be the deluxe kit.
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:20.680]   This is so great here.
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:21.560]   Great way to get started.
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:24.920]   The space kit was developed in partnership with NASA.
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:26.920]   So they've got Earth and Space Science.
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:29.480]   There's an Arduino coding kit that lets you
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:30.560]   code the Arduino.
[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:33.760]   So if you want a child to get started in programming,
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:36.080]   I'll tell you, programming is so abstract,
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:38.880]   it's really great to have a physical output.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:40.080]   It is a great way to learn.
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:41.440]   For the tinkerer, the deluxe kit
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:44.040]   includes 18 modules that snap together
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:45.720]   with billions of circuits possible.
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.880]   No wiring, no soldering.
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:48.960]   You can make it in seconds.
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:51.720]   There's a synth kit if you're into music.
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:54.120]   It's a modular analog, oh, I love this idea.
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:57.200]   A modular analog synthesizer.
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:00.040]   Oscillators, filter, envelope, keyboard, micro-secret.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.600]   See, if you have a kit as interested in music,
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.680]   let's Henry is.
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:03.760]   And he's used Logic.
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.680]   But this is the best way to teach him
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.960]   what this stuff is actually doing.
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:11.800]   Little Bits is now offering customers $20 off your first kit.
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:15.240]   Go to Little Bits, L-I-T-T-L-E-B-I-T-S.
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:16.880]   Little Bits.
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.280]   No QT spelling on this.
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:20.320]   .com/twit.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:22.720]   You'll get free shipping in the US as well.
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.800]   And after you make something, send an Instagram
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:25.520]   off to Little Bits.
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.400]   I know we'd love to see it.
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:29.800]   Just an @Mr_loport.
[01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:31.280]   Now, I'll pass it along.
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:34.120]   I'd love to see your Little Bits creation.
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:37.600]   Little Bits, it's so cool.
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:38.120]   I don't know.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.040]   You guys are young.
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.920]   Maybe you had something like this when you were young.
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:41.720]   I would have loved this.
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:42.320]   This is--
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:43.120]   I would have loved this.
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:43.880]   Isn't this awesome?
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:46.120]   It's like a chemistry set.
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.280]   So fun.
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:50.240]   Have you played with this, Christina?
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:51.760]   I have not.
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:52.800]   But I love it.
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:52.800]   I love the--
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:53.480]   Isn't that great?
[01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:54.000]   The fact that--
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:54.800]   Art, do we know kit?
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:55.800]   That's just awesome.
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:56.800]   The fact that--
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:59.160]   I would have gone crazy for this as a kid.
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:03.440]   And if you want to see more, there's little bits.cc/upload,
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:05.520]   where you can see what people are creating.
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.640]   And there's some great tips.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:07.640]   They've really made it.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:08.960]   I remember when this started.
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:10.360]   It was a Kickstarter.
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:11.560]   Pretty sure it was a Kickstarter.
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:13.120]   And I invested at the very beginning.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.400]   And it was just getting started.
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:18.640]   This is like-- there's so much stuff now.
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.160]   It's such a rich experience.
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:21.720]   They say for ages eight to infinity.
[01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:24.280]   But I think if you're an adult and you have a younger smart
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:28.600]   kid, this would be fine for a six-year-old even.
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:29.560]   This is just incredible.
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:32.920]   This is the Deluxe Kit 18-bits modules,
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:36.280]   5 million combinations, 15 projects.
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.600]   A great way to start.
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:41.760]   $20 off at littlebits.com/twit.
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:45.000]   I think this is so cool.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.920]   A drinker bot.
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:50.520]   What does it do?
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:53.160]   It's a robotic drink mixer.
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.720]   What?
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:56.440]   A bot?
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:57.840]   For all your Shirley temples.
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:00.600]   Oh my goodness.
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:01.960]   Sometimes people--
[01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:04.960]   I love the creativity of human beings, I got to say.
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:05.880]   Just fabulous.
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:12.880]   Did any of you watch Zuckerberg or the others at F8?
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:14.040]   We streamed the keynote.
[01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:17.520]   As we got up early, streamed it on Wednesday and Thursday.
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:21.480]   And I just felt like there was nothing new.
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:24.040]   What about the internet and platform stuff?
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:26.760]   I mean, did you know anything that was interesting at all?
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:28.000]   Say again, Katie.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.640]   The internet of things platform stuff
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:31.760]   that they're doing with parse.
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:33.760]   Is that something that you guys think find interesting?
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.400]   It's such a huge trend.
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:38.280]   I don't really see how it fits in naturally of what Facebook
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:39.200]   does.
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:40.960]   Well, it is interesting.
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:44.960]   I mean, they've acquired Oculus Rift.
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:47.680]   Internet of Things is more of the same kind of--
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:53.560]   they almost feel like these are Googly kind of moonshot things.
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:55.200]   Yeah, I mean, I love parse.
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:56.520]   And I think that was interesting.
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:58.600]   I think as a way to kind of extend that, I think--
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:14:59.880]   What is parse?
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:02.520]   Parse is kind of their application,
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:05.160]   a kind of a services framework that lets people automate
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:07.600]   a lot of web apps and take care of a lot of details
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.600]   that they bought them a couple of years ago.
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.360]   And tons of different applications
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:13.680]   that aren't based on Facebook in any way
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:15.880]   use parse kind of their package stuff.
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:19.240]   And so by adding into kind of this internet of things stuff,
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:22.120]   it could kind of be a way to maybe help people
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:25.680]   build more IoT style support into their apps.
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:27.400]   I think that was interesting.
[01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:31.640]   But I don't know how they turned that into anything
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:34.760]   of their core business, but it's certainly interesting.
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:37.280]   It does feel like Facebook is trying to--
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:40.160]   just like Google is trying to reinvent itself constantly.
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:42.960]   You need to in this day and age.
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:44.880]   There's always the risk that somebody's going to come up.
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:47.800]   They're going to be my spaced, if that's all they did, right?
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:51.760]   That's true.
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:54.400]   It was interesting to me kind of comparing this F8
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:57.120]   to last F8, like how much things they announced
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:58.280]   last year didn't work.
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:15:59.360]   Like remember app links?
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:00.920]   We all thought that was going to be--
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:01.880]   they sold that.
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:04.560]   It was in 1,000 apps.
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.760]   I mean, so that was a complete fail.
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:08.400]   I thought their new ad platform thing
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.720]   with the they're going to be doing for mobile apps
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:12.040]   could potentially be disruptive.
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:14.200]   But yeah, I mean, there was--
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:17.640]   it's kind of nothing that interesting, I guess,
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:19.200]   to regular consumers.
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.200]   And a lot of the problems--
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:21.200]   Which is worth it.
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:21.760]   Which is worth it.
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:23.480]   And answering a bunch of stuff that doesn't happen
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:25.000]   doesn't work, doesn't go anywhere.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.920]   Or just kind of saying, well, try cars.
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:30.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:31.400]   That's true.
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:33.680]   That was like they didn't-- so one of the things they are
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:35.360]   changing, they're going to try to make Messenger.
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:37.040]   I think this is a total on-starter.
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:39.520]   Messenger, a platform.
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:41.280]   They want developers to write apps that
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.920]   integrate with Facebook Messenger.
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:48.400]   And they showed a couple of dumb apps
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:51.720]   that allow you to do kind of weird things in Facebook
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:54.160]   Messenger.
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:59.880]   It's just-- it's not compelling to me.
[01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:01.800]   And I wonder why anybody would even develop.
[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:04.480]   They do have 40 developers who have apps.
[01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:06.480]   Like they showed jibjab.
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:08.200]   So you can make a little jibjab video
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:10.360]   and then send it in Messenger.
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:13.640]   I can't imagine why anybody would spend any energy building
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:16.880]   on Facebook's platform at this point.
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:18.440]   And yet they're doing just fine.
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:20.280]   It's not like Facebook's in trouble or anything.
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:21.680]   Your stock price continues to go up.
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:25.440]   Nothing.
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.480]   This is exactly my reaction to FA.
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:28.800]   How about the Oculus Rift?
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.960]   Is this in good hands?
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:34.520]   Are they a good steward of virtual reality?
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:34.920]   Yeah.
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:37.000]   I mean, I think that they bought it with the understanding
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.600]   that this is going to be a long-term play
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:40.200]   and that they don't need to-- I mean, they're still
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:41.800]   showing off the same crescent bay demo
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:44.120]   that they've been showing off all year.
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:46.880]   And just kind of talking about kind of future scenarios
[01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:47.560]   and situations.
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:49.840]   I mean, I feel like, yeah, they picked a good company,
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.960]   the company that, at least for right now,
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:55.000]   doesn't have a whole lot of reason to really get involved,
[01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.640]   to stop them from doing anything moving forward.
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:01.120]   But I think that we're just so early with all this VR stuff
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:03.480]   that we don't really know what this scenario is going to be.
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.680]   So, you know, I mean, we didn't really
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:07.400]   get any new Oculus news.
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:09.520]   But I definitely feel like a year in Facebook
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:11.680]   has basically given them the money they need
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:14.280]   and the resources maybe to continue doing what they were
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:15.280]   already doing.
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:16.720]   But other than that, they've stayed out of it.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:18.120]   And frankly, as a fan of Oculus, I
[01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:20.480]   think that's been the best case scenario.
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:22.240]   So that's been good.
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:28.720]   They demonstrated kind of a 360 degree immersive video.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:34.160]   I guess we were going through a chinquetera in Italy.
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:36.200]   It requires 24 cameras.
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:39.080]   So this isn't something I'm going to do with my smartphone.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:40.920]   And it doesn't work with Oculus Rift.
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:45.000]   It's like-- sometimes I feel like they're just throwing stuff
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   against the wall.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:49.120]   I don't really get it.
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:50.440]   All right.
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:54.040]   Although, Instagram has a new app called Layout,
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:55.720]   that does exactly what it does in apps
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:57.480]   before it have done, frames--
[01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:01.040]   Including one called Layout.
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:02.040]   He's not happy.
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:02.680]   And I'm like, are you--
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:04.360]   Oh, I get not.
[01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:06.080]   But I mean, I feel for the guy at the same time,
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:07.240]   like, are you new?
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:07.740]   Yeah.
[01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:08.960]   He's been Sherlock.
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:09.840]   Yeah.
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.120]   Precisely, precisely.
[01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:13.720]   And this is not unique to Facebook.
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:16.080]   It's Sherlock-- is the perfect.
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.480]   That's exactly what it is.
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:19.560]   But yeah, I mean, I think the reason Facebook said
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.040]   that they did it, though, was really interesting.
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:23.960]   They said that something like one out of every six users
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:28.880]   uses a layout tool, to make photo collages.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:31.720]   That's a huge amount of--
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:32.840]   that's a huge percentage.
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:36.800]   And so yeah, absolutely Facebook needed to completely bring
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:38.440]   that in house and at least have an option.
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:42.480]   Because that many of your users are using a collage tool.
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:45.320]   I'm actually kind of curious why they didn't just build it
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:47.640]   into the app itself and made it a separate app.
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:50.560]   I would kind of guess, even though Facebook and Instagram
[01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:53.640]   are fond of doing the separate app philosophy,
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.360]   I wouldn't be surprised if at some point
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:58.120]   they just decided to merge the layout feature directly
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:19:59.160]   into Instagram itself.
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:01.240]   Because if that many of your users
[01:20:01.240 --> 01:20:04.160]   are first starting out with a collage tool, to me,
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:07.120]   that indicates that's probably an area where you could slip that
[01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:08.160]   into the main app.
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.720]   And you wouldn't have people getting upset.
[01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:13.400]   You might have even increased usage at that point.
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:17.160]   Yeah, the experience of taking a picture,
[01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:19.600]   not in Instagram, but starting outside of Instagram,
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:21.360]   going through one app into Instagram
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:23.200]   is not a great experience.
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:26.520]   It's just too fussy.
[01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:28.720]   Speaking of Oculus Rift, HTC has said,
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:31.920]   we are going to invite people to join our developer program
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:34.840]   and get a developer-ish edition for free.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:38.240]   Rift was charging $300 for its developer edition.
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:40.480]   A lot of people saw Vive at Mobile World Congress
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:43.080]   and raved about it.
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:46.320]   I guess the key at this point,
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:48.160]   you're in a race to get people to create content
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:49.400]   for these things.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:51.200]   Right, which is the hard thing, right?
[01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:53.200]   Like, that's going to be the challenge.
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:54.760]   I think, you know, at this point,
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:57.040]   Oculus has sucked most of the energy out of the room.
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:59.880]   So that's probably what HTC has to do
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:00.800]   to get people interested.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:03.120]   They need to give those things away to developers
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:05.840]   because otherwise, why would they want to bother
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:10.200]   and already the Oculus ecosystem is sort of fragmented
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:12.720]   when you talk about the difference between Oculus Rift
[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:16.480]   and then the Samsung Oculus-based platforms,
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:17.480]   which are different.
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:21.000]   You know, it's already getting sort of fragmented.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.400]   So I must surprise it all at the HTC and Steam.
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.520]   We're like, yes, please sign up
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:26.680]   and we will give you one of these.
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:28.280]   Sony has its own.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:30.880]   It has the best name, Project Morpheus.
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:33.440]   Yes. Definitely the best name.
[01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:36.320]   Of course, the Matrix.
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:40.040]   And they've been giving development kits out since last year.
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:42.800]   Sony has said it's interesting.
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.280]   They told Polygon about a year ago.
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:45.280]   We don't want people to think,
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:48.600]   how can I port this game to virtual reality or VR?
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.560]   We want people to think what unique thing
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:51.920]   can we do with this tech?
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:54.680]   And to that end, well, you know, as I mentioned,
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:56.480]   we talked to Ben Rubin at Mirkat
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:57.840]   and he didn't want to go into details,
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:00.840]   but he was very excited about this idea
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:02.440]   of live streaming virtual reality.
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:03.840]   In a way, Mirkat kind of is,
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:07.000]   it takes you into somebody's life in an interesting way,
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.960]   but it's a very constrained little people
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:11.000]   into their life.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.800]   Wouldn't it be amazing if it could be a VR experience?
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:15.640]   Yeah.
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:16.600]   I would go for that.
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:18.840]   If I could, you know, so one of the things
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:20.960]   people do a lot with Mirkat, I've done it quite a bit,
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:23.480]   is you Mirkat while you're driving.
[01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:27.720]   And it'd be so cool if you could be in the passenger seat
[01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:30.080]   looking around, talking to somebody
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:32.400]   while they're Mirkatting, that would be interesting.
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:34.600]   You'd look like a dork.
[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:38.800]   And you'd have to have a giant camera.
[01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:41.080]   I don't know what those camera rigs look like, but.
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:42.360]   There's this analogy.
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:43.960]   I mean, this is sort of a larger issue,
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:46.640]   but there's an analogy about technology development
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:50.880]   and the rollout of electricity to different countries.
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:54.440]   So in the United States, when electricity was first being
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:57.800]   brought into people's houses, it was called like your light bill.
[01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:59.880]   It was for powering lights.
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:01.680]   And that's what we used it for.
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:06.000]   And we made it very, very cheap and very accessible
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.080]   to get electricity into people's homes and businesses.
[01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:12.760]   So that allowed people to experiment with other ways
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:14.440]   we could use electricity.
[01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:16.640]   And of course, I mean, you know, from there,
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:19.760]   the whole 20th century happened.
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:23.040]   So the same analogy is being made with the internet.
[01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:27.600]   So countries that have fiber optic and really high speed
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:30.120]   fast internet available to people's homes,
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:33.240]   allows them to tinker and think about what can we do
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:37.240]   with this access that maybe we're not imagining right now.
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:39.360]   And there's a lot of critics in the United States
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:41.160]   who are saying, you know, the caps that we have
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:43.040]   on our internet speed is just ridiculous.
[01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:45.280]   And it's preventing innovation from happening.
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:48.080]   And so it just kind of reminds me when you're talking about
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:51.040]   like trying to think and experiment with Oculus Rift
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:53.040]   in a new way, what else can we do with VR
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:54.240]   that we haven't thought of yet?
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:55.880]   It's sort of similar to that.
[01:23:55.880 --> 01:23:59.920]   It's like we need to give people unfettered mega access
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:02.920]   and let them play in a sandbox.
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:04.600]   - They never show.
[01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:06.640]   And I was a little mad at Facebook during, by the way,
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:08.640]   they were completely wasted there.
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:10.240]   Their second day keynote, which could have been
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:12.080]   about Oculus Rift and instead the chief scientist
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:14.480]   did a lot of optical illusions.
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:17.640]   Everybody in the world has seen a hundred times.
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.520]   But what they could have done, and I would like to have seen,
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.440]   is the camera.
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:23.000]   What do you need?
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:28.000]   'Cause forget the headset, that's what you use to consume it.
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:30.640]   What does it take to make it?
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.200]   'Cause that's what you gotta get people doing,
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:34.200]   is doing innovative things with making it.
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:35.320]   Is it a giant thing?
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:36.160]   Is it a little thing?
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:37.920]   I don't, have they talked about that?
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:41.400]   If I could buy a little camera that I put right here
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:43.600]   that will allow you to be in the studio with us,
[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:45.400]   I would be very interested in doing that.
[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:48.120]   For instance, there it is.
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:49.760]   Is that it?
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:50.840]   What are you showing me?
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:54.120]   - It's a rig you could get where you have like a
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:56.200]   16 GoPros or something, and then you could stitch it
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:57.040]   all together.
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:58.680]   Okay, that's not gonna work.
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:24:59.520]   - That's crazy.
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:05.120]   - I wish they would talk about the creation tools.
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:06.440]   It's so funny in the developer kit,
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:09.960]   they give you the consumer tool, but not the creation tool.
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:13.040]   I mean, I don't think creating software is really the solution.
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:16.080]   I feel this is a rich camera, let me Google that.
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:19.720]   All right, let's talk, let's see.
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:22.320]   Oh, I guess you don't need a big elaborate camera.
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:26.640]   Here's a stereo camera.
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:28.120]   I guess all you need is two.
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:30.880]   It's 159 bucks.
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:36.320]   So you really need only two cameras, right?
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:40.360]   But then if I turn my head, how do I do that?
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:41.440]   How does that work?
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:44.480]   - Yeah, this isn't gonna do it.
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:51.360]   - All right, Chris, I've given you my Oculus Rift
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:53.680]   development kit is now your job to figure out how we can
[01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:58.200]   create immersive VR experiences here in the studio.
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:25:59.040]   Okay?
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:03.760]   Get to, get you 17, get to work, kid.
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:07.000]   Cameras, cameras, cameras.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.200]   If Thomas Edison had said I need a light bulb,
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.080]   would he have invented the photograph?
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:13.920]   - Oh, he needed a filament, all right.
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:15.160]   - He needed 12 GoPros.
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:16.640]   - 12 GoPros.
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:19.280]   I've got three, I can get you started anyway.
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:25.440]   Yahoo and Microsoft are in a 10 year deal for Microsoft
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:28.120]   Bing to be the Yahoo search engine.
[01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:31.840]   That deal is about to, let's see, the search partnership
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:37.040]   took place in 2010, but it did allow them to renegotiate
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:39.000]   in 2015 after five years.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.520]   The negotiations are going on and I don't know
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:45.240]   if they're going well, they've decided to extend them
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:46.800]   for another 30 days.
[01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:50.240]   This is because both companies are publicly held,
[01:26:50.240 --> 01:26:53.000]   so they had to file with the SEC on Friday.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.080]   They mutually agreed to extend the deadline
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:58.440]   to a 60 day period following February 23rd.
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:01.640]   Not clear what's going on there.
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:05.120]   I can't imagine Yahoo would abandon Bing.
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:07.120]   They don't have anything to replace it.
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:12.720]   All right, actually, let's take a break
[01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:17.720]   and then we'll talk about the FTC and Google.
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:19.880]   Is Google a monopoly?
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:25.720]   Should the FTC have pursued them for antitrust?
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:28.600]   They decided not to, but some say,
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:30.680]   after they've read these documents, they should have.
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:32.200]   We'll talk about it.
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:34.560]   Our guests, great to have them, Katie Benner,
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:38.000]   from Bloomberg View, which is a,
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000]   you said it's like commentary.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.480]   Exactly, it's Bloomberg News's commentary section.
[01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:43.360]   We'll call them this.
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:44.880]   This is good, I like it.
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:49.560]   You should get people to go and read more of this.
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:51.880]   Oh no, you're going to get people to go and read more of this.
[01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:52.880]   This is good stuff.
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:53.880]   I know.
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:56.120]   This is good stuff.
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:58.320]   Why are they segregating it?
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:00.000]   Well, because they want to keep the news
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.120]   and the commentary separate,
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:02.680]   just sort of like the New York Times does
[01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:03.520]   or the Wall Street Journal.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:05.880]   They have the opinion section, the opinion pages,
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:09.120]   so the people don't conflate it with news.
[01:28:09.120 --> 01:28:10.320]   That's all.
[01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:13.000]   Well, I'm going to forget the other guys.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:14.400]   I'm going to read this one.
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:15.680]   That's fantastic.
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:17.120]   And I like the layout.
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:18.880]   This is the new Bloomberg layout.
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:21.000]   Exactly, it's very vergy.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.760]   It was a, well, it was controversial when they did it,
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:29.800]   but you're not quite as all in as the rest of Bloomberg.
[01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:32.080]   No, I think that that site is much more,
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:33.240]   there are a lot more bells and whistles.
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:34.080]   That's kooky.
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:34.960]   That's a really great job.
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:38.040]   I'm going to give you some opinion.
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:39.040]   That's kooky.
[01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:43.520]   What they did is so, it feels like it's like,
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:45.280]   it's rendering wrong or something.
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:46.120]   Don't you?
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:46.960]   I don't know.
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:47.920]   You shouldn't, you can't talk.
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:50.360]   But it just feels like this stuff,
[01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:53.240]   and it's stuff's popping out and moving around.
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:55.920]   And then when you read an article, it has a,
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:59.120]   it feels like stuff's, I don't know, it looks kooky.
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:00.840]   commentary is more restrained.
[01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:02.720]   Yeah, I like the view.
[01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:04.040]   So look, there's this blue bar.
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:06.640]   See that blue bar at the top as you scroll down,
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:09.240]   it moves across to tell you something.
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:11.800]   I don't know what, where you are in the article,
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:14.560]   but it's not that helpful because it's an infinite scroll.
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:17.440]   So as soon as you get to the bottom of the article,
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:19.240]   it resets and starts over again.
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:20.080]   Wait, what?
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:22.000]   You can't see me off camera cracking up.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.280]   Can you talk to your boss?
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:29.680]   I will send you an email address for our head of--
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:30.560]   No, I'm just kidding.
[01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:31.400]   That's fine.
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:32.320]   You're just going to have a great conversation.
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:33.160]   It's fine.
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:35.000]   I just, you know, we're in the midst of a redesign,
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.760]   and I'm very, very aware of all the things
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:39.320]   you have to figure out and how hard it is.
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:41.560]   It's how expensive it is.
[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:44.240]   And so I look at other sites with interest, like,
[01:29:44.240 --> 01:29:45.480]   well, okay, these are the decisions,
[01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:47.320]   'cause I know what decisions we have to make.
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:48.920]   And these are the decisions they make.
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:51.840]   And actually, it works perfectly well.
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:55.040]   I just, I think it's very, it's bold.
[01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:56.200]   Thank you very much.
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:29:57.960]   Very bold.
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:01.280]   If you are looking for something to read on Bloomberg View,
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:05.200]   I did just write a column about Google and antitrust.
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:07.640]   So that's the first thing you guys can go in the--
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:11.000]   I'm going to put you on the spot then when we come back.
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:11.840]   Sounds good.
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:13.200]   From this break.
[01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:14.040]   All right.
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:16.120]   Our show today brought to you by My Mattress.
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:20.600]   You have the video of me and My Mattress, me and My Mattress.
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:23.040]   Who would have thought you could buy a mattress online?
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:25.720]   That seems like counterintuitive for so many reasons.
[01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:28.160]   One, don't you want to lie on it before you buy it?
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:31.040]   Two, they're going to ship a mattress?
[01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:32.760]   Three, what the heck?
[01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:34.760]   Well, Casper's convinced me.
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:38.000]   First of all, I have, you know, and everybody has,
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.600]   gone to a mattress showroom and a lot--
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:41.520]   What is it, Lane?
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:42.360]   Lane?
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:44.640]   Laid on a mattress.
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:48.240]   And it's no-- five minutes and a mattress isn't going to do you any good.
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:51.440]   So with Matt, with Casper, you get 100 days.
[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:53.320]   The shipping is free and the return is free.
[01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:57.280]   If after 100 nights, I should say, sleeping on it for 100 nights,
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:31:00.120]   if you don't like your-- love your Casper mattress,
[01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:03.000]   they'll take it back, no problem, no questions asked.
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.600]   But they have done it so well.
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:05.560]   First of all, it does come in.
[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:07.320]   That's a queen-sized mattress in a box.
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:10.240]   I got one for my son because he lives up three stories
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:12.160]   and he wanted a queen-sized mattress.
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:13.760]   There was no way they could get a regular mattress
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:14.760]   in that house.
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:16.960]   He loves his Casper mattress.
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:18.760]   They make them in the United States.
[01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:21.640]   They're premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost.
[01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:23.520]   They're really comfy.
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:26.200]   I got to tell you, latex and memory foam,
[01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:29.160]   so you get both sink and bounce.
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:32.440]   You get firmness, but it conforms to you.
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:36.160]   It is so soft and comfortable and it's completely risk-free to try it.
[01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:42.680]   Casper.com/twits, C-A-S-P-E-R.com/twit.
[01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:45.680]   Don't decide on something you're going to sleep on
[01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:48.040]   for the next 10 years, five minutes in a show
[01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:50.120]   where even Aussie loves our Casper.
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:53.200]   Go online, Casper.com and get a Casper mattress.
[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:55.680]   I guarantee you, you are going to love it.
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:57.040]   Are you money back?
[01:31:57.040 --> 01:31:59.520]   $500 for a twin, $9.50 for a king size.
[01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:01.960]   Compare that to the price of the mattress store.
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:03.480]   I'm going to get you $50 off.
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:06.040]   As an audience member, just go to Casper.com/twit
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:07.440]   and use the promo code "twit."
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:11.880]   $50 off Casper.
[01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:14.240]   This is the kind of thing I think the internet really,
[01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:17.560]   it's interesting to watch how it's changing these businesses
[01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:19.120]   that you never thought.
[01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:21.720]   You never thought you'd be able to buy glasses online
[01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:23.600]   or buy mattresses online.
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:26.240]   They've solved this by shoes online.
[01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:26.680]   I love it.
[01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:30.160]   Casper.com/twit.
[01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:36.240]   So the Wall Street Journal defiled a Freedom of Information Act
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:39.480]   with the FTC and they were curious about the process
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:45.960]   the FTC had used in investigating the Google.
[01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:49.880]   The FTC, I guess this is, and I'm glad you've written on this,
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:51.360]   Katie, so you can tell me.
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:54.680]   My sense is the FTC commissioners
[01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:58.080]   get reports from a variety of different staff groups.
[01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:00.520]   Read them all and then the commissioners decide
[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:02.160]   whether to go forward or not.
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:05.440]   In this case, the commissioners declined to prosecute Google
[01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:08.520]   after a few minor changes to how Google does search.
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:12.400]   But in this FOIA Act, the Wall Street Journal,
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:16.440]   and by the way, the FTC asked for it back and the journal said,
[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:18.400]   "No, we got it now.
[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:24.840]   No, went through this and pulled out some smoking guns."
[01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:25.920]   That they did.
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:26.480]   That they did.
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:28.240]   It was clear that the commission that there
[01:33:28.240 --> 01:33:31.640]   were certain staffers who believed that Google, not just
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:34.320]   that Google had a monopoly because monopolies exist
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:36.160]   in all sorts of businesses, but that they'd
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:39.800]   use that power to hurt other companies
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:42.080]   and/or hurt consumer interests.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:45.240]   So that would be the antitrust part of the suit.
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:48.560]   As you said, in the end, the commission chose not to sue.
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:51.080]   And they worked with Google to preemptively change
[01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:53.400]   parts of the business so they wouldn't have to.
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:55.280]   What I was writing about, what I found interesting
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:33:58.880]   is that the idea of a monopoly in technology
[01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:01.240]   is really different from monopolies that exist in things
[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:05.520]   like oil and gas and mining and these big heavy industries
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:08.400]   because it's very hard to disrupt ExxonMobil.
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:11.440]   It's really hard for a company to have the firepower
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:13.920]   to upend that business.
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:16.160]   Whereas in technology, we see really big companies
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:17.880]   being upended all the time.
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:22.680]   We've seen, in part because you have powerful, smart,
[01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:24.640]   quick startups coming in and finding
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:26.360]   pieces of the business that are weak,
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:30.560]   and also because consumer trends change so fast in the tech
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:33.400]   world that what was interesting and great at one point
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:34.360]   just doesn't work anymore.
[01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:36.320]   I think Microsoft is a great example of this.
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:38.720]   Other people have written about this as well.
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:41.000]   As long as the PC was king, Microsoft
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:42.240]   was going to be king too.
[01:34:42.240 --> 01:34:43.840]   But now that we're moving to mobile,
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:45.880]   suddenly the operating system and the software
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:47.800]   that Microsoft provides and is known for
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:49.160]   have just kind of become irrelevant.
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:52.240]   So that powerful monopoly that Microsoft wielded
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:53.600]   is not as scary anymore.
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:56.040]   And it wasn't because the government broke up Microsoft
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:58.360]   and it wasn't because Microsoft changed its business
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:34:59.160]   practices.
[01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:02.200]   It really was just because Microsoft didn't keep up
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:04.080]   with technology as quickly as it should have.
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:05.760]   And I think people are already starting to wonder
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:08.360]   is Google going to fall into that category as well
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:10.080]   now that we're moving away from online search
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:11.560]   and so much as being done in mobile search
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:12.840]   and being done in apps.
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:14.480]   Where is Google and all of this?
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:16.920]   And then the couple of advantages they do have,
[01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:19.600]   Android for example, you have companies going in
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:22.880]   creating for versions of Android even trying to
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:24.960]   dent that advantage as well.
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:26.080]   - What was the smoking gun?
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:27.600]   Or was there anything in your opinion
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:28.880]   after reading through the report?
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:29.880]   And the journal did a weird thing.
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:32.280]   They only published every other page for some reason.
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:34.280]   - Well they didn't get the whole report.
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:35.280]   - Oh okay.
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:37.360]   - So the complete report wasn't included
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:39.360]   in the FOIA request.
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:42.560]   There were definitely some things in there
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:47.560]   that were, that would be deemed harmful
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:51.360]   to other competitors and this is why Amazon and Yelp
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:53.400]   and TripAdvisor have been so upset.
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:55.920]   The commission defined that Google suppresses
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:59.120]   other companies results in their,
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:01.000]   in Google's own search results.
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.440]   So if information that would come up,
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:07.120]   if Christina is shopping for something
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:10.280]   and she Googles in the item and she wants to buy it,
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:12.840]   maybe the best result would actually be from Amazon
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:16.920]   but Google's going to give her a Google shopping result.
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:17.840]   Which may or you know,
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:19.840]   probably doesn't benefit the consumer in the long run.
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:20.720]   So yeah, that's true.
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:22.560]   But then there's the argument to be made,
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:25.040]   well if we're searching on our phones,
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:27.120]   I'm probably not ever going to Google
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:28.360]   what I want to buy on my phone.
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:30.160]   I'm going to go straight to my Amazon app
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:33.120]   disintermediating Google
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:35.680]   and then making their monopoly a lot less powerful.
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:37.920]   And even if they are abusing that monopoly,
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:39.920]   it doesn't matter because I'm not using them.
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:43.320]   - Jeff Jarvis, we had a long discussion on this
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:46.120]   on this week in Google and Jeff defended Google
[01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:47.960]   saying that really this is the Wall Street Journal
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:50.240]   continuing a vendetta, it's Rupert Murdoch's
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:54.920]   Wall Street Journal continuing a vendetta against Google.
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:37:00.120]   And then Danny Sullivan's done a very interesting analysis
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:03.520]   on marketing land, his site,
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:07.880]   in which he said basically, well here's one quote,
[01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:10.160]   then this comes from a sidebar to the main piece,
[01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:13.600]   how Google skewed search results.
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:14.440]   According to the journal,
[01:37:14.440 --> 01:37:16.720]   Google would automatically boost its own sites
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:18.920]   for certain specialized searches
[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:20.680]   that would otherwise favor rivals.
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:23.520]   Kind of what you mentioned, Katie.
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:26.040]   If a comparison shopping site was supposed to rank highly,
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:28.880]   Google's shopping was placed above it.
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:31.800]   When Yelp was deemed relevant to a user search query,
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:34.240]   Google local would pop up on top.
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:37.760]   Danny says that sounds terrible on the face of it
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:39.320]   unless you understand that this is a practice
[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:42.400]   that many search engines have done to present vertical
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:45.560]   and this is the key, these are vertical search results.
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:49.320]   It said Google, he says Google didn't want
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:54.320]   to give you search results as the result of a search
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:59.840]   and deemed that things like Yelp would basically
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:02.880]   you'd search for something and you get a search.
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:07.480]   And so to some degree that seems reasonable.
[01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:11.560]   On the other hand, the journal says Google had a focus group,
[01:38:11.560 --> 01:38:13.400]   they call them the searchers,
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:16.440]   who were very unhappy with the way Google was doing things.
[01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:20.080]   Marissa Meyer, who was then a Google Vice President,
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:21.800]   said Google didn't use click-through rates
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:24.960]   to determine the rankings for its own specialized search results
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:27.480]   because they'd rank too low.
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:29.960]   So.
[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:32.640]   - Right, well, I mean, and that's kind of,
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:35.440]   I don't know about you guys, but I found myself,
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:37.040]   one of the reasons that I think Google suffers
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:39.840]   so much on mobile, A, as you said, Katie,
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:43.680]   we wanna go to the app rather than going through a search box,
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:46.360]   but part of the reason that's the case is because
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:47.840]   over time, I don't know about you guys,
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:49.320]   but I've noticed that my Google results
[01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:51.520]   have gotten less and less good.
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:54.240]   And a lot of times it's because they're customized now
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:56.360]   to everything they think that I want to like,
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:58.960]   so it becomes kind of this weird circular notion
[01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:02.000]   where I'm only seeing things that I've searched for before
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.600]   or sites have visited before.
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:05.880]   But in other cases, it's because it takes so long
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:08.280]   to actually find the real results that I want
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:11.400]   versus what they used to do, but they were so good at,
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:14.360]   and the reason they disrupted the industry
[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:19.080]   was that Google was fantastic about showing the actual things
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:20.840]   you wanted and showing the highest,
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:24.200]   probably really kind of anticipating this is where you wanna go.
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:26.840]   So, I mean, on the one hand, I think this definitely,
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:28.960]   I can understand why their competitors are upset.
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:31.600]   On the other hand, I almost wonder, you know,
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:35.360]   by doing this and putting their own services above others,
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:38.760]   doesn't that in some ways potentially just make people
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:41.920]   wanna use Google less because the results they're getting
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:44.040]   aren't actually matching what they're searching for.
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:46.600]   They're getting, you know, siphoned off into these,
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:48.240]   into Google local and all these other things
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:50.160]   that probably don't even exist anymore,
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:54.120]   rather than going to Yelp or going to Amazon
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:56.520]   which is kind of what you wanted to do to begin with.
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:58.000]   - Of course, and I think that the comparison
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.960]   with Microsoft here becomes really fascinating because,
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:05.000]   again, Microsoft did so much to enhance
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.320]   and protect a monopoly position that took itself
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:10.360]   the ball in terms of innovation, and then some of the things
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:13.120]   that it did do in order to stay so powerful,
[01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:15.440]   made the experience just bad for users.
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:18.360]   So, the new right is against, to go anywhere else,
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:21.000]   the minute there was a Google Docs or the minute like Apple
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.720]   software was even like kind of okay.
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:26.520]   People started to, people started finding other options.
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:29.080]   - But isn't that why this is an antitrust investigation
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:31.760]   because the hope, it's not illegal to be a monopoly.
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:36.280]   It's illegal to use your monopoly power to enter other markets.
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:39.320]   And so the reason this is a legitimate, in my opinion,
[01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:41.880]   investigation is because Google used its near monopoly
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:46.280]   on search to get itself into other businesses.
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:47.440]   Like what we want to do.
[01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:51.280]   - Part of the problem is, part of the problem is like,
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:56.280]   do we have a clear and defined idea of what a search engine
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:41:00.040]   is, having only had search engines for,
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:02.760]   what, maybe 20 years at this point?
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:07.760]   So, what I'm saying is, Google's service offers,
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:10.840]   when you go to google.com, it offers you a lot of services.
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:15.200]   When you use the Chrome web app, it offers you a lot of services.
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:17.560]   So, or web app, I'm sorry, browser.
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:19.200]   It offers you a lot of different services.
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:22.960]   So, when you Google a restaurant, for example,
[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:24.680]   you're gonna get a Google Maps results.
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:26.840]   You're gonna get reviews of people who have entered it
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:28.760]   from their Google accounts.
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:30.200]   You're gonna get photos of the place
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:32.640]   from people who have uploaded them to Google.
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:36.680]   You know, is that part of a search engine experience?
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:38.040]   Is that something else?
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:40.280]   Is what Google offers now something different
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:41.120]   than a search engine?
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:43.800]   Like, I think it gets into this weird area
[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:47.400]   where I almost see these things that Google is offering us
[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:52.400]   other services and features on top of its site.
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:56.040]   - I think the FTC thing really only dealt with
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:58.040]   traditional online search as you would think of it.
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:00.040]   It didn't deal with all these other areas.
[01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:03.120]   It really just dealt with opening up a web browser
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:07.080]   and typing something into the search bar.
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:09.560]   - But I mean, that's exactly what Google is delivering you, right?
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:11.400]   Like, that's the promise that Google makes,
[01:42:11.400 --> 01:42:12.880]   is that we're gonna follow what you do.
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:15.120]   We're gonna try to offer you tailored results.
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:18.120]   And we're gonna give you a complex, rich,
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:21.240]   and in context, experience for what it is you're looking for.
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:23.400]   So that's why you get the maps and the photos
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:25.200]   and the business listing.
[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:27.360]   And it's gonna show you that business listing
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.480]   instead of Yelp's because it's Google
[01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:30.760]   and it wants to offer you that.
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:34.040]   But it's, I don't know, it sounds kind of tricky to me
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:39.040]   because I don't know if that is what a search engine offers
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:41.840]   or if that's something new.
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:44.200]   Like, is that a feature on top of a search engine
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:47.800]   or does Google, by offering those features,
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:50.520]   now enter into a new category in a way?
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:52.560]   - Well, it's old fashioned to think of a search engine
[01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:54.920]   as merely something you type a phrase into
[01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:57.760]   and it gives you a list of sites that match the phrase.
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:00.120]   That's kind of an old fashioned notion of what Google is.
[01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:01.320]   And you're saying, I think quite rightly,
[01:43:01.320 --> 01:43:04.360]   that Google wants to be more useful than that.
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:06.640]   - But also the SEC closed its investigation.
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:10.360]   Like, we're debating these after the fact, this is over.
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:14.400]   - Google was not to be trust busting.
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:15.800]   They were found innocent.
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:19.360]   - I've argued for this and of course it's pie in the sky
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:22.440]   but I do wish there were a search,
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:24.360]   it's part of the problem is Google is a monopoly.
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:26.360]   It's not like you're gonna go use something else.
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:27.800]   - Of course it is.
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:29.920]   - And I mean, I guess you could use big.
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:31.280]   - But it's not illegal, I mean, there's nothing.
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:32.760]   - But it's not illegal, right.
[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:36.720]   And I kind of wish there were some holy priesthood search engine
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:39.640]   that didn't have all these side businesses,
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:41.400]   didn't have YouTube and Google.
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:42.560]   - Don't go.
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:45.800]   - But Dr. Go uses Google's results.
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:46.800]   - Yes, that is, you're right.
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:48.160]   - That's why I thought that stuff out.
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:49.000]   - Right.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.200]   - And they have some of their own crawling,
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:51.320]   although it's very minor.
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:53.960]   - They have not yet done their own business of crawling.
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:54.880]   And that's what they need.
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:56.040]   If they would do that and say,
[01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:58.760]   "Look, we're just gonna hue to the one thing
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:00.120]   which is to provide you results
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:02.080]   that you will be useful to you
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:03.880]   and we are not in any other business
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:06.120]   so we cannot help our other businesses."
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:06.920]   I would like that.
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:09.160]   I would switch to that.
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:10.600]   - I think the problem is though,
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:15.600]   is that that almost is like the last technology,
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:16.960]   that's the old paradigm, right?
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:18.520]   That was kind of like the web 1.0,
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:20.000]   web 2.0 search paradigm.
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.920]   Whereas where Google is actually frankly losing now
[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:24.840]   and where search is going in the future
[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:26.800]   is that people are using their mobile devices.
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:29.280]   And it becomes about being anticipatory,
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:32.160]   which is why Google needs to do more of these customized things
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:33.440]   and they need to learn more about us
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:35.160]   because they need to be able to know
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:38.320]   if you're in this area and I'm searching for a Starbucks,
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:40.720]   you should show me the Starbucks closest to where I am,
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:44.240]   not their website or something else.
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:46.000]   You should be showing me,
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.680]   if I'm looking for an airline or a time
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:51.560]   or something for takeoff and landing,
[01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:53.560]   you should be searching for that day,
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:56.200]   not for just general information.
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:58.400]   So I think that I am with you,
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:02.360]   but I almost wonder if going that direction is going
[01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:04.680]   in the past and kind of away from how most of us
[01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:07.720]   are kind of going to be using search in the future.
[01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:09.960]   No, I agree, Google now makes it much more useful
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:11.880]   and that's a very different beast
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:13.120]   than a pure search engine.
[01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:14.640]   Google's response to this by the way.
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:16.800]   And one of the accusations from the Wall Street Journal
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:18.720]   was that of course this happened
[01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:20.480]   because since President Obama took off
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:24.720]   as employees of Google have visited the White House 230 times.
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:25.800]   - Oh god, that was--
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:29.640]   - 230, comparison Comcast has only visited twice.
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:31.600]   - Buried way, way down in that story
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:35.040]   and this is why it's so important to read to the very end.
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:35.880]   - Yeah.
[01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:38.840]   - So the journal does acknowledge that a lot of those visits
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:42.680]   were so that employees at Google could help set up
[01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:47.480]   President Obama's Q&A that went over Google Hangouts.
[01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:49.080]   These were not policy people.
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:51.360]   - Five of them, according to Google,
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:52.920]   were a Google engineer on leave
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:56.120]   helping to fix technical issues with healthcare.gov's website.
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:58.120]   - Right, and a lot of those people
[01:45:58.120 --> 01:45:59.800]   were people who were actually going in and out
[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:02.600]   to apply for jobs at the White House.
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:05.840]   So this, so you have to get really far down in the story
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:07.920]   before it becomes clear
[01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:10.520]   maybe why there were so many more visits this year
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:13.240]   than in that year than previously.
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:15.480]   - Over a dozen visits were for production crews
[01:46:15.480 --> 01:46:17.640]   covering the YouTube interviews with the President Obama
[01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:18.480]   instead of the union.
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:19.840]   - Right, exactly.
[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:21.680]   - By the way, that was Alex Lindsay
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:23.000]   and his crew at Pixelcore.
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.280]   I love the picture that they put in the Google blog.
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:26.440]   This isn't their policy blog.
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:29.360]   Really Rupert, and then they got a baby laughing.
[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:31.560]   - No, I love that they're responding with GIFs now
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:32.640]   to help us see them.
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:35.440]   - And I mean, it gives, that's the solution.
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:36.840]   - I mean, to me, I kind of love it.
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:38.320]   What's interesting, obviously, I know this case
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:40.520]   was already decided, but what to me was more bothersome
[01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:42.760]   than even some of this monopolistic practice stuff,
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:44.000]   which obviously we know they have,
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.280]   but the fact that they were, the argument was,
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:47.360]   and there seemed to be proof of this,
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:49.520]   that they were kind of holding Amazon ransom
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:50.880]   to a certain extent saying,
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:54.200]   you have to pay us this amount of money for ads
[01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:56.400]   if we're going to show your search results
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:57.800]   on our pages at all.
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:47:00.440]   To me, that's actually a lot more bothersome
[01:47:00.440 --> 01:47:01.600]   than even in the other set,
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:03.400]   because then I'm thinking, okay, take away
[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:05.480]   the sanctity of search out of it.
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:08.320]   You're now basically saying to one of your
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:09.800]   pseudo competitors in some ways,
[01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:11.840]   but also one of your biggest customers,
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:13.200]   that the only way that you will continue
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:15.960]   to kind of show the results where they should be shown
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:17.800]   is if they continue to pay you.
[01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:19.680]   I mean, that's the Microsoft stuff right there.
[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:21.600]   That's some pure Microsoft,
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:23.080]   like from the 90s sort of stuff right there.
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:24.280]   So on the one hand, I'm like, okay, well,
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:26.480]   well played, somebody read Bill's handbook.
[01:47:26.480 --> 01:47:27.520]   On the other hand, I'm like, wow,
[01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:31.840]   that's, don't be evil my ass, come on.
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:35.520]   I have to say that Google wields such power in our society.
[01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:37.000]   - Large line of start.
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:37.840]   - Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:38.680]   - Those are the things that people
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:40.480]   are going to start scrutinizing.
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:43.280]   The FTC steps closed, but just like Christina said,
[01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:44.720]   there are interesting tidbits,
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:47.440]   there were interesting insights into Google's
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:49.760]   business practices that will probably
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:54.240]   be put under the spotlight more than they were before.
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:55.080]   - Rightly so.
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:57.800]   Google wields a lot of power.
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:00.800]   And I think we need to keep them honest.
[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:01.880]   You know what else we need to keep honest?
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:03.840]   Radio Shack, Radio Shack, and of course,
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:06.040]   going out of business and their bankruptcy sale.
[01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:09.080]   They are offering tens of millions of email
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:11.280]   and home addresses to the highest bidder.
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:14.000]   Do you ever join the Radio Shack battery club?
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:15.200]   They remember when you bought something
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:17.800]   at Radio Shack, they'd ask you for their phone number?
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:19.920]   Well, now you know where it's going.
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:21.440]   13 million email addresses,
[01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:25.800]   65 million customer names and physical addresses.
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:29.520]   And they're trying to sell it off as part of their assets.
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:33.480]   AT&T is complaining not because AT&T is in favor of privacy.
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:34.320]   Oh no.
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:35.160]   - No, no, no, no.
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:36.960]   - 'Cause they say that's our data.
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:38.040]   (laughing)
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:39.480]   - We can't sell this.
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:40.680]   We already own this.
[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:43.080]   We get to profit from it, not you.
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:44.080]   That's my favorite profit.
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:44.920]   - That's important.
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:47.760]   I think it's important to know because
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:50.520]   we often point to privacy policies
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:53.360]   and Radio Shack did have a privacy policy in place.
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:55.320]   But most of the time, these privacy policies
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:58.960]   do not survive the sale or liquidation of a company.
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:00.960]   - Not, absolutely.
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:03.960]   And this is one reason why I would refuse
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:06.760]   to give the Radio Shack people my name or my zip code
[01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:11.680]   or sign up to buy the $5 insurance plan
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:14.480]   on my $25 ethernet to USB adapter.
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:17.320]   And I would say, no, I'm not going to buy that.
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:18.600]   And they look at me funny.
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:21.720]   And I think this is also one reason why
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:23.200]   I don't think any of us are upset
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:24.720]   that they're going out of business
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:26.280]   because this is the first thing they do.
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:27.920]   (laughing)
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:29.160]   - Wow.
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:32.960]   In the past, the FTC again has said that
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:35.160]   if something like this is happening during a liquidation,
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:38.200]   data should be sold with a larger group of assets,
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:40.880]   not just parcel out to the highest bidder by themselves,
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:43.320]   that the privacy policy should be maintained
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:46.600]   and the buyer should be in the same general line of business.
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:50.440]   But this is an example of why you might want to be
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:52.760]   a little careful about the information you give out.
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:54.720]   We're out of time, but what a great time we had.
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:58.160]   I want to thank you all three for being here,
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:01.560]   Jill Duffy, PCMag.com.
[01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:02.960]   Anything you want to plug?
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:08.560]   - I still have my column, Get Organized Every Monday.
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:12.520]   The one coming out tomorrow is about
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:14.760]   freeing up some space on your iPhone.
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:15.800]   So.
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:17.800]   - That's easier said than done.
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:20.060]   (laughing)
[01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:22.480]   - You know, it's kind of, it's,
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:24.120]   so the gist of my column is
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:25.360]   it's really for everybody.
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:27.640]   I'm not talking about high tech stuff
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:31.080]   where you have to do any scripting or, you know,
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:32.280]   unlock an Android phone.
[01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:34.200]   Like, it's really basic tips.
[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:37.240]   I want it to be understandable for the people who don't
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:40.040]   really dig into their technology that much.
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:41.520]   They're just ordinary people.
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:42.520]   They want to use their phones.
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:43.560]   They want them to work.
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:47.120]   So I try to write simple, clear tips for people
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:48.440]   that everybody can understand.
[01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:50.800]   - We all need that.
[01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:55.800]   That's a great service, PCMag.com/GetDashorganized.
[01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:58.080]   Thank you, Jill, for being here.
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:50:59.000]   - Oh, thank you, Leo.
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.000]   - Katie Benner, she writes at the much more
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:05.440]   lovely bloombergview.com.
[01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:07.920]   Very well designed site.
[01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:09.200]   Thank you for being here, Katie.
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:10.800]   Anything you'd want to plug?
[01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:13.520]   - I am a columnist at Bloombergview,
[01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:15.000]   and I write a couple of times a week,
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.880]   but I also have a daily newsletter
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:19.920]   where I rounded all the best tech news of the day,
[01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:22.360]   and I have to do my take on what's important
[01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:23.160]   and what you should be looking for.
[01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:24.000]   - I need to get that.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:25.280]   Where do I get that?
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:27.960]   - I will shoot you an email the minute we're off the air.
[01:51:27.960 --> 01:51:29.600]   - We have plug it on the air.
[01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:31.280]   What are you talking about?
[01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:32.360]   Plug it.
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:33.720]   - We're redesigning the whole thing.
[01:51:33.720 --> 01:51:35.680]   - Oh, you don't want anybody to know about it yet.
[01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:36.520]   - Oh.
[01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:38.400]   - But if you want to subscribe, there's an RSS.
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:40.000]   You can just go to site.
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.720]   Or you can email me,
[01:51:42.720 --> 01:51:44.280]   Katie Benner to at Bloomberg.net,
[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:47.320]   and I will send you the tiny letter URL to subscribe.
[01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:48.920]   - Nice, thank you.
[01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:49.720]   - Yeah, that easy.
[01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:51.120]   That sounds great.
[01:51:51.120 --> 01:51:55.160]   Christina Warren, always a pleasure from Mashable.com,
[01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:57.240]   the king of the Meerkat.
[01:51:57.240 --> 01:52:00.000]   That you were saying that's not you.
[01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.040]   You can-- - That's not me.
[01:52:02.040 --> 01:52:04.080]   - That's what's his name, Pete Cashmore.
[01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:05.160]   - That's Pete Cashmore.
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:07.400]   That's our very pretty CEO.
[01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:09.120]   - He's too damn good looking.
[01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:10.040]   - He really is.
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:10.880]   He really is.
[01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:12.520]   Sort of, it's not fair.
[01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:14.480]   - The chisel cheekbones.
[01:52:14.480 --> 01:52:17.280]   - Yes, it's ridiculous how good looking he is.
[01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:19.120]   - The fashionista.
[01:52:19.120 --> 01:52:20.480]   - Is he, you know, he's shy.
[01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:21.400]   That's what cracks me up.
[01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:23.200]   - He's so shy, he's so shy.
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:26.000]   Which is why it's so funny that he's become such a beer cat
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.760]   whore because he's the shyest person in the world.
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:30.840]   So it's really bizarre.
[01:52:30.840 --> 01:52:31.760]   - Does he still? - But I love it.
[01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:34.040]   - He still sounds like a Scotsman, right?
[01:52:34.040 --> 01:52:35.320]   - He does, he does.
[01:52:35.320 --> 01:52:39.000]   - As long as he doesn't lose that, I love Pete.
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.600]   And we used to, he was on the show a couple of times,
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:42.880]   and he was just too shy.
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:44.520]   He didn't want to do it.
[01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:46.240]   He says, "No, I don't want to be in public,
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:49.200]   "but we just think he's the greatest."
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:50.160]   Give him my regards.
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:51.160]   Thank you all three of you.
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:52.320]   We appreciate your being here.
[01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:55.240]   We had a good day, a good week.
[01:52:55.240 --> 01:52:57.480]   Nay, a good week on Twitch.
[01:52:57.480 --> 01:52:58.720]   And if you missed any of it,
[01:52:58.720 --> 01:53:00.680]   here's some of what you missed.
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:02.800]   - Previously on Twitch.
[01:53:02.800 --> 01:53:05.560]   - You're the woop, woop, woop, yeah.
[01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:06.760]   - Triangulation.
[01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:09.840]   I am becoming increasingly convinced
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:11.960]   that the notion now is corporate lifecycle.
[01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:14.560]   The corporation is built for a certain
[01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:16.280]   technology and paradigm.
[01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:17.120]   - I'm with you.
[01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:17.960]   - And the rest of it.
[01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:19.200]   - Times change, and they change faster now
[01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:20.800]   than they ever have before.
[01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:21.880]   - All about Android.
[01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:25.520]   - You, you brought in a pretty fine piece of hardware,
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:28.360]   if I do say so myself, HTC One M9.
[01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:30.120]   - If this is a phenomenal, fantastic phone,
[01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:32.320]   it's gonna be one of the top five phones this year.
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:35.400]   No doubt about it, except for the camera.
[01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:36.720]   - Before you buy.
[01:53:36.720 --> 01:53:38.720]   - We put an uncrashable parrot,
[01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:41.160]   bebop into the hands of our very own Leo on the port.
[01:53:41.160 --> 01:53:43.160]   - It's very easy to use,
[01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:45.880]   and that's a good thing since the last one I lost
[01:53:45.880 --> 01:53:47.040]   in the sky.
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:49.440]   - No, come back, drone, it did it again.
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:50.960]   Land, land, land.
[01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:52.760]   - Gizwiz.
[01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:55.240]   - What the heck is this?
[01:53:55.240 --> 01:53:56.320]   - You know what this is?
[01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:57.160]   - No.
[01:53:57.160 --> 01:53:59.480]   - That goes into his mouth.
[01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:00.320]   - What?
[01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:04.800]   - And that is going to be a guide to shave.
[01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:06.200]   Perfect goatee.
[01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:08.080]   Oh, that's pretty good.
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:08.920]   - Twitch.
[01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:11.520]   Friends don't let friends miss Twitch.
[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:13.080]   - We cover everything.
[01:54:13.080 --> 01:54:15.080]   - On Twitch, a few minutes to any of that.
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:16.880]   Well, just tune in this week,
[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:18.320]   'cause it's gonna be another great week,
[01:54:18.320 --> 01:54:19.600]   and especially tomorrow,
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:21.200]   but triangulation with Ben Rubin,
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:23.080]   the founder of Mircan.
[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:24.720]   We do this week in tech Sunday afternoon,
[01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:28.000]   it's 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:31.760]   It's 2,200 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:33.800]   If you can't be here live, and we love it if you are,
[01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:36.760]   but if you can't, you can always email us,
[01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:38.360]   I'm sorry, email, why would you email us?
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:40.520]   I don't know, we'll send you a copy, no.
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:42.840]   Just go to twit.tv, that's where it is.
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:43.680]   You don't have to email,
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:45.440]   let's just download a copy there,
[01:54:45.440 --> 01:54:48.240]   or wherever podcasts are stored.
[01:54:48.240 --> 01:54:52.360]   We also have great Twitch apps on all the devices,
[01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:54.240]   all the mobile devices, Android, iOS,
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:55.920]   Windows, phone, even Roku.
[01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:57.480]   If you wanna be in studio, we would love that.
[01:54:57.480 --> 01:54:59.080]   We have changed our policy just a little bit.
[01:54:59.080 --> 01:55:01.400]   We do require that you email us now,
[01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:04.600]   tickets@twit.tv.
[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:06.160]   We'd appreciate it if you let us know ahead of time.
[01:55:06.160 --> 01:55:08.400]   That way we will make sure we always have a place
[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:09.640]   for you to sit.
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:12.200]   We're gonna have to start turning away walk-ins,
[01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:17.200]   I'm afraid, so email us first tickets@twit.tv.
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:19.280]   Thanks for being here, we'll see you next time.
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:23.240]   Don't forget April 19th, the 10th anniversary,
[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:26.720]   Twit with all the original members of the Twit cast.
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:28.400]   It's gonna be a lot of fun.
[01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:30.280]   April 19th, our 10th anniversary.
[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:31.840]   See you next time, another Twit.
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:32.840]   - Yes, it is. - Is it in the can?
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:35.420]   (upbeat music)
[01:55:35.420 --> 01:55:36.720]   (applause)
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:37.560]   - Do it with a Twit.
[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:40.240]   - All right, do it with a Twit, baby.
[01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:41.080]   Do it with a Twit.
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:42.080]   - All right.
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:44.080]   Do it the twit, baby.
