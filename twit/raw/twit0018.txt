[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This is Twit. This Week in Tech, Episode 18, for August 14, 2005.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   So, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   this Week in Tech, the number one podcast, no, I'm sorry, the number two, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   the day to where they are. The pocket of pocket of machines.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   So, you're running biodiesel down there, John? Absolutely.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   French fries. Everything smells like French fries.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   No, you're not giving them chicken fat. Everything smells like chickens.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Hey, you know what? Normally, we'd start the show with what we thought was the top story of the week,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   but I think we're going to toss it to John, because John's a little upset about
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Steve Gibson's spam filtering solution.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   I hate to use the word "solution," because it's like the total evil marketing phrase.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   I think it works.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   I like saying "solution" once in a while, just because it feels so naughty,
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   but John, you're a little upset about Steve's email management system.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Steve, what would you call it? Your filtering tool?
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I'm not sure what we're talking about.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   He wouldn't know because he doesn't get this mail.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   So, what did you explain what he's got here?
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Steve, let me get the message up here.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Oh, wait a minute. You're talking about the fact that we don't allow HTML, either.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Yeah, listen to this.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   There's a message going around. Everyone out there should know that it's kind of the inside baseball here
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   when it comes to this show. Everybody sends a memo out on Terry and Sunday goes all over the place.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Check this link. We're going to talk about this, that, and the other thing.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   As if we plan this show.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Well, you know, there's actually a better plan than what Leo used to do.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Anyway, so you send a thing out, reply to all, and then you get this message back,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   because Gibson's email being the Mickey Mouse system that it is,
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   doing some real work or getting a spam filter.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   You get this message back that says, "Your HTML email was refused by our server."
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Hello! Your email to grc.com was not delivered because it contains, quote, HTML formatting.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Here's the link. It's used by the web pages on the World Wide Web.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Then listen to this one. It says, "Nearly all unsolicited commercial email spam uses HTML for different types of things.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   HTML, this is bull, by the way, to create the, what about those Nigerian letters?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I've never seen one of those in HTML.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Okay, so some of the way goes on and on and on.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   So I sent it back to him, be saying, "What is this B.E.D.?
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And I get it back again because apparently there was a link in there.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   So this is, you know, to me is just basically an insult to anyone trying to send a TV email.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   [laughter]
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   My email goes through fine.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   But once Steve approves you because, you know, I don't send HTML mail. I agree with them.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Well, I know, but you can send Steve HTML if he approves you.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Hey, HTML mail is not going away.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I'd be happy to whitelist you, John.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   So there was, you know, just HTML mail.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   So on your email, we'll just put some grease on your email that slides right in.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   What's wrong with, Steve, what's wrong with HTML email?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Oh, the high tons of garbage inside of it.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Well, I mean, it really is the case that we're phenomenally buried by email unless we do that.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   And we've tried it as an experiment to remove the HTML filter.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And it's just a phenomenal difference.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I think it's a classic way.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I think we're at computer time over here in the peninsula.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   It has a bunch of high-level labor-year-act-builders.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   I would think you, you, you, you, but no spam.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   No, wait a minute, John, do you get no spam because you have a minion of evil helpers that sort through your mail for you?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   So it all shows up without the spam or do you actually not get any spam?
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   It's not.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I do not get any spam.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   How do you do that, John?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Yeah, John, tell us.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   How do you do that, John?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   I don't do it.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Who does it?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Mark Percal is like a genius.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   He runs this little service called Computer Time, which is the guy that he's, I know this guy for 25 years.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   He started off being like a net-aware guy and had a thing called Mark's menu back in the 80s.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Is this something we can use?
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Yeah, we could.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   How could we use this?
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   You just have to go through his system with your mail and just get cleared right out.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Does he offer this as a commercial service?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Yeah, he does.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Or you have to be a friend of this.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Is it softwaretime.com?
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Is that his website?
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   It's www.ctyme.com.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   All right.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I use something similar.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   I use server-side email, spam protection from mail route, which does work very well.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Cloud Mark, same thing, works very well.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Bright mail.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Right.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   This actually works very well in Bright Mail.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   He actually has my server.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I mean, he does the whole thing for me, but he can do just the email part of it.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   And I get no spam.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   None?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   None.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   I even get, I mean, I still get 10 or 15.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   One thing will sneak in a week.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   And then you send it back to Mark and you'll never see it again.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   It's unbelievable.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   What's the URL?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   ctyme.com.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Right.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   We can't get there, but because it's blocking you.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Patrick, you're using HTML.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Well, it's computer type.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Okay, so this is--
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Why do you, John, why do you say HTML email is not going away?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   I mean, it is a blight.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   The bitmail is bloated.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   It hides stuff.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   It's ugly.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   You don't think "increda mail" is a good thing, surely.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   Actually, you know what?
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Wait, so this guy's--
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   It's not HTML based.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Google's email service is HTML based.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Yeah, but you can turn it off.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   That's true.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   But I mean, by default, all that bail is going to--
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Well, not going away because the general public doesn't know what the hell anybody--
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   what Steve Gibson's talking about when it comes to this, like, refusal to--
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   In fact, I think most people, they were writing the Steve when they got that memo.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   They'd go, "I don't know what he's talking about."
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Well, then that's why he explains it so clearly.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   He explains it and it doesn't help.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   I talk about it all the time.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   I've been saying on the radio show for two years, don't use HTML mail.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   I don't know if it's sinking in.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John, John
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I'm not going away.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   I'm not going to be saying that.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   I'm not going to be saying that.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   I'm not going to be saying that.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   I'm not going to be saying that.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   I'm not going to be saying that.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   So turn off the black hole stuff because you're right.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Maps and orbs will have lots of false positives.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   So I turn that off.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   The second thing you do is you set the setting fairly high.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   You set it to eight or the default is 6.5, I think, or six.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   You set it to eight and that way, only the really most egregious stuff gets stopped,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   but that's 80% of all.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Okay, well, let me tell you what the other thing that he does, which is not mentioned there.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   He uses the three-stage filtering system and maybe spam it seriously.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   That was really good.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   That's what made Kent so smooth.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   You know what?
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   If you guys don't want to hear about it, it's fine with me.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   I have no spam.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Three-stage filter, John.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Three-stage filter.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   My latest email does me just fine.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Okay, tell us about the three-stage filter.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   You know what?
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   I'm not talking about it anymore.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   I've already given enough publicity to people out there.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Just go check it out.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Jonsclim.com, good man.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   John's quoted on CTEM.com on the main page.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Well, of course, it says "good man."
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   John's seated for heck.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   This guy would be so busy after this podcast goes public, but no one's going to be able to get an account.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   See, that's when it's time for him to franchise.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Can we talk a little, as laws were saying, the "said the word podcast."
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Because iTunes really screwed the pooch this week.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Did you guys see what happened?
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   No.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   We're going to get Mikey on the show a little later on.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   I'll get a little interview with Mike Lazazara, who works on Call for Help with Me.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Mike and Amber were preparing a segment on how to subscribe to a podcast on iTunes.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   In order to do that, as you know on TV, he had to do it a few times to tape it and so forth.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   He noticed he clicked maybe 10-15 times on the subscribe button.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   This podcast was rising up through the iTunes ranks.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   So try it again.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   We got some third-party people to verify it.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   And he published it on his blog.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   By the next day, the weirdest podcasts were number one, two, three, four on the iTunes podcast.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Wait, so our number one listing is pho.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   I wouldn't get all excited about it.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   I got something to throw in on this.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   What's that?
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   I didn't want to mention it, but it might as well.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   But there's some mechanism out there that somebody buys.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   It's one of these rating mechanisms.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   And it seems to be to stand from Amazon.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   When we first came out with the Dvorak online, the book, we started noticing the same phenomenon.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   If you start pounding the site within a short duration, it jerks the numbers up.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   In other words, values are all broken.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Well, apparently what's happening is that iTunes is counting clicks on the subscribe button,
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   not actual subscriptions, not downloads, merely, which is stupid, but merely clicks.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   There was a Spanish language newscast that's only had one, or podcasts only has one edition,
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   released eight-six that was number two on the iTunes top list for most of Tuesday.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   It's just nutty, a Spanish language.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   It's just nutty.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   So there are a lot of Spanish language speakers.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   A Dave's I-Pack podcast, which by the way is a fascinating podcast all about I-Pax.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Wasn't...
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   You know, I should play you a little bit.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Now, let's not get snarky.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   I know Dave, he's fine.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   I love the I-Pack.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   But, come on, number one, the number one podcast.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   And it's not sour grapes.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   We've been in the top five for weeks.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Well, can we just create a bot and bang this thing and drop ourselves right up there?
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   We don't have to.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   We were numbered one.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Actually, we're back to now.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   The muggle cast is now number one.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Okay.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   See what I mean?
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   See what I mean?
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   We should have a bot.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   Somebody write a bot.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Okay, everybody, while you're...
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   Oh, there's my phone.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   While you're talking on the show right now, just click the subscribe button a few times.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Exactly.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   You just subscribe, you backspace, you subscribe, you backspace.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   That's all you have to do.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   And I bet we can be number one before the show's over.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   That's...
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   You would think Apple would have fixed this.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Business Week picked it up.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   I mean, it's been all over the place.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   And Apple has apparently not.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   So, just one more reason.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Look, it's the easiest way to get a podcast.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   I'm not complaining we're number two on there.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   We've been, you know, high up on the list for a long time.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   But it just shows you these are all of these polls.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   All of these numbers are not...
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   They're worthless.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   John's been saying it for a long time.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   However, we do enjoy being number one.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   Possible.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Under any circumstances.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Yeah, no matter what.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Pound it.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Pound it.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Yeah, we're clicking it right now.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   I mean, Chris Perilla was number one for a day.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   And I think it was probably the same thing.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   He just mentioned on this podcast.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   I don't...
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   I'm surprised that...
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   That wasn't fixed.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   I'm sure they will by the time you hear this.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   Anyway, at least it has.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Isn't it?
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Yeah, it has.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   One good thing.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   This is proved that the iTunes new music Tuesday doesn't have to be the number one podcast.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   You know what?
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Let me say something.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   As soon as Neil centers somebody that really does this stuff properly and they actually charge money to get these numbers, there's going to be no question in my mind that this will be the number one podcast in the country or the world.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Well, we know just for the number of downloads that we're...
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   No, we're...
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   No, he's right.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   And we know from the number of downloads we're getting on AOL that it's...
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   You know, I mean, I suppose there are other people with 300,000 subscribers.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   But I find it hard to believe.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   And these are based on downloads, not.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Ew, it's...
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Why would anyone want this?
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   That's what baffles me, Frank.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   I can't understand it.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   It doesn't...
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   It's baffling.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   All right, let's get to some tech news.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   That's enough inside baseball.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   Roger, you're clearing your sinuses there?
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Oh, yeah, sorry.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   Something like that.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Okay.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   Can we get you a decodistant?
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Here's one in the lobby.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   Here's one in the lobby, everybody's direction.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Intel's announcing a new architecture.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Yay!
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   So at the IDF forum, basically Intel's going to be offering the deets on their next generation
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   of multi-core processors August 23rd at IDF.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   What do you know about this?
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   I mean, I looked at the roadmap like a year ago and I couldn't.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   What changed?
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   I mean, what is it going to be?
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Oh, Penny M.S.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   It's funny you should mention that, John, because that's the exact same reaction I had.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   Oh, they're moving to a new architecture.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Oh, big news.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   No, they do this.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Every policy they have to.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   They say they haven't in five years.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   This is the equivalent of a Penny M.S.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   announcement, or a...
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Which kind of five even?
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Well, I think, I mean, it's part of it, and I have to get my thought, because I actually,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   to be honest, but I kind of cheated.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   I sent a memo to AMD having them explain to me what their intelligence and the guy was
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   on vacation.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   So I couldn't get any action.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Oh, true little Iro-knee.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   But the question in my mind seems to be that is this new architecture actually Intel's true
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   dual core, because the dual core that they're bringing out initially is really a fake.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.680]   It's really two chips kind of on one die, and then the true dual core, which is a separate
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.000]   type of architecture, I believe maybe what this is.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   How is dual core different than two chips on one die?
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Well, there's...
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   There's...
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Oh, boy.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   It's actually...
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   It's actually...
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   The dual core is kind of two chips on one die, and the phony one is actually two chips in
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   one chip package.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.240]   There's a subtle but important difference between pretending your chip is two chips to the
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.240]   opposite.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.240]   To actually being two chips.
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.240]   And actually having two chips on the same.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.680]   So you could have two chips is on the same plastic that's different than having the equivalent
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:43.880]   of two chips worth of transistors on one die for one chip.
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:44.880]   One plastic package.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:45.880]   Right.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:46.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:47.880]   Okay.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:48.880]   I mean, basically it's faster.
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.880]   You know, the demos of these things are astonishing.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.000]   Is this what Apple was thinking of when they...
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.880]   Obviously, if Intel's going to announce it August 23rd, they knew when they were talking
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:58.880]   to Apple.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.880]   Well, Apple...
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.200]   Apple may or may not have cared about this.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.160]   Apple's been stymied on making their...
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.160]   They had no choice.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.800]   Yeah, their party was faster for the last...
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.800]   I agree with that.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:13.320]   This is all about the mobile stuff for Apple.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.560]   You know, the G5 on the desktop was less of a concern.
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.840]   But basically, what's supposed to happen at IDF is they're supposed to announce the
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.320]   new code names for the future platforms.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.000]   What's going on with the upcoming chips?
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   And it's going to be interesting.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   A lot of it's...
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.680]   They're going to be pushing a lot of the stuff we associate with the Centrino platform, which
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.240]   is the chip and the chipset and the 802, the wireless.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.240]   But it's...
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.540]   There's going to be a single and what's going to be really cool is dual core penny
[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.520]   mem processors are supposed to be announced.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.520]   Ooh.
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.920]   Or basically the Yona stuff is supposed to become official.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:44.920]   The details on that.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.720]   Isn't there something pointless about announcing a secret code?
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.000]   Well, yeah, there is and there isn't.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.600]   But if you think about it this way, can you imagine?
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.520]   And this is an interesting thought.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.280]   Being a PR person is complicated enough, right?
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:03.120]   Being a PR person for Intel while in a battle for the enthusiasts over the gaming market,
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:08.360]   while dealing with the fact that AMD is finally getting it together on mobile parts, you know,
[00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.640]   after a number of years of making really interesting things and putting them in notebooks.
[00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:17.840]   You know, it's in the way they're just hounded from every different direction for information.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.840]   They probably are...
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.680]   You know, there's information.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.680]   There's leaked information.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:25.560]   There's leaked information that comes through the vendors they work with, you know, and the
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.560]   suppliers.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:30.120]   You know, it's probably important for them to officially say, "This is the roadmap and
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.120]   this is what's moving forward."
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.200]   And the other thing is they're talking about 2006, you know, they're getting the information
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.200]   out there.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.200]   I don't know.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.200]   It'll be interesting.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.600]   It's interesting timing because they're saying it's going to come out and write it exactly
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.480]   the same time Apple said we'll have the high end Macs.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.120]   You know, and Intel's performance is kind of flatlined on the desktop processors.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.120]   Right.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.560]   You know, so it's going to be the successor to the Pentium 4 and the architecture.
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.560]   It's going to be...
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.560]   What is it called?
[00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.560]   Pentium...
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.560]   Isn't there Pentium 5 or no?
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.560]   No.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:16:59.560]   No.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:00.560]   Pentium 6.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.560]   Pentium dozens.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.560]   I know.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.400]   At this point, like, at this point I think I'm the 13th part 2.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.400]   I don't know.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.400]   Can you imagine?
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:10.280]   There's got to be at least a half dozen companies in the United States, much less the rest
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:15.240]   of the world that are just copying bizarre combinations of phenomes to create, like,
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.240]   you know, future product names.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:18.240]   Blackso.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.240]   No.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.920]   Actually, the Blackso guy wants to talk to us because he claims it's going to be stuff.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:23.920]   We're going to have him on.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.080]   Yeah, John, you got me in a heap of taut water.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.080]   What?
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.840]   Well, we were complaining about plaque cell last week.
[00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:29.840]   Actually, I started that one.
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:30.840]   I wasn't complaining about it.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.840]   You were.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.840]   I was.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:33.840]   And Patrick was.
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.840]   Yeah.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:35.840]   Do you like plaque cell John?
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:36.840]   I've used plaque cell.
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:41.600]   I find it somewhat annoying and very iterations, especially when you get these, you know, these
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.600]   memos constantly.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.920]   But I've gone over and visited with the guys over there.
[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:45.920]   They seem honest.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:46.920]   I'd like them.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.920]   I think they're honest.
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.920]   I blame them.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.760]   I just think that this is a bad time to be asking for people's personal information.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.400]   Well, you know, I did get somebody's reminder of birthday the other day and it was like
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.400]   someone I knew very well.
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.400]   I didn't know it was their birthfaking.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.400]   I'm going to note their birthfaking.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.080]   So, plaque cell works.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.120]   Well, we'll talk to Todd Massonus at some point about plaque cell.
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:08.280]   We also, they do have an extensive listing of their privacy, you know, their points to
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.280]   privacy.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.280]   Yeah.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.800]   I got to tell you about, I mean, not that, and again, I'm not maligning them, but anybody
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.280]   could say anything about privacy.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.560]   Well, you know, I agree with you, Leo, but let me give you one other thing, which I actually
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.620]   mentioned to these guys and I mentioned all these guys will have these high-falutin
[00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:22.620]   privacy things.
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:26.520]   By the way, if you want to read a good one, read mine in my blog, by the way, it's very
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.520]   amusing.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.600]   But I mentioned to some, yeah, this is the way you think right now, but what happens
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.960]   when you sell the company to somebody else?
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:38.080]   And it's always says somewhere in there, you know, subject to change without notification.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.360]   So, this is what bothers me the most.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.920]   I think there's also an issue here on this.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.240]   Did you see this AOL giveaway?
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:50.240]   They're doing, they want to award against a spammer, New Hampshire spammer, 20 year old
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.240]   guy.
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:54.720]   They got his Hummer 2 and $85,000 with the gold bars.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.600]   They're having a little giveaway, right?
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.600]   And you sign up.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.600]   So you go to the site to sign up.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.600]   What do they want?
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.040]   Your email address, your phone number and your home address.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.720]   What are they going to do with that?
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.920]   And your gold bar.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:14.720]   I'm still loving the, the, the, my, I'm still like Scott Richter and his, and his company
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.680]   paying seven million to settle the suit with Microsoft over spam.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.640]   That's the one that's still, you know, part of me is like, yeah, and part of me is like,
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:26.640]   if he's got seven million, how much does he have salted away in, in, you know, the Bahamas
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.640]   and Swiss banks.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.280]   It's a 20 year old kid with a Hummer 2 and a $100,000 gold bar.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.280]   Not Scott Richter.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.480]   No, there's other guy.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.680]   So, uh, we, as long as we talk about OS 10, I suppose we should bring up this issue of
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.680]   the OS 10.
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:43.480]   I mean, I was at a meetup on Thursday and two kids sidled up to me and they said, here.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.480]   He said, what's this?
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.160]   They said, OS 10 on a CD CD.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.080]   What's the PC for the PC?
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.080]   Really?
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.080]   You have a copy?
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.080]   I turned it down, John.
[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.080]   Oh, you what?
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.080]   Holy mackerel.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:59.040]   What do you think you're going to get started with some Canadian plant?
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.960]   They're going to nail you at customs.
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.280]   Never say no to a free seat.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.440]   Well, actually the truth is they probably could put some really nasty stuff on that.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.440]   I figured if they got it, I could get it.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.000]   Yeah, you couldn't get rid of it.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.480]   And anyway, it required VMware, so I didn't want to buy it.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.480]   That's kind of a name.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.400]   A number of these, a number of these OS 10s do, there's, there's, there's a company
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.720]   that don't, yeah, some are natively, some are run on VMware.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.680]   In fact, they say the image that is set up to run on VMware can be installed on a hard
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.200]   disk and a boots native and it works just perfectly.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.160]   There are sites now that list all the different chipsets that are supported by this.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:38.320]   It took about a week for the TPM code to be removed from the kernel and it's now out
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:39.960]   and you can get it with BitTorrent.
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:45.320]   See, that's interesting because they removed the code and actually it was just an extension
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.640]   which they deleted.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:53.560]   So does Apple, yeah, how serious is Apple at protecting it?
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.400]   Yeah, it's just, I don't freaky.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.440]   I'm sure there's like a bunch of rumors flying about that maybe it was Steve's way of showing
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.920]   how ineffective TPM.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:03.920]   Why would he want to do that?
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.320]   Actually, it's what we're probably going to find out is that each of these individual
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.840]   installations of the operating system have a specific identity code in them and there's
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.360]   developers that are receiving knocks on their doors right now.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.360]   Right there.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.360]   Were you in Canada?
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.120]   That are, you know what I mean?
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:22.800]   Not you Leo, but whoever released it is going to have a knock on their door from Apple's
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.800]   attack lawyers.
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:24.800]   That's why I turned it down.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.240]   Oh yeah, I would have never turned it down.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.680]   Well, I'll get it for you next time.
[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:31.080]   You know what I'd like to do is put it on a tablet PC and see if we can make a tablet
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:32.080]   Mac.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.160]   Oh, that would be so fun.
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.560]   I think it should because it's got Wacom drivers.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.560]   Well, almost as useful as, yeah, right, it'd be just as bad as it.
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.640]   But at least we'd have one.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.640]   I think that'd be cool.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.880]   Also, the reports are when you run this thing not on top of VMware, but natively it blows
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.040]   the socks off of any OSX running on the computer.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:50.040]   That's what I found interesting.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.040]   It's fast.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:54.040]   That way faster.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.240]   Everybody's agreeing on that, that it's super fast.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.240]   Really?
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.240]   Well, maybe it's been optimized.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.040]   Well, maybe it's a better kernel than what's on there when maybe it's been optimized.
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.040]   Whatever.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.840]   I hope that's the one they sell as the optimized version.
[00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.840]   But it is the full version is in like some stripped down data or something.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.480]   Now, there's videos on the net.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.400]   You can watch people boot into it and run programs.
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.240]   And it looks pretty much like the full OS X.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:17.680]   I'm telling you, this is the most sinister thing that's ever happened to the business.
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:25.160]   As long as you have an SSE 3 machine, you know, one of the later P4s, it will run all
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.360]   the software.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.720]   So how does this mean?
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:34.600]   Does it mean that Steve Jobs knew this was going to happen and really said it?
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.840]   I have a theory in my PCMag.com column this week.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.080]   If anyone wants to go check it out.
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.080]   I'd like to hear it.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.440]   Why don't you just give us a preview?
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.600]   I thought that that was exactly what you're saying.
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.120]   I think the whole thing is a scheme, you know, to make it look like, oh no, we're trying
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.120]   to protect it.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.120]   We're trying to protect it.
[00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.440]   We're doing everything we can.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.760]   You know, we don't want to compete with the, we don't want to hurt the feelings of the
[00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:54.920]   regular Mac users.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.640]   We don't want to, you know, step on Microsoft's territory.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.640]   We're trying to protect it.
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.640]   We're doing well, you know, they do a crummy job of it because they're going to really
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:05.040]   roll it out eventually and eventually and here's the end result of Steve's going to
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:08.720]   come out and say, well, you know, this thing is in such demand people were stealing it
[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.720]   left and right.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.280]   We had to release it to the general public.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.760]   Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what's the percentage in doing that.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.200]   Maybe to convince the board, maybe to.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.120]   I think it's a publicity stunt.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.120]   Publicity.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.280]   But what you've done is created a whole bunch of hackers who figured out how to practice
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.280]   it.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.600]   It's a publicity stunt for a very narrow section of the public.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:31.480]   Yeah, I know, but if it becomes a scandal and he starts to threaten to sue people and
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.560]   he wants to do this and that and the other thing, it could get a lot of ink and the general
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:39.760]   public, the regular PC user who maybe doesn't care about the Mac would say, huh, I wonder
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.240]   what the fuss is all about.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.240]   Yeah, that might be.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.240]   Maybe I should go check this out.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:46.160]   Why are people working so hard to do this unless it's something better?
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:52.560]   Well, also he probably loves hearing how much faster it's running, right?
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:55.880]   Well, and you know how Gates loves all this too.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.880]   Oh, Bill's got to be having nightmares.
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.880]   He's got to be a nightmare.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.880]   That's wonderful.
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:01.880]   This is not a good thing.
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.600]   No, no, I actually haven't seen either of those sites, but has anyone actually tried
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:11.120]   running normal Mac OS X apps on top of running?
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.120]   It's got this Rosetta built into it, right?
[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.120]   Exactly.
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.840]   So power PC stuff will run on this natively all.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.840]   How well?
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.920]   Well, through the emulation layer.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:24.920]   So as well as Apple was going to make it available for us.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:29.480]   Yeah, Rosetta is a pretty impressive piece of software from what I've heard from people
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.240]   that are playing around with it.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:36.480]   I'm just curious, is like how all the content creation software will run and whether or
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:39.080]   not they will run faster on this?
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:44.960]   The big thing we did at the announcement was they had the guys from Mathematica up.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.400]   And basically like three days, and you know, take it with a grain of salt three days before
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:53.400]   the conference, the president of Mathematica gets a phone call says, could you bring your
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:57.560]   code, a compiler, and attack and meet us in Cupertino?
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:58.560]   And he's like, why?
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.560]   And they're like, there's something we really want you to see.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.560]   You know, we'll get you a plane.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:06.640]   They fly, you know, so he flies out to attack the code on a hard, firewire hard drive.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.680]   They recompile it, and apparently with some minor tweaks, and this is, you know, basically
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:13.040]   their code was in the right configuration.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.320]   They weren't using the older code base, but they recompiled it, you know, in a couple
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.680]   hours, and it ran fine, and it ran great, and they didn't have problems.
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.600]   And Mathematica's got a lot of older algorithms.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:30.040]   Now for the, gosh, somebody helped me out here, Leo, there's Coco, there's Carbon Coco
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.040]   are the two different kinds of...
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.200]   And then there's what's the older one?
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.200]   ... what's the older one?
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.880]   And then there's the compatibility, though, it's not compatibility, which nobody's using
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.880]   anymore.
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.640]   Well, a lot of people, a lot of smaller vendors are still using that.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:43.000]   Most of the time if you're running on OS X, you're running as a carbon application, even
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.600]   final cut pro is carbon.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.920]   If you've been written from scratch for OS X, you'll be using Coco.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:51.240]   Mathematica was probably carbon, I would be surprised if it was Coco.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:57.080]   But the idea is that, you know, all the older software, it's time to get on the Coco Carbon,
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.760]   and the newer stuff should recompile with no problem.
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.880]   So I should have taken that disk.
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:02.880]   What's the...
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:03.880]   Yeah, what...
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:04.880]   John...
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:08.360]   I just sent you an email that gives you the string you can Google for.
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:10.600]   You can find a bit torrent, and that's what I figured.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.960]   ... installation instructions all over the place now.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:18.240]   But John, if I had taken that disk, crossed the border, brought it into the United States,
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:22.560]   and then handed it to you, who would have gone to jail?
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:23.560]   I don't think...
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:26.160]   You know, the point is, well, for one thing, it's silly to think that anybody would go
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.160]   to jail.
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.640]   But the point is, is that you're actually writing for Wired magazine.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.480]   Now I'm a journalist, I write for a public...
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.120]   I'm not like a phony journalist.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.120]   Well, just...
[00:26:36.120 --> 00:26:38.920]   I mean, doing research on this kind of stuff is as common to do.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:39.920]   It's an investigative thing.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:40.920]   Thank you.
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.440]   I don't see that there's an issue here.
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.520]   Well, the only problem is the DMCA.
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.040]   It's a good thing I'm not writing for the New York Times.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.200]   Well, you know, like the DMCA, they're not going to push it when it comes to something
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.680]   like this, because this is already out there all over the place.
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.960]   And we're going to make an example of the wrong people.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.560]   I just got to see it happening.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.560]   Right.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:01.440]   By the way, Valerie Plame, CIA agent.
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.240]   What about Bob Novak?
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.320]   I know this is completely off the point, but...
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.320]   Why didn't he get indicted?
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.920]   No, I loved the way that he got thrown off CNN.
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:11.920]   Was that wild?
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.600]   Didn't he just get up in storm now because he got an argument?
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.120]   He was not an argument with...
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:20.760]   Well, he first swore in a way that you can't on public TV.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.320]   It's a live program.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:26.280]   And then took his microphone off, stood up and stomped off the top.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.680]   All this to be able to avoid being asked about.
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.680]   Exactly.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.480]   Yes, he was avoiding behavior.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.000]   Because he was going to get asked...
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.720]   Carville was going to ask him about this situation with Plame, and then he got wind of
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:39.720]   it.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.520]   And then decided to walk from the show.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:46.840]   Would you ever do that, John, if I were to ask you about skull and bones or something?
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.720]   I'd laugh and then I'd excuse you if something.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.920]   See, that's the way.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:52.920]   Take the offensive.
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.920]   Take the offensive.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.720]   Having only seen about 30 seconds of Novak in my life, I'd like to say on a scale of
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.480]   1 to 10, an intelligence and sophistication.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:07.440]   Pretty sure Devorak knocks him well, well in the lower like percent dials.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.240]   I really doubt it, to be honest.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.000]   Well, smart guy, but anyway.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.920]   Hey, how about this mobile phone, the cabier virus spreading through the World Athletic
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.920]   Championships?
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:16.920]   Did you see that?
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.920]   No.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:18.920]   No.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:22.200]   Okay, 19 people got it, but still, it's improved from concepts.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.200]   It's a lot.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.240]   And of course it's a mobile phone virus that spreads via Bluetooth, so you have to be in
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.240]   proximity.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.240]   You can't...
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.240]   So what do you have?
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.920]   Well, you're in Helsinki, the mobile phone capital of the world.
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.040]   Everybody's got no kids in Erickson's, right?
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:35.040]   Everybody.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.040]   Sometimes it's Europe.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.040]   They all have those GSM emails.
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.560]   They've all got to have phones.
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:42.080]   And this cabier virus is a Symbian, I think it's Symbian based virus.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.680]   Anyway, it requires Bluetooth.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:48.240]   Apparently it did, at least several dozen people caught it in the stadium because they
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.240]   were in proximity.
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.240]   Well, it's interesting.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.720]   In Europe, there was actually a recent number today, they say in Europe, there's about 19
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:57.160]   percent of the phones are Bluetooth enabled.
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.680]   In the States, it's about 7 percent.
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.680]   There you go.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.680]   So there's more higher penetration.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.960]   The problem is you have to say to Bluetooth, except files, which is not the default.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.400]   I don't know why you would do that.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.400]   Do you get those games?
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:14.120]   You want to download those ringtones.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.120]   Or the wallpapers.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.120]   Funny.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.920]   I can't remember what cabier, that's not the one that turns all your icons into skull
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.840]   and bones, is it?
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.200]   There's one that does that.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.200]   That's pretty funny.
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:28.760]   It affects smart phones running Symbian Series 60 using Bluetooth.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.360]   It's being Series 60 phone.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.280]   It drains the power of the infected phones as it tries to propagate, but otherwise relatively
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.080]   harmless according to an article on the register.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.560]   Drains the power because it's always looking for other Bluetooth phones.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:44.560]   All right.
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:50.040]   We're going to, that was Robert Young on the phone, the man who started Red Hat.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.120]   I think we had him on the screen savers.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.560]   He gave me a red hat which somebody's been egged.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.560]   No, no.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.560]   I remember it very well.
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.440]   You gave it to one of my guests.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.440]   What's his name?
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.440]   The guy who invented fuzzy?
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.440]   Logic?
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.600]   Yeah, the guy who invented fuzzy logic said, oh, that's it.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.080]   Well, here's what happened.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.080]   He's sitting there.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.080]   I can't remember his name.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.080]   He's a guy invented fuzzy logic, right?
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.440]   And he says, wow, that's a nice red hat.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.440]   I sure like that red hat.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.880]   Boy, I wish you'd give me that red hat.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:16.880]   Oh my goodness.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.280]   So I had to give him the red hat.
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.280]   You'd say give it to me.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.280]   Oh, I'd say you'd be very exaggerating.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.280]   That's not what I asked.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:25.520]   He's like, yes, I'm being a good host.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.520]   It was a great guest.
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:30.720]   It was like, you know, I tried to get a couple of Hawaiian shirts off of you and never
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.720]   caught them.
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.880]   You shouldn't let me know, John.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:38.040]   He has ways of providing me his wardrobe.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.920]   A lot of people had keys for that wardrobe.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:44.120]   You know, I'm resurrecting those Hawaiian shirts now that call for help is, oh, I can't
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.200]   tell you, I'm so sorry.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.200]   I wish I could.
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.920]   It's a secret until somebody puts out a press release.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.200]   It's like, you know, why aren't they putting out the press release?
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.480]   Think of all the publicity they've missed out.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.440]   I could have mentioned it on my radio show.
[00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.440]   We could have mentioned it on Twitter.
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:00.080]   Can't say a word because it's all about control, Mr. LaPorte.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:01.080]   And who has it?
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.080]   And apparently you don't.
[00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:07.160]   Anyway, we definitely don't want to prevent it from happening.
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.680]   So I'm not going to say anything.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.680]   That's exactly right.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.080]   It's I don't want to.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.080]   They win.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.920]   You've already said, guess what about call for help about six or eight times so people
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.520]   might be able to guess.
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.000]   Really good news.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.520]   It's being translated into Chinese.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:20.520]   Yes.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.160]   Leo's finally my major pays off.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.160]   That's right.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.720]   You can actually speak Chinese.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.720]   There's more Chinese than anybody else.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:28.720]   That's true.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.000]   Yeah, the penetration of PCs in China is in this hive.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.640]   Don, is there anything you want to talk about because Bob is going to have to unfortunately
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.880]   have to use his phone lines?
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:39.120]   Yeah, I mean, just the one thing is if you know there's a thing out there called the
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:42.960]   job destruction newsletter that's done by Rob Sanchez.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.960]   I love this.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.520]   And he got killed by AOL.
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.080]   They blocked him.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.800]   And apparently, as other people have been having trouble with AOL, you know, and there's
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.440]   some of their spam filters, I noticed that this is going on with a lot of these different
[00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:55.440]   systems.
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:01.480]   The AT&T had a black lifting strategy where they dig you down this black list for 30 days
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:02.480]   where they like it or not.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.480]   You can't get off of it.
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.480]   They don't figure that it's any reason.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:05.480]   I agree.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.480]   It's a real problem.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:10.720]   And so he's lost like 85 of his subscribers just because, you know, some unknown reason
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.120]   or, you know, his host or God knows what.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.960]   And you know, I've decided, I've got them writing about this for the magazine.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.360]   There's something owner is about these two trends.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:24.440]   One is type of email blocking and the other one is the, I think, the consolidation of
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:29.360]   all these services we're only going to have maybe one or two major, you know, backbones
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:33.360]   in this country and if somebody wants to do some IP filtering, you can pretty much control
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.320]   the way people, you know, what they can say out there.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:42.360]   I got blacklisted by one of their, there are a number of the orbs, maps, but there are
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:48.560]   a number of other black hole, real-time black hole services where if your IP address or
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:55.760]   range or your domain name is perceived by some mysterious black cloaked figure as being
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:00.760]   a spammer, they put you on this list and anybody who subscribes to this list, and I think
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:04.040]   it's probably what happened with AOL, they probably subscribed to a black hole list,
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.400]   will just automatically dump your addresses.
[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:12.520]   And Leoville got on one of these lists and it was a real problem because my ISP started
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:17.000]   subscribing to the black hole list and I said, "Get this, what are you, you're blocking
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.480]   everything."
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:21.440]   So I think that the problem is there's no appeal.
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.800]   These black hole lists, yeah, they're effective, but who makes these decisions?
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:29.400]   Yeah, I know, I have to do that, say, "No HTML in here."
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:33.600]   And yes, we've come full circle ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.600]   So, Gibson's fault.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.600]   It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:39.600]   it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:40.600]   it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:34:06.120]   it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
