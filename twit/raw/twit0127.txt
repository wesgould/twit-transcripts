[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   [ Sound Effects ]
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.440]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.440]   From people you trust.
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.040]   [ Music ]
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   This is Twit.
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.940]   [ Sound Effects ]
[00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.200]   Bandwidth for this weekend tech is provided by
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.480]   AOL Radio at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.520]   [ Music ]
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.480]   This is Twit, this weekend tech, episode 127 for January 14, 2008.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.880]   CES wrap up.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.800]   This show and the entire Twit Broadcast Network is brought to you by
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.200]   donations from listeners like you.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.200]   Thanks.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:53.040]   [ Music ]
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.320]   This is Twit, the post apocalypse version.
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.800]   No, no, the post CES version and I'm calling it the
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.360]   craptastic electronics show because I thought there was
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.880]   nothing worth talking about there but apparently I'm just wrong.
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.920]   And with us to show us why I'm wrong, Don Reisinger.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.520]   He is with CNET's digital home.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.520]   Hello, Don.
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.520]   Hey, Leo.
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.520]   It's digitalhome.cNET.com, yes?
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.520]   It's the digital home.
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.520]   I always forget the.
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.240]   Don't forget the the.
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.240]   It's the definite article digital home.com.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.640]   Also here, Tom Merritt, also from CNET from Buzz Out Loud and CNET TV.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.960]   Hey, how you doing, Tom?
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.960]   Hey, Leo.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.760]   I am working hard to award digitalhome.cNET.com to Don.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.760]   Can you get it for him?
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.760]   I think you'll send emails.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.520]   Now, had you guys met before CNET?
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.520]   No.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.520]   I met before CES?
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.520]   No.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.440]   We met at CES on Saturday for the first time.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.440]   That's great.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.440]   That's nice.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.080]   I'm glad we could bring you together the Twit family.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.600]   I didn't mean for this to be an all CNET show but the
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.560]   Dvorak isn't showing he was supposed to be here and we're
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.600]   trying to get some others and maybe some others will join us at the last minute.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.600]   But what the heck?
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.600]   I got nothing against it.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.800]   You guys went so I didn't have to go.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.080]   You kind of took a bullet for me.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.800]   I avoid CES like the plague.
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.800]   You don't need to go.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.440]   I mean, if you got in gadget was like a freaking wire service.
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.440]   Right.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.840]   Two many things to read between them and CNET and revision three and Mahalo daily.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.840]   Everybody was there.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.240]   You know, and that's just the Tiffany.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.240]   NBC Nightly News.
[00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.280]   Brian Williams was broadcasting from there.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.360]   I mean, really it's kind of fun to get your hands on a couple of products that I saw there.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.280]   Like the bug labs modules.
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.320]   But overall, you really can get just as much out of it staying at home.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.240]   And frankly, I don't think anybody does big announcements there anymore anyway.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.480]   No, I mean, there's probably.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.280]   I don't even know.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.280]   I don't know.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.760]   I mean, if even if you miss the news from a gadget and everybody else, I mean, you really
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.760]   miss much.
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.760]   Exactly.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.760]   What's the big story there?
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.760]   I don't know.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.760]   Well, okay.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.760]   Let me ask you both.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.320]   You know, there's well, there is the PT Barnum aspect, you know, the three ring circus
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:09.160]   aspect, the nine inch plasma TV from Pioneer that they're they can make, but they don't
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.120]   make and maybe they would make if somebody thought they could sell.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.120]   I don't know.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.720]   The 150 inch plasma from Panasonic.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.480]   It takes a 747 to move it and it can only move one at a time.
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.480]   That's not a joke.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.520]   It has to fit in the cone.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.160]   The nose cone cargo unit right in the middle because it's so big.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.040]   And then, and I guess you'd have to take the roof off the house if you wanted to put
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.040]   it in your house.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.280]   Well, you can't get it in the door.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.760]   It's not really a consumer model.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.760]   No.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.000]   So there's a lot of that going on.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.720]   In fact, that's been going on for years.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.320]   But it does seem like, you know, companies like Apple, for instance, who was a big consumer
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.880]   electronics player can, you know, do better just doing their own conference later.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.440]   Why try to compete against 2,699 other booths?
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.040]   Well, and you run into that with the industries themselves.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.360]   You know, the cell phone folks, they put all their best announcements at the CTI.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.320]   You know, the PMA and Photokina for the photo industry.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.320]   That's next week.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.480]   All the car shows for the for the car industry.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.720]   So I mean, I think sometimes people forget that CES is really about retailers and vendors
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.440]   and I'm trying to figure out what they're going to order for the next year.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.720]   It's not always about big announcements.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.720]   No.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.720]   They need it anymore.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.720]   I mean, I think I fret these kinds of big trade shows or dinosaurs.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.560]   But anyway, that's my phone.
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.280]   So what is this bug lab?
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.800]   What was that, Tom, that you saw?
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.160]   Yeah, bug labs is a platform.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.280]   It's a new company that's doing open source hardware and software and trying to make modular
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.640]   mini computers.
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.600]   So you start with a base computer.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.760]   It's like 128 megabytes of RAM, something like that with a small LCD screen on it.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.880]   And then you can buy an LCD screen module to put on it.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.360]   You can buy a GPS module.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.360]   You can put on it.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.840]   You can buy an accelerometer motion detector.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:03.040]   You know, so the one big app that they have so far from from the open source area is a
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.600]   geotegger for Flickr, right?
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.720]   I mean, that's just kind of a demonstration of, you know, you buy the camera module and
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.880]   you buy the GPS module and then you run this software on it.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.640]   And every photo you take is uploaded directly to Flickr and geoteg.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.440]   I mean, not the most practical application necessarily, but you know, the possibilities
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.400]   are literally endless.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.080]   Whether it takes off or not is a whole different matter, but it's certainly a cool little thing
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.600]   to play with and a cool idea.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.040]   Sounds like Lego Mindstorms for grownups almost.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.040]   It's totally Lego.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.400]   It's totally Lego computing.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.400]   How about you, Don?
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.520]   What was it you find?
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.080]   You know, I saw 150 inch plasma.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.080]   That was neat.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.920]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.760]   Before you go on, speak of the devil.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.520]   Let's add Ryan Block to the conversation.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.520]   Hey, Ryan.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.520]   Hey, can you hear me?
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.680]   I can hear you fine.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.680]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.840]   We were just saying how nobody needs to go to CES anymore because in gadgets got it
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.840]   covered.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.240]   Well, I definitely appreciate that sentiment.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.400]   It was like Tom Merritt, who's also on the line with Don Reisinger.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.600]   Merritt said that you were like a wire service for CES.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.200]   Oh, I'd like to think we do a little bit more than just act as a wire service.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.200]   Oh, man.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.800]   He's not even going to accept that compliment.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:26.200]   Well, no, I mean, it is definitely a compliment because even to be a wire service at CES is
[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.840]   unbelievably difficult because of the amount of news and the level of coverage that's required
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.840]   just to do that.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.120]   But I feel like we really, you know, we take it to the next step.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.120]   We don't just talk about all the new announcements.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.720]   I mean, we really go out there, we check them out, we play with them, we report back on what
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.920]   we found, we do video.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:48.040]   I mean, we really, you know, we do our best not to just kind of fall into that realm of,
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.000]   you know, if you want, you know, like a press release aggregator, you go to and get to it.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.320]   I hope that we don't give you that.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.120]   I clicked that link at the top of the page.
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:02.560]   It said, you know, CES version and certainly read all the in gadget coverage or CES.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.040]   But I have to say my reaction after reading it all was so what?
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.760]   I mean, ho, hum, I don't see anything really exciting coming out of CES.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.320]   We were, we actually have been running down some pics.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.120]   So let me, Don was about to start his Ryan and I'll get to you.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.120]   Okay.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.680]   Because I'm sure you did have something you liked there.
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.520]   You know, I felt that, uh, that I River really, really kind of, uh, brought out a huge line
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.520]   this year.
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.000]   I'm far bigger than any of the, hold on.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.400]   You'll get your chance in a second.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.400]   Don, right.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.400]   Don was about to tell us what you called it.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.400]   No, Don.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.640]   Actually, I agree with Ryan.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.760]   I think I River did things that are really special.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.840]   You can't wait a minute.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.600]   Now you can't steal Ryan.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.600]   I'll switch around.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.440]   I'll see what else I can find in the big grand rooms of garbage.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.840]   I'll try to find something.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.080]   But no, I mean, most of it was revolutionary in me and I just, you know, it was okay.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.080]   It was neat.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:59.840]   Um, I, like I said, do you guys really, I mean, I really liked the iPhone integration from
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.840]   Yahoo.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:01.840]   I thought that was pretty neat.
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:05.440]   Um, maybe just because I'm a little fed up with Google's iPhone app.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:13.320]   Um, like Yahoo showed it's a Yahoo go 3.0, which is, I think a pretty neat platform for
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.360]   cell phones.
[00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.520]   But they have a one specifically for the iPhone now.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:23.520]   I mean, they didn't really go as far as to say this is a specific iPhone app per se.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.440]   I mean, they didn't really want to go that far, but they said that this is how it looks
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.440]   in the iPhone.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.440]   It's unique to the iPhone.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.760]   So in my mind, it is just an iPhone app, but you know, be that as it may.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.600]   Uh, it was nice that had, you know, all this integration, you can scroll, you can see things
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.600]   you want.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.840]   Uh, a lot of, a lot of usability there that I don't always see with Google's app.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.400]   Um, I got a chance to meet with the, with the Blu-ray folks.
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.960]   Uh, I don't know if you want to get into that yet, but-
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.520]   Oh, we'll get into that in a second.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.520]   That was interesting.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.320]   That's the biggest story of CES and it didn't even happen to that CES.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.520]   Uh, now Ryan, you guys, uh, I'm seeing on the front page of Engadget right now, uh,
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.680]   I River might be doing an, an ebook.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.680]   Is that what you're talking about?
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.160]   Are you talking about their MP3 players?
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.480]   Um, well, pretty much everything.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.680]   I mean, I river comes to CES every year with a lot of prototypes and concept devices, stuff
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.880]   that may only ever come out in Korea.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.760]   Um, a lot of things that may never come out at all.
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:18.720]   Um, in CES 2007, they showed a two-sided ebook reader, um, which I, I was actually super
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.720]   into.
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:25.360]   Um, you know, it's basically instead of one kind of tablet style, um, pain of, you have
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.520]   two side by side.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:30.480]   So it's actually, you know, you finish reading one page and you look physically to the next
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.480]   page onto the right.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.480]   A lot more natural.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.480]   Right.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.480]   It definitely feels natural.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.480]   I mean, you know, it makes it thicker and you have to unfold in everything, but it's
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.960]   a little bit more of a book, book reading like experience.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.640]   Um, so not, you know, I'm not too shocked that they're still working on that and kind of,
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.120]   you know, trying to determine whether or not they want to do it, but you know, they, they
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.560]   had a phone there too, which is pretty surprising.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.560]   Wow.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.560]   And I river phone.
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.560]   Yeah.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.680]   It was kind of, you know, like a lot of their other stuff as a prototype.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.880]   So I think we have Apple to thank for all these phones.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:04.000]   Maybe I don't think that Apple really legitimized the cell phone space or anything.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.520]   I mean, you know, it's obviously a huge industry and they were pretty.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.920]   No, but what they did, and I thought there was a great article, by the way, in, in Wired
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.080]   magazine about this.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.520]   And I think he made a very good point.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.320]   The author, whose name escapes me right now is a great.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.320]   Vocal scene.
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.320]   Fred Vocal scene.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:25.080]   Um, that up until the iPhone, they were, you know, cheapo throwaway phones that were
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.280]   just a come on for the cell phone company, just to get you get the service.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.240]   What kind of established it could be a premium product that people would want in and of
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.240]   itself.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.240]   That changed things.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.400]   In the US market, I would agree with that.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.120]   Outside the US market, I don't.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.520]   I think that there are a lot of generalizations that get made about the cell phone industry.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.520]   It's a different business.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:43.520]   It's wildly from country to country.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.520]   No, it's true.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.520]   It's very different.
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.520]   You know, the cell phone industry here was hanging on to an outdated model for a long time where
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.960]   the rest of the world had moved on, I think, you know, as, as essentially what was going
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.960]   on.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.680]   And it took Apple to finally push them into the present, I think.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:03.620]   I was, you know, I don't really necessarily think it's all the cell phone industry's fault
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:04.620]   either.
[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.120]   I had a chance to talk to some people over at Palm.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.680]   I don't even know if I should say.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:08.680]   Do they still exist?
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.680]   Are they still in business?
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.680]   Oh, they exist, right?
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.680]   Tom?
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.680]   They're around.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.680]   They're around, yeah.
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:15.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.680]   I mean, I got a chance.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.920]   I think it was his vice president, whoever he was.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:23.520]   And he said that, you know, Palm has really wanted to do to focus on some of his core competencies
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:29.680]   and add and make some unbelievable features in a phone and get rid of all the extra stuff.
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.440]   But you know, there a lot of ways are governed by the cell phone company saying, well, we
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.200]   need this, we need that to be in a phone because we want to sell it.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.960]   And I really thought that was interesting because, you know, they actually came out and said,
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.440]   listen, you know, we want to do more.
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.960]   We want to be able to give you the things you really want, but we're kind of, we can
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.480]   have our hands tied to some extent.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.840]   Hey, let's get John C. Devorek on this because it really wouldn't be the same without John
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:50.840]   going, and all sucks.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.040]   I'm going to ring him right now.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.960]   He just called me and said, he said, I have something to say.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.960]   All sucks.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.360]   Let's see if we can get him on.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.680]   You think that's what it's going to be?
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.680]   I don't know.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.600]   I think John, you know, John's been famous for not going to CES.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.920]   Hey, John, see Devorek.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.160]   I want to check in my microphone.
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.160]   Fill out of its thing.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.680]   I think that's the technical term.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.920]   He did go to CES this year, though.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.920]   He did.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:15.920]   That documented the process.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:16.920]   He actually went.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:17.920]   Oh, did he do a cranky geese?
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:18.920]   No, this is good.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.920]   This is good radio right now.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.560]   He's definitely in the process right now.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:26.200]   I got it all patched up.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.200]   There you go.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.840]   I put this little thing in other microphones.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.840]   I got it back.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.840]   Actually, you know, the feed is back, but I put this little, I've invented a little device
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.840]   that blocks the sound so it shouldn't get any feedback.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.840]   What are you talking down a cone?
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.880]   Is that what it sounds like?
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.880]   It's going to funnel on.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.880]   Are those drops in Devorek?
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.880]   All right.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:47.880]   You know.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.880]   So does this sound better?
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:55.000]   Millions of dollars of engineering have gone into that microphone.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.360]   And John has taken a toilet paper tube and attached it to the front.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.600]   I don't like those.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.600]   All right.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.600]   No, you sound better with that.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.600]   Are you getting feedback?
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.600]   Is that the problem?
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.160]   No, I was just never mind.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.160]   So John, you went.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.800]   I went last year too, unfortunately.
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.240]   Yeah, but that you kind of went kicking and screaming last year.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.320]   Sounds like this year you actually intended to go.
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.320]   No.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.320]   Yeah, well, no.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.120]   We had the 25th anniversary of the PC magazine party.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.360]   Are we running here?
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.120]   Yeah, we were rolling for a while.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:30.040]   Did they drag out the old Spencer Cat costume?
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.720]   No, that's that's we can.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.320]   They sold that part of the company off.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.800]   That's our asking off.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:38.440]   Somebody's got the Spencer the Cat costume.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.440]   I would think.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.440]   I would think.
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.440]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.440]   I don't know where it is.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.280]   That was the big party, the Spencer the Cat party.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.120]   People would go through that.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.920]   Bill Gates would be there.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:54.720]   And then like at midnight some guy in a mangy cat costume would come in.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.480]   It's a famous promotion.
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.920]   Anyway, so this party was the 25th anniversary of PC magazine.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:00.920]   Right.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.120]   And you know who was there?
[00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.760]   It was Kurt Schilling.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.760]   The picture.
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:05.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.920]   The baseball player.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.320]   Yeah, it's pretty funny.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.160]   Yeah, he's got a video game company that he was flagging.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.720]   That's it.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.040]   That was the highlight of the party right there.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.040]   Pretty much.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:22.880]   That was the highlight of CES for you, John.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.920]   No, the highlight of CES was, and I think this is, I haven't seen the cranky geeks, but
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.240]   we filmed a lot of little stuff around town.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:36.480]   And one of the things that was the highlight was, and I recommend people go there to 3,
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.920]   3, 3, 0, East Tropicana to the pinball museum.
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.920]   The pinball machine museum.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.440]   There's 200 machines there.
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.440]   And they're all playable.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.440]   They let you play them all.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.120]   And all the money, it doesn't cost anything to go in.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.120]   And all the money from the pinball machines goes to charity.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:57.760]   Well, I gotta tell you, I'm so glad I didn't go to CES this year.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:58.760]   150.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:03.000]   They say that about CES every year.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.120]   Every year, it's a, you know, with fewer or greater amounts of exceptions that nothing
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.600]   happens at CES.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.160]   But yet everybody goes in greater and greater numbers every year.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.160]   Why isn't it?
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.160]   It was down this year, wasn't it?
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.080]   They'd say they were, it was 140,000 down from 150,000.
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.680]   Attendance was down.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.120]   Press coverage was up though.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.880]   1600 press people.
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:25.880]   Which is, that's a good thing.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.720]   Brian Williams effect.
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.920]   They're wishing they didn't let, or maybe you're talking about the Brian Lam effect.
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.160]   They're wishing they didn't let Gizmodo in.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.160]   Come on, Ryan, here's your chance.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.800]   At least didn't allow a remote in his hand.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.800]   You know, I don't know.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.080]   I don't really know what to say about that.
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.000]   You can recuse yourself on this one.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   I typically do.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.480]   I don't really like to talk about.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.360]   Yeah, that's just, this is the opposite.
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.040]   Can I say something about that incident?
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.040]   Yes.
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.480]   And I think people should have it explained to him.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:56.440]   First of all, one of the guys from Gizmodo floated, or he, he found some device that
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.880]   you could turn TV sets on.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.440]   It's been around for a while.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.440]   Yeah.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.320]   Yeah, some that when you, can you take it to a bar and then if you don't like the football
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.720]   game, you can hit the button secretly and it turns off the TV and the bar.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.000]   It turns off all TVs, essentially.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.280]   And so he's floating around one of these, who was it by the way that did it?
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.280]   I don't know.
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:17.160]   He's a guy Richard Blakely, I believe.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.160]   A band for life from CES now.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.160]   Yeah, big deal.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:25.520]   So anyway, he went around to a bunch of demos and like a 12 year old was turning off the
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.440]   displays thinking it was hilarious.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:32.120]   The kid was, he was a 12 year old with a press group, the official press credential.
[00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.880]   But yeah, but what difference does it make?
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.640]   Whether he had a official press credential, he could have been a showgoer doing the same
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.640]   thing.
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:42.320]   So I can't generalize that it's just bloggers that do this sort of thing.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.880]   If anyone could have done it, it didn't have to just be, you know, someone who constantly
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.320]   comes from a bar.
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:50.640]   Well, but they did make a video about it, about how funny it was and put it up.
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.560]   I mean, they were essentially trying to drive traffic.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.760]   It seems to me a classic gizmodo stunt.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.760]   If you ask me.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.400]   Yeah, I mean, it's a much money.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.400]   It costs people.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.680]   I mean, a soccer meet pays its riders.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.760]   Is that, is that the problem that Gawker doesn't pay enough?
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.480]   No, they actually have a new payment system.
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.480]   Nobody about traffic.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.480]   Right?
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.480]   Yeah, based on traffic now.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:15.680]   Oh, so there's a lot of incentive to do the kinds of things that would drive traffic.
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:19.120]   Yeah, there's a base monthly salary and then you get a bonus based on how much traffic
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.120]   you drive.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:25.920]   Now the CEA, the Consumer Entertainment Association that runs CES did ban him for life, but they
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:30.400]   haven't decided on sanctions for either gizmodo or Gawker media.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.640]   But that sounds like maybe both should be sanctioned.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.840]   I don't know if I'll be kidding.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.720]   I thought they would try to punish the guy instead of ban him for life from CES.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.240]   That seems like a reward.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.480]   That's what I was thinking.
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:48.560]   Yeah, I heard somebody, I don't know if it was you, Don, saying how much money this cost.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:52.480]   I mean, how does it actually really cost people money just in lost demos?
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.800]   I mean, it seems one of it was a press conference, right?
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.960]   Disruptive, but fairly...
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.360]   Yeah, I mean, one of them was a press conference number one, Motorola.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.080]   But no one I think it is more than anything.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.160]   I think it's these companies come here and they spend X number of millions of dollars
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.840]   that have these huge setups.
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:11.840]   And knowing half these companies, they probably have it broken down to how much it costs them
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:16.440]   per minute and how much they can expect because X number of people are watching their displays
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.440]   and all this stuff.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.440]   They probably have it all written down.
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.040]   So just in case anything like this might have happened.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.720]   And now he goes to, he's been Panasonic.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:27.040]   I think it was with the Panasonic and he turned all the televisions off.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.720]   It wouldn't surprise me whatsoever if Panasonic calls up CES and says, "Listen, you guys are
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.240]   in charge of security.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.240]   You guys should have..."
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.840]   Now, of course, could they have stopped it?
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.800]   No, I mean, there's really no way to stop some guy bringing a remote in.
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.240]   But it wouldn't surprise me whatsoever if Panasonic said, "Listen, you might have cost
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.240]   us maybe 50,000 dollars in case..."
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.240]   We want to give us a rebate.
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.240]   And so I want to sell it somewhat of a rebate because you didn't do your job in securing
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.200]   the area and making sure things like this doesn't happen.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.200]   And you know...
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.880]   Well, they say they have to take it seriously.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.880]   You're right.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:19:00.760]   I believe, I don't know this for a fact, but I would doubt that they could do that because
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:05.880]   I suspect that like with anything else, there's a licensing, not a license agreement, but
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:11.240]   there's an agreement when you attend that you will hold CES harmless and blameless and
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.240]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, if you like to...
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.240]   Me too.
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.240]   If the power goes out or whatever.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:21.000]   Yeah, there are probably all kinds of force majeure and all kinds of stuff in the context.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.080]   CES isn't demified against acts of God and Brian Lamb.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.080]   That's interesting.
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.080]   There's a thought.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.080]   You know, I mean...
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.200]   But it's a childish thing for them to do.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.320]   I don't really want to get too much into it, but I mean, obvious reason, you know, they're
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:40.040]   kind of competing in the same space as us and all of that and Engaging Gizmoder frequently
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.040]   compared.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.040]   But I will say this.
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:51.000]   You know, all judgments aside, you know, press are invited as guests to attend the show.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.760]   You know, this show, although it's very press driven, is not only for press.
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:02.400]   I mean, this show, it has a lot of dealers and retailers and partners and this is a business
[00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.640]   show.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:09.840]   And these companies are out to impress other companies who are going to sell their goods
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.880]   or, you know, resell their goods or OEM their goods or what have you just as much as they
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:17.000]   are out to impress those press who are on hand.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.160]   So anybody who's there is a guest of the show.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:26.920]   And I feel that, you know, that's a privilege and not a right.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.680]   And you know, a hardware partner or retailer or what have you.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.920]   It doesn't matter who you are.
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.360]   You should always treat that with some level of respect and gravitas.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.360]   I think it was one of those.
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:39.880]   Let me throw one more thing in there.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:44.920]   I'm not going to fall over myself as some fabulous privilege to go to this thing.
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:49.440]   But I think if there's a legal action that could be taken, it could be taken against
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:55.440]   Gizmodo for, you know, restrain a trade or I mean, there's a lot of possibilities here
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.760]   if you're of the legal, you know, litigious sort.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.360]   And if I was the people that gives mode, I'd be a little freaked out about the potential
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:06.880]   for some some lawsuits aimed at me, not at CES at all.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.120]   You think the guy was freelancing?
[00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.640]   He wasn't he wasn't acting on the instructions.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:17.800]   I did see that there's some Nevada regulation that actually states that it is explicitly
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:23.280]   illegal to disrupt any kind of, you know, presentation or company presentation or anything
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.560]   like that for no particular reason.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.560]   I mean, I think that there are actually laws against it.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:31.560]   I don't I don't really honestly think that anybody's going to go after them on, you know,
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.560]   court of law.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:38.120]   I mean, you have to be serious about what you're doing when you want to take the media to
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:41.960]   task because people have a field day when that kind of thing happens.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.920]   So I don't think Gizmodo is going to face anything in terms of that.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.760]   But I think it's funny.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:48.760]   Any what's that?
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.920]   They'd be just as funny as their gag.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:56.320]   Well, first thing I thought what I heard about this was it sounds like the yippies or
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.320]   the situations.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:02.600]   That's what I like to be talking about, you know, very Mary Prankster sort of behavior.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:06.240]   But then it's it's Gizmodo and you know, they're not doing it because they're trying
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.240]   to subvert the culture.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.880]   They're trying to drive page views.
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.880]   Right.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.480]   Yeah, I mean, I think it was actually on scene.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:15.960]   I don't know who wrote it, but he said something and almost immediately he brought it to this
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:20.160]   argument that what is this doing for the blogger community is the first time they finally
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.160]   went.
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.800]   You know, and I looked at that and I kind of said, is this guy serious?
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.760]   I mean, like, I think John touched on this.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.800]   I mean, this has nothing to do with being a blogger.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:29.800]   I mean, I could have done it.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.760]   You know, Tom, you could have anyone like John said, anyone else could have done it.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.000]   I mean, I don't think this should be an indictment on bloggers.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.760]   My way of the way, I mean, bloggers were there.
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:40.080]   A pro journalist is known to know better than to do something like that.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.960]   And so the thought would be, well, you let these amateurs in.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.280]   Who knows what's going to happen?
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:48.160]   Yeah, but the point still is that a showgoer could have done it.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.560]   So what's it got to do with bloggers?
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.560]   Well, yeah, this is a stop letting it.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.560]   This is a public.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.320]   You know, yes, all blog.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.680]   This is this is Gawker media.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.880]   I mean, yeah, they do a blog, but this is, you know, they're, they're fairly established
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.040]   website at this point.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.520]   It's not just beyond blogging.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:06.480]   Isn't there, wasn't there a blogger credential that's different from the press credential,
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.480]   didn't they?
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.360]   I think I think basically I think I saw some people with white badges.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.120]   Some had red badges for press.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.120]   White was blogger.
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.120]   Red was press.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.120]   And I had it.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.080]   It's not differentiated though in terms of the show.
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.960]   People got to choose what they want.
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:20.960]   Oh, the shoes.
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:24.320]   It's basically gestural only when you register for CES.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:28.560]   You get to say, when you're going through the press registration, you get to specify,
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.120]   am I press press or am I blogger press?
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.840]   Do you think a company like Pioneer treats a blogger press differently than the press
[00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:35.840]   press?
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:36.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:37.840]   Do you think a company like Pioneer treats?
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.000]   No, no, they treat everybody like crapped Leo.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   So there's a negative.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.560]   See, no, I think they do.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:47.160]   I mean, you know, when they look at that badge and they say, you know, Joe blows tech
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.600]   blog, they're going to say, okay.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:52.600]   And then look at somebody would say, gizmodo and gadget, CNET, whatever, they're going
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:53.600]   to say, oh, okay.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.600]   Now I've heard of this guy.
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:55.760]   Maybe we should talk to him.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:56.880]   I've heard of this publication.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.880]   I think, you know, I don't think it's humanly possible to not do that to some extent for
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:01.880]   these people.
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:02.880]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.800]   But at the end of the day, it was really up to the people who were attending the show
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.280]   to decide how they wanted to be perceived.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.280]   Probably more.
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.160]   I don't think there's any argument that maybe bloggers would be viewed as second class citizens
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.280]   as they often are.
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.760]   But you get to choose whether or not you want to categorize yourself that way.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.160]   And as far as I know, the CEA doesn't enforce badges.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.040]   That's because they lost their nerve.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:25.040]   They wanted to.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.960]   They wouldn't have created that blogger class if they hadn't really had that fall.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:29.960]   Well, it started.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.560]   Oh, let me add another anecdote here because I went last year and I noticed this.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:37.240]   I remember about three or four years ago, if you tried to get into that show and you
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.080]   were a blogger, you could forget about it.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.080]   You weren't getting in.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.400]   Bloggers made a big stink about it.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.280]   And they bitched and moaned and groaned and they did that for about a year.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.640]   And then the CES relented.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.440]   And last year they were so lax.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.120]   I swear to God, this is true because I took somebody with me.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:58.640]   You could walk into the press credentialing area at the sands and just say hi and they'd
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.640]   give you credentials.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.200]   They weren't checking for anything.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.640]   So I assume that they weren't checking much this year either.
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.480]   And now they're going to change their policy.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.080]   They've never really come up with a reasonable policy.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.840]   I think some bloggers should have already always gotten in.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.880]   They probably get a lot of bloggers out there that have more readers than anybody that works
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.880]   for a newspaper.
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:23.880]   They'll probably get a lot of pressure from the booth holders to let these guys.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.640]   Some say let them in because we want to reach these guys.
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.760]   Some say, oh forget it.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.760]   They're not real press.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.360]   I'm sure it's a difficult road to hoe.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.000]   We had one oversell us.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.200]   Bloghouse attended.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.520]   Not allow one of the scenic guys into the blog house because he had a press badge on
[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:39.800]   instead of a blogger badge.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.800]   Right on, man.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.920]   That was sort of an unusual occurrence.
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:48.200]   The new press in the blog house, man.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.720]   Because I was invited to the blog house.
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.040]   I didn't have time to go to it.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.640]   I was too busy playing pinball machines.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.040]   You got to write down a slash blog.
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:55.040]   I had no red badge.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.040]   So they probably would have kept me.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.240]   That'd be an interesting situation to keep me out.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.720]   I heard a plenty of press who got into bloghouse without a problem.
[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:05.240]   But some at one point, one person manning the door wouldn't let Kevin Massey from scene
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.720]   at infinity at a press badge.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.200]   And I said, no, it's bloggers only.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.200]   He's like, I'm doing a blog.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.280]   You have to put your jammies on, man.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:12.720]   Put your jammies on and we'll let you in.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.720]   If you come in, Dr. Denz.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.720]   I think the big--
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:21.120]   No, Ryan, did you all do press badge or blog badge or mix it up or what?
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.120]   Good question.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.120]   For a good question.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:27.960]   You know, I told my team to register as press as we usually do.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.160]   Not that I don't-- I think that being called a blogger is a pejorative or anything.
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.720]   I just figured it'd be easiest if we kept it consistent and kept it as press.
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:38.720]   And I kind of feel at this point, we're owned by a corporate entity and all that stuff.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.960]   We have a very large readership.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.720]   We know we are bloggers.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.440]   We're thought of as press more than bloggers.
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:47.920]   So we had some people who registered as bloggers anyway.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.880]   I mean, I don't think it makes any difference, honestly.
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:55.480]   Well, you know, there's one thing I know is I didn't go to the blog house this year.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.480]   I went last year.
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.440]   And I was-- I think I've been moaning on this.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.440]   What is blog house?
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.000]   So people know what you're talking about.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Blog houses are set at one of the companies.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.200]   I think it began with-- I don't know, was it Pod Tech or somebody.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:12.840]   They took a suite at one of the hotels and then they set up a whole bunch of wireless
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:18.120]   and let these bloggers come in and do reporting from there with access.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.440]   Like you can't do there from your own room, but whatever.
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.360]   It was just kind of a communal thing.
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:26.600]   But last year, I remember that this-- the blog house with the food, they got a food and
[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:27.840]   stuff like that.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:32.280]   It was really a pretty cool setup compared to the regular press room, which I thought
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.680]   was shabby.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:37.120]   But this year, the press room of the CES show was unbelievable.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.040]   I mean, they had cappuccino machines.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.720]   They had a million computers set up that you could use it.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.800]   You can make international phone calls.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.520]   It was wild.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.880]   This was one of the best press rooms I've ever seen ever anywhere.
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.000]   Well, that sounds like a reason to go to CES.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   Now you've given me an actual reason.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   Capuccino machines.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   And fresh cookies, too.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   These were fresh cookies.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.960]   Fresh cookies and a cappuccino machine.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.960]   I didn't get any of that.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.520]   I didn't spend any time in the press room.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:07.520]   There you go.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:08.520]   You're on the wrong side of the hall, Tom.
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:09.520]   There you go.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.520]   Yeah, serious.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.520]   Okay.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:12.520]   So it was really a great press room.
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.320]   I've never really-- they've never done it as a good a job.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.640]   In fact, I've been to a lot of press rooms on other shows.
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.560]   And this is the best-- one of the best press rooms I've ever seen.
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:24.000]   John, did you see any gadget, anything on the show floor that you thought was important?
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.280]   We mentioned the 150-inch plasma.
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.400]   We mentioned the In 9.
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:33.880]   Yeah, I hope POG, or as I used to pronounce it, "Hapage" has a--
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:34.880]   "Hapage."
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:38.000]   Have you changed their name to POG?
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.240]   No, it's still a POG.
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.240]   Too bad.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.240]   Anyway, POG--
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:45.240]   But if you see a single worst name in I've ever heard of, it's--
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.720]   It's really hard to spell it.
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.360]   Nobody could pronounce it.
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:52.000]   Unless you're from Long Island, you don't know what it is.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.120]   So anyway, they've got a device for $250.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:29:00.840]   It's essentially an outlet from the analog hole in HDTV.
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:07.280]   If you try to, for example, run-- if you run an HD signal out of your dish network through
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:15.280]   a composite video, you can't really record that signal in any way, shape or form.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:21.080]   They've set up some system here where you can download the signal onto a hard disk and
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:26.640]   then burn it onto a DVD and full HD on a regular DVD, by the way, because they've got
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:31.840]   it compressed just to the point where it fills up the whole disk at two hours on a regular
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:32.840]   DVD.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:36.240]   So you can take-- so in other words, you've got all that HD content coming off of your
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:42.000]   dish and replay TV or not replay it, but direct TV, whatever it is.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:49.480]   You can now download, capture, and then burn to DVDs, HD content without worrying about
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.160]   all the hassles of the flags and the rest of it.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:58.640]   Is that HDVMD, the technology that compresses it to the DVD size?
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.640]   I don't know.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.880]   Do you remember?
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:05.400]   Because that's the one technology that we kind of thought is a wild card in the whole
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:10.240]   high-def DVD race is this HDVMD, but it's pretty much only used overseas.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.160]   I don't know what they're using for the compressing.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.160]   It's only a stopgap anyway.
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:19.520]   The real idea here is to go from that to just burning on Blu-ray or something like that.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:26.320]   If you try to get that-- if you look at these burners and all the rest of the HD stuff,
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:29.640]   they don't let you take a composite video signaling.
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.840]   It has to go through HDMI and it's got copy protection and all this other stuff.
[00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.920]   This bypasses all that.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:36.920]   That sounds like a good product.
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.240]   Do you know what the name of it is?
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.520]   It was just a prototype so they don't have a name for it yet.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:42.520]   It's not selling it yet.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:47.840]   And the new Slingsbox Pro-- the new Slingsbox Pro HD isn't even going to have an HDMI port
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:51.280]   on it because they didn't want to mess with trying to license it anymore.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.200]   So you just got a component.
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.120]   No, it's actually less to do with licensing.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:31:02.960]   They've never done HDMI on their HD products so far like the original Slingsbox Pro with
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:04.760]   HD Connect and the Slingsbox Solo.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:11.440]   The reason being because the DHCP, the encryption mechanisms on HDMI are so restrictive and
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:16.360]   so difficult to work with and basically would kind of make doing what Slingsbox does impossible.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:18.080]   Yeah, that's what I mean.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:21.400]   In other words, they didn't want to have to mess with trying to license the ability to
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.880]   decrypt all that so they said forget it.
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:24.880]   Just to--
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.720]   Well, I mean, it's not even about the ability to license it.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:32.360]   It's actually about when you decrypt it, you have to do something with that stream that
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.760]   is not sending it to an unprotected source.
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.240]   That's the license I'm talking about.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.960]   The license to copy it, which nobody's going to give you.
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:46.320]   So Slings-- that reminds me that a year ago, Slings announced an Apple TV kind of a box
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.000]   that they still haven't shipped that, have they?
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Slingscatcher, right?
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Slingscat.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   Yeah, they announced it again this year.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   Oh, good.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   That's what I love best about CES.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   They re-announced the last season.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.920]   They have it in a box this year.
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:00.160]   So they promise it's going to ship.
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.320]   It was supposed to ship last spring, but I'm not going to-- who's going to-- I'm not
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.320]   going to call them on it.
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.320]   They actually--
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.160]   They have their act together on it this year.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:11.520]   I also ran into one other interesting product that just was amusing to me anyway.
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:12.680]   Kodak has a bunch of printers.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:16.280]   It's a shame that they don't just don't release the software for everybody.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.400]   Kodak brought a bunch of photo printers out.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:21.160]   And they have a piece of software that you run through.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:25.840]   And you remember how Nikon had that-- you know, and they had the software system for
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:30.840]   slide scanners, and you hit a button and it would take all the dirt and crap off the
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.880]   slides and kind of clean them up automatically.
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.240]   This one does the same thing to faces.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.240]   So if you'd have a--
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.440]   It takes all the dirt and crap off faces.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:44.120]   It takes the pimples and all these other things off of your face.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.480]   What do they call that?
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.480]   It's a pimple remover.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.480]   I don't know what it is.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.480]   They're pressing.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.480]   They have-- there's a name.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.480]   It's just-- I don't know what this is a problem.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.480]   I didn't write it--
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.880]   The Eunuchifier Pro.
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:57.800]   But it does-- but you can see the side by side and it really makes somebody look a lot
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:58.800]   better.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.400]   Oh, I need that filter.
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.240]   They've put in their cameras from some time.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.240]   They've put a slim filter.
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:08.040]   Yeah, and I think that this cleanup filter is going to be in some of their newer cameras
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.040]   too.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.040]   I know they have the slim-- slimmerizer.
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.040]   But I think they'll be-- this too.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:15.040]   So you'll be able to like take a picture of something and make them actually look decent.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.880]   This is for middle America.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.880]   You've had--
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.880]   They sell goggles that do that.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.880]   They call beer goggles.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:22.880]   Beer goggles.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.120]   That's called a couple of Boddington's.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.120]   Well, they--
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:32.800]   Did anyone actually see that the TV Guide is starting maybe to come out of the-- out
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:33.800]   of the casket?
[00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:34.800]   Wait a minute.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:35.800]   TV Guide.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.360]   Now, that used to be a Tribune company.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:38.360]   Who owns them these days?
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.360]   I think it's-- I can't remember exactly how old--
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.360]   Is Rupert Murdoch own them now?
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.360]   I don't know who owns them.
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.360]   I don't know who owns them.
[00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.360]   It's Rupert Murdoch.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.360]   No, it's a Murdoch company.
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:47.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.000]   I think it was called My TV Guide.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.480]   And it's kind of how it works.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:55.440]   It utilizes the internet connection on the set-top box or maybe even if it's in these
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.080]   new HD TVs and stuff.
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.240]   And I guess what they-- basically they explained it.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.960]   I was in there for too long, but it was kind of like supplemental material while you're
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:06.680]   browsing through the guide and doing whatever else.
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:09.800]   Well, you know what the number one channel on cable is right?
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:12.280]   It's the TV Guide channel.
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.280]   Far and away.
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.280]   Is it still?
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.280]   It's moving across.
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.320]   But nobody read me who watches.
[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:23.280]   I mean, you just sit there and wait for the things to come around.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.800]   They put crap on there, though.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:30.440]   So did anybody else go-- when they were at CES check out the NBC decided to put a studio
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.440]   in there for--
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.440]   Yeah, Brian Williams.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.440]   I guess he's seen--
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.440]   Brian Williams is there.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.440]   Yeah, he was.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.960]   I never managed to bump into him.
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.120]   Maybe not as invited to their party.
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.640]   I just couldn't get there.
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:44.000]   But the-- I thought he was very good on the Bill Gates farewell video.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.440]   Well, that was very funny.
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.440]   Isn't that funny?
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.320]   But did anybody go there because it was unbelievable?
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:54.280]   I mean, because we-- when we had Tech TV, we did some live stuff.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:58.960]   And we've seen other kinds of studios, especially modern studios that use some of them more,
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.720]   let's say, cheaper gear.
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:06.960]   And then this studio that they set up-- I mean, I've never seen so many-- what a jumble
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.960]   of cables and wires and cameras.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.200]   That's how the boys do it, baby.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.200]   It was a mess.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.480]   They don't put tin foil on their microphones.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.480]   No siree.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.160]   They got the real gear.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:20.160]   Let's hear Brian Williams, the Bill Gates farewell video.
[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.160]   This was--
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.240]   It is a day the industry never thought would come.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:29.960]   Join us all day as we report on Bill Gates last full day at Microsoft.
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.120]   He's got a good sense of humor, though.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:36.920]   He did that for us when we-- was it Brian Williams or was it Tom Brokon?
[00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:41.200]   It was Tom Brokon who did that when we launched Tech TV.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.200]   Did a little bit for us.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.200]   Yeah, I think it was Brokon.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:47.520]   So they got a good sense of humor over there at NBC.
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:51.920]   I don't know how they got Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, George Clooney, Bono, and Al Gore
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:52.920]   to be on there.
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:53.920]   Matthew McConaughey, too.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:55.360]   Well, yeah, you know what?
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:56.360]   The thing that--
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.200]   How's the largest fortune of any man in the world?
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.200]   Yeah, I guess it probably gives me--
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.120]   It doesn't have any money, right?
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:05.120]   Some of us-- or somebody out there has got to find as who it was, who was the Booker
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.520]   on this deal, because whoever it was that that lined up all these people was not--
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:13.880]   Because you didn't-- I mean, let's face it, Bill wasn't calling around.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:14.880]   But somebody was.
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:15.880]   I'd like to know who it was.
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.880]   I'm calling for the--
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.680]   Well, my dog, Django, probably could have dif-- booked that.
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:19.680]   I mean, you just like-- it's Bill Gates.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:20.680]   Oh, yeah, we'll do it.
[00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.240]   Bill Gates on live one.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.640]   Well, yeah, that always sounds-- yeah, in theory, that sounds right.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.760]   But the fact is, you first, you got to track the people down.
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.760]   Yeah, you got to get to the right person.
[00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.120]   It's really a painful thing.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.360]   It's not like, you know, you're on Twitter and saying, "Hi."
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.080]   We need to get Barack Obama, and then he calls the next day, which would be the case
[00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.080]   with this audience we have.
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.640]   Of course, like that.
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:46.440]   Actually, the creepiest thing is he's lifted-- when he's doing the bench press with Barack--
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.320]   whether that-- Barack Obama is his trainer.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.320]   No.
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.800]   That Matthew McConaughey is his trainer.
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.720]   I've never seen skinnier arms in my life.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:54.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.640]   I mean, I thought that was a joke, but it's not.
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:01.160]   He's really got-- it's painful.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:02.160]   I feel--
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.160]   I feel--
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.160]   I feel--
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.160]   One rep, though, that was good.
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.160]   One rep with just the bar.
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:09.200]   Yeah, just the bar.
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.640]   So the big story to me that CES was one that--
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.600]   By the way, I'm sorry, I don't want to interrupt.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:17.120]   By the way, anyone who wants to see that video, it's on my blog, Devorg/blog.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:18.960]   As it is on leoville.com/blog.
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.160]   And YouTube, I mean, it's on YouTube.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.160]   Oh, yeah, YouTube.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.160]   That's right.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.160]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.160]   It's easy to embed.
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:26.160]   Hard--
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.160]   Of course, it's better to go watch it.
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.160]   Leo or John's blog.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.160]   Right.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:30.160]   Give us the credit.
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.160]   Or mine when I go and post it now that I've had the idea.
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.080]   John's got advertising on his blog.
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.080]   Go watch it on his.
[00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.080]   He'll get some benefit out of it.
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.080]   I don't want to.
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.080]   I get nothing.
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.080]   Nothing.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:44.520]   The big story was, of course, Devorg-- do we say Devorg/blog?
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:45.520]   No.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:46.520]   Devorg--
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:47.520]   I'm drinking, though.
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.520]   Wait a minute.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:54.080]   Like a little Jack Daniels here.
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:57.400]   Devorg/blog.
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.640]   The big story was, of course, the HD DVD story.
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.000]   And that came out four days before CES.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.200]   Must have put a little consternation in the bonnets of the HD DVD exhib-- exhibitors
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.200]   on the floor.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.200]   Warner Brothers.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.200]   Oh, wait.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.600]   Did not interrupt again, even though I'm an interrupting mood.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.600]   Go ahead.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.000]   Think about the people that had speeches prepared.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   Right.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   Well, the party.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.760]   The whole HD DVD party was canceled.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.000]   They canceled the press conference.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.160]   Microsoft was going to-- supposedly going to announce an Xbox 360 with an embedded HD
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.160]   DVD player.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.160]   Never mind.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:29.600]   No, that was never going to happen.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.600]   You don't think that was going to happen?
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.120]   I completely called BS on that rumor.
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.120]   I always have.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.120]   Yeah, I wondered.
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.280]   You see, you don't think so, huh?
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.080]   No, I've never thought so.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:41.680]   They made great sales on the $179 HD DVD add-on.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:48.400]   Microsoft has absolutely no incentive to add an HD DVD player integrated into the 360.
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.400]   They want to drive cost down.
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.400]   They want to sell more units.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.320]   That's just going to drive their cost up, lower their profit, their margin, per device.
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.120]   But they were in the HD DVD camp.
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:57.120]   They were--
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:59.440]   They were the HD DVDs over the internet on Xbox Live.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.160]   I mean, there's no reason for them to do it.
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:04.640]   But they will only reason they offer an HD DVD player is so that they can say they can
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.400]   compete against PlayStation 3.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.400]   No, well, I--
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.400]   I might disagree.
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.400]   I disagree with that.
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.400]   I disagree.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.400]   I disagree.
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:12.400]   I think they said a lot of money in HD DVD.
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:13.400]   And they said a lot of money in HD DVD.
[00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:14.400]   And they do a Blu-ray player if it got popular or not.
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.400]   Well, they did after this.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.400]   But of course, they're going to say that.
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.720]   I mean, what else are they going to say?
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:22.680]   If everybody in the industry is doing Blu-ray, if HD DVD is a dead format, you think Microsoft
[00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:26.640]   is really going to say, no, we will absolutely, spifling never adopt this format.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:27.640]   Do we know how to get money?
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:31.240]   There shows what you're saying, Ryan, which is like, we really want people to download
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.240]   to the Xbox.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.240]   Support whatever we need to support.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:37.120]   Well, that was the great conspiracy theory, was that Microsoft was pumping money into
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:41.600]   HD DVD because they wanted this format war because it benefited them in the long run with
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.600]   downloads.
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.600]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.600]   I mean, I think--
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:45.600]   You think that's true?
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.240]   You think they did that?
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.400]   I think it's pretty clear that that's where that's interest.
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:53.480]   I mean, they're definitely pushing HD downloads on Xbox Live.
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:58.000]   But even if you decide that you want to buy a 360 with an HD DVD player, you're still
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.280]   buying a 360, you're still going to buy some games for that.
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:03.720]   I mean, you're still getting the Microsoft platform in your living room.
