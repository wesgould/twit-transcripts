[00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.900]   It's time for TWIT to show the covers all the latest news.
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.620]   And today, there's nothing to talk about, but the iPad.
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.380]   That's why we brought in the top of the line, best guys
[00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.180]   in the business, because maybe they could find something else
[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.180]   to talk about.
[00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.940]   Tom Merritt, he's an expert on the tech news,
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.460]   because he does buzz out loud every day.
[00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.220]   Hello, Leo.
[00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.720]   Hey, Tom.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.740]   It's great to see you.
[00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.620]   It's good to be here.
[00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.620]   Thanks for having me.
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.220]   The launch?
[00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.060]   Oh, yeah.
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.780]   That was fun.
[00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.660]   I actually never got to touch the thing.
[00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.060]   You did?
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.220]   No.
[00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.100]   Because you got too busy?
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.620]   No, I wasn't allowed in.
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.740]   They restricted the number of people from CNET
[00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:07.900]   that could go in.
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.340]   Oh, so Molly got to touch it.
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.940]   No, no.
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.340]   Brian Tong, Donald Bell, and Erica Og.
[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.300]   Who the hell are they?
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.460]   Brian Tong from CNET TV is our Apple by-host.
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.020]   Erica Og News and Donald Bell Reviews.
[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.820]   They were like, well, one from TV, one from reviews,
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.220]   one from news, that's it.
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.180]   OK, I'm not going to say anything.
[00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.260]   I go ahead and say so.
[00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.140]   I would put my celebrities on this one, wouldn't you?
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.900]   The big names.
[00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.540]   It's like NBC got to go in and Fergley got to see it
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.660]   instead of Brian Williams.
[00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.460]   It's like, what the hell?
[00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.860]   That's probably what would happen.
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.620]   They'd leave Brian Williams on the anchor desk.
[00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.260]   That's where Molly and I had a lot more fun
[00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.900]   sitting in the studio, making comments.
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.420]   Yeah.
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.580]   Why can't I tell you this?
[00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.740]   How does it feel?
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.020]   Does it feel sensual?
[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.460]   It does.
[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.340]   It's a refreshing, supple ankle of a Aylus movie star.
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.060]   That, ladies and gentlemen, is the amazing voice of Mr. Patrick
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.500]   Norton, who was also there in his little bear hoodie.
[00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.060]   Yes, I've gotten a lot.
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.860]   That's from tadgear.com.
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.820]   It's a bear hoodie.
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.260]   And yes, it is expensive because it is made in America
[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.140]   by American laborers who charge more than slave labor overseas.
[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.660]   Oh, man.
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.980]   Come on.
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.500]   You're wearing some slave labor outfit right now, aren't you?
[00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.900]   This is American Apparel.
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.940]   I have no idea where this came from.
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.060]   Is American Apparel actually made in America?
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.540]   Mm-hmm.
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.540]   LA.
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.420]   It's a scorely company for other reasons,
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.420]   but they do employ workers in LA.
[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.580]   They strongly prevent them from organizing unions,
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.260]   but hey, who does their hero?
[00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.700]   And they pay them $0.50 an hour.
[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.500]   There you go.
[00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.540]   So really, which is worse, being a slave labor in America
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.900]   or in Thailand?
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.340]   Thailand.
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.580]   Well, technically, you can't be a pure slave labor in America,
[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:44.820]   depending on why you can legally--
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.980]   Not fine.
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.020]   --labor as.
[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.460]   I guess so.
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.260]   John C. Devorek probably would have something to say
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.580]   if he weren't so appalled by this conversation.
[00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.740]   Oh, it's terrible.
[00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.020]   Shocked.
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.020]   Shocked in the slave labor.
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.940]   They've birthed for their work.
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.620]   Crushed them.
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.700]   Crushed them now.
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.820]   Crushed all slaves.
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.820]   All right.
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.580]   Is that the right way to go?
[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:02.980]   I think you're right, Mr. Marks.
[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.480]   Mm.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.980]   That's fine.
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.140]   Yes.
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.180]   So we're not going to actually not
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.780]   going to talk about the iPad at all today.
[00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.740]   It's boring.
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.380]   It's done.
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.060]   It's over.
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.740]   I don't care.
[00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:13.980]   All right, maybe a little later on.
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.620]   Let the market play it out, see what happens.
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.080]   Well, you know, that was an interesting thing
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.700]   that David Pogue told me.
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.780]   He said, you know, because what surprised me
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.420]   is how much hatred there was spewed.
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.940]   Vitrial.
[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.700]   Vitrial.
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.580]   Like Apple had stepped on somebody's cat.
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.300]   I mean, people were pissed off.
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.660]   Is that--
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.780]   I think this was the point of my market watch column
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.840]   that ran on Friday for all of you out there
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.420]   who want to read something decent.
[00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.940]   What was the point?
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:39.860]   That was the--
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.660]   Really, the point.
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.420]   But why do you think people were peeved?
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.700]   I think there was everybody had their pet little thing.
[00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.060]   They wanted on the machine, and they didn't deliver.
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.440]   And everybody I talked to, and there's
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.800]   all-- everybody had their own pet little peeve.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.880]   Yeah, so there was no way Apple could respond.
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.320]   I don't know.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.240]   This is a problem.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.480]   This reminds me of the time.
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.400]   If anybody wants to remember way back,
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.720]   but this happens every so often, Texas instruments
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.640]   pulled something like this.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.200]   When they came up with a TI-99/4,
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.200]   you remember that, Leo?
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.680]   Sure.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.400]   I love that sucker.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.280]   And it was missing a control key or something.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.000]   I forgot what it was.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.040]   There were some keys that was missing.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.120]   They just weren't on the keyboard.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.160]   And they were important keys.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.360]   And it was like, hey, they rolled it out
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.700]   to show to people the thing in advance, months in advance,
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.280]   and that made us such a big secret.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.560]   They would have gotten enough feedback right there
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.080]   to fix all these complaints.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.960]   If Apple had rolled this thing out to everybody,
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.760]   pretty much like a small bait.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.440]   So it got out.
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.560]   People saw pictures of it.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.480]   It wasn't really finalized.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.360]   And it wasn't really fully announced.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.920]   And people could come back and say, hey,
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.000]   I'm not going to buy this if it doesn't have a camera,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.160]   or I need a stylus.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.480]   I can't draw on this thing, or a million of these other complaints.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.640]   They would have fixed it.
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.800]   They would have had a perfect pad,
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.240]   but no, they had to keep a big secret.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.280]   They wouldn't have had a perfect pad.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.200]   They would have had a tablet PC like there's 300 other ones.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.040]   The TI-99/4 was missing a backspace key.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.520]   No, that's pretty significant.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.760]   I don't think that the iPad is missing anything quite
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.520]   as critical as that.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.320]   I would say--
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.480]   I think it was a backspace key.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.160]   It was stupid.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.920]   The camera is not-- you know, I tell you,
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.040]   here's what I think is missing.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.440]   I think stylus know.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.000]   So you have your one thing too?
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.560]   But stylus is crazy.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.480]   I don't think-- black and multitasking is a huge minus.
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.680]   Frankly, I've got multitasking on the Nexus 1,
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.000]   and it crashes it more often.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.360]   That was Hitler's complaint.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.120]   Yeah, cuz he's throwing off it.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.920]   Godwin's law.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.440]   And the camera-- OK, be nice to have a camera.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.640]   But I don't think this is so much a content creation device,
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.440]   as a content consumption device, which
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.440]   means that my biggest question is
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.640]   why they didn't do a 16-9 720p device,
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.520]   which because movies look like crap on this,
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.320]   because they're so letterboxed.
[00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.200]   That's up to me, that's the biggest minus.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.960]   If it's--
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.040]   See, my position is it's not to replace a netbook,
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.240]   it's to replace a Kindle.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.000]   It's a content consumption device.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.440]   Yeah, or a Kindle, or I'm trying to use my iPhone
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.160]   on the couch at home and the screen's too small,
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.680]   and I'm getting frustrated, but I don't want to have
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.960]   to go pull my laptop out.
[00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.960]   This is that device.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.840]   It's a pretty small niche.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.920]   Yeah, it's got an iPhone.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.000]   It's got senior citizens.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:11.880]   I think it's a good niche.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.680]   I think it's a niche.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.680]   It may not be a bad niche.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.600]   I'll be watching--
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.920]   I'll be reading The New York Times on it magazines.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.960]   I think it's going to be a great book reader.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.880]   Some people say, well, LCD, I don't know.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.320]   I think it looked like an ice screen that was--
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.000]   I understand why they didn't put multitasking,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.760]   because they don't want it in the iPhone.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.880]   This is the iPhone OS.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.360]   They may put multitasking iPhone 4
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.400]   when they finally figure it out.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.400]   If they figure out how to make--
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.680]   Multitasking doesn't belong in a phone.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.920]   I know a lot of phones have it, but I think it causes problems
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.560]   almost always.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.720]   But I get why it's not in there yet,
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.360]   and they could roll it in later.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.760]   And in fact, all the Apple guys apparently
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.800]   were dropping hints like crazy.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.600]   Like, oh, there'll be more features in this
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.920]   before it actually launches.
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.760]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.040]   It sounds like maybe they'll even be an OS web--
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.320]   They could put a backspace in there.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.760]   I don't know if it'll be 4, but if it'll be 3.5
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.120]   or something before then.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.800]   But I don't understand why they didn't put a camera in.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.400]   Was it just keeping the cost down?
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.160]   Is that all there is to it?
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.400]   I would say.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.400]   I think it's had 499--
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.440]   It's had 4.99 cameras.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.120]   Putting that 4.99 price point was tough for them.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.440]   And I think they're right to get that price--
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.120]   Some of the people spec in parts are saying
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.440]   there's only $250, $275 in parts in it.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.120]   So that still leaves Apple a fairly healthy amount
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.080]   of profit in there.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:17.600]   That's true.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.120]   That's the numbers in there.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.120]   And it's an unsubsidized device.
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.320]   So they should be-- from what everybody's saying,
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.600]   there should be money to be made on this.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.960]   I think it-- but I get to go back a step, Leo,
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.320]   and say, multitasking does belong on phones
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.480]   because it belongs on personal computers.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.560]   These aren't phones anymore.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.200]   This is far beyond a phone.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:42.840]   And case in point, this is not a phone.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.120]   I don't think it's a personal computer either, though.
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.120]   Well, it may not be a personal computer either.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.360]   But the idea that if I have something going--
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.960]   it's annoying to have to restart everything from scratch
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.520]   every time you launch an application.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:54.960]   You know what I mean?
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.120]   It's got a good old-fashioned, DOS, terminate-and-stay
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.200]   resident program kind of feel to it, which
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.880]   is really annoying on the iPhone.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.600]   We should point out that there is multitasking on the iPhone.
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.720]   It's just that Apple, only Apple, gets to do it.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.240]   Right.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.360]   And they only get to do it with the phone
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.280]   and to a lesser degree, the GPS and to a greater degree.
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.800]   The iPod does it.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.600]   You can listen to music and play a game.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.640]   I do it all the time.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.240]   Yeah, no.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.160]   And it's great.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.240]   But it's only kind of the lockdown stuff
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:24.080]   that Apple allows you to.
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.560]   Well, I think that their point in that case would be,
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.880]   it's nervous for us to make a phone that can be locked up.
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.280]   And I locked up my Nexus 1 for 45 minutes yesterday,
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.520]   which meant I couldn't make a call
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.640]   because I installed a podcasting client that
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.840]   decided I wanted to download all of this stuff at the same time.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.720]   And I couldn't use the phone.
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.680]   And so I can understand why you would make that argument.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.880]   A phone, I agree with you, Patrick.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.920]   The tablet is less of an argument.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.680]   What you know, I think the tablet has been in power.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.920]   But I mean, I've had my iPhone lock up
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.600]   without doing anything other than using the regular features
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.080]   that were put in there.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.400]   It's gotten more reliable, though, right?
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.400]   It doesn't lock up really badly.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:56.920]   Absolutely.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:57.440]   Absolutely.
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.120]   So I think that they're looking at reliability.
[00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.120]   I wouldn't be surprised to see multitasking.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.280]   But I don't think multitasking, lack of multitasking,
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.080]   is killer because I think really this is like--
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.440]   Here's my use case.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.240]   I sit in-- I'm reading in bed.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.160]   Maybe I want to check my email real quickly or look at Twitter.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:12.520]   Get up.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.800]   I want to read the New York Times at the breakfast table.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:18.280]   Maybe look at the New Yorker or magazine or us or something.
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:18.920]   Take it to work.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:23.360]   I have the chat room running on it in the background.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.120]   You can watch movies and TV on it.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.640]   If you have a sling box, it'll put TV anywhere in the house.
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.040]   You put the sling application on it.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.880]   I think that's a pretty compelling content consumption
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:34.320]   device.
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.520]   That's my point.
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.640]   Yeah, but people there on Facebook, they're on Flickr.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.640]   They're moving photos.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.160]   I think basic web usage to this point for a lot of people
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.920]   involves content creation.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.360]   Yeah, it launched them.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.320]   I mean, if they didn't expect it to be used for a significant
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.520]   amount of email or Facebook or whatever,
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:58.000]   they wouldn't have basically launched it with their own keyboard
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:58.880]   adapter in place.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.480]   Well, that was what puzzled me.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.480]   I thought that was a mistake.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.440]   I thought at launching iWork and the keyboard
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.040]   kind of implied something that it's not.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.200]   It implied it's more of a computer.
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.480]   I thought that was kind of a mistake, to be honest.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.400]   See, having used that keyboard on the screen,
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.640]   I mean, it's not bad for an on-screen keyboard.
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.960]   You're not going to do much typing.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.200]   I can type 80 words a minute on a real keyboard.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.320]   I can type about 15 on that screen.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:25.040]   So by having the keyboard, even if it is optional,
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.800]   it'd be nice to use a Bluetooth keyboard or something
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:27.080]   like that.
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.960]   But by having the keyboard there, people
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.880]   who type and do entries-- and there's
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.200]   a whole lot of people out there, moms and dads--
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.360]   You should get a net book then.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.920]   If you want a camera multitasking a keyboard,
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.280]   isn't that a net book?
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.360]   But didn't you just--
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:39.760]   And it's cheaper?
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.400]   Steve, tell us that net books are pieces of stuff that--
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.520]   Well, that could be Steve's opinion.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.840]   But I don't think that's really where this market lies.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.720]   If you buy a net book, you want all that stuff.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.000]   That's the difference here, is that it seems like Apple
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.320]   is making an appliance.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.320]   They're making a--
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.320]   My point exactly.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.720]   They're making a blender.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.880]   An internet appliance--
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.320]   This is not for geeky people.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.440]   This is for folks who just pick it up in the store and go,
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.360]   oh, it does that.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.440]   Oh, it's so fast.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:04.920]   Oh.
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:05.720]   Exactly.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.280]   And then want to take it home.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.400]   And they spend a lot of time on MySpace.
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.040]   They spend a lot of time on Facebook.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:12.840]   A lot of time on other--
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.560]   You could use this with Facebook, I think.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.120]   Just fine.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.440]   This keyboard's good enough to do Facebook for crying out.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.400]   Or three or four characters at a time.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.400]   Do you know what Facebook's going to have to do, though?
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.160]   They're going to have to place Farmville and all those flash
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.120]   games and something else.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.640]   Well, Calcanis has the second version.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.520]   I mean, that would be Farmville.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.400]   It would be a good Farmville device.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.800]   I don't understand why--
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.280]   I understand why Apple is--
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.160]   basically, Apple has said, we're going to take a little hit
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.280]   because we want to kill flash.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.800]   Well, and that's interesting because a lot of people
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.640]   that I've talked to say they won't get it because it doesn't
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.680]   play Hulu.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.560]   And the reason it doesn't do Hulu is it doesn't play.
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:48.720]   So what's the answer?
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.400]   Apple says, we're going to make it so that none of our portable
[00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.920]   devices support flash.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.360]   We make-- there's 75 million iPhones out there.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.280]   What do you think Hulu's going to do?
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.640]   Hulu's going to figure out a way to do it in H.264.
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.520]   It does crazy stuff, though.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.880]   We don't want it in boxy.
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.280]   And we don't want people to watch anything more than five
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:07.720]   episodes.
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.440]   Then I don't know the ones that we're making.
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.600]   I'm certainly, as a content creator,
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.200]   making sure that we have a version that works on the iPad.
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.720]   Wouldn't that be the smart thing to do?
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.040]   Yes, because you're smart.
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:16.880]   Well, that's Hulu.
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.360]   You can't--
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.400]   Hulu does stuff that's a big talent to their own success.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:21.720]   Steev--
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.200]   But weren't you just savaging the networks for not being
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.960]   able to make an intelligence decision about smart consumers
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.200]   to save their lives at a certain trade show a few weeks ago,
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.040]   or you'll lose.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:31.880]   Well, they are.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:32.880]   They're morons.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.400]   And so Hulu could conceivably do something stupid.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:34.880]   That's a hard thing.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.120]   But I think Apple's point of view is--
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.840]   well, in fact, let me read to you.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.920]   Steve Jobs had a town meeting with Apple employees
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.600]   late last week.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.360]   This is from MacRumors.com following the launch.
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.480]   Actually, it's from Wired.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:50.000]   Wired says two of the things that Jobs talked about.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.720]   Jobs says Adobe is lazy and blames Adobe
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.880]   for a buggy implementation on flash on the Mac
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.400]   as one of the reasons they won't support it.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.480]   Quote, "Apple does not support flash
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.840]   because it is so buggy whenever a Mac crashes.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.200]   More often than not, it's because of flash."
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.000]   No, Steve.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.800]   That's not true.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.240]   I don't think that's true.
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.400]   No one will be using flash, he says.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.080]   The world is moving to HTML5.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.240]   And I do agree with him on that.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.160]   And I think this is clear.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.680]   That's what Apple's trying to do is get--
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.880]   they don't want one company, Adobe, to have so much control.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.440]   So they want to go to an open center.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.000]   Unless it's them.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.520]   Yeah, unless it's them.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.840]   Part of what's so sad, though, is especially
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.240]   so many large corporations, because of the level of perceived
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.080]   control, it gives them over the content on the website,
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.320]   run everything in flash.
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:37.840]   And it's desperately unfortunate because it makes the pages
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.680]   load slower, especially the initial accessibility goes to crap.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.640]   Accessibility goes to crap.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.960]   Depending on how good their programming is or their designers
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.640]   are, the accessibility across different screen sizes,
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.200]   waxes, and wanes.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.880]   It's unfortunate.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:58.440]   And it's also absolutely a abysmal resource hog, especially
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.000]   if you tend to do silly little things.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:00.800]   100% CPU.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.360]   25 windows open.
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.880]   YouTube has an HTML5 beta going on right now.
[00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.200]   You can join it by going to youtube.com/html5.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.440]   And all the videos will now be h.264 without the flash
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.360]   wrapper.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.960]   Just do it and see what the CPU difference is.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.840]   It's like night and day.
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.480]   It's huge.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.960]   Now I know everybody who watches our live stream is watching
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.600]   flash, because our providers do it in flash.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.480]   But if you watch on the Android platform,
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.560]   you stream stuff is not flash.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.560]   It's h.264.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.240]   That's why it works on the iPhone.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.880]   We'll be sure to include that kind of a stream
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.800]   into an iPad application.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.120]   And I would imagine that everybody else, except maybe
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.680]   somebody's stupid enough to say, oh, look, why would Hulu
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.760]   care about flash?
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.000]   They're not in the flash business.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.040]   But they don't care about accessibility as much as they
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.520]   care about making a splash.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.720]   And so as long as people can watch it on their computer
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.080]   limited, they're fine with that.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.320]   They actually don't want it on the mobile platform.
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.520]   They want to use it as a barker to get people to watch
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.080]   the broadcast.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.920]   So that's why they're not wanting it unboxy.
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.200]   That's why they don't really care about.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.080]   That's why they haven't come out with a mobile app that makes
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.200]   Hulu easily accessible on a bunch of different mobile
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.000]   platforms.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.440]   So they're fine with flash because it locks it down for
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:09.800]   them.
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.200]   Don't they understand that real competition is not mobile
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:12.680]   platforms?
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.520]   The real competition is BitTorrent.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.960]   It's the Pirate Bay.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.080]   Yeah, they should.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.040]   And they should understand-- and actually, Hulu
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.680]   themselves understands this.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.920]   And once the network stops, it's just
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.520]   Fox and NBC that doesn't.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:23.880]   Yeah.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.040]   But they're fighting an internal battle about it.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.040]   John, you've been so quiet.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:27.840]   What do you think?
[00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.160]   Oh, I'm just listening to you guys.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.440]   You guys are all full of crap.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:30.840]   Oh, good.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:31.520]   That's what I thought.
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.840]   Tell us how it really goes, John.
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:41.520]   Essentially, all I'm hearing are excuses for the iPad as
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:43.320]   opposed to--
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.520]   Oh, I gave you a use case.
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:45.480]   Not an excuse for how I use it.
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.400]   Well, I mean, yeah, a use case.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.280]   But it's like, you know, you're--
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.120]   that's you.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.120]   I mean, you're like one of the most unusual people
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.120]   in the panel considering all the-- the fact that you're a tech
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.960]   maven junkie, as it were.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.200]   You're also doing probably the number one
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.920]   podcaster in the country.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.480]   And you have a lot-- and you are creating content all the time.
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.560]   And you probably would be reading the New York Times at
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.760]   breakfast rather than talking to your wife and kids.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.800]   Oh, I don't want to talk to them.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.120]   They got nothing.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:15.520]   And reading the thing in bed, you know, rather than sleeping.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.600]   You know, I just don't see a lot of people doing any of that
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:17.920]   stuff.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:18.680]   I mean, I--
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.120]   Well, I agree.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:19.680]   You might be right.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:21.480]   I mean, we'll find out in two months if there's a market.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:21.960]   No, I know.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.000]   I mean, I could be dead wrong.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.160]   But I-- first, when I first discussed this thing on the
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.400]   Cranky Geek show with all the other guys who had seen it, it
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.920]   was like, well, you know, I think it's probably going to be
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.200]   successful because Apple's really good at marketing stuff.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.800]   But then after I started hearing the groucing, which was
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:40.120]   very unlike Apple Mavens, complaining bitterly about one
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.080]   thing or another, or mostly little minor things, and then
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.480]   realizing that this is essentially not a computer.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.120]   Like, I agree with you on that.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.280]   It doesn't run the Mac OS.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.600]   It wouldn't run Microsoft Word.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.160]   It's essentially a giant iPod touch for--
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.200]   Yeah, it's all of it.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.680]   --for senior citizens who--
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.800]   whose icons need to be bigger.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.400]   And--
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.440]   I think Apple is the Obama of the tech world.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.160]   And I think that it's going to be interesting to say, I'm now
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.680]   skeptical whether this thing can be as successful as they
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.840]   were hoping.
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.600]   By the way, no one's ever done well with this model anyway.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.720]   And I don't think they did anything outrageously different
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.360]   in terms of, yeah, maybe reads books a little better.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.320]   But nobody has made a pad work.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.000]   I mean, Microsoft, through a bunch of money, after it
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.200]   just happened in the '80s and the '90s, we keep--
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.440]   Yeah, but none of them were nearly as usable.
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.320]   I mean, the user interface on this is really--
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.000]   Is very--
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.960]   The closest I see people really jacked up about is the Kindle.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.040]   Yeah, that's what to me.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.440]   This is the competition for the Kindle.
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:33.960]   That's--
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.440]   I don't see any--
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.480]   I don't like the white lights shining in my face
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.520]   when I'm reading.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:39.080]   See, that's the problem I have with the Kindle
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.600]   is you have to have a light on.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:42.120]   No, but it's like paper.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.680]   You have to have a light on paper.
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.000]   Yeah, the Kindle is less fatiguing.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.640]   I've been reading books on LCD screens, literally,
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.000]   for like 15 years now.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   I think the first one I read was a Neil--
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.200]   Neil Gippson.
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.640]   One of them, Gippson sci-fi book back in '92.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.280]   It came on a 3 and 1/2 inch floppy.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.200]   I ran it in my Core 2 Duo.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:08.640]   But it's fatiguing on the eyes to read on an LCD screen.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:11.840]   I mean, we do it all day at work, but it tends to be--
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.520]   people complain about it more.
[00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.280]   Yeah, somebody said that.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.720]   They said that, yeah, we read them all day at work.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.360]   But the last thing we want to do is come on and read more
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.000]   on the LCD.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.640]   We read it work, we read it in a different way.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.000]   We don't read a book for a couple hours at a time.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.360]   We look at it, we look away, we read--
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.520]   I don't think we'll know until I get it home,
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.680]   but I plan to replace the Kindle with it and then see it.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:31.280]   I'll let you know.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.040]   But you're right, if it's fatiguing,
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.280]   I won't be happy about that.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.880]   I mean, Leo, don't take this the wrong way,
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.400]   but you're not going to replace the Kindle with it.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.680]   You're going to put the Kindle in a drawer.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.600]   Well, you're going to be selling it on Craigslist.
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.560]   No, no, no, the Kindle--
[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:49.000]   Well, if it's a fail, you'll be buying a new Kindle.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.720]   Yeah, I think the--
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.400]   I've been ready for stuff that replaced the Kindle.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.600]   The Kindle is not a long-term satisfying proposition to me.
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.760]   I keep the Kindle right next to my bedside,
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.720]   and I read paper on it in the morning.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.080]   I read books on it in the evening.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.320]   How is it for reading the paper?
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.560]   I'll carry it around the house.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.760]   It's good if all you want is to read the couple of tops
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:06.160]   of the reason.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:06.640]   Linearly.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.120]   Yeah, it's not good for skimming or jumping.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.680]   For flipping through the paper.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.840]   It's not the same experience.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.440]   That's why I'm looking for the iPad.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.280]   I like that.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.800]   And I think the iPad is good for that.
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.120]   And I think it's going to be a middling success.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.680]   I think it's going to be a little more popular than the Apple TV,
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.320]   but it's not going to be nearly as popular as the iPod or the iPad.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:26.440]   So here's why I say that Apple pulled an Obama.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.200]   Obama's pissed off people on the left
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.560]   because he's not progressive enough.
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.680]   He right hated him because he's too liberal.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.000]   So everybody hates him.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.920]   And Apple's done this, basically.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.840]   What they've done is it's not geeky enough
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.920]   for the Apple fanboy geeks, right?
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.480]   So it's pissed them off.
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.840]   And then the Apple haters already hated it anyway.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.160]   And they're just as glad to jump on this bandwagon.
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.040]   So you've got about 80% of the public going.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.280]   This thing sucks.
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.040]   That's what's a compromise solution.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.320]   Yeah, but let's look at it from another perspective.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.920]   For one thing, the Apple fanboys do not--
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.400]   and I don't know when this ever happened the way you're describing it.
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.040]   But I've never noticed that they're discerning as a general.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.600]   I think you're right.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.600]   They just jump on anything that Steve Jobs says that,
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.280]   I don't know if they were eating or drinking or smoking,
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.320]   but they-- whatever, it's fine.
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.960]   And they usually rave about stuff and they jump all over people who are critical.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.840]   It's just not happening with this thing.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.520]   Actually, I think it has been happening some.
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.600]   Or maybe we've just been reading different stories.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.720]   But I've heard a lot of--
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.600]   Steve's giving people what they need, not what they want.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.520]   Which is one of my favorite marketing quotes.
[00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.520]   You know, it's funny because I said the opposite,
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.080]   which is this is not a device you need,
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.880]   but it might be a device you want.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.520]   And by the way, Steve, generally,
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:44.400]   speaking, historically, he's the one who coined that you should be selling the sizzle,
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:46.280]   not the steak back in the '70s.
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:46.960]   Really?
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:52.240]   He's always the guy who's giving people what they want, not what they need.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.160]   I think the iPad is more sizzle than steak.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.960]   And I think there might be an analog to it in the Nintendo Wii,
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:00.800]   where people--
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.360]   Bad name?
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.360]   --just like the iPad.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.520]   --back, just said it's a horrible name.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:04.960]   It doesn't do anything.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.320]   Right.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:05.920]   It's not--
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.520]   It's crappy compared to the competition.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.360]   I mean, yeah, sure, it's cheaper.
[00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.960]   But why would anyone buy a Wii over a PS3 or an Xbox 360?
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.040]   And look who dominated the console market.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.360]   On sell-in.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.360]   Yeah, maybe that's a very apt analogy.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.840]   I'm going to disagree with this, too.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.520]   I guess I'm going to be disagreeable today.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:22.400]   Go ahead.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:27.120]   So we had some phenomenal new input devices.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.880]   I mean, the gyroscope and the whole things you could do with that controller
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.560]   were astonishing.
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.560]   People were just seeing something that was totally new,
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.400]   so they started being hypercritical.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.760]   And it still has some of the best games you can play,
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.560]   and some of the cutest things you can do.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.960]   And it's always been oriented to younger people, so kids love it.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.640]   But older people can play it without feeling too humiliated.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.360]   I don't think that the comparison is the same at all.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.080]   This thing is not designed for young people.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.480]   It's got nothing really special and unusual in it
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.880]   that the iPod touch doesn't have.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.680]   So I'm not seeing this comparison as being valid.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:22:59.360]   Wait a minute, though.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.720]   Nick name is saying in our chat room,
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.520]   and I think this is an apt question.
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.080]   Which do you think a child would gravitate towards?
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:06.920]   Which would they prefer?
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.160]   A touchscreen device or a notebook or a desktop?
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.360]   Mm, touchscreen device.
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.320]   I'll tell you what.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.760]   John, let's do a bet.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:14.760]   Wait, wait, wait, stop.
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.520]   Wait, wait, that's a-- I want to stop this question
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.920]   because it's species.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.880]   The fact of the matters I already said,
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.160]   and they probably would gravitate.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.880]   If you said the same thing about a kid and an iPod touch,
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.520]   what I was saying about the Wii is that
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.800]   it was introducing some new paradigms.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.000]   There's no new paradigm here.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.480]   It's just a big iPod touch.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.360]   So this is not a valid thing to throw at me.
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:39.360]   Well, but what if you say the iPod touch and the iPhone
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:43.600]   were the promise and that the iPad delivers on the promise
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.560]   simply by virtue of having a bigger screen
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.840]   and a faster processor?
[00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:47.680]   It just--
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:51.400]   Yeah, that would be a laughable proposition.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.440]   I think there's a lot of people that are using iPhone
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.160]   applications that might actually welcome the larger screen.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.160]   I mean, there's been situations where I've said,
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.960]   you know, if I could just connect a stupid keyboard
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.320]   to my iPhone, there's a lot more I could do with it.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:09.320]   You know, is it worth $500 or $630 to have that larger screen?
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.120]   You know, I'm a little less stoked about it
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.160]   than I was on the day it released.
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.520]   You know, but the, you know, it's a nice piece of hardware.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:18.800]   The screen looks good.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.400]   Everybody's wanting about 10 by seven.
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:21.680]   It's very elegant.
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.280]   It's, you know, and it's, they didn't need to, you know,
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.080]   do a paradigm changing interface
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.920]   because they already did that with the iPhone.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:30.760]   Right.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:31.840]   I didn't say that they had to do that.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.520]   I'm just saying for the sake of this argument
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.840]   that you've artificially created,
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.160]   they would have to if you're gonna compare it to the Wii.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.000]   I think you're right, John.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.320]   I think that's where the analogy falls down.
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.120]   I mean, there are a lot of similarities though.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.960]   Between, in the appeal to different age groups
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.760]   that don't normally buy this sort of thing
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.920]   and the fact that it's got a stupid name
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.400]   and all of that sort of stuff.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.560]   But, but I think you're right.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.760]   I think you hit on the key difference,
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.360]   which is what is the wow factor?
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.840]   There was a wow factor with Wii in the Wii mode.
[00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.640]   And I'm not sure I see one with the iPad
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.600]   where people look at it and go, wow, wow.
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.520]   I've never seen anything do that before.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.240]   I like what you said, Patrick.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.920]   This is this, the innovation already happened
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.760]   on the iPod touch and the iPhone.
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.760]   And because there's such small screens,
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:13.520]   you really don't see it.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.800]   I think that John, there is innovation here.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.360]   It's just that we, it's not new.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.360]   It's just bigger.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:19.440]   Well, bigger makes a difference.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.000]   It's just going bigger as innovation.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.080]   I think that your, your,
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.680]   I don't know the funny word.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.240]   I think it's, I think it's taking,
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:28.440]   the innovation was absolutely done on the iPhone
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:30.960]   and to a much lesser degree, the iPod touch.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.040]   They've got a large application base in place.
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.400]   They've got a lot of people looking to make,
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.040]   to make money on the application base.
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.600]   They have a huge population of people
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.760]   that understand and trust the interface.
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.360]   And they basically, you know,
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.480]   all the development for an entirely new platform
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.480]   has already been done on a frickin' cell phone.
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.320]   You know?
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.200]   Look, I mean, how many times you launch a new computer
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.440]   with 140,000 apps ready to go?
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.280]   Every 100,000.
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.280]   - Every 100,000. - That was one of the.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.360]   - That was unlimited apps.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.360]   - That was unusual.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.480]   That's the most unusual thing about this launch.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.960]   That's never happened before.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.280]   - Oh, that's huge.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.960]   Every computer you buy has more apps than I have ever.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.160]   - Again, if I want to be argumentative,
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.160]   which apparently I do,
[00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:10.120]   let me say that you're talking about 140,000
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.560]   phone applications for a little handheld device
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.640]   and now all you're doing is just blowing them up
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.160]   as if that's appropriate.
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.000]   - No, you're right.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.760]   I played a game Assassin's Creed
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:23.840]   that was designed for the iPhone screen.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.000]   And when you blow it up, you know,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.280]   they say 2X on the button,
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.760]   but really it's 2X each dimension.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.920]   It's four times bigger and jaggy as hell.
[00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.680]   So application developers are going to have to rewrite.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.960]   I don't know how hard it is to rewrite,
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.640]   but to really take advantage of that real estate,
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.800]   they're going to have to rewrite.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.440]   On the other hand, I think of a few applications
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.640]   that I love on the iPhone that it would be great on the iPad.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.320]   I'm thinking of my Sonos remote control
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:45.480]   for the Sonos own player would be great.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:47.800]   I'm thinking Mint would be fantastic,
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:51.040]   especially if you wrote it to have more information.
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:52.480]   You know, there's a lot of applications
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.400]   that would be very sweet on that.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.880]   Imagine what you would do with TweetDeck.
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:57.960]   TweetDeck is really two.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:58.800]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.560]   - It's too big for the iPhone.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.160]   You know, you don't get those columns,
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.680]   but it's just a little more real estate.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.480]   Wouldn't that look nice on that screen?
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.640]   So I think that there's, and I tell you, I'm showing,
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.920]   if, yeah, a jeweled--
[00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.200]   - Yeah, well, because I don't care if he gets jaggy,
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.040]   it doesn't matter.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:15.280]   - Yeah, but jeweled would be beautiful on there.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.440]   It'd be a great, but a jeweled device.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.560]   Crossword puzzles, wouldn't it be great?
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:20.680]   It's made for Sudoku.
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:21.680]   - Yeah.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.960]   And I don't think it's going to be that hard.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.600]   And I would love to hear email from people
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.160]   who are developing iPhone applications,
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.760]   'cause I don't see, in some cases,
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.120]   they may have to do new texture masks,
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.000]   but I don't see a lot of applications
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.200]   having difficulty scaling to a larger screen.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.120]   Yeah, are they going to have to do a point release to do it?
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:36.960]   I don't doubt it.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.320]   - It can't be that hard, right?
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.760]   - All right, well, anyway, I think the people
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:40.680]   in the chat room are moaning
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.840]   that we'd be laboring the point.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.560]   - No, this is, look it, this is a,
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.480]   they hate everything.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.840]   We talked about Twitter, and they hate it,
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:47.680]   but there's no--
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.520]   - Twitter.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.120]   - I'm supposed to tell you to stop now.
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.520]   - There's no evidence that these are the biggest,
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.520]   this is the biggest story of the month, maybe the year.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:57.360]   Come on, we get to talk.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.480]   - Yeah, I know, but I think the subtopic
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.320]   is what they're complaining about.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.280]   - Oh, all right, we'll move on to the--
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.120]   - I do want to play SimCity on the iPad though.
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:02.960]   - There you go.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.320]   - And you already own it.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.160]   - And it's really cramped on the phone.
[00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.000]   - And you already own it,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.120]   and when you plug in your iPad for the first time,
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.520]   all of those apps are going to transfer over.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.520]   I think it's going to, look, I don't care if it doesn't sell.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.920]   I'm not trying to argue you and convince you
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.840]   that this is a great thing.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.520]   I just, I see a use for it,
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.320]   and I think that there is a market for it.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.000]   I don't know how big it is.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.600]   I loved the Apple TV, and that's been a bomb.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.760]   - Oh yeah, I'm a big fan of the Apple TV,
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.360]   but I know it's not successful.
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:31.520]   - Oh, it's a huge, horrible failure.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.720]   Now, according to TechCrunch,
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.560]   the Kindle sold 3 million units.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.720]   I don't know how accurate this is.
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:36.560]   Millions.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.720]   - It was an Amazon that was saying
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.720]   they've sold 3 million units.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.280]   - No, Amazon said millions.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.440]   - Amazon said stuff that led people to read the tea leaves.
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.840]   - And then Mike Arrington said,
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.160]   "According to my sources, which have been accurate
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.400]   in the past." - He said that too.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:51.280]   - But 3 million, well, 3 million in two years
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:53.400]   is not anything to write home about.
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.520]   And this is an interesting point because
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.080]   Amazon is acting like they're in the Kindle business,
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:02.000]   not in the book business.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.560]   Amazon has reacted very badly, in my opinion, to the iPad,
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.920]   and has really started a turf war,
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.120]   and this is all about-- - How's this?
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:13.200]   - Well, McMillan, you heard this whole McMillan story, right?
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.880]   - No, I'm not following this.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.160]   - Oh, okay, so I'll talk about it in just a second.
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.160]   We're gonna take a break and come back and talk about it,
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.160]   but I think this is-- - Good teaser, Leo.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.560]   - There's a problem, as I've mentioned before,
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.480]   with teasing in a podcast.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.280]   It just makes people skip the ad.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.920]   - Yeah, but it was still you, you're a natural,
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.400]   you can't get away from people-- - I can't help it.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.480]   - Pro that you are. - It's built into my radio DNA.
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.880]   - Nothing makes a tease better than pointing it out.
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.120]   (laughing)
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.840]   - By the way-- - It makes a tease better for you.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:42.360]   - You've been teased!
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.200]   Now, please, tone fast toward the ad.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.000]   What I was talking about is not that interesting.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.200]   This is much more interesting.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.000]   We've got a brand new product to tell you about.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.040]   From the folks at Carbonite,
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.880]   you know I talk about Carbonite Online Backup,
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.680]   and one of the things I hear all the time from people is,
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.320]   that's great, but it's for one computer.
[00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.960]   I would love to see something like this for the enterprise.
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.120]   We, I'm very pleased this is the first time
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.040]   anybody has ever told you about
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.560]   a brand new product from Carbonite.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.880]   I've been talking with David Friend
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.160]   and the Carbonite team about this for a year.
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.480]   I'm really excited to introduce
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:15.280]   Carbonite Pro for small businesses.
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.280]   You can take a look at it by going to carbonitepro.com.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.200]   Now, you're familiar with Carbonite Online Backup,
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.040]   it's the automatic PC or Mac backup.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.120]   Designed for individuals,
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.480]   it'll allow you to backup everything on your computer,
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.680]   all the personal files and everything automatically.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.120]   Over the internet uses AES-256-bit encryption.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:40.120]   You set the key so it's private, 128-bit SSL to upload it,
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.600]   so it's absolutely secure.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.280]   Really is a great service for individuals.
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:45.720]   We've been recommending it for a long time.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:50.160]   This is a new package for small businesses, Carbonite Pro.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.560]   Donating any extra hardware.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.440]   Now, you already have an existing backup solution
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.080]   I presume in your business.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.040]   This works hand in hand with it
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.960]   to give you off-site backup.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.960]   You get a centralized admin dashboard
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.280]   with backup status as many computers as you want.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.080]   Each employee can access their own backup files
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.240]   if you let them, of course.
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.200]   You can be notified.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.760]   Your office can be up and running in no time
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.960]   because each employee can go,
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:16.640]   okay, I'm getting my files back.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.120]   It is very affordable, starts as low as $10 a month
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.800]   for your entire office.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.920]   I'm gonna tell you how you could do it free
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.280]   for 30 days in a second, but let me give you an idea
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:29.040]   of how the pricing will work.
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.840]   If you have, as an example, let's say,
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.440]   have five gigabytes of backup spread
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.360]   over eight computers, 25 bucks a month.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.600]   18 computers, five gigabytes, 50 bucks a month.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.360]   We're talking 10 to $50 a month for peace of mind
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.640]   for you and your employees.
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.360]   That's less than if you got Carbonite
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.080]   for each individual machine.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.360]   And the additional admin features really make it
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.520]   a great solution.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.760]   Now, this is a perfect solution.
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.000]   If you've been avoiding kind of this whole problem
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   of offsite backup, you didn't wanna deal with it
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:56.840]   in your business.
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.400]   If you don't have an IT department
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.280]   and you don't wanna have to become an expert
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.400]   in this stuff, a great solution.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.080]   Now, I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.840]   There is no coupon code needed for this
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.400]   because we're the only people talking about it.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.960]   So they know if you go to the website,
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.120]   it's 'cause you heard it on Twitch.
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:16.320]   Go to carbonitepro.com.
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.120]   I really want you to try the 30 day trial
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.520]   and give them feedback.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:23.480]   This is really a preview for the Twitch audience
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.840]   and a chance for you to really take a look at
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.320]   what this new product from Carbonite is.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:33.000]   I'm just thrilled, immediately installed it for our office
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:36.520]   because we have this, we actually lost,
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.600]   we bought a $20,000 San storage area network.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:43.800]   I mean, really, I thought that was very expensive
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.200]   and it died and lost all the data.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.160]   That's expensive.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Well, no, and then I was told, oh no,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.880]   oh, you want it to be absolutely reliable
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:54.520]   so you don't lose data, that's the $100,000 version.
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:55.600]   (laughing)
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:59.160]   Oh, how could I have been so cheap?
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.280]   So I'm looking for a way to back that up
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.160]   and to back everything else up on our network
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.320]   and this is the solution.
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.520]   Thank goodness, I wish I'd had it two weeks ago,
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:11.480]   carbonitepro.com, really thrilled to be able to bring it
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.640]   to you for the first time anywhere on Twitch.
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.800]   So here's the story, John, I think you'd be very interested
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.640]   in this, Millen, which is a big publisher,
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.960]   I can't remember all their imprints, Henry Holt,
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.400]   is it random house of McMillen?
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.640]   Everybody's owned by Pearson.
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.040]   Millen, except McMillen.
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.440]   No, I think McMillen is too.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.960]   So it's a division of Pearson.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.440]   Well, Simon and Schuster is CBS,
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.280]   that's the only one I know about.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.480]   So confusing, there's only three big publishers.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.600]   They're all gone.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.880]   So here's the deal, McMillen says to Amazon,
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:47.800]   we don't like it that you set the price on our books,
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.320]   on the Kindle, we don't like $9.99.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.920]   We want to charge $15.99 and oh, by the way,
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.560]   Apple's letting us charge whatever we want
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.840]   in the iBook Store.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:02.280]   So on Friday, Amazon's response was to pull all
[00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.040]   McMillen books from the Amazon website,
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:08.440]   including print books.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.880]   And the only way you could get a McMillen book
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.040]   on the Amazon site is to go to a third party seller.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.920]   You could not get it from Amazon.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.000]   All right, well, there you have it.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   McMillen wants to go as high as $15.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.160]   This is the same battle that Apple had on the iTunes store
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.080]   with the music industry.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.240]   Remember, Apple wanted to keep it at $0.99.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:26.720]   And some music industry said, no, we want three tier pricing,
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.680]   a buck 29, 99, and 79.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:32.560]   And now the way Apple got it worked out was they went,
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.480]   they said, okay, we'll do it, but no DRM.
[00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:37.040]   So when the iTunes Plus started without DRM,
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.160]   the new tiered pricing, everybody was happy.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:42.600]   We got rid of DRM and the record industry got their buck,
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.280]   'cause basically everything's a buck 29 now.
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.120]   So that's really what they're doing.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:47.120]   - Well, the story that everyone in the chat room says,
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.720]   Leo, Leo, Leo, Amazon cave, they cave, they cave.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:52.440]   - According to TechCrunch, this is the latest.
[00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:53.880]   And again, consider the source.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.440]   Lena Rao writing on TechCrunch just minutes ago.
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:01.000]   Amazon just posted an announcement saying it gives up.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.960]   It gives in, you win.
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:05.520]   Dear customers, Amazon's--
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.320]   - Oh, this is it, yeah, this is Amazon's old trick.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.640]   - Yeah, yeah, they did this before, didn't they?
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.720]   - McMillan has a monopoly over their own titles.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.760]   Yeah, they publish them for crying out loud.
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:18.440]   McMillan, one of the big six publishers,
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.720]   has clearly communicated to us,
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:22.160]   the regardless of our viewpoint,
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.160]   they're committed to switching to an agency model
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.400]   and charging, I don't know what that means,
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:29.080]   1299 to 1499 for ebook versions of best sellers
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.360]   and most hardcover releases.
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:32.240]   - That means Amazon doesn't get to be the wholesaler
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.560]   and the retailer at the same time.
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.280]   - Yeah, that's what that agency model is.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.880]   - You're not a bookstore.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:39.160]   You are a bookstore, in other words,
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:40.440]   'cause that's what happens in the bookstore, right?
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.240]   Is it McMillan says, this is the price.
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.920]   - This is the price, that's why it's printed on the book.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.440]   - Yeah, and the bookstore does,
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.880]   if the bookstore discounts, it comes out of their pocket,
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.520]   not out of McMillan's pocket.
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:52.400]   - Who pays the MSRP on a book?
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.760]   I mean, borders does 30% off,
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.400]   although even the small book stores--
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.560]   - But the way it works, as I remember,
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.360]   and John, you probably know better than anybody,
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.960]   but as I remember is that the book publisher
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:07.080]   sets a retail price and collects half of that price
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.280]   as its money.
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:11.960]   Whatever the retailer wants to charge above that half
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:15.280]   is the retailer's profit, which could be a full 50%
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:16.600]   or if the retailer wants to discount.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.640]   And in fact, Amazon discounts some titles
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:20.800]   and makes less money.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.120]   But I think what's happening here is
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.400]   when Amazon charges 999 and the Kindle,
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.880]   it's cut, McMillan's cut as well, right?
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.400]   Yeah, and I didn't think that was the case,
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.080]   but that's what this implies.
[00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.800]   Amazon says, "We have expressed our strong disagreement
[00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.920]   "and the seriousness of our disagreement
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:40.920]   "by temporarily ceasing the sale of all McMillan titles."
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:44.160]   You know, can you say antitrust action?
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.640]   I mean, this sounds like illegal to me.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.480]   - Where's the trust?
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.120]   - It's gonna be questionable whether,
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:53.440]   well, the antitrust issue is the fact
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.720]   that they're vertically integrated
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.080]   and they have a device that nobody else has.
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.840]   - They're not, yeah, they're not really a book--
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:36:59.680]   - They're not a bookstore.
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:02.720]   - But with the Apple machine coming out and--
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:05.120]   - Maybe there's competition, yeah.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:06.240]   - You know, I don't know if you could make
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.080]   the argument, it's antitrust.
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.720]   - Well, Amazon just means spirited.
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.560]   - Didn't Amazon just change its pricing
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:14.000]   so that anybody who agrees not to put DRM on a book
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.280]   gets to keep 70% or whatever?
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.600]   - They did, they flip-flopped it out.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.720]   It used to be 30, 70 now, it's 70, 30.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:20.560]   - Right.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.280]   - You just have to enable text to speech
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.760]   and not have DRM and then you get the same model.
[00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:27.000]   You can set whatever price you want
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.920]   and you keep 70% of it.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.480]   - Amazon continues on to say,
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.520]   "We want you to know that ultimately, however,
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.680]   "we will have to capitulate and accept McMillan's,"
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:41.680]   this is like the cable war in New York City over Fox 5.
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.280]   This is like--
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.960]   - Sounds more like gurring.
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.240]   - God, we will capitulate and accept,
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:49.000]   you just wanted me to do it in German, didn't you?
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:49.840]   - Oh yeah.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:52.200]   - And accept McMillan's terms because McMillan
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.160]   has a monopoly over their own titles.
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:56.800]   Well, of course they publish them for crying out loud.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.800]   - What does that mean, they have a monopoly?
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.360]   Well, and you can't buy McMillan book from anyone else.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.200]   - Right.
[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:04.960]   - And books are different in that way, right?
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.160]   Because once you, if you write a book,
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.360]   you can't sell it to three publishers.
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.640]   - You have to sell that whole book, right?
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.480]   And that--
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.200]   - No, you could, but they don't have to agree to it.
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:13.040]   - Yeah, right.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:13.880]   - And they don't.
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:14.720]   - And they don't.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:15.560]   - Of course not.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.360]   - And we've advanced to offer McMillan books to you,
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:20.680]   even at Pice's we believe are needlessly high for ebooks.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.400]   Now that's a good point they're making.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.120]   There's no print here, there's no truck,
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.160]   there's no ink, there's no remainder system.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.000]   - Yeah.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.840]   - You have to take returns and resell it.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:33.040]   - So they're saying, this is 15 bucks too high for ebooks.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:36.360]   Amazon customers will at that point decide for themselves
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:39.200]   whether they believe it's reasonable to pay $14.99
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.400]   for a best-selling e-book Apple.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.440]   We don't believe that all of the major publishers
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.920]   will take the same route as McMillan,
[00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:45.760]   and we know for sure--
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.120]   - Okay, it will now.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.320]   - No, you know, I have still a lot of friends
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:53.400]   in the publishing business back there in New York City.
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.520]   And they hate Amazon.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.680]   And one of the things is not so much the fact that,
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:00.840]   yeah, there's no printers, there's no trucks,
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.240]   and there's no the rest of it.
[00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:03.600]   But the problem is that what you have
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.080]   is you have a bunch of grousing writers and agents
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:08.800]   because the typically, especially with best sellers,
[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:10.400]   which is what we're talking about here,
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:15.360]   they don't take the kind of mediocre little royalties
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:18.920]   that you and I would get of maybe 10 to 15%
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.720]   of the wholesale price.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:23.520]   They take a piece of the retail, suggested retail--
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:24.360]   - Off the top, maybe.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.120]   - And it's a big chunk.
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:31.040]   Well, now if the retail price goes from $40 to 9.95,
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:33.200]   well, who's gonna be complaining the most?
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.880]   - I don't know, I don't know.
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.160]   - Now the writer gets what, nothing?
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.240]   - Math is hard, I don't know what who.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.160]   The authors, okay.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:45.880]   - Yeah, I mean, it's a fight that Amazon's been in
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:49.360]   since the '90s when they started undercutting the prices.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:52.360]   I mean, they sort of were the leaders in this business
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:54.360]   of chopping down prices on stuff,
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.840]   in some cases selling niche books
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.840]   for less than they paid for them
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.280]   in order to grab business.
[00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:02.720]   And independent books, so there's a crying foul back then
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:04.720]   because they're like, look, we can't compete with this
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:07.600]   because they're just, they're not taking a profit
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.520]   on some things and driving us out of business.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.800]   - Let me tell you a little story I heard today.
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.080]   Last night, a major author was about to appear
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.280]   on a major network radio show
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.520]   and was shocked to learn that his book was no longer
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:20.680]   available on Amazon.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:22.000]   He couldn't list it on his website
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.200]   with his Amazon affiliate link,
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:25.960]   which by the way is a hell of a lot more money
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.400]   than we ever got for royalties.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.920]   And was furious and said, he's talking to other authors
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.080]   about a class action lawsuit against Macmillan
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:35.840]   because he lost a ton of money
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.360]   because when he made that appearance,
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.620]   he didn't sell any books.
[00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:43.720]   I mean, some authors wanna be on Amazon, John,
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.440]   regardless of the cut.
[00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:46.960]   - Yeah, but you're talking about a guy,
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:50.000]   if you guys are making both of his money on affiliate sales,
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.440]   he's not the same kind of,
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.200]   he's not a Danielle Steele, I can assure you.
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.960]   And the guy's in the publishing business
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:00.320]   is just like any other media business where the big names,
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:01.720]   I mean, this is like the record industry,
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:05.960]   the show business model for the recording industry
[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.960]   where Britney Spears brings in more money
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:10.720]   than almost everybody else and everyone else's a lost leader.
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:15.000]   Well, these people, the Danielle Steele's and Tom Clancy's
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.800]   and all the rest of them, the Grishums,
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.760]   but these are the guys who wag the tail
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:20.960]   and what they say goes,
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:22.720]   these other guys who are moaning and groaning,
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.840]   they sell 10,000 books, maybe, maybe 50,000 books,
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:30.480]   it's nothing and they have no influence whatsoever.
[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:35.480]   - What if Apple did on the iBook Store,
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:39.200]   what they did with the iTunes store
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.840]   and let authors sell books directly without a publisher
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:45.600]   and let them set price as apparently
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.120]   they're gonna do for publishers.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:50.040]   Wouldn't authors prefer that model?
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.640]   - And you can already do that sort of
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.760]   by putting your book out as an app.
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:55.720]   - You could do that on Amazon even, right?
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.200]   - Yeah, as an app on the iPhone store.
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.200]   - Right.
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:41:59.040]   In fact, a lot of people do that.
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.560]   In fact, I think the iPad might be a really good way
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.440]   to do that 'cause you could do multimedia,
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.440]   you could put video and audio in an app,
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.920]   you could make it a really cool book.
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:07.920]   - Look, a look.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:08.760]   - A look.
[00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:09.760]   (laughing)
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.600]   - Vell.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:12.040]   - I think there's a future in that,
[00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.520]   but not for these big names.
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:16.000]   No, Danielle Steele doesn't know how to do multimedia.
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:16.840]   - Well, it does.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.000]   - It's like simply.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.040]   - To the music business, right?
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:23.200]   Where the big huge stars like John is talking about
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.560]   are really the ones stand to lose the most
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:28.560]   from the new system, but the new system's coming
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.040]   and so all the battles are,
[00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:31.920]   how do we get to keep as much of the money
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.440]   that we used to make under the old system
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.680]   in the new system?
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:36.720]   Because this whole supply chain in publishing
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.040]   is just getting torn apart.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.800]   You don't need to have all of that stuff
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.480]   that Leo was talking about with the warehouses
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:42.920]   and the trucks and the middlemen.
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:43.760]   Just like music.
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.760]   It's the same thing that happened in the music industry.
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.120]   Anne Rice, by the way, according to Who Me
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.600]   and our chatroom is posted on the Kindle forum saying,
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.560]   she's thinking about doing that, go and direct.
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:58.520]   If you were a name like Anne Rice with a huge following
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:02.360]   and you said, I'm gonna put my next vampire book
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.200]   out by myself.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.040]   - She's right in the vampire book anymore.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.640]   - She writes Jesus books now.
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:08.280]   - But if they're popular, put your name in the cell.
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:10.240]   - Didn't Stephen King have a,
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.520]   and I believe it was pre-kindle, but--
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:13.520]   - Yeah.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:16.080]   - Didn't Stephen King have a rather dramatic failure
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.680]   with this recently?
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.600]   - Well, but you're right, it was pre-kindle.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.280]   He published a chapter at a time
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.000]   and he wanted people to pay for it directly
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   and he said it does, I didn't make nearly enough money.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.800]   - Chapter at a time when there wasn't any book reader,
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.440]   not sure about it. - He also had a blackmail scheme
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:30.960]   'cause he said, like, I'm not gonna finish the book
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.160]   unless enough people buy.
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:35.320]   - It was a real oral Roberts kind of--
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:36.160]   - Yeah.
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.640]   (laughing)
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:39.480]   - I don't know.
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:43.880]   I like the idea of disintermediating the publishers,
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:47.880]   but I also think that Amazon poses a real threat
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.480]   because this is fairly monopolistic.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.640]   They're trying to set the price.
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.440]   And it's interesting that they're doing it now
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.520]   when the iPad, when real competition's appearing
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.440]   from Apple as well as Barnes & Noble.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:58.800]   - Well, and Sony's got a wireless--
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:43:59.640]   - Sony.
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.560]   - Device now, they're in the game again.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.520]   You know, they're not behind the curve.
[00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.720]   So then the Nook is out there to--
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:06.560]   - Right.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.400]   - If you can--
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.280]   - I think though, the iPad sales will
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.840]   in the first year, "Dwarfall 3" combined.
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:12.680]   - Yeah.
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.080]   - It doesn't mean people actually use them to read books.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.440]   - Well, that's what Jobs said, isn't it?
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.280]   He says who reads anymore.
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.120]   - That's right.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:20.680]   - I'm not gonna build a device for people who read.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.680]   That's like 20% of the population.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:24.400]   - He also said video didn't belong on the iPad.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.400]   - Yeah, that's a little disingenuous, yeah.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:30.080]   I think, again, getting back to the iPad,
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:33.040]   I think as a content device where you read a book
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:35.800]   or you read a magazine or you read your newspaper,
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.360]   you know, I mean, this can be pretty cool, I think.
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.960]   - It's better for magazines, for periodicals.
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:39.960]   - Great for periodicals.
[00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:40.800]   - Magazines and news--
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.600]   - And the Kindle really falls down on periodicals.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.240]   It's not color, you can't skim.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:48.600]   - What's the news about Twitter today?
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.720]   (laughing)
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:52.240]   - We haven't pissed off enough people.
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.720]   What's the latest from Twitter?
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:56.460]   (laughing)
[00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:57.920]   - You need a bumper.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:59.360]   - The Twitter, (imitates whooshing)
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:00.200]   bumper.
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:03.120]   Let's see, there must be some other stories.
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:04.240]   I'll tell you what, let's take a break
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:07.280]   while you guys search for something to talk about.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.400]   Go to meeting friends, go to meeting
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:10.480]   from the folks at Citrix.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.560]   This is the way that I get out of traveling all the time.
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.840]   You know, they're, let's face it,
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.080]   my ad agency wants me to go meet these clients
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:18.920]   all the time, right?
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.200]   They say, "We gotta go to New York,
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.480]   we gotta go to the Jersey, we gotta visit people,
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.240]   we gotta meet 'em, we gotta press the flash."
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:27.640]   And I just say, "Haven't you heard of go to meeting?"
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.040]   Of course they have, they sold the ad.
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.800]   And they say, "Oh yeah, go to meeting,
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.640]   we should use that, yeah, you should use that.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:37.800]   Go to meeting saves you time, trouble and money traveling."
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.880]   That could kill your company's profits with go to meeting,
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:41.920]   you could do more and travel less,
[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:43.520]   make those sales presentations,
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:46.680]   do the product demos, train, collaborate.
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:49.560]   Just about any conference call is better with go to meeting.
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.400]   Go to meeting, I hold all my meetings with go to me,
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.200]   I don't leave this room.
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:57.520]   Go to meeting.com/twit, you'll find out why.
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:59.320]   Less than 50 bucks a month,
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.080]   you hold as many meetings as you want as long as you want.
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.840]   And that includes VoiceOver,
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.080]   Internet and free teleconferencing,
[00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:10.040]   49 bucks a month, go to meeting.com,
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:11.920]   try it free for 30 days right now.
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:16.080]   Go to meeting.com/twit, that's the website.
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.000]   We use it with Maxwell's house, some of our shows,
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.800]   I use it to prepare, we're gonna,
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.080]   you know, I'm doing a big presentation at Macworld,
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.960]   Macworld Live in which we have a bunch of performers
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:26.760]   and we're trying to figure out
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:27.760]   we don't have rehearsal time,
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:29.120]   they're all over the place and I suddenly said,
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.040]   "What do I mean rehearsal time?"
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:33.400]   Go to meeting, we'll do a go to meeting with everybody.
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.120]   This is the best way to do it.
[00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:38.360]   Go to meeting.com/twit, you try it out
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.640]   and you tell me what you think.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:41.960]   We thank them so much for their support
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.480]   of this week in tech.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:45.960]   Is that, John blank out his screen?
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:48.360]   - Foggy. - Looks like a piece of,
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:49.640]   it's foggy in the-- - Foggy in
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.560]   the shots house before at cottage, he does that.
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.840]   It's like he's going off and doing something
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:54.920]   in the same room.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.240]   I don't understand.
[00:46:57.240 --> 00:46:59.480]   - I got a story.
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:00.320]   - Yes, sir.
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:04.600]   - Anybody catch the articles that Comcast is starting,
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:08.280]   IPV6 trials, they're finally running out of IPV4 addresses?
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.120]   - No kidding.
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.120]   - Sky has slowly been falling for a decade now.
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.520]   - It's getting closer to our heads.
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:14.680]   - Yeah.
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:16.200]   Well I know like the, you know,
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.120]   pretty much all the government is sourcing
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:20.560]   and this is driven, I think, a lot of the IT industry
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:22.120]   to follow the basically they've been,
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.000]   everything has to be IPV6 ready.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.040]   It's been purchased by the federal government
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:27.360]   for several years now.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:28.920]   But yeah, there was,
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:31.080]   our technique I was reading an article that basically says
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:34.880]   they're looking for volunteers to be in IPV6 trials.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:36.640]   So they've been playing around with it for a while,
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:37.880]   but now they're actually getting serious
[00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:39.560]   and rolling it out to end users.
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:43.920]   - What the hell is Santa Claus in the house?
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:44.920]   - Dog tags.
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:46.760]   - Dog tags, oh god.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:48.680]   (laughing)
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:50.280]   So how does that work?
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.520]   I mean, is all my hardware and software ready to go
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:54.760]   and IPV6 compatible with-- - No.
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.400]   - Well, it depends, actually John,
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.120]   it really depends on the hardware and software,
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:59.640]   anything you bought in the last couple of years
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:03.000]   in all the Microsoft and-- - Do I just check up on--
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.640]   - Pre-operating system should be IPV6 ready.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:07.280]   I don't think you're actually gonna have to change
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.320]   the cable modem box.
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:11.760]   It would be interesting if they had to.
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.400]   - Or if they could-- - But push 'em for a moment.
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:16.520]   - They basically said they're running out of IPV4 addresses.
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:20.200]   So here we go, Comcast plans four trials.
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:23.400]   This is from the Ars Technica article.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:24.480]   The first one we use,
[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:26.320]   the transition technique is still under development
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.440]   called 6RD.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:29.520]   It's a automatic tunneling mechanism,
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:33.160]   similar to 6 to 4 available that's available in Windows.
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:38.240]   The difference is that R60 only tells IPV6 packets
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:41.400]   across an IPV4 only part of the service provider's network,
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:42.840]   which is kinda interesting.
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:45.600]   Then they're actually gonna go to native IPV6.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:50.600]   Third trial will be basically IPV4 encapsulated in IPV60
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:52.520]   across IPV6-- - Oh, it's encapsulated.
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:54.040]   - Only parts, yeah, well, basically--
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:55.920]   - So that means it'll still, I don't have to change anything.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.840]   - Right, you don't have to change a router or your--
[00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:00.120]   - Although it seems to be more on their network,
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.400]   the tests for their network,
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:02.800]   more so than the end users.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.600]   And then the fourth trial-- - And the fourth trial.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.640]   - So the issue with IPV4 was it only,
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:10.480]   it had too small an address space,
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.840]   'cause it's four dotted quads.
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:14.480]   So that means 65, what is it?
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.240]   How many, no, too trillion, I can't even know.
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:17.080]   I don't even know.
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.680]   Two billion addresses.
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.560]   And that's not enough if everybody hasn't addressed,
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:23.160]   but we kinda put off the problem
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.640]   because we were using routers.
[00:49:24.640 --> 00:49:25.480]   - Yeah.
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:27.920]   - So it wasn't like my refrigerator needed its own address,
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:29.360]   I just had it on my local network.
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:30.520]   - And a one that's also thing is--
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.440]   - The provider themselves, you minimize the number
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.800]   of IP addresses, they pooled them.
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.960]   - But with IPV6--
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:40.280]   - There's a lot of shared addresses.
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.520]   - Right, because they have a pool.
[00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:43.120]   - You don't need network address translation
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:44.920]   because everything does get an IP.
[00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:46.280]   - There's enough, there's enough.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:47.480]   Vince surfs said there's enough.
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:49.160]   I remember he talked about this on the screen savers.
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:50.000]   - I remember that.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.760]   - There's enough IP addresses in IPV6's space
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:57.440]   for every molecule in the galaxy to have its own IP address.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:58.640]   But I guess that's enough.
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:00.080]   - Yeah, well they were saying, I guess
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.520]   from what Comcast was saying is like between,
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:07.840]   they've got like 25 million TV, 15 million ISP,
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.600]   6 million Comcast digital voice subscribers.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:13.360]   And so the 16.8 million private addresses
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:16.200]   they're sitting on in their network space
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.040]   in their assigned-- - Well, the one
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:18.040]   that they're running up.
[00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:18.880]   - Yeah.
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:19.880]   - This doesn't sound too urgent though,
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.200]   'cause when you go to sign up, they say,
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.280]   note that submitting this form does not guarantee
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.720]   your participation.
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.600]   So if they're not sounding a note of like,
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:27.920]   please, please hurry.
[00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:30.760]   - What do you think about Comcast buying NBC?
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:31.880]   I mean, here we are.
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:35.360]   We all worked for a company that was purchased by Comcast,
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:37.360]   watched it go down in flames.
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:40.360]   - It didn't go down in flames.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:41.800]   - No, it still exists in fact.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:45.160]   - And there's some great shows out there
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.800]   and some people that-- - Oh, you'd be so
[00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:47.880]   diplomatic, Patrick.
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:49.280]   - Wow, he's looking for work.
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:50.760]   - I must be, wow.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:53.240]   - No, I'm happily employed right now, John.
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:56.360]   But I mean, it's also because I've still got some friends
[00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:58.360]   that still work on Attack of the Show.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:01.600]   And it's people say nasty stuff about Attack of the Show,
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:03.000]   'cause it's not the screen savers.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.600]   It was never meant to be the screen savers.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.960]   - Well, it was when it was first named the screen savers.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:08.960]   - Well, but I mean, when they shut it down
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.160]   and relaunch it, it attacked the show.
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:12.000]   - I mean, I have to say, I resented that just
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:15.040]   the slightest bit, but steering the ship
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.920]   towards the original question.
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:19.640]   - What do you think the problems with NBC being
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:20.680]   about by Comcast are?
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:24.400]   - I don't think they're gonna be analogous at all.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.860]   - Yeah, NBC broadcast, podcast,
[00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:27.920]   - With Comcast, they wanted the carriage.
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:28.760]   - Right.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:29.600]   - And they bought it for G4.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:30.760]   - They did it by the president.
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:31.880]   - For G4. - Yes, it was gift.
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:35.040]   - And with NBC, I think what Comcast is up to is
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:38.120]   they want someone to take over their channels.
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:40.240]   They've got G4, of course, and they also have
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:43.400]   E, the Comcast Sports Networks, Golf Channel,
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:44.240]   I maybe miss it.
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.120]   - So they want NBC to run these channels?
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:46.680]   - I think they're like, look, you know what?
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:48.400]   Take these, NBC Universal--
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.320]   - That is an outstanding theory.
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:51.360]   I like it.
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.800]   - Yeah, but I don't buy it because the,
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:57.040]   the first of all, I think Comcast channels,
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:59.320]   some of Comcast channels are actually doing better
[00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:03.280]   than some of NBC, and I'm grossly oversimplifying,
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:06.440]   but NBC itself, NBC's subsidiary,
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:08.440]   the smaller channels on the network,
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:11.840]   are doing a lot better than actual NBC.
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:12.680]   - Yeah, but that's the point.
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:13.520]   - You see NBC's very simple.
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.360]   - They do that well, and that's a perfect example
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:17.240]   of what you take that model at doing that,
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:18.480]   what you just described well,
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.120]   and then dropping it on top of all these other
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:22.800]   Comcast properties, same management structure,
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:24.000]   should be a winner.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.840]   - Is they doing it for that, or are they doing it
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.120]   because they want a movie studio,
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:28.840]   and they want to be a larger presence
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.320]   on the entertainment side of things?
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:31.640]   - I think that's true also.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:33.040]   I don't think it's an either or question.
[00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:33.880]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:36.320]   - Yeah, in fact, Comcast has had trouble
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:37.680]   with its content arms.
[00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:39.480]   Remember Liberty, they spun that off.
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:41.520]   That was the content creation arm for Comcast,
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:44.400]   and they didn't want to really be in that content business.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.240]   So you're saying that they still don't want to be
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.080]   in the content business.
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:49.280]   They're gonna run in NBC Universal as independent,
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:51.480]   spin all their content stuff that they're trying to get rid
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:52.320]   of into that.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:54.200]   - I think they want to be in that business,
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.320]   but they don't want to be the ones having to manage it.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:59.000]   So they buy the expertise by buying NBC.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.440]   - Right, the probably confidence.
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.120]   - Similar to what CBS did when they bought
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:05.200]   CNET Networks was, we want people who already do this
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:06.120]   to be the interactant.
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.560]   - And just kind of let them go off
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:08.400]   and do their own thing.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:09.840]   Well, that would be very good for NBC.
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:10.680]   I would be--
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:12.640]   - So until next Friday's firings.
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:13.640]   - Yeah, we'll see.
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:14.880]   - Until they're not gonna start--
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:17.200]   - We'll see, we'll see, we'll see.
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:21.760]   - But do you think there's a Comcast NBC conflict coming
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.800]   as far as carriage on the internet?
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:25.600]   If you've got a Comcast ISP and they start,
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:28.360]   I mean, are we gonna have a net neutrality battle coming
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:29.240]   after this is happening?
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:30.240]   - Well, don't--
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:32.280]   - If I were CBS, I'd be a little unhappy
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:34.680]   about the nation's largest cable company
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:37.040]   owning a television network,
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:39.720]   because don't they now have pride of place in there?
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:41.000]   And don't, I mean, what?
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.080]   - Yeah, I think it's a couple of--
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:42.920]   - They're gonna get sweetheart players.
[00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:45.600]   - Almost all of NBC Universal channels,
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:47.400]   almost all of them are in primary.
[00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:49.360]   They're in basic cable, not all of them,
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:50.960]   but certainly quite a few of them.
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:55.120]   I mean, NBC, Telamundo, Bravo, USA.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:57.240]   - I just hate it when I see companies merge like this,
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:58.080]   'cause it just seems to me
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:53:59.880]   it's just gonna be bad for competition.
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:00.720]   - Well, there's only two of them.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.160]   - I agree with you too, Al Hulu.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.400]   - Wow, John, you're a nice guy.
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:05.600]   - They're gonna pull out a Hulu.
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:06.480]   - They might as well, right?
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:08.400]   'Cause they've got Comcast as the fan.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:09.640]   What does NBC need?
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:11.800]   The truth is, all of the people who are participating
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.800]   in Hulu, it's a very uneasy relationship.
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:16.120]   They don't like Hulu, they wanna do it themselves.
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:17.840]   CBS does it themselves.
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:19.720]   - Right, because CBS has TV.com.
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:20.560]   - Right.
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:22.400]   - And so Hulu is like, no way.
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.240]   - No way.
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:24.560]   - You don't, you can move along over here.
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:27.440]   - And NBC, I imagine, we'll just move to the fan.
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:29.360]   Of course, if you're not a Comcast customer,
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:30.920]   that's not such a good thing.
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:34.640]   - Or that TV anywhere thing that Comcast is planning.
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:36.120]   - Right, they're doing that now.
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:39.800]   I can subscribe to my TV on the internet, basically.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:41.800]   And any channel that I get is a Comcast customer,
[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:43.120]   I can stream.
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:44.960]   I can watch "I Dream of Jeannie."
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:46.360]   - And that's pretty compelling when you're just,
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:48.920]   you know, you get the thing, mailer, and you look at it,
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.080]   and you're like, oh, really?
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:52.240]   It keeps me as a customer of their high price.
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:53.680]   - I just feel like I'm even all about this.
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:56.280]   - So you go to Comcast.net and you look,
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:57.960]   and you can see almost anything that you can see
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:00.840]   on your television is now streaming on Comcast.
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:01.680]   - Right.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:02.520]   - Ooh.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.120]   - Which, to me-- - Of dee-quality.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:04.960]   - It's not very good.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:06.600]   It's like, it's like Hulu, it's like everything else.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:07.480]   - No, no, no, I mean, for the,
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:10.160]   actually the, the regular cable service,
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.000]   has it gotten better?
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.720]   'Cause it used to be pretty atrocious here in San Francisco.
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.600]   - How's the HD quality of television shows on Comcast?
[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:17.320]   - Yeah, on the regular cable,
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:19.520]   not the streaming online stuff, the actual cable stuff.
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:20.960]   - I feel it's okay, I haven't really thought about it.
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:23.080]   It looks fine to me, but I'm an idiot.
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:24.920]   I know. - Hard though.
[00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:25.760]   - I can't tell.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:26.960]   You know, I, I--
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:30.600]   - So you're not looking at it, recoiling in horror,
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:31.720]   that's a good thing. - No, it looks like
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:32.640]   hi-deaf to me. - That's a good thing.
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:35.560]   - That means it's better than it used to be in San Francisco.
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:37.240]   - Yeah, no, I haven't recoiled.
[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:38.080]   - Okay.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:39.080]   - There's no recoil. - There's no recoil.
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:41.000]   There's no recoil lists.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.400]   - He doesn't hold the remote to his shoulder though.
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:44.240]   - Oh, you're very important.
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.600]   You don't wanna have the TV hitting you in the cheek.
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:47.840]   He gets real bruising.
[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:50.640]   I just, I know from our chat room,
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:51.560]   and I think this is really cool.
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:53.640]   You know, I have an OLPC sitting right behind me
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:55.080]   that I've never really used.
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:57.360]   I bought it when they did that two for one deal,
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:01.720]   and I donated, you know, an OLPC to some poor kids
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:02.920]   somewhere I don't remember where,
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:04.640]   and you get one for free, right?
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.560]   'Cause I wanted to look at the OLPC.
[00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:08.920]   Well, there is now at laptop.org,
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:11.200]   the home of the OLPC,
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:14.840]   a opportunity to donate your unused,
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:17.880]   even if it's unworking OLPC to Haiti.
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:19.480]   I think that's a really cool idea.
[00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:21.880]   If you have an unused EXO laptop,
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:23.640]   you can give it to a displaced student in Haiti,
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:25.520]   as we know most of the schools fell to the ground,
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:26.760]   a lot of students,
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:29.960]   even if they survive the earthquake have nowhere to go.
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:32.800]   - And you can still do the buy and donate as well.
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:33.840]   - Oh, that's neat. - If you want to.
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:35.720]   But yeah, I think it's a smart idea to say,
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.320]   hey, there's probably a lot of people who bought this
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.240]   to play around with, they don't use it anymore.
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:40.600]   Let's get it to somebody who can actually use it.
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:42.320]   - Absolutely, I'm gonna do this tonight.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:45.360]   This is really, I'm really thrilled to be able to do this.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:47.920]   So if you go to OLPC, laptop.org,
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:51.240]   they're wiki.laptop.org, OLPC for Haiti,
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:55.480]   and they give an address, you can ship it there,
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:58.680]   and the OLPC core field volunteers in Haiti
[00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:00.280]   will distribute them as part of rebuilding
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:03.040]   around Port-au-Prince, I think this is really neat.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:03.920]   This is really neat.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:07.280]   And is the original cardboard box required?
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:10.160]   No, oh, XO laptops are quite tough.
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:13.440]   - They are pretty, it's pretty hard shell around.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:14.320]   I'm like, I'll give them that.
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:16.400]   - They're not gonna be able to give you a tax receipt.
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:18.600]   You're not gonna get a charitable deduction here.
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:19.640]   - Really, no, that's interesting.
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:21.040]   - Why not?
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:24.000]   - It says, "Due to legal reasons, on a personal level,
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.680]   "we strongly appreciate your gift."
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:28.080]   - I think because when you bought it
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:30.160]   in the first place, you could take a tax deduction
[00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:31.000]   on that purchase. - There was a charitable
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.880]   deduction then, I don't know.
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:34.800]   - I don't care how much is it worth, come on.
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:36.960]   - I'm just saying, it sounds fishy.
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:41.280]   - John, you're such a cranky person.
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:42.120]   - What you're doing?
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:42.960]   - You should do a show.
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:44.960]   - Like, were you just getting to be sure this morning?
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:45.800]   - Yeah.
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:49.080]   - And it turns out that right in apparently Haiti
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:52.320]   is now sitting on top Saudi Arabia oil reserve.
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:55.920]   - Really? Well, that's good for us, isn't it?
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:57.280]   - Well, yeah, it's great for us.
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:58.960]   - Actually, you know what, if you're, oh, wait a minute.
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:02.800]   This goes back to Adam's original conspiracy theory
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:04.480]   that the whole earthquake was created
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:07.040]   by a giant machine under the ground
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:08.880]   so that we could march in safe Haiti
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:10.480]   and then own the country
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:12.600]   so when the oil reserves are discovered,
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:14.680]   we'll be sitting pretty.
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:16.520]   - No, he never had, I'm the one who came up
[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:18.880]   with the oil reserves and we're gonna take over the country.
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:21.680]   - Oh, he was the one with the earthquake machine.
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:24.000]   - Okay, it was a joint effort.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.680]   Another reason to listen to the effort.
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:27.720]   - Without joints, I might add.
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:28.560]   - That's surprising.
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:30.000]   - That's amazing and I'm not sure it's true
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.400]   in the case of Adam Curry, but anyway,
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:34.040]   he's always toking on something.
[00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:35.400]   Is it just a cigarette?
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:36.960]   - Yeah, he rolls his own.
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:40.320]   - So every time I've ever talked to Adam,
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:41.680]   I like on Skype, just with audio,
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:45.200]   there's always this going on and then it matches lane.
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:47.440]   So that's just, that's just tobacco.
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:48.800]   - Yeah, it's a fact.
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:50.800]   He used to, in fact, I don't mind.
[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:53.000]   - He lives in Holland, it's not illegal, right?
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.400]   - No, he used to smoke a lot of dope.
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:56.560]   He did stop smoking it a couple of years ago
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:58.440]   and he used to even when he came over
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:59:00.320]   would mix dope in with his tobacco
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:01.160]   'cause he's a smoker.
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:02.480]   - That's a very Dutch thing to do.
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:03.560]   - And one time I was walking down the street with him,
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:05.680]   I said, "What the hell, how much marijuana
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:06.960]   "you got in that thing?"
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:09.320]   And so he toned it down a little bit,
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:10.840]   but now he's got nothing.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:12.120]   - Good.
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:12.960]   - Yeah, I think that is good.
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:14.840]   - He was in brain cells left.
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:16.400]   - Once you're past 20 years old,
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:17.320]   you shouldn't be smoking weed.
[00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:18.840]   - Noagenda.com.
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:20.720]   - Yeah, right.
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:21.560]   - Noagendashow.com.
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:22.880]   - Sorry, noagendashow.com.
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:25.040]   And you guys had run that whole thing on donations
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:26.920]   and somebody told me that you're both making
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:29.000]   a good living on donations.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.040]   (laughs)
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:30.960]   That's what I thought.
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:33.040]   - That was actually my reaction exactly.
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.640]   (laughs)
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:35.480]   They have the--
[00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:36.560]   - Yeah, right.
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:40.760]   - It might pay for the papers anyway.
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:43.560]   - Should we talk about the Anti-Counterfeiting Treaty Act?
[00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:44.640]   - Acta.
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:46.280]   - Which has nothing to do with counterfeiting.
[00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:48.040]   - Or a trade agreement, not treaty act.
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:49.920]   - Yeah, well it is treaty,
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:52.000]   and that's one of the reasons act is going on.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.840]   Michael Geist has written a lot about this
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:57.160]   in he's the Canadian Larry Lessig, basically.
[00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.760]   He's a lawyer, teaches law in, I think, in Ontario.
[01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:01.880]   And writes a great blog.
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:03.680]   And he was a guy who discovered the terms
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:05.280]   of this acta treaty.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:09.120]   'Cause they were, they're secret.
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:12.560]   This is a treaty that countries are being asked to sign,
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:13.720]   become signatory to.
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:16.240]   And then, of course, because it's a treaty,
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:18.840]   it will be rubber stamped by Congress.
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:21.400]   And it's a very clever backdoor attempt
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.840]   to get the three strikes law enacted,
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.600]   not just all around the world, but here in the US.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.800]   - They're having three strikes laws.
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:31.960]   - Not that kind of three strikes.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.080]   The three strikes I'm talking about,
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:34.720]   the acta treaty, this is so--
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.000]   - Oh, you're kidding me.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.760]   - This is so horrible.
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:41.280]   If you are accused, not convicted, not proven,
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:43.520]   just accused by a rights holder,
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.040]   in other words, the record industry
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:49.720]   or the movie industry, of piracy on your internet connection,
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:53.320]   three times, so they write to your provider once.
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:54.840]   You do it again, they write again.
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:56.200]   You do it again, write again.
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.680]   They have, without recourse to a court of law,
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.680]   without due process, according to the treaty,
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:03.680]   they'll have the right to cut you off.
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:06.320]   Your internet service provider be required to cut you off,
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.680]   and then publish your name to a blacklist
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:10.480]   so that no other internet service provider
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:13.480]   can sell you access forever.
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:16.080]   So accused three times of piracy,
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:17.840]   accused three times of piracy,
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.720]   you now no longer have access to the internet
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:21.560]   for the rest of your life.
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:22.560]   (laughing)
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:23.800]   Isn't that good?
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:24.760]   - That's dumb.
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.440]   - Now they passed it in France,
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.080]   and the only difference in France,
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:30.880]   the French parliament or whatever they call them,
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:33.520]   assembly national de pas de vans a vie,
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.520]   said, "We're gonna add one little Philip,
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.480]   "that third time a judge will have to review it
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:40.240]   "before we cut you off for the rest of your life."
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.640]   But the treaty, the way the treaty is written,
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.520]   they would prefer not to have that court thing
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:45.680]   that just slows it down.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:48.320]   - And it also British one that they were talking about
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:49.680]   was particularly creepy,
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:52.320]   'cause they were talking about a 50,000 pound fine
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:55.320]   if someone in your house is accused of file sharing,
[01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.280]   starting, what do they call it?
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.680]   I don't know if they had a name for this agency
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:04.160]   that was basically gonna use RA cronies
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:08.120]   or whatever the British equivalent is to go basically like--
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.720]   - RA a cronies.
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:14.240]   - Yeah, to go after anybody they want in the act new laws
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.600]   that are having to deal with silly things
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.040]   like the legislature.
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:19.680]   - And this is a real clever backdoor attempt
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:21.480]   because if it becomes a treaty,
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:23.080]   then the US just kind of rubber stamps it
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:24.560]   and it becomes the law here too.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:26.640]   - So now they're having secret hearings in Mexico.
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.120]   - The seventh round of negotiations
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:29.800]   happen in Mexico this week.
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.240]   - You have to have secret meetings.
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:32.080]   - Yeah, 'cause they don't wanna be
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.200]   to know what the rules are.
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:35.600]   They claim that it's because it's a national security.
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.160]   That's what the Obama administration says.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.080]   It's a national security issue.
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:41.160]   - Terrorist, terrorist, the down loaders.
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.720]   - We can't conduct fruitful negotiations
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:46.280]   on this important anti-counterfeiting agreement
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.200]   unless we do it in secret.
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:50.600]   And we are doing it with the best interest
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.320]   of the United States in mind and all that sort of thing.
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:55.280]   - Well, if it was just about counterfeiting currency,
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.760]   I would have no objection to this.
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:01.000]   - It's supposed to be about counterfeiting goods.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.080]   - Right, you know, like D.
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:03.520]   - You know, you mean Chinese counterfeiting
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:04.880]   that starts to deviate.
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:06.080]   - But they're slipping in all of this
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.720]   - The IV on persons.
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:10.080]   - Yeah, they're slipping in all this IP enforcement
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:11.520]   that applies to the internet
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.680]   that would actually make it the DMCA worldwide.
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:17.640]   So you would have the same broken process
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:20.360]   where anyone can accuse anyone of copyright infringement
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:23.520]   and have to have stuff taken down
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:26.080]   and used as a club without any kind of court supervision
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:29.840]   worldwide, anti-cam quarter rules.
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:32.120]   - That's the one where, also where they can search
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.320]   your laptop as you cross the border.
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:35.920]   - Horror enforcement measures would go into place.
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:40.440]   Statutory damages, which Jamie Thomas' case is actually
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:41.640]   fighting against right now.
[01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.520]   - Yeah, she got cut down to 54,000 dollars.
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.080]   - That's sort of like, it doesn't matter.
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.160]   Just making available a file would mean
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:49.360]   that you could own hundreds of thousands of dollars
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:54.360]   in your current file you were accused of bringing across.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:58.560]   So, and it would not only have every country
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:01.360]   that signs under the treaty have to have these laws in place,
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:03.920]   but also any country who's not part of the treaty
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.560]   would then come under a lot of pressure.
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:06.400]   - Cut off.
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.720]   - To join if they wanna keep their trade negotiations.
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:09.560]   - Yep.
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:10.400]   - And they don't even get to be a part
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:11.400]   of the secret negotiations.
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.960]   - So right now, Australia, Canada, the European Union,
[01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.040]   Jordan, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand,
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:17.440]   Republic of Korea, Singapore,
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.720]   and the United Arab Emirates
[01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:20.640]   are involved in these negotiations.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.240]   Switzerland and Japan as well.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:27.240]   And they're all being held secretly.
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.440]   Thank goodness for Michael Geist,
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.280]   who has really kind of revealed this information.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:31.400]   - Yeah, this is a nice website.
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:32.240]   He's got him looking at it now.
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:33.400]   - He's great.
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:35.040]   Really smart guy.
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.520]   We interviewed him when I was up in Canada
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.480]   doing call for help.
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:41.080]   And I just, people should read up on this.
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.680]   The Electronic Frontier Foundation has an active page as well.
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:46.220]   EFF.org.
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.320]   And the more you know about this,
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:52.920]   the more appalled you will be.
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:53.760]   You know, one of the things,
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.240]   I'll give you an example in Korea, South Korea,
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.400]   which was famous, I know John, you were just there,
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:05:00.360]   famous for its, you know, high speed internet
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:02.960]   and it's kind of open internet.
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:05.600]   They passed ACTA in the Republic of Korea.
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:10.400]   And if they passed it, yeah, I think they have passed it.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:15.400]   And one of the things they ban is internet hard drives.
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:19.680]   So things like carbonite, things like SkyDrive.
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:20.520]   - What?
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:22.280]   - Things like S3.
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:25.200]   - It could potentially be used for naughty things, John.
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.080]   We have to get illegal.
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:30.240]   - You could, because pirates would use it
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:33.520]   to store content, you know, off of their system.
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:35.880]   - No, that's dumb.
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:39.040]   - An opposing ACTA or opposing the secret negotiation
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.760]   of ACTA or the provisions in ACTA doesn't mean
[01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:41.960]   you support piracy.
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:45.680]   It means that you don't want to have people accused
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:49.720]   of piracy without actually having some proof
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:51.720]   and you want the punishment to fit the crime.
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:52.560]   That's the way I feel.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:55.880]   It's not about saying, hey, we think piracy is cool.
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:57.480]   And that's sort of the message
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:59.440]   that the RIA and the MPA want to put out there is
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:00.880]   if you oppose these sorts of measures,
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.320]   well, then you're obviously, you know,
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:04.640]   supporting the terrorist, you're supporting the pirates.
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:05.840]   And that's not what it's about at all.
[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.960]   It's about having fair rules that the way
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.960]   the DMCA works right now is ridiculous.
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:12.720]   If I just don't like Leo, I can go and send
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:15.520]   take down notices against him without any basis.
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:17.280]   And hope that he doesn't have enough money
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:19.160]   to come back and prove I didn't have any basis.
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.320]   And then I pull his content down at censorship.
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:22.480]   - We gotta really fight this stuff.
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:24.680]   These guys are nuts, just nuts.
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:26.560]   Anyway, find out more EFF.org.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:28.200]   You can read about it.
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.280]   You can read about it and help fight it too.
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:34.560]   I mean, I'm a sustaining monthly donor to EFF.
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:35.400]   - Let's chat room and we're like,
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:37.240]   don't send take down notices against Leo.
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.240]   That was just an example.
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.080]   - Please don't.
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:40.200]   - I just didn't take that.
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:43.680]   - Please don't even mention that that it's possible.
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:45.600]   I'm not going to do these.
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:50.200]   Hey, as long as we're unhappy with the Obama administration,
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.560]   here's some more good news.
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:54.600]   With the release Monday--
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:55.520]   - Who said happy?
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:56.440]   - Leo is.
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:57.680]   - I'm unhappy.
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.520]   - Okay.
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:00.200]   - Well, because of ACTA, and now this,
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:02.320]   with the release of the president's budget request,
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:06.200]   NASA will get the marching orders from,
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:07.200]   this is from the Washington Post,
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.680]   the new administration's marching orders,
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:11.120]   and there's nothing in there about going to the moon.
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:12.520]   - No more budget for the moon.
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:13.680]   - I thought they were going to go to the moon.
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:17.160]   - No, the budget kills the constellation program.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:20.480]   This is the one that George W. Bush, my hero.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:21.720]   - It doesn't fund it.
[01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:22.720]   It doesn't kill it.
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:24.120]   - It just doesn't fund it.
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:26.800]   You can go to the moon, but we won't pay for it.
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:28.040]   - That's kind of what they're saying, right?
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:28.880]   - Yeah.
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:29.840]   - And privatize it.
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.680]   If private companies want to go to the moon,
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:32.600]   we encourage that.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:34.320]   - It also kills the areas one rocket,
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.920]   which was as successful as Space Shuttle.
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:39.200]   Already we've spent billions developing it.
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.880]   And that undermines Mars because the point of going to the moon
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.600]   was not so much just to return to the moon.
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:46.440]   - Right.
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:49.640]   - To develop the ability to leapfrog onto Mars.
[01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:53.280]   Former NASA administrator Michael Griffin
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:56.560]   views the Obama budget as disastrous for human spaceflight,
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:58.960]   quote, "it means essentially the US has decided
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.680]   "they're not going to be a significant player
[01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:03.760]   "in human spaceflight for the foreseeable future."
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:06.000]   The path they're on with this budget is a path that can't work.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.800]   I mean, yeah, I guess we're in economic trouble,
[01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:12.800]   but boy, it just seems like it's so little money, really.
[01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:16.360]   - Yeah, they never wanted to do it in the first place.
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:17.200]   - I guess not.
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:21.200]   - I mean, there's that latest thing.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.040]   - What's that?
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:24.880]   Oh, you mean the puffin?
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.360]   - No, the latest thing--
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:27.200]   - I want one of those.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.080]   - We're going to privatize the whole space program.
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:29.920]   - That's all right.
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.920]   Maybe that'll work.
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:34.480]   The budget is boosted by more than a billion a year,
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:35.920]   and that's what you're going to hear, of course,
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.320]   is that, "Well, wait a minute, what are you talking about?
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:40.000]   "We're increasing the budget by a billion a year,
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.760]   "but they need three billion to pursue
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:44.200]   "the human spaceflight program."
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:46.000]   So it's underfunded, I guess.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.120]   But you know, Paul Allen could just give him a couple of bills.
[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:51.640]   - He's fun, the whole thing.
[01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:53.400]   - Bill Gates, another couple of bill.
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:56.040]   - Well, and that is kind of what they're hinting about is,
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:58.920]   we would like to push this into the private sector more.
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.120]   You want to go to the moon, fine.
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.320]   Get the rich people to go to the moon.
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:03.160]   - Get the rich people.
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:04.160]   That's the problem.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.000]   - They're going to leave us here.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.360]   - They're going to go to the moon.
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:07.200]   They're going to leave us.
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.200]   We're all going to be alone.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.800]   All the rich people will be living on the moon
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:12.400]   in their special moon pen houses.
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:15.560]   Haven't super moon parties.
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:16.400]   - I'm going to tell you right now,
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:18.800]   they're going to be freezing their butts off those people.
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:21.840]   - Well, you know, Paul Allen built that big yacht
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.560]   just so he could be the king of the party, right?
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.680]   I think Paul should build a little moon unit.
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:30.080]   - I think it is scary how little science we fund right now.
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:31.200]   When you consider that we--
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.040]   - Short site.
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.800]   - Let the LHC go to Europe.
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.680]   We have killed the space shuttle program,
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:37.320]   so we're now relying on Russia
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:40.000]   to get up into space and back.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.480]   And now this, where we're underfunding
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:46.120]   the one major project that we had going on,
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:49.480]   other than some very important and very good telescopes
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:52.080]   and surveys and missions like that,
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:53.880]   I'm not sure what we're up to
[01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:58.440]   and how we maintain a lead in scientific advancements
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:09:59.960]   and scientific exploration.
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.680]   - I understand people say, oh no,
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:03.120]   you got to spend the money here on Earth.
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.040]   We're in crisis.
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:06.560]   We've got a fiscal budgetary crisis.
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:08.640]   And also we've got poverty
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.080]   and we should spend this money
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:13.120]   to support people at home.
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.360]   But I think there's also some,
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:17.600]   is there not some benefit to the thought
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:18.960]   that you might want to leave the planet,
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.000]   find out more about the planet?
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:20.840]   Maybe even--
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:23.400]   - Yeah, but we've also got a Congress
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.200]   that for several years managed to,
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:27.960]   you know, it's just an administration
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:29.560]   that was against stem cell research.
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:31.240]   We've got a population divided
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:33.120]   on what's appropriate medical research.
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:37.800]   I mean, it's sad, but a lot of the advancement in science
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.000]   is just, you know, we can't afford it.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.120]   It's not even, it's not even not a,
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.760]   Florida, people are outright against it,
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.520]   at least until someone in the family suffers
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.720]   a traumatic accident and then suddenly,
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:51.640]   maybe it's not so evil after all.
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:54.000]   - We seem to have an anti-science bias
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.880]   that's kind of crept into the conversation largely
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.240]   because the educational system,
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:10:59.200]   and I've argued this,
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:00.840]   I've always thought Obama should have emphasized that
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.200]   to begin with instead of that.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:03.920]   It's a vicious circle too because the less you're--
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.000]   - Yeah, you get a bunch of dummies
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.440]   and then they don't understand it,
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:07.640]   you know, they just just ridiculous.
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:08.480]   - But you know, this country--
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:09.640]   - The vicious circle of dummy dummies.
[01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.400]   - This country going back to Adley Stevenson,
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.880]   has always been anti-intellectual,
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:14.440]   anti-egg head, right?
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:15.280]   That's kind of--
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:16.840]   - That's not before, way before Stevenson.
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:19.320]   - Oh yeah, go back to Andrew Jackson, I think.
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:20.400]   Was he an egg head?
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.920]   - Yeah, he was the first of the presidents.
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:24.520]   They're like, I'm not part of that liberal--
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:25.720]   - Ham, smart, pants.
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:27.360]   - I'm gonna let my friends into the White House.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.200]   - Ham, he was complaining, he wasn't an egg head.
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:31.120]   I think the first real egg head we had in office,
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.120]   which is a term by the way,
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:35.280]   an endearing term that was used in the 50s by our parents,
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.680]   was Woodrow Wilson.
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:38.520]   - He was a professor, Princeton, never--
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:39.360]   - Yeah, actually Adam, he's the president.
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:41.440]   - Adam was an egg head on some level.
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:42.560]   He was a functional lawyer.
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:44.400]   - John Adams is a very smart guy.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.560]   I saw the HBO TV show.
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.000]   I know all about him.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:48.920]   - But Thomas, look at this.
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:49.760]   - I mean, look at this.
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.560]   - Terry, he's like, "That just looks like Russ Pitts,
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:52.760]   "exactly right."
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:55.440]   (laughing)
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:58.040]   - I never thought of that, Paul Jamani looks just like
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:01.000]   the producer, the web producer, we used to have Russ Pitts.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:02.480]   It's the sideburns.
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:06.000]   And the grouchy attitude, the demeanor.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.120]   - But I mean, Thomas Jefferson was certainly--
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:12.360]   - He founded the University of Virginia.
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:15.440]   - He studied art in the past five years.
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.280]   - So do you think we have a kind of--
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:18.120]   - Stay yes.
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:21.840]   - Do you think we have a bipolar relationship to intellectuals?
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:22.680]   Or do you think we--
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:24.400]   - The country is always a good guy.
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:25.240]   - Kill them.
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.600]   - We've gone from like 80% of the population living
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:30.120]   in rural environments to 80% of the population living
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:33.000]   in cities to like 80% of the population living
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:33.960]   in the suburbs now.
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:36.320]   I mean, the country has always been divided.
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:38.160]   It has always had radical differences.
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.280]   Even the founding of the company, the country was one.
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.680]   There's a Freudian slip.
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:46.080]   Was like, if you read about the battles that went on
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.080]   between the--
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:47.920]   - Do you think--
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.400]   - The northern states--
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:52.720]   - And I say this as a parent, about to have a senior
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:53.920]   in high school and to enter college
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:55.960]   and then another one shortly thereafter.
[01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:57.520]   Do you think-- - Uh-huh.
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:00.800]   - We could ever in this country do as say Sweden does
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:04.520]   and have free higher education or is that just really crazy?
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:06.640]   - Well, we did have free higher education
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:09.920]   in the state of California and then the people responsible
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:12.800]   for it decided it was much more important to preserve
[01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:13.920]   and there's two arguments.
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:15.320]   This proposition 13, right?
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:18.280]   Proposition 13 was put in place in California.
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:20.960]   - And it was a property tax cap.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.280]   - And it was because they were killing us
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:24.240]   with property tax jackups.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.880]   - Well, it was, yeah, which because the value
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:28.360]   of the land was going up, right?
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:31.080]   So people, and I've seen this happen, you know,
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:34.120]   case in point, like ranchers and there were a couple ranchers
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:37.120]   near Vale, Colorado and because Vale would, you know,
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:40.840]   in suddenly like 1969 or 1970, they start this ski resort,
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:42.880]   property values became astronomical.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:45.080]   So people have been ranching there for 100 plus years.
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:46.920]   Suddenly there was absolutely no possible way
[01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:49.440]   to pay the property taxes on their ranches.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.080]   So they got pushed out, right?
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:54.160]   It here in California, people who had been living in LA,
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:57.320]   you know, in Berkeley, in San Francisco,
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:59.880]   and all these other cities, Orange County, San Diego,
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:02.000]   the property values started going berserk.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.160]   So people, especially people on fixed incomes,
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:05.840]   could no longer pay the property taxes,
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.920]   would have to sell or lose their homes.
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:11.080]   So the idea was that, okay, we're gonna lock this down,
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.720]   we're gonna, and we're gonna lock,
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:15.960]   we're gonna cap the cost of property taxes,
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:19.520]   but they did it for civilian.
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.960]   They did it for people, they did it for businesses.
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:24.200]   So there's businesses that are sitting on
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:26.080]   unbelievable amounts of property
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:28.400]   that the property taxes haven't changed on them since,
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.600]   what was it, John 76, 77, when this was--
[01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:33.080]   - It was as well ago, yeah, 77, yeah.
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:35.320]   - You know, and then you have all of the other expenses,
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:37.120]   the population, explosion, and california.
[01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:38.840]   - But you know, you had to stay on the property
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:40.360]   to get that deal, you couldn't, you know,
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:41.920]   be jumping around.
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:43.560]   I mean, if you move, you know--
[01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:44.560]   - Yeah, you get reassessed.
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:46.600]   - Right, right, but I mean, most of the people,
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:48.760]   if they move, they were moving to significantly less
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:51.080]   expensive places and more rural sections of the animal.
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:52.440]   - It made sense for older people,
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:53.960]   it made sense for fixed income people,
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:55.440]   people were being taxed out of their homes,
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:56.600]   I understood that, but it also--
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:57.600]   - But the reality is, is that--
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:58.920]   - Killed higher education.
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:14:59.760]   - Killed education.
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:00.600]   - I don't think so.
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:02.840]   - But they had no taxes on what killed higher education.
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:04.600]   - They decided to come up with the lottery.
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:05.920]   Remember when they started the lottery,
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:07.680]   it was gonna be for education.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:09.480]   - Our kids win too, was the slogan.
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:11.000]   - And so they bring up the lottery,
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.160]   oh, the lottery, oh, we're gonna be a lottery state now.
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.040]   All the money's going to education.
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:15.880]   So what did they do?
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:17.360]   Yeah, they all went to education,
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:19.040]   but the money that used to go to education,
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:20.440]   they just pulled the plug on it.
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.800]   The education ends up getting less money.
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.280]   - Right, well if we can go from hyper local to hyper wide,
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.640]   I don't think any intellectualism is--
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:28.800]   - This is not text that we should probably stop.
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:30.440]   - Problem, I think it's a global problem.
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:31.480]   - I think it's always been there,
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:32.680]   there's always been this sort of like,
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:34.720]   bring down the egg heads,
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:37.360]   sort of mentality that waxes and wanes over time.
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.720]   - Well speaking as an egg head, I resent it.
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:40.720]   - Eat the rich.
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:41.560]   - Eat the rich.
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:42.400]   - Eat the rich.
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:43.240]   - Eat the rich.
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.240]   - Oh, you're so sorry to speak about something.
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:46.760]   Like that's an insult.
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:48.640]   - Yeah, you're too intelligent.
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:50.160]   Can you just dumb it down a little bit?
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:51.520]   And by the way, folks,
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:53.200]   what you just heard for the last 10 minutes,
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:55.920]   that's what happens when we don't talk about Twitter
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:56.840]   in the iPad.
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:57.680]   I just wanted to--
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:58.840]   - We go crazy.
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:00.080]   - We go crazy.
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:01.880]   - Talk about football.
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:04.840]   - Pro-ball, good idea, bad idea.
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:05.760]   (laughing)
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.280]   - About anti-virus tools.
[01:16:07.280 --> 01:16:09.160]   - You'd love to do a sports show, I bet.
[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:12.960]   - Oh man, no, I worked on CanBR when it went sports.
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.440]   The station I worked at in San Francisco,
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:15.720]   the last radio station I worked at,
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:16.560]   no, not the last,
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:17.640]   but one of the last,
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:20.320]   when all sports, and I just felt like a fifth wheel.
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.640]   Man, I didn't know anything about sports.
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:24.520]   - Tech sports.
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:26.120]   - That was a great tackle.
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:26.960]   - Yeah.
[01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:27.800]   - That's a great tackle.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:28.640]   - So embarrassing.
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:33.000]   And I had to be president of the San Francisco Giants fan club.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:33.840]   - And we went out--
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:34.680]   - You like baseball.
[01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:36.080]   - Well, I had to like baseball.
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.440]   I made that my--
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.280]   - Baseball was great.
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.440]   - You got me the ball, I think.
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:42.440]   - I got you a sign ball.
[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:43.280]   - Yeah, I think so.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:45.720]   - Who was, I got my dad at Willie Mays autograph.
[01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:46.640]   That was cool.
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:47.480]   - Well, that would be cool.
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:50.280]   - We were campaigning for San--
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.360]   To get the city of San Francisco
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:52.800]   to build a stadium for the Giants
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:54.800]   'cause they were in the world's worst stadium
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:56.160]   candlestick park.
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:58.600]   And we got one of them faux trolley cars,
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:00.600]   a motorized cable cars.
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:01.440]   - The party cars.
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:02.280]   - Party cars.
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:03.640]   And Willie Mays and I,
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:05.800]   and we went to every sports bar in town,
[01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:07.920]   and Willie would come in and,
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.400]   you know, and the crowd goes crazy
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:10.680]   'cause it's Willie Mays.
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:12.520]   He's very recognizable in San Francisco.
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:14.160]   And he'd say, "Vote for prop W."
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.000]   And they'd go, "Okay."
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.320]   And then we'd leave and we'd go to another bar.
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:17.840]   It was fun, that was fun.
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:18.760]   - That's a good night, man.
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.960]   - Yeah, it was a blast.
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:22.360]   It was really, really fun.
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:23.920]   And then, you know, I'm there.
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:25.840]   I said, "Will, could you autograph this ball
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:26.680]   for my dad?"
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:27.520]   And he did.
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:29.080]   So that was kind of fun.
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:29.920]   How do we--
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:31.240]   - We'd rail off the track wheel.
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:32.080]   - We'd rail off the track wheel.
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:32.920]   - We'll be over there.
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:34.360]   - Where the hell are the rails?
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:37.480]   Can we smarty pants take a break
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:39.840]   and we'll come back and we'll find one more story or two.
[01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:40.840]   I don't know the talk about--
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.600]   - Crafts even tech stories.
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:44.960]   - Please, Lord, give me a tech story.
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:49.320]   The iPad sucked all of the news out of the room, didn't it?
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:52.120]   - We can talk about Google dumping IE6.
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:55.080]   - And I think the Google book deal is again on the rails.
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.720]   But, you know, that's like talking about actits,
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:00.240]   another one of them subjects and just, you know, it's like,
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.360]   let me talk, this is a tech story.
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:04.720]   This is something I like to talk about, audible.com.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:07.880]   I loves my audible.
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:10.840]   Audible is the audio bookstore.
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:11.680]   You know, it's funny.
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:12.960]   I don't even know why they need to advertise
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:14.920]   because it really isn't any competition.
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:18.000]   I mean, is there, if you want to listen to audio books,
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.480]   it's like a no brainer, you just go to AUDIBLE.com
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:25.560]   and you're listening to the best audio books in the world.
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.720]   I used to when I first started commuting to Sanford,
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:29.320]   so actually it's before then,
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:32.840]   before I did the tech TV in '98,
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:35.600]   I was commuting to Cupertino in like '94, '95,
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.040]   doing a TV show for Ziff Davis.
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:38.880]   That was a two and a half hour commute each way
[01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.360]   on a good day.
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:42.320]   And that's when I started listening to audio books.
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:44.640]   But in those days, it was books on tape or recorded books
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.160]   and they were coming to cassettes,
[01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:48.800]   like 20 cassettes in a box and you'd have one month to listen.
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.480]   And if you didn't finish the book in a month,
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.120]   you'd have to send it back and get it back again.
[01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:52.960]   Oh, is it pain?
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:57.920]   I was, when Audible came along in 2001, my life changed.
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:01.360]   And now I just, I am such an audible addict.
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.720]   Audible.com/twit2, you can try it.
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:06.080]   If you've never done it before, you can try it.
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:10.120]   Two books free.
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:11.760]   Audible.com/twit2, you'll go to
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:13.760]   the Platinum signup.
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:16.080]   That's two books a month, the first two are free.
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.880]   And because the Grammys are tonight,
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:21.600]   they've got a list of Grammy nominated books.
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:25.120]   Yes, they do have a Grammy nomination for audio books.
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.080]   So this would be, these would be the best books to look,
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:29.640]   listen to, you know, according to the Grammy committee,
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:32.160]   Michael J. Fox's always looking up the adventures
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:34.480]   of an incurable optimist.
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:36.280]   Oh, how about this?
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:39.240]   David Stratham and Richard Dreyfus
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:41.640]   reenacting the Lincoln Douglas debates.
[01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:44.360]   Now, now there's some for eggheads everywhere.
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:46.200]   I had a distinguished record of service
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:47.960]   in the Illinois state legislature
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:49.760]   and had served a term in the lower house
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:52.800]   and powers as a member of the Whig party.
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:54.200]   I'd love to listen to that.
[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:59.000]   So that's nominated for, oh, how about the dramatization
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.040]   with Edward Herman Sandro and Michael Madsen
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.160]   of the Maltese Falcon?
[01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:04.040]   Well, I gotta listen to that.
[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:06.680]   This is all from Audible and you get two of these for free.
[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:07.520]   So you could--
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:09.680]   This was tall and pliantly slender.
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:10.520]   Yes.
[01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:11.360]   But it has an angularity anywhere.
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:12.200]   I was talking about you.
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:14.400]   Her body was erect and high-breasted.
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:15.400]   Her legs long.
[01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:18.160]   Whoa, I didn't know the Maltese Falcon was so racy.
[01:20:18.160 --> 01:20:19.320]   (laughing)
[01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:21.760]   Wow, Jimmy Carter narrating his own book.
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:24.480]   We can have peace in the Holy Land.
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:25.840]   Kind of, that's not racy.
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:28.640]   Oh, here's something very racy.
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:31.900]   Carrie Fisher's book, is it novel or memoir?
[01:20:31.900 --> 01:20:34.200]   Wishful drinking.
[01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:35.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:36.120]   She's got a one woman show, the same name.
[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:37.840]   So I think it's must be a memoir.
[01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:39.200]   Let's see what it says.
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.400]   Carrie Fisher tells the true
[01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.600]   and intoxicating story of her life
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:44.520]   with an imminable wit.
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:45.600]   Yes.
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:47.440]   You can only imagine what Carrie--
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.000]   You wanna fit in.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.200]   Hell, I still wanna fit in with certain humans.
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:55.680]   But as you get older, you get a little more discriminating.
[01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:58.240]   Well, my parents were professionally committed
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:20:59.400]   to sticking out.
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:01.080]   Does either all the grammity nominated?
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:04.480]   How about Nelson Mandela's favorite African folk tales?
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:08.920]   Samuel L. Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg and Matt Damon.
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:11.480]   One of these guys is not like the other.
[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:15.120]   Dean Pitchford, Captain Nobody.
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.400]   I never heard of that one.
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:18.240]   (whistles)
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.080]   No.
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:21.440]   (laughs)
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:22.920]   I don't know what that was.
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.880]   That can't be kept nobody there.
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.000]   Sorry, Tyler just woke up.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.200]   Oh, oh, hi, Tyler.
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:29.480]   You know, they hate for kids too.
[01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:31.080]   This is a great thing, Patrick.
[01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:32.760]   They've got kids books.
[01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:35.200]   So you can put on a recorder and the kids can listen.
[01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:38.080]   And studies have shown that kids
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:40.440]   who are listening to audio books read
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.800]   at a higher level sooner, they get the chapter book sooner.
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:45.360]   It's really a great resource for everybody.
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:49.000]   I want you to go to audible.com/twitto.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.640]   Take a look at the grammity nominated books.
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:53.280]   Pick a couple there.
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:55.160]   Maybe the January customer favorites.
[01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:56.800]   This is one of the great things about the audible site.
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:58.040]   It's a great way to browse.
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:21:59.320]   It'll play on all your devices.
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.360]   By the way, they will work on the iPad.
[01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:03.640]   So you can move your books over
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:05.520]   as soon as you get your iPad, iPhone,
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:10.520]   Zoom, Kindle, audible.com/twitto.
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:12.880]   We thank them so much for their support.
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:14.440]   This week in tech.
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:17.400]   Are you doing is a Sword and Laser book?
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:19.240]   Yeah, we're finishing up Cori Doctorow's
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:20.320]   down and out the Magic Kingdom.
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:21.400]   It is not all.
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:25.480]   We'll be doing a new selection this month and it's open.
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:27.760]   So now do you, so you let your fans
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:28.920]   help choose the Sword and Laser stuff?
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:29.840]   Yeah, we go back and forth.
[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.160]   Sometimes we put it up to a vote.
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:32.840]   Sometimes we take open recommendations.
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:34.640]   Sometimes we get dictatorial and just.
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:35.480]   So how does it work?
[01:22:35.480 --> 01:22:37.880]   So you read down and out in the Magic Kingdom,
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:41.320]   which is a great book and coined the term Wuffy.
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:42.440]   Yeah.
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:45.200]   And so you read it and then do you like
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:46.360]   have a book group of the air?
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:47.280]   I mean, what happens next?
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:48.960]   Yeah, so we have one episode where we set it up.
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:50.840]   We talk a little bit about the background of the book
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:53.000]   and how it came about, maybe a little stuff
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.160]   to prep you for reading it.
[01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:55.120]   Then you read it.
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:58.320]   The next episode we do a wrap up where we talk about
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:59.800]   do we take comments from people who read it.
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:02.080]   You got an interview with Daniel Suarez.
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:03.360]   And then sometimes we'll do an interview.
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:05.000]   In fact, we're trying to get Corey.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:05.840]   Oh, Corey will do it.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:06.520]   I'm sure. Yeah.
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:07.520]   Corey's great.
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:09.120]   Oh, he'll do it in a minute.
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:10.200]   Daniel Suarez.
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:11.040]   Wow.
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:12.040]   Daniel Suarez.
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:14.000]   Demon and freedom.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.520]   Those are both those are the next two books.
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:16.360]   They're a dude.
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:17.200]   I just downloaded it.
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:18.040]   Can't wait.
[01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:19.680]   You know him?
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:20.680]   Know that guy.
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:21.600]   You should read Demon.
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:23.080]   John, I think you might like it.
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:23.920]   I can't wait.
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.240]   I'm so excited.
[01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:26.560]   I know reading is hard.
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:28.600]   I can barely read the newspaper.
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:29.960]   That's why you got to get audible, John.
[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:31.440]   They read to you.
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:33.520]   I'm like having servants.
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:35.720]   When you get older, you can't read.
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:36.880]   I can't read.
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:39.320]   I can't read anymore.
[01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:40.280]   He could feel his legs.
[01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:43.080]   Actually, that's why I like the kindles because I could make the type size.
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:44.960]   Like every book is a large type book.
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:46.880]   It works a lot.
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:47.800]   It's good.
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:48.400]   And then I take it to--
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:49.760]   One word on a page.
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:52.760]   And I take it to Denny's for the early bird special.
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:53.600]   And I fit right in.
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:54.280]   It's great.
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:55.280]   A bunch of people like me.
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:57.120]   It's the most coffee Mr. LaFoy.
[01:23:57.120 --> 01:23:58.680]   I can't have any more coffee.
[01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:00.000]   The Prashteach acting up.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:00.440]   It's great.
[01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:02.360]   It's really a pleasure to go in there.
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:05.360]   I've flashed my AARP card.
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:07.800]   And I can have all the bacon I can eat for $1.
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:09.520]   You said "Gramony Awards."
[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:10.960]   I did?
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:13.800]   It is the "Gramony Awards," isn't it?
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:15.360]   Isn't it?
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:16.520]   Yeah, it's the "Gramony Awards."
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:17.920]   "Gramony Awards."
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:20.400]   Seven "Gramony Awards" with all their--
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:21.200]   New York.
[01:24:21.200 --> 01:24:22.440]   "Gramony Hall."
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:23.320]   Yeah, that was--
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:29.360]   wasn't that we're a typical new in "Tyler 2," saying their famous song.
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.160]   "Boss Tweed."
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:31.840]   Boss Tweed?
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:32.560]   Very good.
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:34.360]   See, John, you can't fool John with your--
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:35.920]   Janet Tweed's dad.
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:38.360]   You can't fool John with the American history references.
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:39.400]   He's right on it.
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:39.880]   He's a tweeter.
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:41.840]   Tweeter.
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:43.040]   Jeez.
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:43.960]   We just descended.
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:47.560]   So the Google book deal looks like it's down and out once again.
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:48.200]   The same--
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:49.280]   The winner's is going to end.
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:50.360]   Never.
[01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:51.120]   Never.
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:52.840]   Because Google's got more money than God.
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:54.200]   And Amazon is fighting it.
[01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:56.280]   Everybody else is fighting it.
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:24:59.520]   Because Google-- basically, the fight is over orphaned works.
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:01.520]   Everybody agrees that if it's a public domain, Google
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:03.520]   should be able to scan it, sell it to whatever they want it.
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:06.680]   But what if it's a book that's not in the public domain, technically?
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:08.400]   But nobody says, I own it.
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:09.480]   Or even if--
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:10.440]   Well, this is an issue.
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:13.960]   Even if it's not orphaned, but you don't speak up,
[01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:15.240]   Google gets the right to sell it.
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:15.960]   That's the problem.
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:19.160]   And if you don't come forth to get the royalties within five years,
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:22.080]   the royalties get split up amongst Google and all the other authors
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:25.120]   in the business that have spoken up.
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:28.840]   It's an opt-out situation for every author on the planet,
[01:25:28.840 --> 01:25:30.760]   whether you're part of the author's guild or not.
[01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:34.280]   So Ursula K. Le Guin wrote a letter on behalf of, I think,
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:36.200]   60 other authors saying exactly that.
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:38.320]   It should be opt-out, not opt-in.
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:39.840]   I mean, it should be opt-in, not opt-out.
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:40.280]   Yeah, right.
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:42.120]   You should be by default.
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:43.440]   You should retain your rights.
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:45.320]   Author's guild should be able to make this deal with Google
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:48.160]   for their 8,000 authors, but not for every other author
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:49.720]   on the planet.
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:52.480]   I think that there's still a problem with these orphaned works.
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:53.400]   And it's very annoying.
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:55.640]   These things need to be either--
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:56.880]   it's not as though--
[01:25:56.880 --> 01:25:57.400]   let's face it.
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:59.840]   There's some book, let's say, has written about 1945.
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:01.800]   It's an economic book that's kind of interesting.
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:05.200]   It might be of value to people studying the science.
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:10.000]   And it might be worth republishing a small run of maybe
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.680]   1,000 copies.
[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:13.620]   This is not like something that's going to be a runaway best
[01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:13.880]   seller.
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:16.280]   It's not going to break anybody if they don't get it.
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:20.760]   But if the thing just stays buried with one last copy rotting
[01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:23.200]   away in some library basement, I think
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:23.880]   it's ridiculous.
[01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:26.160]   They have to be able to bring these books out.
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:30.560]   It's not as though anyone's going to really get ripped off.
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:32.040]   Problem with orphaned works is cop--
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:34.280]   by some old orphaned work that nobody cares about.
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:36.640]   If we didn't have copyright law extending for like three
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:38.240]   times the life of an average human,
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:39.800]   we wouldn't have an orphaned works issue.
[01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:40.520]   That's the problem.
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:41.800]   We need to fix copyright.
[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:43.560]   That's absolutely the case.
[01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:44.160]   That just--
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:45.840]   As soon as this is too late, it only changed that.
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:47.200]   That'll be a possibility.
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:49.680]   Well, and now, of course, with the Supreme Court ruling
[01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:52.800]   that corporations can basically give all they want to campaigns,
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:53.300]   that's it.
[01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:56.200]   That's never copyright law will now never change.
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:56.680]   Right?
[01:26:56.680 --> 01:26:59.160]   Because they'll push all of their candidates in that they want.
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:00.560]   It'll protect copyright law.
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:01.560]   Yes, stooges.
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:02.840]   They're quite that easy because they're more--
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:03.600]   Use their right word.
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:05.320]   Yeah, it makes it harder.
[01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:08.320]   But it's been-- the general rule of thumb
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:11.360]   is that the more money you have to throw at a particular political
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:14.880]   issue, the more likely you are to win in the age of television
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:16.800]   and other mass mediums.
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:18.640]   I thought it was an interesting debate, though,
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:22.480]   with the Supreme Court, because it is a form of speech
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:24.520]   that gave money to a political campaign.
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:27.280]   And I mean, we do protect speech.
[01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:29.800]   Is a corporation somehow not?
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:32.440]   Back in the golden age--
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:33.520]   excuse me, the Gilded Age.
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:37.120]   But back in the 1870s, 1890s, the people
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:40.760]   that if you scale the amount of money that Bill Gates's work,
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:42.720]   it's a pit and compared to a bunch of the people that
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:44.680]   were running the railroads and the Vanderbilts.
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:45.640]   And it's the Vanderbilts.
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:48.840]   And you look at the amount of money
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:50.120]   that was going around back then.
[01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:52.160]   It's already was decided over 100 years ago
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:54.240]   that corporations had the same rights
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:56.400]   as American citizens in the courts.
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:57.480]   So in some sense--
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:27:58.960]   So that's the problem.
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:00.600]   Are corporations really people?
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:01.280]   Corporations being--
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:02.840]   If there are people, how can we can't arrest
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:04.400]   when it's thrown in jail for murder
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:06.480]   when they kill people with their crappy products?
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:07.320]   They're made of people.
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:08.880]   There in lies the rub, John.
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:12.160]   They have all of the upside of being a citizen
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:13.960]   and none of the downside and the ability
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:18.720]   to let the corporation can move on while the officers of the corporation
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:20.400]   get to take the rap for the decision to make.
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:22.960]   That's why I'm a corporation, baby.
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:23.960]   You better believe it.
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:26.280]   But even the officers don't have to take the rap.
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:30.760]   In some cases, if a corporation like John says conducts murder,
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:32.160]   it's just a fine.
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:34.920]   And nobody is at fault.
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:37.920]   Nobody goes to jail for murder because it was a corporation.
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:40.280]   And if they really start to clear bankruptcy
[01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:41.920]   and shut the corporation down before they--
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:42.440]   No, no, no.
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:43.920]   --they think they're viable for what they've done.
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:45.400]   And which they shouldn't be allowed to do
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:49.760]   because that's euthanasia, which is illegal with a person.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:51.960]   I'm just saying, this is a classic example of the story.
[01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:52.920]   It's a zumbar.
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:53.360]   Yeah.
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:56.320]   Well, it may be a stupid idea, but it's been the law of the land
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:57.280]   for over 100 years.
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:58.680]   It's been filled with--
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:00.240]   You know, it was a 5'4" decision.
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:01.360]   It's not cut and dried.
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:04.280]   Obviously, there's more to it.
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:06.800]   And it did overturn several presidents,
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:09.200]   previous Supreme Court presidents that said corporations--
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:11.440]   Which is a little weird.
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:11.920]   Yeah.
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:12.840]   Because money has speech--
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:15.360]   Well, we all know conservative judges are not activist
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:17.320]   and in fact, are not making law.
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:20.000]   They're just upholding the Constitution as they see it.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.920]   So if I have more money than you, I have more speech than you.
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:24.000]   Yeah, you have a lot more speech.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.040]   So the Supreme Court has million speeches.
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:26.240]   You get millions of dollars in speech.
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:26.800]   Right.
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:28.440]   That's a good point.
[01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:29.080]   Tough luck.
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:29.640]   That's the point.
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:31.000]   Well, the flip side is this is also America.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.680]   You can start a company, become rich,
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:35.320]   and then use that money you've made to be as free speech
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:36.000]   as you want, Tom.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:36.720]   A lot more speech?
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:37.720]   Succeed.
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:39.640]   Well, that's fair.
[01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.480]   Except that--
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:44.160]   And we should be the ones talking of all the people that
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:46.200]   have a lot of extra free speech compared
[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:48.160]   to the poor guys in the chat room.
[01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:50.120]   We've got an intimate speech.
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:53.840]   Hey, you may have free speech, but if you cannot go to Gmail
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:56.080]   and create a label named Buzz--
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:57.680]   Yes and no.
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:29:58.120]   Well, look.
[01:29:58.120 --> 01:29:59.440]   See, it says you cannot--
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:00.320]   I'm doing it right now.
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:01.480]   Wouldn't let me do it.
[01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:03.040]   You can't create a label named Buzz.
[01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:05.600]   It's a reserved system label.
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.520]   Oh, there's a good backstory there.
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:08.520]   No, look at mine.
[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:09.360]   See right there.
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:09.360]   I know.
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:09.880]   I'm looking at mine.
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:10.840]   Please try another name.
[01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.440]   Well, you're-- because you know why you can do it?
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:14.360]   Because you're the host of Buzz Out Loud.
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:15.120]   OK, here's the thing.
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:18.480]   When you do it in the way you just did it, it says no.
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:21.120]   But if you just go up into labels and say--
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:22.680]   Oh, you found a label loophole.
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:23.600]   And press Create View.
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:24.600]   What are you guys talking about?
[01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:27.240]   It says the conversation has been labeled Buzz.
[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:28.080]   And then it's label.
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:29.360]   And now you have a Buzz label.
[01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:30.120]   Yeah.
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:31.480]   What is bizarre?
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:32.840]   But why would they care?
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:34.720]   Why would Buzz be a reserved label?
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:37.440]   I think there's something going on here.
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:38.880]   It's a new programming language.
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:40.240]   And probably when I click on that label,
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:41.880]   I say there are no conversations with that one.
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:42.720]   Patrick E. See?
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:43.240]   See?
[01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:43.880]   Not just label.
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:46.040]   So you can-- There's a column there for you, John.
[01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:46.960]   Well, they'll be.
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:49.200]   They have one called Go.
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:51.000]   Maybe they're going to do Go Buzz.
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.040]   I mean, I understand deleted messages
[01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:55.280]   would not be a good label because the system should
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:56.680]   have that reserved.
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:59.920]   Are they planning on putting some Buzz label in the reader
[01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:02.840]   software that overlaps a Gmail or whatever?
[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:04.600]   Maybe it has something to do with ringing the phone
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:05.440]   or shaking it--
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:06.800]   The Buzz tag just chapped.
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:08.880]   It just disappeared on show.
[01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:10.520]   Mr. Google found you.
[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:11.040]   No.
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:11.560]   How dare you?
[01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:12.120]   That was weird.
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:13.160]   How dare you create a label?
[01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:14.160]   Google police.
[01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:16.920]   La la la la la.
[01:31:16.920 --> 01:31:20.240]   The folks who discovered this were the folks at Google Blog
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:26.360]   Escoped, which is an excellent blog about the Google sphere.
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:29.960]   He says, looking up the word blog in Buzz in Google,
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:32.400]   we get several definitions.
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:34.600]   I don't know how that helps.
[01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:36.240]   What does it mean?
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:38.440]   Does anyone know why this could be?
[01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:40.760]   Well, they better be careful how they use it because CNET
[01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:42.360]   has a trademark on some use.
[01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:43.360]   Really?
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:44.360]   Buzz out, man?
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:45.360]   The word Buzz by itself?
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:48.440]   They got Yahoo had a daily or a Buzz report.
[01:31:48.440 --> 01:31:49.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:50.440]   You can't do that.
[01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:53.640]   And CNET has a show Buzz report posted by Molly Wood.
[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:54.880]   Weekly, it's a video show.
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:57.360]   And so they had to stop it.
[01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:58.360]   Huh.
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:31:59.360]   Very interesting.
[01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:00.440]   Yeah, who should get out of the house more?
[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:02.440]   Everybody knows that show existed.
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:03.440]   Maybe it's going to be--
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:06.200]   What did you do with Google search on it?
[01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:07.840]   Yeah, seriously.
[01:32:07.840 --> 01:32:10.000]   But isn't Buzz like a generic word?
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.160]   How can you really own Buzz?
[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:13.120]   I mean, the actual just the word Buzz.
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:14.120]   Sure.
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:17.880]   People always ask me, and I'd like to answer this once and for all, if they can use this
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:24.640]   week in for their podcast, of course they can because Mel Allen says it's all right.
[01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:25.640]   I don't know.
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:26.640]   Mel Allen?
[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:28.640]   With this week in baseball, which predated this show.
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:29.640]   Oh, Mel Allen.
[01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:30.640]   Oh, wow.
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:32.920]   How about that?
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:33.920]   How about--
[01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:34.920]   Not quite.
[01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:35.920]   No.
[01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:36.920]   I'm working on it.
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:37.920]   I haven't heard Mel in years.
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:40.120]   I've had that's pretty good considering I haven't heard him in a long time.
[01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:43.760]   Do you know who took over for Mel Allen on this week in baseball?
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:45.160]   Here we go again.
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:46.160]   Buzz--
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:48.080]   Oh, there's a tie in.
[01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:49.080]   A tie in.
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:50.080]   Where?
[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:51.080]   Off the track.
[01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:52.080]   There's a good ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:54.280]   You know, this show is never in the track.
[01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:57.480]   Google says you can't use IE6.
[01:32:57.480 --> 01:33:01.440]   They're phasing it out for Google apps, docs, and sites.
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:05.800]   So France, Germany, and now Google say IE6 is verboten.
[01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:07.760]   And stop at e6.com.
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:08.760]   Is there a website?
[01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:09.760]   Yeah.
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:10.760]   It's good.
[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:12.760]   It's about time we start dying at e6.
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:13.760]   What is the point?
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:14.760]   Why?
[01:33:14.760 --> 01:33:15.760]   You know what?
[01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:16.760]   I'm using that.
[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:17.760]   I would be almost everybody.
[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:18.760]   Google stepping up and doing no evil.
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:19.760]   First they're the--
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:20.760]   The--
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:21.760]   The--
