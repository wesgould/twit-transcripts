[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.320]   Why do cats, Per?

[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.720]   It's time for TWIT this weekend tech, the show where we cover the week's tech news.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.920]   And you know, today we've got three refugees from the Ashley Madison website joining us.
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.200]   And I'm very excited.
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.720]   John C. de Vorac is here.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.000]   I'm just kidding.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.600]   You are?
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.320]   No, I'm not.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.960]   Actually, I have the database.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.480]   You?
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.840]   It's like 30 gigabytes.
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.400]   Huge.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.560]   You download the whole thing to go.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.320]   Oh, everybody's got the data.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.520]   The big one?
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.440]   That's Dwight Silverman from the crown.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.960]   Houston.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.840]   Oh, by the way, you didn't plug no agenda show.com.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.120]   No agenda show.com.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.520]   Hey, look who else is here.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.440]   It's Phil Merl.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.280]   Phil Merl.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.920]   I'm doing it.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.160]   We do that every time.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.520]   You know, I looked you up in Madison.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.720]   You're not there.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.960]   Oh, thank you.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.680]   Actually, my wife told me she did.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.480]   And I said, why would you do that?
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.120]   Why would you do that?
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.960]   I think that's an insult.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.400]   Everybody's wife did.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.320]   I think it would be up because I try out everything.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.440]   And I forget that I've been in something to look at it.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.040]   You, that's your story, right?
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.120]   And I thought, and you're sticking to it.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.440]   I tried this out.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.680]   And so I looked at it.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.320]   Anybody that was found in there is an idiot.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.400]   Because these things are all scams.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.720]   There's all its 50 men, one woman.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.520]   It was something like that, wasn't it?
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.640]   Like 90% women?
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.120]   Amen?
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.280]   86% men.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.600]   86% of them.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.600]   I'm low.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.160]   So my wife's position is that there aren't real women in there.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.880]   They're all--
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.240]   Some woman came out and said that she was hired at $35,000
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.200]   a year to create characters constantly.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.920]   Just every day she'd do like a--
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.040]   But look, it has a trusted security award.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.600]   It says they're right on the front, trusted security award.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.320]   It's not.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:44.160]   And it's 100% discrete until the database goes up.
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.160]   Kashmir Hill in Unfusion wrote an article saying,
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.240]   we should just not look.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.120]   Don't look.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.280]   Well, that means that--
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.400]   For a rise.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.760]   I'm watching Russia today.
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.800]   There was one of the shows.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.880]   And that girl calls the co-host out.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.840]   He was on there.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.640]   Oh, geez.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.600]   And he's like--
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.960]   I'd be furious.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.160]   I'd be so furious.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.040]   And he's like, try-- well, I was just research.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.960]   It was this, it was that.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.120]   Somebody sent me a note.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.960]   And I don't know if this is a true or not saying that it--
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.080]   Ashley Madison was not a double-opbed-in system
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.240]   so that others could sign you up for it.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.720]   And you would appear in the database,
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.920]   even if they did it as a prank.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.880]   I don't know if that's-- is that true or is that true?
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.840]   Yeah, I'm sure it's true.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.160]   I got signed up by some joker to JDate.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.200]   Oh, god.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.600]   I get worse stuff than that.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.440]   Well, anyway, I kept getting these--
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.320]   Yeah, dating solicitations.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.480]   And now that was J-- I don't know how this happened.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.960]   It was JDate, and everyone was in Syracuse.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.920]   It was just a ludicrous--
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.680]   Well, the guy who signed yet was in Syracuse.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.280]   Probably.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.520]   Yeah, people think that's funny.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.800]   Oh, it was a laugh.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.800]   It's a hoot.
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.720]   Likely since I get no spam, I can just--
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.560]   a blacklist of all that.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.400]   The only site I know of that has revealed names is Gawker.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.200]   What a surprise.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.120]   They revealed names?
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.640]   They've revealed names of people in the database.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.600]   Oh, I've--
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.840]   No, there's a bunch of sites that have--
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.560]   Are there search engines?
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.480]   A lot of sites have gone in and said, like, in my blog post,
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.280]   I went in and I looked at the list of government domains.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.780]   Yeah.
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.320]   And found that there were five people
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.840]   with the city of Houston's domain who inside that port.
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:19.640]   Well, that's appropriate.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.600]   You're reported for the--
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.520]   Right.
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.120]   And that's-- I didn't want to go any further.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.320]   Oh, please.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.720]   Go further.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.880]   Really?
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.520]   It's like looking at the Jennifer Lawrence naked pictures.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.080]   Well, the thing is, it's very now complicit in the whole thing.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.920]   You know, if you found that a--
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.320]   if you found, say, that a city council member or the mayor
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.360]   of a town was in it, the question becomes,
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.920]   are they broken any laws?
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.800]   Do they position themselves as being--
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.320]   It's not illegal.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.040]   Well, they could have also been put in there
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.560]   by somebody else's political enemy.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.200]   That's right.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.920]   It may not have been-- it may not have been in themselves.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.280]   If there wasn't a verification email, which apparently there
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.200]   wasn't, then nothing you find there is probably--
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.920]   Unless I guess--
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.120]   Well, if they paid by a credit card, they--
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.800]   How did this work?
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.800]   Maybe you can explain.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.880]   And that's how they--
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.280]   Is it your paper incident?
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.960]   Or how does that--
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.080]   No, it's like all the rest of them.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.640]   They're all the same.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.680]   It's a monthly fee or--
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.680]   Yeah.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.200]   It's a monthly yearly fee.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.200]   And it's a cheaper fee.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.840]   You know, the way that some of the people were identified,
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.480]   like Josh Dugger, was that--
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:20.320]   I wasn't going to say any names.
[00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.480]   I wasn't going to say--
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.040]   Well, that's fair.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.560]   --you'll win there.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.480]   Well, that's been all over the place.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.880]   That's been all over the place.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.240]   We had it on our site.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.920]   That is all over the place.
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.200]   You know, they were matched up by credit cards.
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.400]   So if they were able to match the credit cards
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.200]   to an email address, that's--
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.160]   And they'd do a champion.
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.040]   Then you're busted.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.920]   Right.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.600]   All right.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.320]   But I think--
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.120]   If Donald Trump were on there, that would be a story.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.200]   I guess.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.520]   Yes.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.760]   You'd have to do with it.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.240]   I guess.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.320]   He'd be more likely to buy the place.
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.520]   It's not prostitution.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.520]   It's not--
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.240]   I'm sure the place is crawling with prostitutes.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.200]   But that's--
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.280]   That really gets the guaranteed date.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.000]   But you would have to prove that.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.440]   Right.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.000]   I mean, it's not--
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.240]   I don't have to prove anything.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.280]   It's not against--
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.000]   I don't believe that infidelity is against the law.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.440]   Maybe it-- in Texas, it might be.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.040]   Yeah, it's not even--
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.600]   In the military.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.080]   No, it's not.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.960]   In the military, it is.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.480]   And there were a lot of military--
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.960]   No, interesting.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.480]   --a lot of doc to my L domains in those emails.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.920]   There is an indictment of somebody
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.040]   who signs up with his government address
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.040]   or his military address.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.120]   It's stupidity and--
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.120]   That's the indictment.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.600]   That's the indictment.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.840]   They're guilty of stupidity.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.760]   But what's the tech angle in this story?
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.560]   That they claimed it was secure and safe.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.560]   They even have that trusted verifier.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.880]   I think that tech angles--
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.040]   It's not--
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.360]   Everything is like this.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.280]   If you put something online, you can't guarantee it's safe.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.000]   It's security.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.760]   It's privacy.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.280]   I think anyone who trusts any of these sites--
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.920]   I think one of these days, the big bust
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.880]   is going to be Facebook.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.800]   Amazon.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.000]   Amazon's interesting, but Facebook--
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.280]   because they never throw anything away on Facebook.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.200]   At least that's what they say.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.520]   So all your crazy personal photos
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.200]   that you have supposedly deleted
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.400]   can all be brought back.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.120]   And yeah, it'd be pretty interesting.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.160]   That's the privacy one.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.240]   The financial one would be Amazon.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:07.880]   Because it is--
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.160]   They have credit card numbers.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.200]   They have credit card numbers.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.440]   Is it possible to--
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.880]   If you're Jeff Bezos or Tim Cook, say, look,
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.200]   I don't care what it costs, this must be secure.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.600]   Is it possible to do that?
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.400]   No.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.120]   It's impossible.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.560]   So there's nothing that would be hacked.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.240]   If it's on the internet, it's not possible.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.240]   Yeah, interesting.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:28.760]   I mean, you could just--
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.160]   We had this conversation.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.280]   We had this conversation with somebody
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.760]   who is an expert, Steve Gibson.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.960]   And I said, is there anything Sony Pictures Entertainment
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:38.760]   could have done differently?
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.160]   Well, there's a lot they could have done differently.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.600]   But is there anything they could have done
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.880]   that would have been sufficient?
[00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:48.440]   And then the counter example I use is Shelley Adelson,
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.880]   founder, creator of Comdex, sold Comdex for a little bit of money,
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:57.200]   and then built casinos in Macau that were just cash cows.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.440]   His Sands Casino operation runs the back office operation
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.600]   for Vegas casinos, for Atlantic City casinos,
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.000]   for Macau casinos.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.720]   If there were something in the world you would want to secure,
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:13.000]   it would be the back office operations for a massive casino operator, right?
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:13.800]   I mean, that's--
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.600]   It'd be one of many.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.000]   I think banks are in the same league.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.480]   Yeah, but banks have shown that they're kind of ignorant about this.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.440]   But you kind of figure Shelley had the best guys on it.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.960]   He was hacked by Iranians.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.840]   So I think that proves your point.
[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:29.120]   There probably is nothing that is unhackable.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.720]   If you're targeted--
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.360]   Yeah, if you're targeted, it's like if you--
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.480]   being targeted is not good.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:41.280]   So here's the tech angle, I think, that Josh Herman had it at the All,
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.000]   where he said that this is--
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.720]   it's one of the things we were supposed to read.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.400]   This is new territory in terms of the personal cost of hacking.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.320]   These are not assignments, Philip.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.200]   You don't have to--
[00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.040]   There's different ways to--
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.320]   Do you think it might work all day?
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.320]   Now, there's different ways to pursue this.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.680]   Don't think of it as an assignment.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.480]   It's just what we might talk about.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.000]   All right.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.520]   All right.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.640]   Anyway.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.000]   His point was that it's one thing.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.720]   If your credit card gets hacked, you may lose a little money,
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.360]   but usually the bank makes it good.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:15.480]   But if you were cheating on your wife and it gets discovered,
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.040]   that's real cost.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.240]   That's real personal cost.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.320]   And his point is this is new territory for hackers.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.400]   And my question is, what was their motivation?
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.480]   Were they trying to expose--
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.960]   They came out with a fraud.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.560]   They were-- you know, it could be impact team.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.800]   They said that it was-- they hated this site
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.160]   because it was encouraging sin.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.640]   And so they went after it.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.440]   Well, furthermore, claimed they'd been in three years.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.400]   They were also after it because they
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.200]   were charging $19 to expunge your data.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.280]   And completely, you could quit and your data would stay there
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.680]   or you could pay $19 to leave.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.920]   And even when you did that, there was still data that remained.
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.920]   And in fact, when they did their dump,
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.680]   they had proof that indeed the $19 deletion didn't delete.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.360]   And that incensed them.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.080]   It doesn't take much money on it.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.320]   It's $19 deletion.
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.880]   But if you credit that they felt it was immoral,
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.280]   does that imply that this is maybe Iranian hackers or something?
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.800]   No, some guys.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.600]   And they're Americans.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.640]   They're Americans?
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.240]   English was their second language.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.000]   Is that what they said?
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.200]   I didn't see that.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.560]   There was one of the things-- there was a Q&A with them.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:29.080]   And something didn't come across clearly.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.240]   And they said, is our English not right?
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.400]   Did you not get that because we didn't say it right?
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:34.920]   Interesting.
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.680]   And when you read the transcript, it
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.840]   was clear that they were not first-time English.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:46.120]   I have someone who's a friend of mine who has a theory that women
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:51.160]   were involved in it because there are three sites at Avidlife
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:51.960]   Media.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.440]   There's established men.
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.840]   There's Ashley Madison.
[00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:58.280]   And there's one called Cougar Town or something like that.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:01.200]   And they said, Cougar Town can stay up.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.400]   That's fine.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.320]   That was OK.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.960]   These other two have to go away.
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.880]   So from that to extrapolate it as probably a woman or women
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.440]   are involved.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.920]   Or a young man who happens to like older women.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.160]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:17.600]   Yeah, I'm on that database, so we won't take that one.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.040]   Cougar Town.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:19.600]   Cougar Town.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.760]   How old would a Cougar have to be for you?
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.360]   Maybe called Cougar Life, I think.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:25.840]   Cougar Town's better.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.600]   Well, I mean, that's a TV show, is that?
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.200]   Yeah, that's how that's what I'm getting from Avidlife.
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:36.800]   Here from Boing Boing, the TLDR on the Q&A,
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.880]   the hackers behind the breach first
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.920]   in release snippets of data in July.
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.760]   After nearly 30 days, they'd end up 10 gigs,
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.400]   followed by another 20 gigs.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.440]   There's a third data that I think 30 gigs.
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.120]   And they say they have 300 gigs more,
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.120]   including internal company emails, files.
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:56.960]   So this is Sony Pictures style hack.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.200]   How hard was it?
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.200]   The Impact Team.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:02.000]   We worked hard to make fully undetectable attack.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.480]   Then got in and found nothing to bypass.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.440]   They were, they prepared for the worst.
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.000]   They got it.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.080]   Right, nothing.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:09.840]   Yeah, no resistance.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:10.960]   What was their security like?
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.760]   Bad.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.800]   Nobody was watching, no security.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.880]   Only thing was segmented network.
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.280]   You could use pass 1234 from the internet to VPN
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.400]   to root on all servers.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.200]   But they do have a trusted security award.
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.120]   They got the little sticker.
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.920]   The sticker they felt was good enough.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.000]   They have the graphic.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.200]   When did you start hacking them years ago, a long time ago?
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.200]   In the read me of the first day to dump over the past few years,
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.840]   they claim.
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.320]   Do we know for a fact that this is actually the hacker
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.680]   or is this somebody?
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:45.320]   I think that this they believe, right?
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.280]   This is--
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.000]   They use the same cryptographic--
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:48.520]   That's right.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.040]   They have the key.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:49.720]   They use to do the dumb.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.680]   Oh, down to PGQP.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.000]   So they say tens of thousands of user pictures
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.520]   are in the next dump, but we will not--
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.440]   1/3 of them are intimate pictures.
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.680]   I think Penis is correct.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.360]   OK, I was trying to avoid the word.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.000]   But anyway, yes.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.960]   1/3 are just pics.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.320]   And we won't dump them.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.240]   And we won't dump them.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.480]   Not dumping most employee emails either.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.480]   So there is this kind of moralistic.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:15.960]   Well, there were--
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:16.320]   Tinged.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:16.800]   --tinked to--
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:16.800]   --tinked to--
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.160]   --the hackers for moral reasons.
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.520]   Very interesting.
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.480]   I think it's a non-story.
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.000]   OK.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:23.880]   Well, we're moving on.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.680]   Thank you very much.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.800]   Well, I mean, don't you think it's kind of just--
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.920]   It's not really a tech story, but it's hard to turn your--
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:28.880]   It's like hard to have written.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.240]   Well, no, it's a tech and society story.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.360]   It's a society story.
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.280]   It's where we have come to as a result of this.
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:37.080]   And there will be more like this.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.520]   And it is a cautionary tale, but you make a good point.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.360]   What are you going to do about Amazon?
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.280]   I mean, you're going to not use Amazon?
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:44.800]   I mean--
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.360]   What's the worst that can happen?
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.560]   You get a new credit card.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.360]   Amazon all the time.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:56.680]   By the way, big payments from Target to Visa was a target.
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.280]   It was Target, wasn't it?
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.400]   That was hacked.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.760]   And of course, in the past, the tradition
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:09.160]   has been that the credit card companies just eat it.
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:09.520]   Right?
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.160]   They just--
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:10.680]   They just--
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:11.120]   They may be--
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.480]   Well, they not only eat the liability,
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.960]   but they eat the cost of sending new cards out and all that.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.840]   They tend to, yes.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.680]   This time, they went to Target and said--
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:19.880]   No.
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.560]   You guys didn't do the job.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:23.600]   They nicked them?
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.520]   They nicked them for hundreds of millions of dollars,
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.560]   and not an insignificant amount of money.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.440]   Issuers receive payment for some of their costs.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.280]   Under rules laid out by Visa, they
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.080]   have the choice whether to accept another payment that
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.400]   will reimburse them for any fraud.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:46.360]   Target agreed to embarrass Visa $67 million.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.200]   And that's just one.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.720]   That's one credit card company.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.220]   Good.
[00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:52.800]   So Leo, you may not have seen this
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.320]   because it was kind of a regional story,
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:59.120]   but a month or so ago, the law enforcement
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.600]   down in the Rio Grande Valley on the Texas, Mexico border
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.120]   confiscated a bunch of credit cards
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.120]   that had numbers that had been stolen during the Target
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.720]   hack, and that they had waited this long to start
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.920]   kind of producing these, and they were being distributed
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.480]   all along the valley.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.320]   And they shut them down.
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:23.920]   But so far, a lot of the credit card numbers had not surfaced,
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:28.040]   and they just now are, which so you're not safe for a while
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.800]   after something like that.
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.440]   Will this be better now that they're putting--
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.880]   I mean, all my credit card issuers are sending me
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.560]   cards with pins in them.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.400]   I mean, chips in them.
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.040]   I got one.
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.880]   No pin, just chips, because apparently it's
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.080]   chip and sign October 1.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.160]   It was chip and sign.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.680]   Which I don't know exactly what the benefit is to that.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.760]   You're not.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.040]   Yeah, I mean, we're still swiping a card or tapping a card
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:48.920]   and signing.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.840]   Like, that's your identification.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.680]   Chip and Pin would be much more secure.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.120]   And of course, we're the last country, I think, in the world,
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:55.760]   not to have chips.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.120]   That's because there's some--
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:58.880]   I bet I don't know this for a fact.
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.720]   But I noticed this took forever to get the smart cards,
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.960]   because there's a patent.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.640]   It would cost like 50 cents extra or something that didn't make--
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.120]   And the laws protected them against liability
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.600]   or consumers against liability.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.280]   So there's no pressure from us.
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.000]   No incentives.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   No incentives.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.320]   Like, whatever.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:19.520]   So here's the incentive.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.600]   You probably talked about this.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.600]   In October, the rules change.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.600]   It used to be that the banks paid--
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.320]   if there's any fraud, it went to the bank.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.600]   And starting in October, it's going
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:34.520]   to-- the link in the chain that had the weakest security
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.520]   pays up.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.880]   So all the retailers, who are usually the weakest link,
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.640]   are upgrading their equipment and all the credit card
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.320]   companies are putting the chips in.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.960]   And the whole thing is supposed to get more secure.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:51.480]   And whoever doesn't get stuck with the bill after October.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.400]   Exactly.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.160]   And that's why everybody--
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.640]   Rite Aid, CVS--
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:59.360]   Everybody's putting those tap and pay terminals in.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:02.520]   Because somebody steals my card and they go wandering
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.320]   into some place, and nobody cares enough to check ID
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.800]   or do anything.
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.680]   And then the bank gets stuck with the bill.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.440]   There's no incentive for the retailers
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.920]   to try to put a stop to this.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.680]   They figure just the bank will pick it up.
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.720]   It has a plus.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.220]   Yeah.
[00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:18.080]   Thank goodness.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.280]   Let's take a break.
[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.080]   Got a great panel.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.120]   I call it a crease.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:22.880]   Oh, you got a great panel?
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.520]   We just need some good topics.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.600]   John busts my chops constantly.
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.560]   I thought Ashley Madison was good.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:31.680]   I think it's a good topic.
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.160]   It's his or her.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.640]   I led-- if it leads, it leads.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.360]   It didn't lead.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.840]   And by the way, there's something insulting in that comment.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.280]   What?
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.320]   Yeah, blood coming out.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:43.320]   All right.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.320]   All right.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.320]   Well, we'll do-- OK.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.720]   Well, you know what?
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.720]   You want to talk?
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.720]   We can talk.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:52.360]   I know you want to talk about the new Intel chipset.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.560]   Very exciting.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.920]   Really big story here.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.320]   Skye, like are you excited?
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.320]   Pins and needles.
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.120]   Or would you rather talk about Ashley Madison?
[00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.120]   No, I'm not.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.120]   All right.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.120]   I'm just saying.
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.120]   I talked out.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.120]   New router from Google.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.120]   Let me talk about that.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.120]   We're router.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.120]   That Google router.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:15.120]   I'm going to talk about that because it's an interesting stealth device in your home.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.920]   But first, I want to talk about Intel, believe it or not.
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:19.960]   And I'm not-- it's not just Skylake.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.040]   I'm talking about the Intel 2-in-1s.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.280]   Do you use a 2-in-1?
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.280]   I don't know what--
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:27.400]   Tablet plus, you know, keyboard like the Surface Pro's 2-in-1.
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.400]   The Yoga's a 2-in-1.
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.640]   No, I don't use those things.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.400]   This is becoming more and more popular of a category.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.400]   You can thank Intel for that.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.400]   It's a Microsoft.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.400]   It was--
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.400]   Oh, no, no.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.920]   Microsoft just hopping on the Intel Band way.
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.920]   Wow, I didn't know that.
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:42.920]   You know that.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.160]   Intel often does these reference designs.
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:46.320]   They don't sell any of themselves, but they do these reference designs.
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.320]   You love the NUC?
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.320]   I do.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.320]   I'm a big NUC fan.
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.600]   So they do these reference designs and then companies come out and they make them.
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.480]   The Intel-powered 2-in-1 is giving business owners, small business owners, what they
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.160]   want, both.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.480]   Not just one or the other.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:04.560]   You can't-- they don't want to choose between A or B. If both will help your business, they
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.800]   want A and B. It's not hard work or innovation.
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:12.320]   It's hard work and innovation, versatility and strength.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.680]   So these Intel-powered 2-in-1s give you both the best of both worlds, a laptop.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.040]   You choose between a laptop and a tablet.
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:22.200]   You get both performance and freedom.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.000]   Powered by Intel's family of core processors, these are amazing.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.960]   You can impress clients at the touch of a tablet, handle robust programs on the go.
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.560]   You can do it right and you can do it right now.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.560]   That's a better way to work.
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.160]   That's the power of and.

[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.480]   laptop.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.640]   The battery of the fifth gen Intel-core processor, up to 8.7 hours.
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:12.080]   It's 2.6 times longer than the 2011 laptop.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:17.400]   If you want super battery life, I love the Core M processor.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:23.040]   That gives you razor thin tablet ultra-fast laptop, a single mobile device.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:27.280]   The Intel Core M processor base 2-in-1 provides the optimal combination of business class
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.640]   performance and battery life.

[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.960]   It's really nice to have Intel on the show.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.960]   Very happy.
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.520]   Now let's talk about Skylake.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.200]   So Lindsey is already in Lindsey.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.200]   You move back from Pittsburgh.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.200]   PA.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.840]   He moved to Pittsburgh like a week ago.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.800]   Have you ever seen the snow in Pittsburgh?
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.120]   Oh my gosh.
[00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.120]   Not this time of the year.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.120]   Yeah, he's back.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.120]   You notice he went back and he saw him.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.120]   He's back there.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:18.120]   We did actually.
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.560]   I've been playing with a Note 5, which I love.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.560]   Is that it?
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.560]   Yes, it is.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.560]   Well, let's see.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.560]   As a matter of fact.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.560]   And it has a new feature.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.560]   It's 100% big.
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.560]   I thought it would be.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.560]   You know what?
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.520]   It's 5.7 inches, which is as big as the Note 4, but because the form factor, you don't
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.000]   feel like it's that big, do you?
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   No.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Look at this much more.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   It's a strange line to it.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Oh, it's gorgeous.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.800]   I like the S6 Edge Plus.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.520]   That's a fine phone.
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.280]   You know, I have the Edge, the original.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.720]   Yeah, we got it.
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.400]   And I keep accidentally touching the Edge.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.560]   That's still the screen.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.560]   Right.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.800]   So I keep accidentally doing things.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.960]   So I decided not to get the Edge Plus, but to get the Note 5.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.120]   And also the stylus.
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.000]   Well, let me show you this, John.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.480]   Next time you're in a bar.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:07.520]   The stylus complains if you walk away with the phone and it doesn't, it kind of beeps
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.520]   at you.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.520]   Hey, where's my stylus?
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.520]   It did that on the Note 4 to it.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.200]   That's important because it's easy to lose these.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.600]   But watch, the phone was off.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:21.320]   I popped out the stylus and I can start writing, you know, 5, 5, 5, 1, 2, 1, 2.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.880]   You never lose that number.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.880]   Oh, nice.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:27.200]   Isn't that nice right on the off screen?
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.720]   And by the way, do you notice the latency?
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.720]   It's very good.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.400]   They've really, this thing just keeps up.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.280]   And that's a problem sometimes with those stylus devices is that they're a little lag
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.040]   between when you draw it right on it and then you can save it.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.040]   You saved a mess.
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.440]   I made a mess, but I saved it.
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.440]   So it's a permanent mess.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.440]   How do you save it?
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.400]   You just press the save button.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.880]   It's called a screen off memo.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.320]   There's a lot of nice features in this.
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.880]   I really feel like...
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.920]   This is the phone of the day for you.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.200]   But the reason, yeah, for the phone of the day, maybe a week.
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:01.080]   The reason I mention it is because it has a feature that you can stream from the camera
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.320]   directly to YouTube live.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.720]   So I was back before the show.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.880]   I was back in the kitchen and Alex Lindsey had this new DXO camera.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.480]   I said, "Oh, oh, wait a minute."
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.480]   Is it here?
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.480]   It's got a DXO.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.480]   Awesome.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.480]   The DXO one.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:17.480]   So I said, "Oh, oh, wait."
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.680]   And I started the live stream off of the phone and he did a little quick impromptu review
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:21.880]   of it.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.800]   And I think that's really cool.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.720]   It's like, yeah, see, isn't that nice?
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.120]   I'm liking it.
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.120]   Yeah.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.120]   Let's see.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.040]   This is kind of interesting.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.160]   Are you can draw on the screen?
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.160]   Yeah, you can.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.040]   So Leo, do you put cases on your phones?
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.040]   I bought a case, but you know what?
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.120]   This phone is so beautiful.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.120]   I bought the Samsung.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.760]   Oh, that's a horrible looking case.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:43.760]   That is ugly.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:44.760]   It makes it like a note for it.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.680]   It gives it a plastic bag.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.400]   So no, I'm not going to put a case on this one.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.400]   It's too beautiful.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:54.440]   So I was looking, I've got the, they sent me the S6 Edge Plus and I like the Edge and
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.720]   I thought, well, if I was going to do, if I was going to buy one of these, what would
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.360]   the cases look like?
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:00.360]   No, they have cases.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:06.720]   Yeah, but they're not very protective because they have to expose the side of the screen.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:13.160]   So that's always the weak point on most of these cases is that your glass is glass and
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.400]   you can have a gorilla case.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:19.240]   But if you hit a rock from the point and the glass is going to break, it doesn't matter.
[00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.080]   This case is a flip case.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:24.840]   The funniest case that Samsung is offering, and I don't think it's available yet, is
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:25.840]   a keyboard case.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.440]   Have you seen that?
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:30.760]   The keyboard is like a blackberry.
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:33.240]   But not because it flips around from the back.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:37.960]   It goes right where the keyboard, the on-screen keyboard is and when you tap a key, it taps
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.720]   the on-screen keyboard.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.720]   That's how it works.
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.880]   It's not electrical.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.680]   It's tapping the screen for you.
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:45.960]   Yes, it's dumb.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.280]   It's so stupid.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.880]   People who played with it at the Samsung event were not impressed.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:53.280]   So I guess I won't get that.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:57.080]   Somebody says, yes, Dwight, that's an Edge case.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:07.680]   I did get the OnePlus 2 as well, but I tell you, once you use those OLED screens, it's
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.000]   really hard to use lower quality.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.680]   The screen on the Edge is just like you fall into it when you look at it.
[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.680]   It's just beautiful.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.680]   It's beautiful.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.480]   Wait till you try VR porn.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.480]   Did I say that?
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.160]   Yes, you did.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.120]   God.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.920]   So Google's making a router.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.040]   I heard that too.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.840]   I'm broadcasting something.
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.840]   Yeah, your YouTube live.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:31.840]   It's on my YouTube stream.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:32.840]   Everybody wants to watch.
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:35.520]   The Vorac is now going to be distracted by behind the scenes.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:37.440]   There are the Germans.
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:43.120]   By the way, I think there's a sign somewhere that says at any point you could be on camera.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:49.520]   So you were warned they sign like an eight-page disclaimer for the disclaimer you've got.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.160]   Did you know that your child belongs to him now?
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.160]   I've said that, page three.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.320]   You got to read it carefully.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.320]   Look at that.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:00.720]   By the way, I think there's a sign somewhere that says at any point you could be on camera.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.160]   Well, it's a little washed out because of our lights in here, the flare from the look.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.160]   But in a normal situation.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.160]   It's great.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.160]   It sounds good.
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.160]   There you go.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.000]   It's a little better when you get out of the light.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   And the lane sees about 15 seconds.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.400]   Well, it's a little washed out.
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.560]   And it's in sync this time.
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:21.560]   The video that we did beforehand.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.120]   Yeah, I think that was my thought of sync.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.760]   Or maybe not my fault, but it sounds good.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.760]   There you go.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:30.160]   So if you go to youtube.com/liolaport, I've got three or four of those up now.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.240]   I've been playing with it a little bit.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.240]   I like it.
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.080]   It's Periscope Liker, Mierkät.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.560]   But I like the idea of doing YouTube Live.
[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:38.080]   I feel like that's more of a mainstream thing.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.080]   Plus it gets saved.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.080]   It doesn't...
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.560]   It doesn't have the social aspect that Periscope does.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.560]   No.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:45.560]   It doesn't tweet out.
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:46.560]   It doesn't tweet back.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.480]   Well, there's embedded chat on the page.
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:51.520]   Well, there's nothing there yet.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:52.520]   Oh, there is.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.160]   But there is a live chat that pops out there.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.160]   Why didn't know that?
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.160]   Well, that's part of YouTube.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.160]   That's part of the YouTube.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.160]   Oh, right.
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.160]   Oh.
[00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.200]   But the thing is, you don't see it on your screen as you're shooting.
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.200]   You'd have to have a second.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.200]   Oh, yeah, right.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.200]   That's different.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.200]   That's a flat thumb or something.
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.480]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.000]   What were people saying?
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Nothing on that one.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.800]   Oh, good.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.480]   So the...
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:20.240]   I was shocked when earlier this week Google without any fanfare, Apple would have had at
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:29.280]   least a event put out a router, the on hub router.
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:30.840]   I read about it somewhere.
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.840]   Immediately went there.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.960]   It was already sold out almost everywhere.
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.360]   I think Jason, did you get one?
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.360]   Who got one?
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.440]   Oh, Jeff Jarvis, I think, went to Walmart and got one.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.320]   And I ordered mine, but it won't be coming until October.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.840]   The Walmart one, they say, is just a few days off.
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:53.360]   Why is Google doing a router?
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:56.800]   Because they make money the more people are on the internet.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.800]   It's not like others aren't doing routers.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.800]   It's a router.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.160]   Are you going to go with the paranoid aspect?
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.160]   It's like this is a spy device.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.920]   They already have a lot of echo.
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:12.520]   They put out a statement saying that they're not getting that information.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:19.560]   But I'm tempted because there's some cool aspects of it.
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.720]   The three lights, if your thing is working, it's green.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.120]   If it's not working, it's red.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:28.080]   If there's something funny about it, it's orange.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:32.400]   And then apparently there's tools that make it really easy to figure out what's going
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.840]   on.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:36.960]   This is a piece of bad technology that we're living with.
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:37.960]   It is.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.960]   They're crab.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:39.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:40.960]   They're cheap.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:46.440]   They come in and make routers work the way, you know, simply and easily.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.840]   The way you want them to work.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.240]   That's a worthy goal.
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.800]   I think you just nailed it, Philip.
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:54.680]   I think that Google does stuff when they see something crappy.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.240]   Let's go.
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.800]   You know, we could do a better one and then just do it.
[00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.560]   Whether they're going to make money at it, whether it's a business model at all, they
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:02.560]   just do it.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.560]   Because they--
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.560]   Is it really $400?
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:05.560]   $200.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.560]   $200.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.560]   The ones on Amazon are $400.
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.360]   That's somebody's gouging.
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.960]   So I bought it for $200.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.280]   Walmart was $200.
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:18.400]   That's a lot for a router when you get a commodity Wi-Fi router for $50.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.160]   But you get a good pay for it, right?
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:25.560]   The goal of the original Apple router that they still sell, but I suspect they don't
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:28.640]   sell a lot of them anymore, was this very same thing.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:33.400]   It was supposed to be taking an arcane piece of technology and making it simple.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:38.000]   But anyone I think who owns one of the Apple routers knows that when you get down to it,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.200]   it's not that simple to use.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:43.160]   One of the interesting things about this is it's very limited.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:46.120]   It has only one hardwired ethernet port.
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.120]   It's a Wi-Fi router.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.120]   It really is.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.120]   It's a Wi-Fi router.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.120]   Well, that's not--
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:52.120]   And you can get a hub if you really want more price.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.120]   You got to give it a score.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.120]   It'll switch is what you'd want.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.120]   You want to switch.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.120]   Something like this.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.120]   All right.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:02.440]   But the other thing is that they were touting an app so that you can control it from your
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.000]   smartphone.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.440]   But a lot of the routers that I've tried lately have apps that allow you to control--
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.600]   I can control my LinkSus router at home from here on my phone.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.480]   But how big of a deal that is.
[00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.560]   What's the advantage of that?
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.520]   Why would I want that?
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:22.680]   If you're-- let's say, for example, that the guest access isn't turned on.
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.520]   A friend of my wife's comes over.
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.640]   She doesn't know how to work the routers.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.560]   It says, can you turn the guest access on?
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:31.960]   I can turn it on, set the password from here, and tell her what the password is.
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.440]   You can text it to them.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:40.720]   I'll tell you, the one reason I bought it is because of buffer bloat.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.720]   So many--
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.880]   Oh, no.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:43.880]   That's a real thing.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:44.880]   Buffer bloat.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:45.880]   Buffer bloat.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:46.880]   It is a real thing.
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.880]   I'm not making that up.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:48.880]   I've heard of it.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:49.880]   I've never had a problem.
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:50.880]   So here you have.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.880]   You just don't know it.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.880]   So what we set the router every morning.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.880]   That doesn't help with buffer bloat.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.520]   So buffer bloat is putting too much RAM in a router.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:02.440]   As RAM got cheap, router manufacturers said, hey, it couldn't hurt to have more RAM.
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:10.480]   So they put more RAM in, but the problem is more RAM broke the prioritization of packets
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:16.120]   in such a way that streaming media, Skype particularly, really can suffer from too much
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.120]   RAM.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.120]   They call it buffer bloat.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:21.520]   And it's hard to know whether that router has a buffer bloat problem.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.440]   There needs to be a buffer bloat analysis.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.440]   There is.
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.160]   It's called Netalizer.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.160]   We Netalizer.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.640]   We will use this-- it's a Java app.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:35.960]   We will use this when we have guests on who are having unpredictable problems with Skype.
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:37.120]   It's from ICSI.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.520]   The-- I will check this.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.280]   The new speed test over at DSL reports also--
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.280]   That's-- isn't that awesome?
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.280]   --for buffer bloat.
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.320]   Isn't that an awesome-- that's a good one, yeah.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:52.920]   So I figure at the very least, the guys at Google are not going to make a router with
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:53.920]   buffer bloat, right?
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.720]   They're the kind of geeks that would know that.
[00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.920]   And it's going to be-- oh, by the way, there's my name on the DSL reports.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.360]   What's your name, do I think?
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.360]   I think we brought it down.
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.360]   Avoid this man.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.360]   I think we brought it down.
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.600]   This is an HTML5 test.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:09.120]   It really does a great job on here.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.440]   I'm a big fan of the--
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:15.360]   The Google router also has a USB speaker in it.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.920]   So it can be used for audio.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:17.920]   Is that interesting?
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:23.240]   So you can pair it probably to a phone with the Chromecast does that.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.160]   Does it have a mic in it?
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:26.800]   No, but the phone does.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.240]   So Chromecast does that, right?
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:32.720]   It's inaudible audio, tones that identify it uniquely so that you can pair.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.720]   But--
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.040]   It's only a three-watt speaker.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.960]   It's not-- it looked like an Amazon Echo.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.000]   I thought, oh, my gosh, this is an Echo.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.520]   The Echo sounds great.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.520]   I know.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.520]   But it needs a better speak.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.520]   I'm--
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.520]   So-- yeah.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.520]   Go ahead.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.200]   Someone in the chat room says that Google isn't making a router, the TP link is.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:50.760]   Yeah, the TP link makes it.
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.160]   But to Google spec.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:59.560]   Here's one thing that's interesting is that they didn't use the Next brand.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.160]   No, Nexus.
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.880]   They didn't use Nexus.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:04.880]   Yeah.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.640]   Well, what's the--
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.040]   Oh, the next thing is Next.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.760]   The Next is their in-home brand, right?
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.120]   You know, bringing technology to the home.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.680]   Google spent a lot of money on it.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:18.680]   Oh, Nest.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:19.680]   I mean, Nest.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:20.680]   Nest.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.640]   Oh, in fact, I thought this would be a Nest product, like Dropcam.
[00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:25.640]   It's not.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:26.640]   Yeah.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:32.240]   So there's a little bit of marketing, branding, confusion here.
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:35.040]   You know, Google doesn't care about that.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.040]   I think you're right.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.040]   They don't care.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.040]   Well, after they split the company up and all these little companies--
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.920]   Branding, shh, manding won't make a difference.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.920]   The real point of this is it's going to be a home automation hub.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:51.200]   And you can tell that when you look at the deep specs, it supports ZigBee, which is 802.15.4.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.200]   It supports--
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:53.200]   Spent around forever.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.200]   Weave.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.200]   It supports Brillo.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:00.720]   Brillo's the Internet of Things OS that Google announced at the Google I/O this year.
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:05.960]   Weave is their mesh networking for smart home appliances.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.240]   So this is really not a router.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:10.720]   This is a smart home hub.
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.240]   Much as Apple TV is probably going to be a smart home hub.
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:14.240]   The Trojan horse.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:19.240]   Which is the end, the Amazon Echo, which increasingly every two weeks--
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:21.240]   They set it up with smart things.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.240]   Some do write.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:23.800]   There's not people who love that.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:24.800]   Home automation.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:25.800]   I love it.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.720]   I've never talked to anybody that doesn't say the same thing.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:30.720]   Because you can go up to it and say, I'm not going to say the name of the woman.
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.880]   By the way, they've changed the name now to that name.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:33.880]   What name?
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:35.520]   So, nice one.
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.040]   Alexandria.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.040]   So they've changed--
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.040]   Like in Virginia?
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.040]   No.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.040]   All right.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.040]   Okay.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:43.040]   Cover your echoes ears.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.040]   Alexa.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.040]   Alexa?
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.440]   Oh, crap.
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:47.440]   So it will--
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.440]   Alexa.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.440]   All hard disks immediately.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:54.480]   If someone says Alexa on the TV, you have the TV on.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.480]   Alexa wakes up.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.480]   It's so annoying.
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.480]   She'll wake up.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.480]   Tell the artist thing.
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.480]   And she'll go, but--
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:00.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.480]   I don't understand what you want.
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:07.120]   Actually, well, Adam, who's another fan of this thing, he says that during the elections,
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.120]   when they're listening to CNN--
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.120]   You better hope there's not a candidate named Alexa.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:16.120]   No, they say election and it picks it up as Alexa.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:22.160]   So, when Dr. Mom, who's echo, always wakes up when we say that, is peeved right now.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.400]   Well, you can listen to this.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.400]   You can listen to us.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.160]   You can say, "Okay, Google."
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:31.640]   You can say, "Alexa, listen to Twit," or listen to Twit on Tune in, I think, and it'll play
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:32.640]   us.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:36.760]   So she may well be doing that, in which case, every time we say that word is driving it crazy.
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:40.680]   Alexa, put the no agenda show on favorites.
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:43.080]   Now you know why we don't invite John C. de Vor?
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.080]   Why, I can't even worry.
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.320]   I'm just saying stuff.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.920]   Hey, Siri, he's trolling your Alexa.
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.400]   Okay, Google.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:53.120]   Anyway, now what is it?
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.400]   Do you have one, Dwight?
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.320]   Does it now work with smart things?
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.320]   How does that work?
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:04.320]   It works with a variety of smart home devices.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:09.400]   It's primarily they're touting it as turning your lights on and off, but it'll work with
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.400]   other things as well.
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:17.400]   Just to begin.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.400]   Right.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:23.320]   And if you tell her, "Find smart things on my network," it will stop and it'll search
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.240]   your network and then say, "I found this, this, this, this."
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.400]   So it's all done by voice.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:28.400]   It's very cool.
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.400]   Interesting.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.400]   Light bulbs.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.400]   Here's the...
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:36.000]   So I think Google is actually seeking to compete with Amazon on this.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.080]   I think that one of the reasons they got this out the doors is because they know exactly
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.800]   what Amazon is doing with the Echo.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.360]   Well, not just Amazon.
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.440]   That's what Xbox One and Connect are going to do.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.680]   So Microsoft is in this very big.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.680]   Amazon's in it.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.840]   Google's in Apple.
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:54.400]   Probably Apple with the Apple TV.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.760]   Apple TV is almost certainly going to be a hub.
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.760]   But why, guys?
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:58.760]   Why do they care so much?
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:37:59.760]   What is...
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:00.760]   Is this suddenly the next big thing?
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.960]   Fear driven to think something bad's going to happen and they're going to be left out in
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:04.960]   the cold.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.440]   I think they need a new add-on where you go.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.200]   And then next thing you go to the lights.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.200]   Clap on?
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.200]   Clap off.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:16.880]   Well, it's amazing how much lights...
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:22.760]   That seems to be the killer apps or the killer product so far for all of home automation.
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.400]   Lights is what's selling.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.280]   You can control the hue.
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.120]   Actually, this has been for a while with the Echo.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:30.120]   Right.
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.840]   There's more and more different types of lights.
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:34.840]   So I haven't set that up.
[00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.320]   Echo, I'm going to say Echo, not the A-work.
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:39.320]   Echo, make my room purple.
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.320]   How do you do it?
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:47.800]   You do presets in the devices and then you say, "Okay, television lights and it will turn
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.520]   off everything and just turn on the lights you used to watch TV."
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:51.520]   No.
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:53.920]   That's worth spending a few hundred bucks for.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:54.920]   That feature?
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:55.920]   It does seem kind of dopey, doesn't it?
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.480]   Well, it depends on how big your house is.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:02.080]   If you have a giant theater in your house and you want to...
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:07.560]   This might be something big because everybody is like making these stealth hubs.
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:08.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.560]   It doesn't have to be something big.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:13.880]   You've gone to those comdexes and the consumer electronics shows where there's row after
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:21.000]   row of competing products and none of them serve a useful purpose and they all disappear
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.560]   within a couple of years.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.560]   It's kind of herd mentality.
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:25.280]   Yeah, and I think John's right.
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:29.760]   I think they're afraid that there's something big here that there's going to be a first
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:35.080]   mover advantage for whoever does the big one and they don't want to lose out.
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:38.120]   They put a product out.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:44.080]   You don't want to be a big company like Microsoft or Apple or Google and miss the next big thing.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.600]   Microsoft almost missed the internet.
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.280]   They miss a lot of stuff.
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.680]   I don't think it's that important.
[00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:54.080]   These guys do work out of fear because they have shareholders that are coming to meetings
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.000]   and say, "How come you guys didn't do this?
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.680]   Everybody else is doing it."
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.280]   I don't know.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:00.920]   I did have one little thing though.
[00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:10.360]   I went to dinner with Bert Monroy and his wife and a Apple guy, an old Apple, old-timer
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.360]   adapter.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.360]   He's still there.
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.360]   His wife.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:18.000]   His wife comes up to me after and says, "Later this year," she says, she wants to say any
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   detail.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.240]   She says, "Later this year, you're going to have plenty to write about and it's going
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.200]   to be hilarious."
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:29.040]   Apparently, Apple's coming out with something that directed at me something I can ridicule
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.040]   the company over.
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.040]   A mouse?
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.040]   It could be.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.040]   What would you ridicule?
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.040]   Let's figure out what this means.
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.040]   I'm doing that with this.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.440]   No, this is what I'm saying.
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:37.440]   What could it be?
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:42.280]   I just took it lightly and then her husband came out, the guy works at Apple and she says,
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:47.920]   "I told John about the things coming out later this year and how ridiculous they are."
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:48.920]   He goes, "Oh."
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:53.080]   He rolled his eyes and that was the end of this little back and forth.
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.080]   I don't know.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.080]   I mean, what could it be?
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.080]   It has to be something that would ring your chimes.
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:00.720]   It has to be something that I can go crazy.
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.640]   I don't speak might well be it.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.640]   Talking to your TV.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:04.640]   How would that be?
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.640]   Everybody does that though.
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:06.960]   I don't see that being a...
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:12.080]   I don't know what it could possibly be unless they came up with a car that runs backwards
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:13.080]   or something.
[00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:17.320]   Well, apparently they're all in on automated self-driving vehicles.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:23.200]   In fact, they just hired away one of Tesla's hotshot engineers at Apple.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.560]   I just thought I'd throw that out.
[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:29.800]   Consumer Electronics Company Apple, according to some Reuters.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.040]   I've heard of that.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:37.320]   "Has hired a senior engineer from electronic car maker Tesla according to a LinkedIn posting."
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.160]   That's part of...
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:42.480]   You know, you've got to scan those LinkedIn postings with an eagle eye looking for this
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:43.480]   stuff.
[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:47.120]   Half of nine to five Macs scoops come from LinkedIn.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:50.280]   LinkedIn is valuable resource for intelligence gathering.
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:56.120]   Jamie Carlson on his profile changed his current employer from Tesla to Apple.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:59.760]   At least six others with experience developing self-driving technology and systems have joined
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:00.760]   Apple.
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:04.760]   That confirms what was strongly rumored is that Apple is working on this.
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:06.960]   Apple's probably working on a hundred different technologies.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:07.960]   Sure.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.160]   It doesn't mean they'll all come to market.
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:11.280]   Would you buy an Apple self-driving car?
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.280]   Apple car?
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.280]   Well, it just doesn't sound cool.
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:16.280]   That you would unlock, would you?
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.280]   Maybe.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:25.520]   I think we have to distinguish between a fully 100% self-driving car and the kinds of features
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:30.520]   that are going to be very popular that are taken from that technology.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:38.560]   If you talk to people, there's a lot of stats to suggest that self-driving cars would save
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:39.560]   a lot of lives.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:46.320]   In fact, what I read is that if widely implemented, it would save more American lives than curing
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.720]   AIDS, stopping murder, and eliminating war combined.
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:56.240]   Well, 35,000 people a year, it used to be 44,000 a year, would kill on the roads.
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:58.080]   Not to mention people that are injured.
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.840]   That number, the 44,000 numbers, actually maybe you might hit it this year because for
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:04.120]   some unknown reason, we're having a lot of accidents.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:06.520]   Nobody wears helmets in their car anymore.
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:08.040]   That's shocking.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.120]   You know, the helmet thing, do you remember when the Highway Patrol used to wear helmets
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.120]   in their truesers?
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:13.120]   No, really?
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.120]   Yes, they used to wear a big blue helmet.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:18.520]   I'm probably saving many a life.
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:25.080]   The irony of autonomous vehicles is it might save 44,000 lives, but one person gets killed
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.240]   by a self-driving car.
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:28.000]   It's all, yeah, it's going to be funny.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   It's all over.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.280]   A robot car kills one person.
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.760]   Yeah, it's going to be a problem when the one person is killed.
[00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:34.560]   Bucky Fuller, remember Bucky?
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:44:04.560]   It was this Dine-M-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M-Dine-M
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:08.640]   The driver, one of the drivers was killed in a collision.
[00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:09.640]   It held 11 passengers.
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:12.560]   Yeah, it was like a little bus traveling at the night.
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.200]   You can turn on a dime, literally turn on a spot.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.640]   90 miles an hour, 30 miles per gallon.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:23.080]   I mean, this thing should have been, well, take a look at it.
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.280]   It's like a rolling blimp.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:28.080]   I wanted, I wanted, I really like one.
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.080]   I want one.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:30.080]   There were, there were, there were some.
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.080]   But you make them again.
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:34.520]   The testment stopped when one of the drivers was killed in a collision.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:37.400]   Yeah, you need a seat belt back then.
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:42.400]   Look at this, they're testing the wheels of car number two for strength and load distribution.
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.720]   I think this looks pretty, pretty sweet.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:47.400]   Are any of these prototypes in museums anywhere?
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:48.400]   I'd love to go see one of them.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:49.400]   I don't know.
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.080]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:54.000]   That would be very cool.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   Yeah, somebody did chat with them.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   There he is.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.680]   The guy's got a right pickle car.
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:07.520]   Apparently, there's a car at the National Auto Museum in Reno with an unfinished interior.
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:10.800]   So here's what, here's the interior.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.360]   Here's what it would have looked like.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:14.120]   It was like, it was like a blimp.
[00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.120]   It was a derigible.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:16.120]   On the ground.
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:17.120]   On the ground.
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:18.120]   On the ground.
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.120]   A rolling derigible.
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:22.200]   Anyway, the point being, this might have been brilliant technology.
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:26.200]   It certainly solved a lot of problems, but because one accident, that's it gone.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.640]   Well, we'll be in this transition.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:32.560]   In this transition period where when you start having autonomous cars, you'll have a blend
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:36.160]   of humans and a blend of autonomous cars.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:38.200]   That may have to be the worst.
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.200]   That's the worst.
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:40.200]   That's the worst.
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:41.200]   That's the worst.
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.200]   Everyone is doing it safe.
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.200]   That's like when Sweden, they used to have left hand.
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.200]   They used to be on the wrong side of the road and they switched the other side.
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.200]   And if we're not.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.200]   What?
[00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.200]   Yeah, they used to.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:50.200]   That's a recipe for disaster.
[00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:51.640]   Well, that was pick a sign and stick with it.
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:56.280]   This was the side that back when you used to be like the English, now they like the Americans.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:00.320]   And apparently what they did was they phased it in so they had one week.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.080]   It's just a joke, Leo.
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:03.080]   It's just a joke.
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.080]   You made that up?
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:05.080]   Yeah.
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.680]   It's a joke they tell in Sweden.
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:07.680]   Very believable.
[00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:09.280]   Didn't they tell that with conviction?
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.280]   They left the trucks.
[00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:12.680]   Yeah, it was just ridiculous.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.080]   They have the trucks.
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:15.960]   It's a good story.
[00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:20.680]   I don't actually believe in the autonomous vehicle from Apple.
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:25.560]   I think they will add features that are autonomous like.
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:29.600]   I think there's too much resistance from Americans love.
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:30.600]   Everybody loves their car.
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:31.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:32.600]   Well, they love driving.
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:34.040]   They love to be in control of it.
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:37.400]   What if you could say the thousand dollars of an insurance?
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:41.800]   I'm not going to argue at the point that you're not alone with your thinking.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:45.680]   But if you talk to the millennials, they have no interest in driving.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.800]   They would just they all use it over.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:48.800]   Oh, me too.
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:49.800]   And they just use it over.
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:50.880]   Actually, both ends of the bell curve.
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.040]   Us old folks don't want to drive.
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:53.040]   I love driving.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.040]   Really?
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:57.640]   You're a young man in the heart.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:58.640]   Yeah, sure.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:46:59.640]   You like to drive?
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:00.640]   Yeah, sure.
[00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:01.640]   Why wouldn't I like to drive?
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:02.640]   Well, you know, you never did.
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:03.640]   You never did.
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.640]   You didn't have to go somewhere anywhere.
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:08.080]   Yeah, I tried to peddle you.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:11.680]   When you drive this show, it's an excuse to put your pants on once a week.
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.680]   I got to get those pants on once in a while.
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:17.880]   But for me, for anybody who commuted, I commuted two to three hours a day.
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:21.720]   Oh, that's when you were working at 13 years when I was working at Tech TV, I'd drive down.
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:23.640]   I would be gladly never.
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:27.240]   I'll be the old man in the passenger seat while my wife's driving.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.240]   Wave in the dad's.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:32.400]   That's because you made yourself miserable for a very long time with a very boring drive.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.400]   It was horrible.
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:36.520]   If I was going to Los Angeles a couple of times a week, I'd feel the same way.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:38.520]   Well, on the five.
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:39.520]   Well, how about you?
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:42.240]   I bet you do some commuting in Houston.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:45.920]   No, actually, I live about five minutes away from the mighty usual.
[00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:46.920]   Everybody's smart.
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:47.920]   But I have lived.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:48.920]   I have lived.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:54.800]   When I was covering compact, I lived out by compact, which is about 15 miles from the
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:56.720]   center of town and I would drive into work.
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:58.960]   So I did have that commute.
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.960]   But I actually like a commute because it gives you time to think.
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:06.360]   Listen to great podcasts and audio books.
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:12.160]   And it's a so I actually didn't mind having a commute except when I was driving a standard
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.760]   Mustang and then it was a real pain in the butt.
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:17.360]   Most of the agenda was standard commuters.
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:22.400]   Most of our listeners are probably listening right now as they in the car.
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.400]   In the car.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:24.400]   In the car.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.400]   Yeah.
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:30.760]   I think if you have autonomous cars, at least initially because Americans do love to drive
[00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:36.400]   and not everybody lives in a city and has a commute, I think that they will be you'll
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.640]   be able to take them over and continue to do them.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:46.680]   And I like what Phillip is saying in that a lot of times rumors make Apple going all
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:50.560]   in on something and then they come at it kind of from a different point of view.
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:53.080]   You know, the TV, I think is the best thing.
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:58.000]   You know, there were all the rumors that Apple was going to do an actual television set and
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.760]   they never have and probably never will.
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:05.360]   And I think what they'll do is they'll look at ways to make driving more pleasant or to
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:10.040]   make the controls of it more Apple like.
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:11.040]   That seems unlikely.
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:16.600]   The why would the car afford to go to Apple for the self driving.
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:20.720]   But you know, if it's so good for it hates the idea and better than what they can do,
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:21.720]   right?
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:25.720]   If it's better, it's better than what Ford can do and it'll sell cars for it would be
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:26.720]   smart.
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:31.320]   You have to convince the auto manufacturers that that you know software better.
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:33.840]   But I think auto manufacturers are very reluctant to do this.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:38.360]   They don't want they already got burned by Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft car.
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:40.880]   I think it's one thing to have an entertainment system in there.
[00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:44.840]   I mean, after all, they use Q and X now and Android cars.
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:49.200]   But another thing entirely for some third party to do the drive train to do the drive
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:52.240]   electronics, I think that scares an auto manufacturer.
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:57.320]   I think that no auto manufacturer wants to seed that responsibility to a third party.
[00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:58.320]   I would guess.
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:00.720]   I mean, I think it'd be hard to a hard self-raple.
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:05.400]   Don't you think I would think it'd be more like an Eddie Bauer deal where you get the
[00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:06.400]   slippers?
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:07.400]   Yes.
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.400]   Eddie Bauer does all these cars.
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:10.400]   I don't know if you ever noticed.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:12.040]   Eddie Bauer does cars.
[00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:13.840]   They do the interior of the design.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:14.840]   Eddie Bauer edition.
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:18.080]   Yeah, Eddie Bauer uses Eddie Bauer for a bunch of cars.
[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:19.080]   That's like what I'm saying.
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:22.600]   They know, I don't think they might entertain it or maybe they'll let it be the Apple version
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:23.600]   of a Ford.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.200]   But really, you think they'd let them have access to the drive train?
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:28.600]   Especially when they don't know about the drive train, but the steering wheel.
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:31.840]   Well, if you're doing a self-driving car, you have access to the drive train.
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:34.680]   No, I just think I don't know that you're going to do a self-driving car.
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:35.680]   It may not be a self-driving car.
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:36.680]   It may not be a self-driving car.
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:39.080]   You can't really do any of this.
[00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:43.760]   I mean, even the self-parking, you need access to the accelerator, the brake, the gear
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:48.680]   shift, the clutch, the steering wheel, all of that stuff.
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:49.680]   No clutch.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:50.680]   You don't need a clutch.
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:58.600]   Anyway, it seems pretty obvious that Apple's doing this because unlike the TV rumor where
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:04.000]   you didn't see all this noise around it, you're seeing a lot of noise around this Apple car.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.840]   Yeah, I think the reason why is because Johnny Ived is interested.
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:08.840]   Right.
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:09.840]   That's probably right.
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:13.560]   And I don't think they would make it for Ford.
[00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:17.560]   I think if Apple's going to make a car, it's because they think that there's a possibility
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:23.360]   that they could make the best car in the world that will improve people's lives and they'll
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:24.360]   make it--
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:28.720]   The last thing I do is buy a car from a computer manufacturer.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.120]   That's the worst idea ever.
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.160]   It's going to crash.
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.080]   So why not buy Tesla?
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:38.080]   Whenever you have this conversation come up about Apple self-driving cars, the question
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:41.960]   becomes why not buy Tesla, which they certainly could do?
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:44.400]   That market cap is way too high.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.800]   Really the Tesla market cap is too high?
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:48.560]   The market cap on Tesla's out of control.
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:49.560]   Because Apple has almost $200 billion.
[00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:50.560]   You can buy $200 billion.
[00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:51.560]   You can buy it by Ford.
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:53.560]   It's cheaper, I believe.
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:54.560]   $31.43 billion.
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:55.560]   You're right.
[00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:56.760]   That's an expensive company.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:57.760]   Wow.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.760]   Considering they only make $10,000, $20,000.
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:00.760]   I don't know what they're--
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:01.760]   $31 billion.
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:02.760]   Yeah, it's outrageous.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:04.760]   It's probably not even a profitable company.
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:05.760]   Barely profitable.
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:06.760]   I don't know.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:07.760]   I don't remember.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:08.760]   They did come out of the stock.
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:09.760]   They're not so good.
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:10.760]   That's one day.
[00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:11.760]   Let's--
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:12.760]   No, this is not--
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:13.760]   Every tech stock went down like that.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:15.760]   All the stocks are being pounded for a moment for having a correct shooter.
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:20.800]   Also, Tesla, Horace Dadeu, who knows, who's forgotten more about this industry than we
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:25.000]   will ever know, says the Tesla's not really a very disruptive company.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.440]   I mean, they bought someone's factory, right?
[00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:28.440]   Right.
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:29.440]   They're building the cars--
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:30.440]   It's a boutique.
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:31.440]   --to the way every other car is--
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:32.440]   It's a boutique.
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:35.480]   They got a deal on the old Toyota factory in Fremont, which used to be a general motor--
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:36.480]   It's a nimme plant.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:38.960]   They have a piece of it.
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:40.640]   They build a car in there.
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:41.960]   Yeah, I think Horace is right.
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:44.080]   It's such a small operation.
[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:45.640]   It can't be considered.
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:48.560]   He means it's not disruptive in the sense it's not new technology.
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:50.320]   Well, it's kind of new.
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:51.960]   I mean, it goes motor advertising.
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.760]   Really super good motors.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:54.760]   Yeah.
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:56.640]   That's the new part.
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.120]   But I don't know.
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:01.240]   He also says if you're going to reinvent the automobile, you first have to reinvent the
[00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:02.240]   road.
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:03.480]   Oh, that's a bad--
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:04.480]   That's a non-starter.
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:05.480]   Right.
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:06.480]   That's really a non-starter.
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:08.480]   It's not a bad thing where we are.
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:10.040]   That may be where we are.
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:11.040]   You're not in California.
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.280]   You should try to get a load.
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:18.480]   Our local ice cream company, Clover, has an ice cream flavor called Petaloma Pothole.
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:19.480]   That's how bad.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:21.480]   We're famous for our pothole.
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:22.480]   What's in that pothole situation?
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:23.480]   It's not a control.
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:25.480]   It's their version of Rocky Road.
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:28.080]   You build better roads in Afghanistan.
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:29.080]   I know.
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:34.280]   Well, that's a reason to upgrade the infrastructure with all the surplus money.
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:36.320]   Yeah, with all this cash we've got flying.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:37.320]   Mm-hmm.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.320]   Let's take a break.
[00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:39.320]   Coming back with more.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:40.320]   We're going to talk about Marshmallow.
[00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:43.520]   We're going to talk about Project Sunroof.
[00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:49.840]   We're going to talk about Facebook as the ultimate source for hacking.
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:50.840]   Cat photos?
[00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:51.840]   No?
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:52.840]   Cat photos.
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:53.840]   News.
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:54.840]   Oh, yeah, sure.
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:55.840]   News.
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:57.480]   Oh, I should have brought my--
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:58.560]   We're seeing it here.
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:00.480]   Most of America gets its news from--
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:02.040]   The Bernie Sanders badges.
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:03.680]   I found the Bernie Sanders.
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:05.160]   I'll take a Bernie Sanders badge.
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.160]   Oh, you will?
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:07.160]   I'll get you one.
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:08.160]   Sure, he's my man.
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.160]   Bernie Sanders?
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:10.160]   Bernie's a king.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.160]   He's a king.
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.160]   He can't do it.
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:13.160]   No one can.
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:14.160]   I want to see a Trump Sanders to get--
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:15.160]   That'd be great.
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:17.160]   Yeah, we must have just shoot ourselves.
[00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:18.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:23.160]   Oh, they told me never do politics or--
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:24.160]   You shouldn't.
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.160]   You in particular.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:26.160]   Yeah, I know.
[00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:27.160]   Yeah.
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:28.160]   Because I'm a--
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:29.160]   You're just a knee jerk liberal.
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:30.160]   That's why.
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:31.160]   Red diaper baby, as they said.
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:32.160]   Were you really--
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:34.160]   No, no, no, but my parents are pretty--
[00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:35.160]   Mark off, Les.
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:36.160]   I know one, yeah.
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.960]   Our show today brought to you by Zip Recruiter.
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:42.360]   If you are the person in your business and if it's your--
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:45.920]   If you're the owner and the chief cook in bottle washer, you are.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:47.000]   Who does the hiring?
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.200]   And you want to know about Zip Recruiter?
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:50.840]   We love Zip Recruiter.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:51.840]   Great way to hire.
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:57.400]   Of course, the internet has been huge in finding staff, but there are many, many job sites.
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:59.760]   How do you know which one is right?
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:03.800]   How do you handle all the incoming resumes and inquiries?
[00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:04.800]   Zip Recruiter.
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:10.360]   Zip Recruiter lets you post to 100 plus job sites and social networks like Twitter and
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:13.400]   Craigslist, all with one click of the mouse.
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:17.280]   You can screen rate and hire the right candidates fast.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.000]   This is the dog days of summer.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.960]   We are in the middle of them right now and believe it or not, this is a great time to
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:28.240]   hire because the competition has taken August off.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:31.320]   So the people who are looking for work have fewer places.
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:33.240]   There's less competition.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:38.400]   But you got a post where the job searchers are in that Zip Recruiter.
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:45.120]   Post to 100 plus job sites and instantly be matched to current resumes from over 4 million
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.880]   job hunters.
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:51.280]   Within a day, you'll be getting candidates and they won't be calling your phone or sending
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:52.280]   an email.
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:54.000]   They roll right into Zip Recruiter's easy to use interface.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   So it's fast.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.120]   You can screen them, rate them and hire them fast without any phone calls.
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:00.920]   I love that.
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:03.160]   Zip Recruiter has been used by over 400,000 businesses.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:07.480]   I want you to try it right now for free.
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:09.360]   We have so many people in the whole using Zip Recruiter.
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:12.360]   I got an email from Melinda.
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:13.720]   She said, let me see if I can find it here.
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:17.800]   We have received several highly qualified candidates from Zip Recruiter.
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:19.600]   So happy our company signed up with them.
[00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:21.560]   We're excited to see what comes next.
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:25.160]   Next, thank you so much for your customer help line also.
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:27.800]   It's very helpful.
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:28.800]   I think they're a great company.
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:32.800]   I think you'll like them and I think you will be glad you used them.
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.480]   Getting the right candidates is so important.
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:39.240]   ZipRecruiter.com/twit, four days free.
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:41.040]   You'll be impressed, I'm sure.
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:44.760]   And I think four days is enough time to actually find that right person.
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:45.920]   ziprecruiter.com/twit.
[00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:52.320]   We're having a lot of fun today.
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:53.320]   A great panel.
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:57.000]   John C. Devorak is here from the NOAA Gender Show from the Houston Chronicle.
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   Dwight Silverman.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.400]   Now, good friend from Fortune Magazine, Philip Elmer-Dewitt.
[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:02.880]   Really one of the guys has been around.
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:05.200]   When did you start covering tech?
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:07.400]   I think I asked you this before, Philip.
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:09.480]   Oh, you're muted.
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:11.480]   Oh, unmute him.
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.440]   Oh, Jason fixed it.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:14.440]   OK, 1979.
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:16.440]   Holy cow.
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:22.400]   Actually, that's about when I wrote my first article for bite, I think.
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.320]   There you go.
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:27.920]   I was writing about the Atari of all things.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:30.360]   We're the old fart show here.
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:32.320]   I called it creaky geeks.
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.360]   I'm probably the youngest one.
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:35.800]   I started like in late '80s.
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:42.440]   But you were talking before the show, you were a general assignment reporter covering
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:43.440]   Houston.
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:47.640]   Well, I was assistant state editor when I came to the Chronicle in '90.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:53.440]   But I had done a lot of freelancing from like maybe '85 on occasionally doing tech
[00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:55.080]   stuff because I was interested in it.
[00:57:55.080 --> 00:57:57.080]   All you had to do is know a little bit.
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:57:58.080]   Right.
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:57:59.080]   You were the guy.
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:04.320]   And I was running at the alternative newspaper I worked for in San Antonio, in the San Antonio
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:12.720]   current, I was running a computer bulletin board in the early '80s as an online newspaper.
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:13.720]   Oh, wow.
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:15.040]   We were putting our stories up there.
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:19.600]   Although it was a modem and we only put in lines so you could dial in and read, hang
[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:21.640]   up, someone else dial in and read.
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:24.120]   But it was an online newspaper.
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:25.120]   Wow.
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:28.560]   By the way, screen grab time everybody.
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:30.040]   Okay.
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:33.040]   We'll make sure that's the thumbnail.
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:34.440]   You can photo shop.
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:37.360]   That is the thumbnail for the show today.
[00:58:37.360 --> 00:58:38.360]   Photo shop.
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:39.360]   Anything you want.
[00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:44.680]   Apple says lies, damn lies and statistics.
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:47.280]   What are they saying this way?
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:53.680]   Survey from a company called MusicWatch, 5,000 people, which at least earlier this week, said
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:59:01.720]   that 48% of those who tried out the new Apple Music user service had stopped using it already.
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:04.360]   Apple says, oh no, the number is much lower.
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.840]   And I would guess Apple would know.
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:08.600]   But maybe they lie.
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:09.600]   Maybe they're lying.
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:12.360]   79% of people who sign up for a trial are still using the service.
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:15.680]   To me, this is all moot because it's still free.
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:20.480]   We won't know anything until October when the three month trial is over.
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:23.000]   And then we'll only know if Apple chooses to tell us.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.200]   Now this story was fun with bad stats.
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:29.720]   Almost everything in the original Word story was wrong.
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:34.120]   The Apple had announced that 11 million users had signed up.
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:35.520]   We were using it.
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:38.760]   And they made it 11% of iOS users.
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:41.880]   That's really more like 1.5%.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:42.880]   Yeah.
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:49.400]   Anyway, it was interesting to me that Apple came out quickly and actually said something.
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:54.360]   Normally, even if something's wrong, they tend to stay in black box mode.
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:58.480]   And it was interesting that they came out very quickly and correct.
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.960]   Do you think they're a little sensitive to the whole thing?
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:03.040]   I think they are sensitive to it.
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:08.200]   I think also, it's not like Taylor Swift, where they change their business model on a
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:09.200]   Sunday.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.200]   But I--
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:12.840]   That's cloud.
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:20.200]   I think we may be getting a little bit of the Jimmy Iovine influence.
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.600]   I mean, he knows what a bad story in music watch means.
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:26.160]   He's not going to take that line down.
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:30.520]   And it also may be a little bit of the Katie Cotton is dead.
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:33.080]   And now we have Steve Dowling.
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:37.560]   And everything in Apple PR has loosened up a little bit.
[01:00:37.560 --> 01:00:39.000]   I feel like--
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:39.800]   Hey, he's in to say it.
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:40.760]   Not actually dead.
[01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.160]   She's not dead.
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:42.720]   She's gone.
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.800]   She's coming out even with her family.
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.080]   She's relaxing.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:49.360]   She's probably a lot better off than she was.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.360]   Former former--
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:53.040]   Former former beloved Apple media spokesperson.
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:58.000]   But somebody who really kept it tightly on tight ship.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.200]   Yeah, that might be.
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:02.720]   I think a responsive Apple to this kind of thing, though, does kind of indicate that
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:07.960]   they care enough to make sure that the perception is at least that Apple music is viable.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:12.480]   I don't see anything particularly different from any of the other services.
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.960]   But not enough to switch.
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:18.920]   And furthermore, we've heard a number of tales of whoa from even from Apple Star Wars.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.640]   Stalwarts like the Loops Jim Dowl Rimple.
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:24.640]   I think probably you're scaring people off a little bit.
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:30.480]   Yeah, you notice Jill Rump, Dow Rumple, the day after he came out with his complaint,
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:35.040]   they called him into Cupertino to sit him down to explain what he was doing wrong.
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:36.160]   We can help Jim.
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.160]   You're doing it wrong.
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.640]   You're holding it wrong.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:39.640]   Right.
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:41.440]   That's fine for Jim.
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:43.560]   The real test is October, right?
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:46.840]   That's when you start having to pay $10 a month.
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:50.360]   So one thing that is intriguing to me about, I never got into Spotify.
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:54.840]   I actually was one of these old geeks who like to have a new file.
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:55.800]   I want to buy music.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.640]   I want to buy it, right.
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:02.640]   Well, the day, I got into the trial and got into it.
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:12.080]   And the light bulb went off when I bought or added to my music, the $150 box set for every
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.960]   song Pink Floyd ever did.
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.880]   And I have access to that and I don't want to pay $150 for it.
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:21.040]   And so when I, that happened, I kind of went.
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:22.040]   That's a big difference.
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.040]   Yeah.
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:27.760]   And I am still glad that I bought the Beatles box.
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.320]   Yes.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:31.040]   You don't get that.
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:37.640]   So Dwight, you have to be in a Wi-Fi or you have to have cellular reception, at least,
[01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:39.440]   to listen to that box set, right?
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:40.440]   Well, who does it?
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:44.040]   Well, once you add it to my music, you can listen to it.
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.040]   It's on my phone.
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:46.040]   You can cash it.
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.040]   You can cash it.
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:48.040]   And you can cash it.
[01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:49.040]   Right.
[01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:52.240]   And so I'm, you know, I'm, and I'm always connected on anything I listen to anyway.
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.720]   And that's an interesting point.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:56.760]   We have really gotten to the point where you just assume that everybody has kind of ample
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:57.760]   bandwidth no matter what.
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:58.760]   Yeah.
[01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:00.760]   Because you don't live in Western Massachusetts.
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:01.760]   No, I know.
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.360]   It's not, it's not right.
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:04.360]   Right.
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:08.160]   Remember when Microsoft got in all sorts of trouble when the, they were talking about
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:11.080]   the Xbox one having to be always connected.
[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:14.400]   And then one of their spokesmen who promptly lost his job said, well, if you're in a nuclear
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:17.000]   submarine, okay.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.840]   But really there are a lot of people for whom that is not the case.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:23.640]   Nevertheless, more and more we're seeing the assumption that you just kind of have high
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:25.520]   speed unlimited bandwidth.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:32.560]   In fact, T-Mobile though, if you do have a T-Mobile doesn't charge you for data for most of the
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:36.000]   music services, Spotify, Apple music, you could stream all you want.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   It doesn't cost, cost you anything.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.280]   I think if you add, if you add the file to my music, if you do a click on that plus button
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:49.880]   and add it to my music, it ends up on your phone or your, or iTunes.
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:55.320]   Although if then if you, if you drop it, then you can no longer listen to it.
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.320]   You can drop one.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.560]   So there is DRM on it.
[01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:58.560]   Right.
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:03:59.560]   Oh.
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:00.560]   Or if you stop subscribing, you mean?
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:01.560]   Yeah.
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.560]   Right.
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:03.560]   Right.
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:04.560]   Yeah.
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:05.560]   What happens if you stop subscribing and then you take a couple months off and you're resubscribed,
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:08.000]   you get all the, you have the...
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.840]   I think you get it back.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:10.840]   You think.
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:16.800]   I do, I know you do because I was a Spotify subscriber for a long time then dropped it
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:19.960]   and recently picked it back up and all my playlists were there.
[01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:20.960]   Everything was still there.
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:21.960]   Wow.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.680]   So with, and that, now at least for Spotify.
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:29.000]   That's, that's frankly, if you think about it, that's a big deal because they want you
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   to come back.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   Right.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   It's tied to your Apple ID.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   Yeah.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.320]   So all you have to do is as long as you keep your Apple ID, you should be fine.
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:36.320]   How about this?
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:41.360]   I got to call this today from a very disgruntled Apple customer.
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:43.520]   He wants to use Apple family sharing.
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:48.120]   His kid, he's got a kid is 12 years old and the nice thing about Apple family sharing
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:54.760]   is that you can buy music, TV shows, movies, share it with your kids Apple ID and then
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:57.320]   they don't have to buy the music they can listen and watch.
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:00.040]   But in order to do that in the US, I don't know if it's the same in Germany.
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:03.080]   You sound like you guys are using it because I sing nodding heads.
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:09.760]   In the US because of the Child Online Protection and Privacy at COPPA, somebody under 13, they
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:11.760]   have to take special privacy precautions.
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:16.640]   They need, before you can do this, your kid has to create an Apple account and you have
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:19.360]   to prove that as a parent you're approving this.
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:21.720]   So this guy was pissed because he says, "I don't have a credit card.
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:22.720]   I have a debit card.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.720]   That's what I use."
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:25.400]   They won't accept a debit card.
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:26.880]   Apple says, "Why is this?
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:27.880]   Most debit cards are accepted."
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:30.160]   Because I guess kids can have debit cards.
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:31.160]   This is the way of...
[01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.800]   This is Apple's method.
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:39.400]   I don't think COPPA specifies how you prove it, but they do require that the company verify
[01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.600]   that the parent is approving this.
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:45.040]   So the way Apple does it is, what's the CVV?
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.720]   What's the security code in the back of your credit card?
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:50.120]   And then that way they know, "Well, you're an adult because you have the credit card,
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.080]   so yes, we're going to let you create this account."
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:53.080]   What are they doing in Germany?
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:54.080]   How do they verify?
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:55.360]   Do they verify?
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:56.880]   Something similar.
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:58.960]   So this guy was pissed.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:01.320]   He says, "I'm going to have to get a credit card to do this."
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.320]   What is the guy...
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:07.760]   Could you just walk into an Apple store and just say, "Hey, Apple store doesn't do anything."
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:10.880]   Do I look like I'm a grown up?
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:13.280]   This is my child.
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:17.400]   Anyway, I told him right to Tim Cook.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:18.400]   You want to play with my camera?
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.880]   This is the new one.
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:21.000]   Is that the new two?
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.960]   This is the A7R2.
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.280]   This is supposed to be the greatest camera ever.
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:29.880]   That is a very spent-to package there.
[01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:32.160]   It's supposed to say two on the logo.
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:33.160]   It's a two.
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:34.560]   Do you think B&H ripped me off?
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:36.560]   Son of a gypped.
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:42.200]   No, it says two on the bottom.
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:43.760]   That little sticker?
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:46.000]   Looks like it's handwritten though.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.840]   What about Dr. Dre?
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:50.840]   What about Dre?
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.480]   What about Dre?
[01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.920]   What about Dre, Leo?
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.600]   It's funny when Apple acquired Beats.
[01:06:56.600 --> 01:07:00.720]   Of course, the chief acquisition at Beats really wasn't the 110,000 subscribers to their
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:02.000]   streaming music service.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.840]   It certainly wasn't the headphones.
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:05.720]   It was Jimmy Iaveen.
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.040]   It was Dr. Dre.
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.160]   It was Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails.
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:13.800]   The musicians, the musical people behind the scenes at Beats.
[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:18.280]   Glenn Rubenstein over here, one of our great guys who was a music promoter and booker,
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:23.320]   said, "Dreys history with women is not so hot.
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:27.200]   Apple might not really want to promote this Dr. Dre nexus."
[01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:28.480]   I would agree with that.
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:36.520]   Now that Straight Outta Compton is out, the movie about NWA, and some stories are resurfacing
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:45.000]   about Dre, one example of him beating up in a club, beating up a woman reporter, because
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.760]   they didn't like what she'd written about NWA.
[01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:51.760]   I think she implied that Ice Cube was more important than Dr. Dre.
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:57.480]   So he takes her in a stairwell and literally pins her down and pummels her.
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:00.480]   Stories like this, Dre is now apologized to all the women he's hurt.
[01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:02.680]   So that's okay.
[01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:03.680]   Everything's fine.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.520]   No, you need to personalize it.
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.520]   Apple actually issued a statement.
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.240]   Did they, what they say?
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:11.840]   They said he's apologized.
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.840]   He's a changed man.
[01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:14.840]   He's a move on.
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:15.840]   It's a move on.
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:16.840]   I suppose it would be.
[01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:17.840]   Yeah.
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:22.640]   I don't think, Jimmy Ivey seemed to be the guy that they were pushing the hardest in
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.440]   that beat steel.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:27.920]   And I thought Dr. Dre disappeared pretty quickly.
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:31.760]   I mean, he was in one picture showing this Apple watch.
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:35.880]   And I hadn't heard from him again until this new album came out.
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:40.000]   Well, this is his supposed, this is his first album in what, 14 years, is kind of his victory
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.280]   lap is like they made the movie about me.
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:46.480]   I got the new album, which by the way had an Apple exclusive, Apple music exclusive.
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:50.080]   By the way, I'm looking at this picture of Dre.
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:51.840]   He's not wearing an Apple watch.
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:52.840]   Yeah.
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:53.840]   Good catch.
[01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.320]   Wearing a watch at all.
[01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:56.320]   Yeah.
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:57.320]   Oh, cool.
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:58.320]   Yeah.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:01.200]   It looks like a designer watch, but not unless I'm mistaken.
[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:04.280]   And then look like an Apple watch.
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:05.880]   I can't zoom in.
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:09.160]   He was in that famous picture where everybody was covering their wrists.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.160]   Right.
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:11.160]   Yeah.
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.680]   And it looks like maybe a Missoni or a, a little like.
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:15.680]   It'll watch at all.
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:18.080]   Maybe it's just a band without the watch.
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.560]   It looks like a watch.
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:20.560]   It looks like a wrist.
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:23.800]   It has the bits, the bits face on it, as a matter of fact.
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:25.360]   He's wearing an Android wear.
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:27.320]   Oh my God.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:29.840]   Good be.
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:35.320]   So Leo, this is not on your list, but it's keep, has been popping up in my Twitter feed
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:36.320]   the whole time.
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:37.320]   Oh, let's talk about it.
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:42.200]   Speaking of, of, of rappers, this is an actual headline.
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:46.200]   Wiz Khalifa handcuffed an airport for riding a hoverboard.
[01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:50.080]   Hey, he was, where did he get the hoverboard?
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:51.320]   And how can I get one?
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:54.640]   B, since when is that illegal?
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.040]   It's, he says all because I didn't want to ditch the technology.
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:02.680]   And we'll be using in the next six months, do what you want kids, he said.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:03.680]   Wow.
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:05.480]   It's a hoverboard.
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:08.920]   So Alexis has been promoting its hoverboard.
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:12.760]   I've seen some of these hoverboards in almost every, as far as I know, in every case.
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:14.000]   It's in one in the wild.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:20.160]   No, they require huge amounts of power because it's using super conductivity and, wait a
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:21.160]   minute, let's see.
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:22.600]   Let's see Wiz Khalifa.
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:30.120]   He, he shared this of US border and customs protection, yelling, stop resisting, get off
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:31.520]   the hoverboard.
[01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.240]   There's no hoverboard in evidence here.
[01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:35.480]   You think it's a hoax?
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:39.000]   Because there is, is there such a thing as a real hoverboard?
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   No, it's not.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.480]   There's a lot of people that take him down.
[01:10:42.480 --> 01:10:45.720]   Well, he's a strong, strong, no, he's not.
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:47.560]   He's a skinny little thing.
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:50.680]   He was forced to lie belly down in the airport ground because he didn't want to ditch the
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:52.560]   technology everybody will be using.
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:56.840]   This sounds a little, John, is your smell detector going off here?
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:00.000]   I did do the first time I heard the story.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.280]   Restrained for riding a hoverboard.
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:07.200]   Here's his second video that he posted.
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:11.880]   First of all, what video camera is he using that has the date and time stamp on it?
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:17.640]   Looks like one of those old giant ones.
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:21.560]   No, no hoverboard is in evidence, by the way, in any of this.
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.720]   He was arrested for that story.
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:29.400]   I just love the fact that we have a headline on the Internet saying someone was arrested
[01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:30.760]   for riding a hoverboard.
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:32.360]   It's like 2015.
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:33.360]   It's ridiculous.
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:36.080]   It forgets straight out of confidence.
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:38.000]   Straight out of the back to the future.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   Right, exactly.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.240]   So if you talked about this, I think this is what he's riding, by the way.
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:44.720]   This is all the kids are riding these.
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.160]   They're basically segues without him.
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:47.160]   Oh, yes.
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:48.160]   Right.
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:49.160]   Yeah.
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:50.680]   Didn't we have some of these around?
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:52.600]   I feel like I would have killed myself if I rode this.
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.280]   There's a picture on Rolling Stone.
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.520]   It's like looking on a skateboard.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.080]   Looks like him on it.
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.080]   And it's one of those.
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.080]   Yeah.
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:00.600]   I'm pretty sure that's what they meant.
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:01.600]   It's like a skateboard.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.560]   No, it's not like a skateboard.
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:04.560]   It's like a sign.
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:06.200]   No, I mean in terms of falling off.
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:07.360]   You just jump off.
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:08.880]   Well, I don't know about that.
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:10.360]   I just seen his one.
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:11.360]   Just two.
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.800]   Should I get one of those?
[01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:14.800]   Yeah, this would be great.
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:15.800]   You should definitely get one.
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:16.800]   Yes, you know that.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:17.800]   Two segues.
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.960]   I know, but this is a little different.
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:20.960]   I'm a master of--
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.520]   It's like having a--
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:25.120]   I want to be thrown to the ground by US border and customs.
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:27.640]   I'll take mine to IAA and we'll see that.
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:28.640]   That's what they're talking about.
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:29.640]   That's probably not a price.
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:30.640]   Yeah, it's got to be.
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.720]   And all the kids will be riding these in six months.
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:35.520]   Have you talked about this camera on the air?
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:36.680]   A little bit, why?
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:38.200]   Well, this is like the camera right now.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.720]   That's the camera.
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:41.600]   Do you have it set on silent shutter?
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:46.840]   No, but you press this button right here, and then you can choose silent shutter.
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:47.840]   It might be.
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.320]   I think it was because I just took some pictures.
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:50.320]   It's silent, yeah.
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:52.080]   And it makes no noise.
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.080]   That's silent.
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:55.320]   So no, but it does it by charging the--
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:13:01.480]   What it does is it has normally, if you turn the silent shutter off, a regular metal curtain.
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:02.480]   Right.
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:03.480]   For normal--
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:06.520]   Then it goes out of the way because it is a mirrorless.
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:08.400]   So there's no mirror, but there's still a curtain.
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:11.640]   But if you turn it to silent, it does a digital curtain because it's a--
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.960]   Yeah, you don't need a camera, basically, right?
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:16.400]   So you don't have to have a shutter.
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:19.240]   It's turning on and off real fast.
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:21.560]   And how do you grow the image?
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:22.560]   Grow it?
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:23.560]   Well, so I can focus.
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.160]   Oh, there it is.
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.520]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:27.760]   That's the first-- that's C1.
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:31.080]   So you can reprogram all those buttons so you can do that.
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:33.480]   This is a camera that-- this is fantastic.
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:38.920]   Trey Radcliffe, who is, of course, one of our favorite photographers, says that that camera
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:42.280]   is the best digital camera made today, probably the best digital camera he's ever used.
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:45.920]   I believe it only does five.
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:47.960]   Brackets five for HDR does not do seven.
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:48.960]   You can do nine.
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:49.960]   Oh, you can?
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.480]   I never-- I didn't see it in the text.
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:52.480]   I'll show you.
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:53.480]   You can do nine.
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:54.480]   Oh, you can.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:55.480]   Yeah.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:56.480]   Oh, OK.
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:57.480]   And what's the name and model?
[01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:58.480]   Oh, this is the Sony.
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:13:59.480]   Get this.
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:00.480]   Get this.
[01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:01.480]   The Dwight-- by one of these.
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:02.480]   It's only $3,000 Dwight minus the lens.
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:03.480]   The A7R2.
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:05.400]   The lens is another grand.
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:06.880]   No, that's an $8,000.
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:07.880]   No, it's this.
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:09.520]   I'm saying the lens you can get from them.
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:10.520]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:11.520]   It's expensive.
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:12.520]   Mm.
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:16.040]   No, this $8,000 lens is very unique.
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:17.040]   Not everybody has these.
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:18.520]   Not everybody has that, baby.
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:19.520]   Oh.
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.520]   You got to be crazy.
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.520]   I keep-- I just--
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:24.680]   I know this is a hilarious story.
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:29.240]   I keep hoping I'll become a better photographer if I just buy enough gear someday.
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.800]   I will have.
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:35.360]   Look at even Justine's dog has a hoverboard.
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:38.760]   That's how hip.
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.240]   You got to get one of those hoverboards, Leo.
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:41.480]   It didn't be bombing around.
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:42.800]   Did we send these back?
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:44.160]   Didn't we have these?
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:47.880]   We reviewed them, I thought, on before you buy.
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:51.840]   I feel like, though, if you don't have a handle to hold, you have to balance or something.
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.960]   Do you think they're harder to ride?
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:54.960]   You think?
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:57.080]   It's like a skateboard.
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:58.920]   If you can't have a ride a skateboard, you--
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:14:59.920]   No.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.160]   My son can ride a skateboard, so he probably won't.
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:02.160]   Look at Justine.
[01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.520]   Look at her go.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:04.520]   You go, girl.
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:06.160]   She can probably ride a skateboard, too.
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:07.600]   If I were you, I wouldn't get one of these.
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.040]   You're going to kill yourself.
[01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:10.040]   Guaranteed.
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:11.040]   Put your eye out, kid.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.040]   Guaranteed.
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:14.760]   And then we'll get my $8,000 lens.
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.520]   Well, put it me in the will.
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:21.000]   I will ask you to go on the few people that would appreciate having a seat.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.320]   You appreciate that lens.
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:24.840]   Now you're a pretty serious photographer, I know.
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:26.000]   You like your 11 shots.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.000]   I take a lot of shots.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:28.520]   But they put them up anywhere.
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:30.520]   I have them in the house, and I've been--
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.720]   No, but I mean, like-- oh, you've entered competitions?
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:33.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:34.720]   Have you won?
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:35.720]   Yeah, I've won a couple of things.
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:36.720]   Nice.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:37.720]   I didn't know this about you.
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:38.720]   That's one of my hobbies.
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:42.200]   You post them on Flickr, Smugmug, Google-- nowhere.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:45.000]   We can see them.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.640]   I build most of my stuff up to huge sizes.
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:50.800]   How big?
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:51.800]   44, both.
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:52.960]   So you would want this camera.
[01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:54.000]   It's 42 megapixels.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.160]   You would-- you don't need that many megapixels for--
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:15:58.160]   When you're doing snapshots.
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:58.760]   Snapshots.
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:15:59.280]   No, you don't.
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:00.120]   Yeah.
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:02.880]   Actually, one of my best pictures I shot with a little pocket camera.
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:04.360]   We're going to the Supreme Court, kids.
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:05.640]   Apple and Samsung.
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:09.800]   Samsung is going to appeal to the Supreme Court.
[01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:13.760]   You remember that a couple of years ago, a federal jury in San Jose
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:19.880]   found that Samsung had ripped off Apple and their iPhone patents awarded several hundred
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:25.080]   million dollars to Apple on Wednesday.
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.120]   Samsung says, "We're going to appeal.
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:31.280]   We're not giving you the money because we're going all the way to the Supreme Court."
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:32.280]   Why not?
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:35.960]   What's interesting about this is they've got a lot of support.
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:37.960]   Google, Facebook, HP.
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:43.680]   They're all backing them because it feels like Steve Jobs famously is going to start
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:49.240]   a nuclear war over the ripoff of iOS.
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:53.920]   He may have overreached in that original suit with the design patent stuff.
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.680]   It's the thing that everybody makes fun of.
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:57.760]   There were two issues.
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:00.600]   There were physical patents.
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:05.000]   The more important ones were the trade dress patents that this looks like an iPhone and
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:10.160]   it's intentionally done that way to confuse the consumer.
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:15.560]   Those trade dress patents are perceived by the industry as dangerous.
[01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:19.760]   Well, it's really subjective.
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:24.000]   You can't say objectively, "Oh, that's obviously that was..."
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.800]   It's perceived by the industry, but what is the law?
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:29.120]   What is the current state of the law?
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:30.680]   Patent law is so...
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.680]   It's a mess.
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:33.680]   Yeah.
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:36.160]   Even patent lawyers can't figure it out.
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:40.400]   It's being written by...
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:41.400]   Where do we start?
[01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:46.160]   Stuff gets patented that probably shouldn't get patented and then more stuff gets patented
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:50.880]   that maybe used the stuff that already got patented that shouldn't have been.
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:53.880]   We're way deep in a mess.
[01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:55.880]   It's a nightmare and we can't get out of it.
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.400]   Here's some good news.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:00.720]   Steve Jobs just got a patent for the iPod Shuffle.
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:02.400]   He just was awarded...
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:06.560]   He died four years ago, but he was just awarded...
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:13.360]   The Shuffle came out ten years ago, but he was just awarded a patent for the iPod Shuffle.
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.440]   So you can see how efficient this is.
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:18.440]   Jeez, Louise!
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:19.920]   You said Jeez, Louise.
[01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:20.920]   Yeah.
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:21.920]   Do you know her?
[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:22.920]   That's funny.
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:23.920]   I think it's Louise Brooks probably, right?
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:24.920]   Don't you think?
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:25.920]   I...
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:26.920]   I...
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:27.920]   You remember Louise Brooks?
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:28.920]   No.
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:29.920]   No?
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:30.920]   Fill up.
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:31.920]   You remember Louise Brooks?
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:32.920]   She's sorry.
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:35.480]   Why am I older than everybody on this show?
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:38.520]   Only in spirit.
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:40.760]   The original Bob, right?
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:42.960]   Oh, and that's why people said Jeez, Louise?
[01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:45.200]   I'm thinking it's a rat that era.
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:48.520]   She was a movie star in the 20s.
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:49.520]   Jeez, Louise.
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.320]   Yeah, you're older than I am then.
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:52.320]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.560]   Did you date her or what was it?
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.520]   I don't even remember that from film school.
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:19:01.400]   I will never forget Pandora's Box, one of the great four out of four stars, Roger
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:02.400]   Ebert.
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:05.560]   Ninety percent on Rotten Tomatoes.
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:06.960]   It was...
[01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:07.960]   What year?
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:12.600]   Claimed German silent film, she played Lulu, a woman so beautiful and luring that Fue
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:15.560]   can resist her siren charms 1929.
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:18.880]   Just before the switch over.
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:20.560]   Directed by GW PEPST.
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:21.560]   PEPST!
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:22.560]   The great.
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:25.520]   Yeah, he probably got a blue ribbon for that.
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:29.800]   At least the total security award.
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:30.800]   Very least.
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.560]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:34.560]   Are you audible book listeners?
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:36.280]   I got the cutest picture.
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:38.280]   Yes, yes, yes.
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:40.360]   I love audiobook.
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:43.160]   So I'm walking by the barbershop yesterday.
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:44.320]   I'm seeing if I can find this photo.
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:48.920]   I'm walking by the barbershop yesterday and I looked through the window and this kid,
[01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:51.040]   he is not happy about getting his haircut.
[01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.720]   He's making the most sour puss face I ever saw.
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.280]   I came in and I said, "Can I take your picture?"
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:57.080]   I asked his dad, "Can I take your picture?"
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:59.280]   I said, "He looks so miserable."
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:00.760]   Probably his first haircut.
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:01.760]   I'm new there.
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:02.760]   That's what I thought.
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:05.400]   Oh, it's a first haircut or something like that.
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.560]   So I said, "Why are you so?"
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:07.800]   No, that's somebody else.
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:08.800]   Why are you so?
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:09.800]   You shot that at HDR.
[01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:11.800]   Why are you so?
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:12.800]   Look at that.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:13.800]   I said, "Why are you so unhappy?"
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.640]   So I'm not unhappy on listening to audiobook.
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:16.640]   I said, "What?"
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.600]   He pulled out his iPod touch.
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:21.320]   He was listening to Diary of a Wimpy Kid while he was getting his haircut.
[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:24.080]   "I have high hopes for the future of this country."
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:25.880]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:26.880]   Yeah.
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:30.720]   How do they shake out the earbuds?
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:34.160]   You know, I didn't see earbuds, but I don't know how he's listening.
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:35.160]   Maybe it's coming through.
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:36.160]   I don't know.
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:37.720]   Coming through the sheet.
[01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:39.120]   That was the cutest thing I ever saw.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.600]   He was just hearing it in his head.
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:42.160]   No, he showed me.
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:43.160]   Diary of a Wimpy Kid.
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:44.160]   He showed me.
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:45.160]   He got it on his iPod touch.
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:46.160]   He didn't mean he did anything.
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:47.160]   We love Audible.
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:48.160]   Kids love Audible.
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:49.160]   Adults love Audible.
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.840]   One of the things that research shows is that kids who...
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:54.880]   You would think, "Oh, I want the kid to look at a book and read it."
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:59.400]   Kids who listen to audiobooks, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, great choice, are become better
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:00.920]   readers because they're listening.
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:01.920]   They get engaged.
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:03.200]   They also bring out the book.
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:04.760]   They look at the book.
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.840]   I want to talk a little bit about a group of kids that...
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:11.320]   You know James Patterson, of course, the great best-selling author.
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:15.080]   He is teamed up with Audible to help a group of kids.
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:17.320]   They call him Reluctant Readers.
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.560]   James says, "I was a reluctant reader.
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:22.880]   My dad was a reluctant reader, but reading is so important."
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:27.360]   I think it's maybe the single most important thing a kid can learn in school.
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:32.640]   Patterson is on a personal mission to inspire kids to discover that reading is fun, it's
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:35.040]   entertainment, it's great.
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:40.800]   In this summer, he's partnering with Audible to create a program that encourages young readers
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:43.800]   to make their way to books by listening to audiobooks.
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:48.440]   I think we found one young reader who was very much into his audiobooks.
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:50.320]   The program focuses on family listening.
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:51.640]   I think that's a great idea.
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:55.040]   I have very fond memories of listening to.
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:57.120]   It's not easy being brown with my kids.
[01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:00.760]   It's just wonderful.
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:04.640]   It recommends titles, suggests genres that parents and kids will enjoy together.
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:07.680]   In fact, Patterson's put together a recommended listening list.
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:11.840]   An Audible kudos to you Audible is providing those audiobooks at a discount.
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:18.800]   Plus, reading guides for families, particularly on Patterson's featured series, Middle School,
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:21.000]   Daniel X and Treasure Hunters.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.160]   They're having an Instagram campaign to have kids and families show where listening took
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:25.160]   them.
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:31.040]   It's countless studies have shown that listening to books improves early literacy skills, it
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:36.080]   expands vocabularies, it elevates comprehension.
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:39.360]   Narrators can bring the text to life, which helps kids there.
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:43.840]   That's a great one, Treasure Hunters, which helps kids really get engaged in reading and
[01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:46.000]   in stories.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.840]   They can listen while cleaning their rooms while getting their haircut while on the road.
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:50.840]   That's what we did.
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:55.080]   We were on a road trip and we listened the whole way and it was so much fun.
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:59.800]   For a special summer promotion to encourage reluctant readers, just a reduced price is
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:03.400]   495 a book, audible.com/paterson.
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:08.720]   P-A-T-T-E-R-S-O-N.
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:13.280]   I was listening to his, I wanted to hear his first book along came a spider.
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:14.920]   Great book.
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:18.960]   The chatroom saying it doesn't help with spelling, but I guess that's what God invented
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:19.960]   spell checks.
[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:20.960]   You know what?
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:22.760]   My kids spell so poorly.
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:26.680]   Actually, Henry's not too bad, but Abby's terrible.
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:31.480]   Always was because when they were little, there was this fad called whole, I think it
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:34.640]   was whole language.
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:36.320]   We had learned with phonetics, right?
[01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:38.640]   But phonetics had been the school of phonetics.
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:39.640]   No good.
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:40.640]   No good.
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:44.560]   So they encouraged them, believe it or not, to spell it any way they wanted to.
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:45.560]   Inventive spelling.
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:47.560]   Inventive spelling, you know about this.
[01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:50.480]   Yeah, that's what my kids had, but they ended up being good spellers.
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:52.600]   Yeah, you know, I think it's almost genetic.
[01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:53.600]   Some people aren't.
[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.280]   I think online, though, if you do a lot of chatting online, Mike, that helps because
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.280]   people laugh at you.
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:58.520]   Yeah, you're an idiot.
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:01.800]   Literacy is more, yeah, in some ways literacy is bigger now because of that because it's
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:02.800]   typing.
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:03.800]   So I went to the kitchen.
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:04.800]   Yeah.
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:07.400]   So I was finding the red vines, which is not there.
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:09.320]   No, but you found something so much better.
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:13.440]   Why would any, why would this be in the cabinet as a snack?
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:15.840]   Dinty moored beef stew.
[01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:17.320]   It's my nine.
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:18.320]   That's good.
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:23.720]   When I'm going to do the Twitch show, I'm going to look forward to some beef stew.
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:24.720]   It's good.
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:25.720]   I got these.
[01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:27.760]   These look like at least edible.
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:28.760]   What is that?
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:29.760]   I don't know.
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:30.760]   Some sunkissed.
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:31.760]   Some.
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:38.200]   So here's Lamar Wilson as a video on YouTube fat guy on hoverboard.
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:40.640]   So these are Carl's hoverboards.
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:41.640]   Even though they're not actually.
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:43.800]   They're not floating in the air.
[01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:44.800]   Right.
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:49.720]   The kids are doing it, including Wiz Khalifa and Justine and wow.
[01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:50.720]   It was a guy.
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:51.720]   I got to get one of those.
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:52.720]   I got one.
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:53.720]   I got to get one of those.
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:54.720]   You'll scream like a girl.
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:58.560]   Can you do a skateboard?
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:24:59.680]   Not in a long time.
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:00.680]   I don't know.
[01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:01.680]   I used to.
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.120]   Oh, then you can probably do this.
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:05.720]   Is this a terrible plot?
[01:25:05.720 --> 01:25:06.720]   No, no, no.
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:08.360]   Two islers are not better than red vines done.
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:09.360]   Okay.
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:11.680]   Those we've changed the chat room set.
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:12.920]   Have some dinty moored beef stew.
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:13.920]   It'll cheer you up.
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:14.920]   I don't think so.
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:15.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:16.920]   Go ahead, Phillip.
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:18.640]   Didn't the guy who bought Segway die?
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:19.640]   No.
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:20.640]   Taking his Segway off a cliff?
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:21.640]   Yes.
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:22.640]   No, that was the CEO.
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:25.480]   Yeah, but he was a British investor.
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:27.640]   I think he bought the third guy to buy it.
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:32.800]   Segway was not and still not the most financially viable company in the world.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:36.280]   He had more off-road Segways and apparently took it off-road.
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:39.560]   There was some question whether he had a heart attack before or after he wrote it off
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:40.560]   the cliff.
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:41.560]   Yeah.
[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:46.640]   I was at time when the Segway first came out and they were actually considering putting
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:47.640]   it on the cover.
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:48.640]   Yeah.
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:49.640]   It's a project.
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:50.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:56.720]   There was a writer who was very excited to write a time cover about it and nobody at
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:57.720]   time had seen it.
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:06.440]   So they sent me up to New Hampshire to kick the tires and see if this was a cover worthy.
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:10.040]   And I met everybody and I listened to their business model and I could tell.
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:11.520]   There's no business model.
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:14.080]   Well, their pitch was China.
[01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:15.240]   We've got a problem with China.
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:17.360]   They all want to have cars.
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:22.640]   If all of China gets a car, the planet's going to heat up and go to hell.
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:25.640]   So the solution is to give them Segways.
[01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:27.080]   And these things were selling for what?
[01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:28.080]   Six or $700?
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:31.000]   No, I just bought two.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:32.000]   They're $6,500 each.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.720]   I think we're like this three or four back then.
[01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:37.280]   This is going to replace the bicycle.
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:39.760]   No, but it's sure fun to ride.
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:41.280]   So we ran it inside.
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:42.280]   We didn't do it on the car.
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:49.440]   And by the way, a few years later, Time Magazine, the 10 biggest tech failures of the last decade.
[01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:51.240]   Number one, Segway.
[01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:52.240]   The Segway.
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:54.160]   Here we go.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:57.760]   But so it was not Dean Cayman who was a brilliant inventor who invented the Segway.
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:26:58.920]   It was not he who went off the cliff.
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.320]   I think a lot of people think that's the case.
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:02.000]   It was a British investor.
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:08.360]   The saddest story of this all is that Segway had fought for years to keep a Chinese clone
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:12.760]   of the Segway out of the United States, fought successfully.
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:17.760]   They just got bought by the Chinese clone company that six months ago.
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:19.240]   The challenge.
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:20.240]   Ironic.
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:24.960]   The Segway is cheaper than your lens.
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:31.800]   You know, I probably sound like the worst one percent of all time.
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:35.640]   This is the most decadent thing anyone's ever owned that I know.
[01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:41.920]   But I live on Dintymore beef stew because I give up those things for my art.
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:46.320]   It is pretty decadent.
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:47.320]   I like it.
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:48.880]   I like the fact that you have this lens.
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:51.360]   I don't know what to say.
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:55.320]   Because I can shoot a picture on it once I'm not going to pretend to fall humility.
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:57.760]   No, you've got the lens and everyone.
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:00.720]   This rig I'm holding in my hands.
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:01.720]   $12,000.
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:04.640]   That's ridiculous.
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.640]   I just wanted to be a bit of a photographer.
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:08.960]   And John, that's all I wanted.
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:12.080]   That's almost as much as an Apple watch.
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:13.080]   Oh, God.
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:14.760]   $12,000.
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:17.120]   This is the company that bought Segway, the NineBot.
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:18.120]   They also make this.
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:19.480]   And it doesn't even have auto focus.
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:21.080]   No, that's the whole thing.
[01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:22.080]   Yeah.
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:23.080]   Well, you're going out of focus.
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:26.120]   No, you pay more money to not have auto focus.
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.120]   Makes sense.
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:28.120]   Yeah.
[01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:29.640]   They make this ridiculous contraption.
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:31.240]   This is a wheel.
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:36.520]   These pedals flip down and you stand around and you roll around in this.
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:37.520]   Yeah, you look like a conic.
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:40.280]   So you need a lunatic in that thing.
[01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:43.520]   Did you see there's one that looks like a bathroom scale?
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:45.160]   And you just float around on that?
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:48.800]   And you sit on it and you ride around and you can steer and all that stuff.
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:49.800]   That's--
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:50.800]   You're going to get one?
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:51.800]   You know what they're touting?
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:53.800]   They're saying this is going to be huge in China.
[01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:54.800]   Right.
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:57.880]   Now that China's broke, I don't think anything's going to be huge in China.
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:28:59.720]   Hey, is it over for China now?
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:00.720]   No.
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:04.240]   When we were in China in 2009, I was really impressed.
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:07.120]   I mean, Shanghai, they were building a new skyscraper every few days.
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:08.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:09.120]   It really was cool.
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:11.040]   It was 90% of the world's cranes.
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:12.040]   Amazing.
[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:16.080]   And I thought this culture, we were in the American century.
[01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:19.720]   I feel that maybe the 21st century will be called the Chinese century.
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:21.200]   No, if we have anything to do with it.
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:24.960]   Well, I mentioned it to my guide and he said, no, no, you don't understand.
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:30.520]   The economic underpinnings of this are completely fragile.
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:32.720]   And he said, this is not a stable economy.
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:34.720]   And he was right, I mean, but it took a few years to--
[01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:36.720]   Oh, they're still kicking by.
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:37.720]   They're still going to kick by.
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:40.040]   Look, they got a wheel with pedals that you can--
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:41.040]   Mm.
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:42.040]   Iridescent--
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:43.040]   How much they're selling that for?
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:44.040]   What's that sold for?
[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:45.840]   It's got to be cheaper than a segue.
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:49.840]   They also sell an atmosphere lamp that's full of personality.
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:51.840]   An atmosphere lamp?
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:53.120]   What does that mean?
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:55.120]   I don't know.
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:58.920]   It looks like the top of the Amazon Echo.
[01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:01.120]   It's an individual lifting handle design.
[01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:03.560]   I think there's a language issue here.
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:07.320]   Being compatible with popular accessories.
[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:08.320]   Mm.
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:09.320]   Being.
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:10.320]   All right.
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:11.320]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:13.320]   The Ashley Madison Hack was Chinese.
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:14.320]   Right.
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:15.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:17.880]   It doesn't take much to figure out.
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:20.320]   Would you rather have this or--
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:21.920]   I'd like to see somebody drop her board.
[01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:23.240]   They just show the model.
[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:24.240]   I don't know.
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:25.240]   It could be two feet high.
[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:26.240]   Look, you got an app.
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:27.240]   It could be a little bitty thing.
[01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:29.960]   The 9-Droid app.
[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:31.280]   Tracking all the time.
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:36.320]   Looks like you're in one of those giant tires.
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:39.160]   It's basically-- all of these are just segues without the handle.
[01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:40.160]   That's all I'm going to do.
[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:42.160]   I want one of these.
[01:30:42.160 --> 01:30:43.240]   Let's take a break.
[01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:44.520]   This was a good week on Twitter.
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:48.360]   And we have taken the liberty of piecing together
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:52.360]   some highlights from the week's best shows.
[01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:53.200]   Take a look.
[01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:55.320]   Previously on Twitter.
[01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:55.880]   Oh my god.
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:56.720]   Look at that loud shirt.
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:30:57.720]   Turn that thing down.
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:00.160]   Yeah, I had to put an earplugs just to wear it down.
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:01.360]   Tech news today.
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:04.880]   If you needed any more evidence that the patent process moves way
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.440]   too slowly, here it is.
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:08.680]   The late Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs
[01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:11.480]   was granted a patent this week for the iPod shuffle.
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:13.080]   Jobs died about four years ago.
[01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:17.440]   This shows exactly how backed up the patent system.
[01:31:17.440 --> 01:31:18.720]   This week in Google.
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:20.440]   I love the R&D stuff at Google.
[01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:21.720]   This is mind boggling.
[01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:24.360]   I imagine Larry sitting in a chair to kill something like this.
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:26.120]   With his fingers steepled.
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:28.040]   He's very entirely white.
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:31.040]   And Larry says, thrill me.
[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:32.800]   And the engineer has five minutes.
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:34.240]   Does he have a cap in his arms?
[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:36.400]   Yeah, he could have Mr. Bigel's worth in his arms.
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:37.400]   You nailed it.
[01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:39.280]   That's exactly what I mean.
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:40.400]   All about Android.
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:43.720]   As we finally get the unveiling of what Android M actually
[01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:46.120]   means, and it is marshmallow.
[01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:46.960]   Marshmallow.
[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:49.080]   And now the marshmallow is on fire.
[01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:51.320]   That's how you get the nice and crispy.
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:52.640]   This is how you do it.
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:55.240]   All right, so then you take-- OK, sorry, continue to twist.
[01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:58.000]   Thousands of hours of high quality drivel.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.960]   Is the Android robot our size?
[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:01.320]   And that's an enormous marshmallow?
[01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:03.640]   Or is the Android robot marshmallow size?
[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:04.760]   I look really important.
[01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:06.840]   All through the PR material from Google PR.
[01:32:06.840 --> 01:32:07.720]   And I did not see that.
[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:10.160]   Inquiring minds not to know.
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:10.920]   That was it?
[01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:11.400]   That's it.
[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:12.960]   That was the best of the week.
[01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:13.480]   Wow.
[01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:15.800]   It was a bad week.
[01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:16.800]   OK, I'll grant you that.
[01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:21.840]   You know what, a bad week, Jeff Bezos, after that New
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:23.240]   York Times article last week?
[01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:24.240]   Oh, boy.
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:24.760]   Yeah.
[01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:26.240]   And you know what's really interesting?
[01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:29.480]   To watch the back and forth, people say, no, first of all,
[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:30.080]   didn't happen.
[01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:32.080]   That was the New York Times taking straight aim
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:34.960]   at the owner of the Washington Post.
[01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:36.640]   They're those who say, yeah, it happens.
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:38.880]   It's a startup-- well, 10-year-old startup.
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:39.520]   But it's like--
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:41.080]   Or even more than that.
[01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:42.680]   It's a very engaged company.
[01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:44.360]   When you go to work for a company like Amazon,
[01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:46.880]   you expect to work long hours, get emails in the middle of the night,
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:48.880]   and things like that.
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:49.800]   Where do you go?
[01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:50.560]   Where do you fall down?
[01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:52.480]   My thinking on this whole thing has gotten--
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:54.760]   I thought originally that it was the Washington Post
[01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:57.160]   versus the New York Times because they've been chiding each other.
[01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:57.680]   Right.
[01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:00.120]   So somebody decided to take a pot shot at Bezos.
[01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:05.160]   But now I'm thinking, if you look up unions versus Amazon,
[01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:08.520]   I think you find the genesis of this thing.
[01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:10.880]   Amazon's been fighting the unions left and right.
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:13.080]   The big newspapers are all unionized.
[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:14.640]   I don't know about the Chronicle.
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:17.880]   But the New York Times is huge union operation.
[01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:19.920]   This is what it is.
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:21.920]   It's just to give it to this guy because he
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:23.360]   won't let the unions in.
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:24.560]   That's what I think.
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:27.200]   There aren't any union papers in Texas.
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:28.400]   No, it's Texas.
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:29.000]   Oh, Texas.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:30.000]   Oh, OK.
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:30.440]   That makes sense.
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:31.840]   I worked for the only one.
[01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:35.760]   The San Antonio Light, God Rested Soul, was a union paper.
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:37.360]   But there are no--
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:39.880]   They're one of the big cities up north
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:41.960]   are almost all union papers.
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:46.120]   What I think happened here is that when they talked to both current
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:49.320]   and older former employees, former employees
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:51.800]   usually have some kind of gripe.
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:55.680]   And I think there are probably pockets where you have
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:59.640]   unacceptable managers, managers who abuse their people, who
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:00.600]   take the kind of approach.
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:02.720]   And there are some who don't.
[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:04.200]   And there was a--
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:06.920]   In one of the later--
[01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:09.640]   The story by the guy who was an Amazon employee who
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:10.640]   sought to debunk it.
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:12.480]   Yeah, he published it in the media.
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:12.920]   Yeah.
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:13.480]   Right.
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:15.080]   He was in a meeting.
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:16.640]   He said where the guy said, yeah,
[01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:19.440]   we used to burn people to the ground in this place.
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:22.120]   And so I think they may have done that at one time
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:23.200]   across the board.
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:26.960]   But I suspect that it's probably been diluted since.
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:31.400]   And the New York Times probably just got kind of a blind review
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:33.200]   of what actually happens in there.
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:34.680]   It's too complex for a good man.
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:37.160]   Yeah, but it still seemed like a hit piece.
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:38.080]   It did feel like that.
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:39.240]   In fact, they're--
[01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:40.120]   Margaret Sullivan--
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:40.560]   They got tried it.
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:45.120]   Yeah, Margaret Sullivan, who's their ombudsman, right?
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:47.520]   Said, yeah, we could have done a better job balancing this.
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:49.360]   We could have tried to find some other employees
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:52.040]   with opinions somewhat differing.
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:53.720]   It did seem to feel like a hit piece.
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:54.960]   I'm sorry, go ahead, Philip.
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:55.960]   Well, I was going to say that.
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:59.280]   They got tried it by the ombudsman person, I think.
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:03.760]   But the people who say, oh, you look at any of these companies.
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:04.760]   You look at Microsoft.
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:05.360]   You look at Apple.
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:06.240]   You look at Facebook.
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:07.680]   And you get the same kind of behavior.
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:11.320]   People went back to say, look at the sole of the new machine.
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:14.760]   The same kind of startup intensity, the long hours.
[01:35:14.760 --> 01:35:15.760]   That's a good point.
[01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:16.560]   That's a good point.
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:20.040]   But I don't think it was the long hours that bothered people
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:21.040]   about that arcway.
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:23.080]   It was the woman who had the miscarriage
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:25.480]   and was told she had to come back to work.
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:26.640]   The bullying.
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:29.840]   I do think that Bezos--
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:32.240]   Bezos, Bezos-- is different.
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:36.560]   I think he's missing the gene for human empathy.
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:40.640]   And he's got control of a company and a lot of people.
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:41.280]   You pointed us--
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:42.320]   I could be wrong, but--
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:42.760]   Yeah.
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:44.960]   You pointed us to Jonah Sarah's piece in the New York Times,
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:46.840]   the opinion pages.
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:49.480]   And I think the salient article Sarah writes,
[01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:52.640]   it's worth remembering that Amazon is a first generation
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:53.360]   internet company.
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:57.560]   It's peers, including Yahoo and AOL,
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:59.160]   are a shell of their former selves.
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:01.920]   Even as Amazon's become ever more important and powerful.
[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:03.320]   Whatever you think about his methods,
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:08.120]   he has managed to keep Amazon absolutely relevant.
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:10.320]   But he's burned through--
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:12.840]   first of all, you forget that they already
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:17.760]   did a hit piece on Amazon for what goes on in their warehouses.
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:19.120]   In other words, no air conditioning.
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:20.160]   People were being worked for death.
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:23.280]   And finally Amazon, you OK, they put the air conditioners in.
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:26.920]   This is strictly about the white collar workers,
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:29.360]   their upper level management.
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:31.960]   And I totally believe what the Times reported
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:37.400]   that they work these guys just as hard as they possibly can.
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:39.720]   And when the guys start to break down,
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:42.000]   they get rid of them and bring in a new crop.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:45.520]   They're treating people like they're fungible.
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:48.440]   There's plenty of people who would be happy to work at Amazon.
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:49.840]   You get a good training.
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:51.960]   You can only do it for so long because it's too much.
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:53.720]   And other companies aren't like that.
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:56.320]   People get hired by Apple to do a certain job.
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:57.880]   And they stay there for 30 years.
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:01.000]   There's got to be something different about Amazon.
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.320]   People uniformly said it was horrible.
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:05.560]   The worst job I ever had working for Steve Jobs.
[01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:07.200]   And I will never forget it.
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:09.360]   And I will never regret it.
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.360]   It's a double-edged thing.
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:13.960]   These are those masochists that work in Silicon Valley, though.
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:15.600]   I think it's being--
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:19.840]   I think the Mr. Robot Show is kind of exploring this a little bit.
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:21.320]   Are they going to get into that now?
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:24.720]   Well, the whole show is about kind of the sickness
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:26.200]   of a high-end programmer.
[01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:28.240]   Leo, are you not watching Mr. Robot?
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:29.880]   I watched The Pilot, and I loved it.
[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:31.160]   I thought it was great.
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:32.280]   It's incredible.
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:33.040]   It's getting better?
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:33.960]   Incredible show.
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:35.720]   Oh, man.
[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:37.720]   It's probably the best show on TV, right?
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:38.800]   No, I like the first episode.
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:39.360]   I would agree.
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:39.920]   OK, good.
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:40.400]   Where is it?
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:41.400]   What's going on in the U.S.A?
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:42.400]   What's going on in the U.S.A?
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:44.040]   It has as often been.
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:47.280]   U.S.A is owned by NBC Universal,
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:49.880]   so it's not of all places.
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:51.040]   It's kind of where they're doing--
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:53.200]   Yeah, but it's where they dump stuff, usually.
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:54.800]   It's kind of--
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:55.800]   It's kind of their dumping ground.
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:58.960]   If they ever bring back Starsky and Hutch,
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:00.920]   it'll be on U.S.A. network.
[01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:03.760]   So, the Duke's of Hazard Redux, that's
[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:05.240]   going to be in the U.S.A. anymore.
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:07.200]   It's available on their archives.
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:08.640]   It's on iTunes.
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:10.640]   They don't have a lot of--
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:11.320]   Yeah.
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:12.320]   It's fantastic.
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:15.080]   If my wife, who is not a techie and not at all
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:18.240]   interested in hacker culture, is mesmerized
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:21.080]   and when we're cord cutters and when we get the email
[01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:23.400]   from iTunes saying, this is available, she says,
[01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:23.800]   let's watch it.
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:24.720]   Let's watch it.
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:26.040]   It's really good.
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:27.040]   I love that, Sarah.
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:29.480]   Only on Duke's of Hazard is actually a Warner Brothers
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:30.600]   brother's brother's brother.
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:33.240]   I don't think NBC Universal will be a drag back.
[01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:36.160]   I'm a classic clue to give it to you.
[01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:37.120]   You deserve it.
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:37.920]   I deserve it.
[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:40.200]   I earned that.
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:41.120]   Duke's of Hazard.
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:42.240]   OK, I have a question.
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:44.480]   I don't know if it's a spoiler because I haven't been watching
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:45.280]   it.
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:49.280]   But Steve Gibson and I both have posited.
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:49.960]   Positive.
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:50.480]   Positive.
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:51.120]   Woo!
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:54.200]   That the hoodie guy, whatever his name is,
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:58.360]   and the hacker guy played by-- what's his name?
[01:38:58.360 --> 01:38:59.040]   Every player--
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:00.680]   Everybody knows this.
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:01.760]   It's like Fight Club.
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:02.120]   Yeah.
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:03.120]   Yeah, OK.
[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:05.440]   Have they-- has that paid off yet?
[01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:07.440]   Well, it's not like Fight Club in the sense
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:08.680]   that it's his alter ego.
[01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:10.280]   OK.
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:11.720]   But it's very similar.
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:13.040]   Do they tell you this?
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:15.320]   They show you on, I think, episode five on the--
[01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:16.560]   episode nine.
[01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:16.960]   Is it--
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:18.160]   --one that just did it.
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:18.680]   I spoiled just the--
[01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:20.280]   Is that nine episodes for people?
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:21.320]   Episode nine, yeah.
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:21.760]   The one coming up.
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:24.120]   Is that Carl Long and you've only watched episode one?
[01:39:24.120 --> 01:39:24.920]   One.
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:25.880]   Wow.
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:27.640]   Episode 10 is the final one.
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:28.520]   It's this week.
[01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:29.720]   Oh!
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:30.280]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:31.720]   That's exciting.
[01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:32.560]   Yeah.
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:34.560]   I've become an evangelist for this show.
[01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:36.280]   I think it's just spectacular.
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:37.120]   I'm going to sit down.
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:38.000]   There's too many shows.
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:38.880]   You know, I hate this.
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:40.640]   This is an important show you have to watch.
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:41.880]   But there's too many good shows.
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:42.960]   No, this is the--
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:43.680]   He's right.
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:44.680]   This is the top show.
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:45.280]   He's right.
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:46.800]   This is the show you have to watch.
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:47.680]   OK.
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:49.800]   It raises issues that we deal with here.
[01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:50.600]   I don't know what it does.
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:51.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:53.040]   It's just entertaining as hell.
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:54.600]   Have you been watching Humans?
[01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:55.600]   Yeah, I like Humans a lot.
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:56.760]   I have not seen Humans.
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:57.400]   Humans are good.
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:39:57.760]   Humans are good.
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:39:59.160]   It's very good.
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:39:59.600]   That was one of--
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:00.280]   OK, here we go.
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:02.720]   Ladies and gentlemen, right into the old review section
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:03.840]   of the twin broadcast.
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:04.320]   That's another one.
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:05.720]   Where the chat room goes.
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:08.560]   Well, actually, the original Swedish version was much better.
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:12.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:15.120]   I review because I love you.
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:16.120]   Chat.
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:16.520]   Yeah, so--
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:17.960]   By the way, see it.
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:19.000]   Good news here.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:22.440]   According to the onion, Jeff Bezos assures Amazon employees
[01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:25.240]   that HR is working 100 hours a week
[01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:28.760]   to address their complaints.
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:30.520]   Bezos says, nothing matters more to me
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:31.760]   than the well-being of our employees.
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:33.720]   And our HR staff will continue to work their fingers
[01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:35.560]   to the bone, not seeing their families,
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:36.800]   not seeing their friends, or anything
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:39.400]   at all outside their offices for as long as it takes
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:40.920]   to make this right.
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:43.080]   Bezos added that any employee not fully committed
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:44.880]   to ensuring a healthy work-life balance
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:46.560]   should look for a job elsewhere.
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:48.040]   So that-- you see?
[01:40:48.040 --> 01:40:48.440]   Yeah.
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:50.760]   He's addressed it.
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:52.280]   I'm glad the onion's still around.
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:55.440]   I love the onion.
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:57.120]   Let's go to Hot Topic.
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:57.720]   What is a Hot Topic?
[01:40:57.720 --> 01:40:59.080]   Hot Topic.
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:00.240]   You want a Hot Topic?
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:00.840]   Yeah.
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:04.080]   I don't think we've discussed the Skylake CPU yet.
[01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:04.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:05.240]   OK.
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:06.000]   What else?
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.160]   Sprint's going to abandon to your contracts,
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:09.760]   just like T-Mobile and Verizon.
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:10.360]   Really?
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:12.200]   Yeah.
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:14.800]   Have you found Marty Rim?
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:15.160]   What?
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:15.760]   I did.
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:17.040]   You found him?
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:17.540]   Yeah.
[01:41:17.540 --> 01:41:18.040]   Yeah.
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:19.040]   What did you find?
[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:20.520]   I did a Kickstarter.
[01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:20.960]   Really?
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:21.960]   Really?
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:22.920]   No.
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:23.720]   What?
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:26.080]   Hired a private eye in New York.
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:27.200]   And I found--
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:29.040]   How did you pitch the Kickstarter?
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:32.600]   How do you say, I want to hire a private detective?
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:33.960]   How did you pitch that?
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:36.200]   I said, we're coming up to the 20th anniversary
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:38.680]   of the cover that ended my career as a tech journalist.
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:40.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:44.080]   And this guy who was my source.
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:45.480]   Wait, you've got to tell his story.
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:46.960]   It started from the beginning.
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:48.120]   All right.
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:53.280]   20 years ago, last July, time ran a cover story on Cyberporn
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:56.800]   that was immediately ripped to pieces
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:59.840]   by the civil libertarians, among others.
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:02.800]   Mostly Mike Godwin, the Mike Godwin of Godwin's law,
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:07.560]   that any internet discussion will eventually invoke Hitler.
[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:10.120]   Anyway, the source for this story
[01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:13.480]   was a Carnegie Mellon undergraduate
[01:42:13.480 --> 01:42:18.560]   who purported to count how many pornographic pictures there were.
[01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:20.200]   This is the early days of the internet.
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:25.120]   So we're talking about Usenet and porn, BBSes.
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:32.280]   And time just loves two things, one exclusives and two numbers.
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:35.120]   So he was offering us an exclusive access
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:37.880]   to the numbers of pornographic pictures on the internet.
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:42.720]   And I was a green enough writer to get a cover opportunity.
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:44.920]   I ran with this thing.
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:48.240]   Late in the week, about Thursday, as I'm finally reading
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:50.400]   this report, and I'm starting to think, ooh, this
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:52.960]   is really shoddy research.
[01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:54.280]   But I was too deep into it.
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:55.120]   And I was too green.
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:42:57.800]   And I went ahead and wrote this cover story.
[01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:01.360]   And we had a picture of a kid with wide eyes
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:03.120]   and a keyboard.
[01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:04.440]   And obviously there you go.
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:05.440]   Great photo.
[01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:06.040]   Great photo.
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:07.320]   And it wasn't a photo.
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:08.960]   It was a Photoshop thing.
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:12.560]   And inside it had a naked man humping a computer.
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:14.560]   I mean, the art was amazing.
[01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:16.120]   And you've got to put this in a contest,
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:18.480]   because this is 1995.
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:20.400]   This is the beginning of the internet.
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:22.440]   And nobody was even aware that this was happening.
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:27.480]   Well, there were the bulletin boards in the '80s.
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:28.600]   Yeah, but it was not common knowledge.
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:29.920]   There was a lot of porn.
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:31.560]   Well, I don't know about that.
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:33.040]   But OK, keep going.
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:37.560]   The rule about any new medium is pornography becomes
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:39.320]   the first thing that makes money.
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:41.320]   Anyway, the cover came out.
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:46.120]   And all the guys on the well, you know what that was?
[01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:47.120]   I was a member.
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:49.360]   Yeah, you still have a well address, I believe.
[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:53.120]   No, I finally-- the fortune got tired of paying $100 a year.
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:54.320]   So I lost that account.
[01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:58.640]   Anyway, they leaped on this cover and ripped it today.
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:02.880]   They hired-- they got some academics
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:04.680]   to look at the methodology.
[01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:06.720]   And it was terrible.
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:11.120]   So his name is Marty Rim.
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:13.880]   And he hung around for a couple of weeks.
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:15.480]   He did an interview with The New York Times.
[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:18.120]   He was on ABC Nightline.
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:21.400]   And then they started to find out about his past,
[01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:24.320]   which had some weird stuff in it.
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:25.800]   And he disappeared.
[01:44:25.800 --> 01:44:28.080]   And nobody had seen him for 20 years.
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:30.680]   So we were coming up to the 20th anniversary.
[01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:33.120]   And I thought, if I'm going to do something about this,
[01:44:33.120 --> 01:44:35.840]   because it had kind of haunted me, I'd looked for him.
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:37.360]   Did you regret it?
[01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:39.760]   Oh, yeah, Jesus.
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:41.640]   I had to stop writing.
[01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:42.160]   Really?
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:42.960]   I'm an editor.
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:43.840]   That's not hyperbole.
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:44.120]   You really--
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:44.640]   I got it.
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:45.640]   I got it.
[01:44:45.640 --> 01:44:47.520]   I edited science for 12 years.
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:49.160]   The editors, as we know from last week.
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:49.640]   Evil.
[01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:50.920]   Evil.
[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:52.000]   Oh, I haven't--
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.160]   You had to listen to the last week, John.
[01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:55.320]   John, sorry.
[01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:56.760]   Do you know the editor joke?
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:58.120]   There's one funny editor joke.
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:44:58.760]   Shall I tell him?
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:44:59.760]   Yeah.
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:00.100]   Yeah.
[01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:01.880]   So editor and writer are--
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:02.480]   get lost.
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:03.640]   They're covering the Gulf War.
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:04.960]   They get lost in the desert.
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:08.760]   They climb over these hills.
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:10.400]   Marages appear and disappear.
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:12.360]   And finally, they're about to die of thirst
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:13.960]   when they go over one more hill.
[01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:15.760]   And there's an oasis.
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:19.000]   And there's a pool of clean, clear, cold water.
[01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:20.760]   And the writer goes and he sticks his head
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:22.360]   and he's drinking the water.
[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:24.920]   And the editor, he realizes, is standing behind him,
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:26.200]   pissing into it.
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:27.880]   And the writer says, what the hell are you doing?
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:29.160]   And the editor says, it's OK.
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:30.000]   I'm making it better.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:33.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:34.320]   That's a good joke.
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:35.320]   For the writers for--
[01:45:35.320 --> 01:45:38.320]   That's a very classic, I would say, yeah.
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:40.560]   Yeah, it turns out it's an army joke.
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:42.200]   It's a private better joke.
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:42.560]   Yeah.
[01:45:42.560 --> 01:45:45.720]   Anyway, so 20 years later, I--
[01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:47.200]   I pitch it to fortune.
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:49.760]   They say there's sort of interest in my story about it,
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:53.320]   but they feel uncomfortable about hiring the detective.
[01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:55.240]   But they said, if you want to do it with Kickstarter,
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:55.960]   that's OK with us.
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:58.080]   So raise the money on Kickstarter.
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:02.400]   It took me like three days and hired the guy
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:07.360]   and got a home address and a work address.
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:08.480]   And I waited.
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:11.640]   And I thought-- I had fantasies of doing a whole podcast.
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:13.240]   And I taped a bunch of interviews
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:15.280]   with everybody around the story.
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:18.680]   And then I finally said, I got to go try to find the guy.
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:21.240]   So I drove down to--
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:23.160]   he lived outside white planes.
[01:46:23.160 --> 01:46:25.240]   And I took a day, and I drove down.
[01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:26.400]   They really, really in the morning,
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:28.720]   I parked outside his house, and I waited, and waited,
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:29.680]   and waited, and waited.
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:31.160]   And nobody ever came out.
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:33.440]   And I knocked on the door, and the dogs were barking.
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:35.400]   And finally gave up.
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:37.160]   And I went to his place of business,
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:39.640]   where before she wised up to me,
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:42.000]   the receptionist identified him from his picture.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:42.920]   Oh, yeah, he works here.
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:45.040]   And then she got freaked out, wouldn't talk to me
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:46.120]   anymore.
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:48.320]   Anyway, he was clearly ducking me.
[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:50.720]   In fact, he scrubbed all his length.
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:51.680]   He's got a new name.
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:52.680]   He changed his name.
[01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:54.000]   He changed his name.
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:57.200]   Why was he ducking you?
[01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:58.760]   I'm not quite sure.
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:46:59.200]   It may be--
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:00.280]   He doesn't want to relive it.
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:01.600]   He doesn't want to relive it.
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:05.120]   Yeah, someone said, he learned early on
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:07.520]   that if you scrub badly enough on the internet,
[01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:09.960]   there's nothing to do but to get a new identity.
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:10.640]   But you know what?
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:13.240]   I think that 20 years later, hindsight
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:15.920]   has proven him not so far off.
[01:47:15.920 --> 01:47:21.160]   Well, he was far off in that his thesis was
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:24.640]   that people would go to the internet for the kind of porn
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:27.120]   that you couldn't get in the magazine's hand,
[01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:29.160]   that it would be--
[01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:30.880]   I won't even go in parafilia.
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:32.240]   He was short-sighted.
[01:47:32.240 --> 01:47:35.320]   He just didn't realize they'd go to the internet for any kind
[01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:36.800]   of porn they could find.
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:37.000]   Right.
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:40.000]   It's mainly mainstream porn is what most people go for.
[01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.480]   Just like the real world.
[01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:46.480]   And even Godwin says, now he doesn't wash with porn.
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:47.600]   Right.
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:50.040]   And you just have to learn how to raise your kids within it.
[01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:53.400]   Anyway, that part of his thesis was wrong,
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:54.960]   and we played it a big--
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:47:57.720]   Yeah, but he's on the other hand.
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:01.760]   Well, I would grant him that the porn is certainly
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:04.160]   one of the number one-- if the Nothi number one uses it,
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:05.000]   the internet.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:06.040]   Email.
[01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:08.280]   So this is a rapid story.
[01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:08.880]   Did you get it?
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:09.840]   Whole of him?
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:10.080]   All right.
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:12.160]   Well, here, the end of the story is here.
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:13.720]   I go back to his house.
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:14.720]   It's the afternoon.
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:16.880]   I'm banging on the door.
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:18.240]   Like a madman.
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:21.720]   The dogs are barking at me and then looking back at something
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:23.360]   and then barking some more.
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:24.880]   And it hit me.
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:27.840]   This guy is probably right on the other side of the door.
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:30.120]   And for the first time, I put myself in his shoes.
[01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:32.400]   And what it's like to have me--
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:33.400]   Of all people.
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:33.920]   Right.
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:35.880]   He's been trying to avoid me for 20 years.
[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:37.200]   And here I am outside his door.
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:39.480]   And I just-- I felt like a stalker.
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:41.000]   And I decided--
[01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.960]   He was probably aware of the Kickstarter.
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:43.680]   Did you--
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:44.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:45.400]   --not necessarily.
[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:46.320]   I got--
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:49.120]   Did you yell, open the door, you son of a bitch?
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:52.960]   You ruined my life.
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:53.520]   No, I did not--
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:58.880]   He collected 917,000 images, descriptions,
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:03.200]   short stories, and animations from BBS's.
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:06.760]   So which is what I was talking about, the 1980s.
[01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:09.000]   Now, so that's the end of the story.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.440]   You never did get a hold of him or what?
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:11.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:49:11.440 --> 01:49:11.960]   And--
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:12.760]   Aww.
[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:14.080]   That's a disappointment.
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:15.160]   I found out where he was.
[01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:16.680]   I found out what happened to him.
[01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:19.160]   Marty Rim, wherever you are--
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:20.600]   Let me look at my wall watching the show.
[01:49:20.600 --> 01:49:21.080]   He's not watching the show.
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:23.520]   I got a $20 bill right here.
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:24.440]   Bring him on the show.
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:25.360]   You come on this show.
[01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:26.360]   You're trying--
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:28.160]   --of a hundred dollars.
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:30.720]   A hundred dollars.
[01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:32.800]   No, I'm not giving him that camera.
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:35.560]   Stop it.
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:36.080]   Wow.
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:37.720]   Well, anyway, that's the story.
[01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:40.400]   And I had been trying to get this American life
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:41.680]   interested in doing the whole--
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:43.840]   I was thinking of doing the whole--
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:46.160]   what was the name of that podcast that was so popular
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:47.040]   where she chased down the--
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:47.880]   Serial.
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:48.880]   Serial.
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:51.520]   I had fantasies of doing a serial kind of thing
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:52.720]   until I realized I had enough--
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:54.920]   You should have offered Rim a job.
[01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:56.920]   So the American life didn't--
[01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:58.880]   ignored me totally until--
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:01.440]   It feels like that would be a great this American life story.
[01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:01.960]   Yeah.
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:02.800]   Yeah, they're cool.
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:05.480]   Then they finally responded to me and said, wait, wait.
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:07.880]   You didn't talk to them?
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:09.240]   That's kind of spoil it.
[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:10.480]   Yeah, ruin it.
[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:10.920]   Yeah.
[01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:12.480]   Or it makes a better story.
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:14.000]   Or it makes it a better story.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.320]   Well, it depends if you're drinking the water or pissing
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:17.320]   in it.
[01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:19.400]   Hey, yo.
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:21.600]   So Philip, there's a podcast called--
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:22.760]   It's called "Spy All."
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:23.920]   It's all section how.
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:25.040]   You know that.
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:27.440]   That dives into kind of the background
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:29.920]   and the history of things on the internet.
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:32.640]   And they would love this story.
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:33.720]   What's it called?
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:35.040]   Reply All.
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:36.920]   It's a Gimla Media podcast.
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:38.640]   Why are you sending him elsewhere?
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:41.120]   This is a podcast network.
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:44.360]   We do a podcast every day.
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:45.200]   Lots of podcasts.
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:48.680]   What I was thinking to this, it sounded like one of theirs.
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:51.200]   And it's a great--
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:52.720]   Gimla is serial, right?
[01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:54.120]   Gimla's the same guys.
[01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:55.360]   Yeah.
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:56.360]   I pissed at Gimla.
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:50:58.720]   It's NPR, isn't it?
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:00.040]   No, it's a spin off.
[01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:00.600]   It's a spin off.
[01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:02.600]   Gimla is the planet money guys.
[01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:03.720]   And they do serial.
[01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:05.680]   They do startup.
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:07.680]   They do--
[01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:08.960]   Well, startup is about--
[01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:11.200]   Story of Cyber porn, part one.
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:15.200]   I only got to listen to and help produce and take part
[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:18.120]   in the No Agenda show at noagendashow.com.
[01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:18.840]   You can do that.
[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:20.640]   Can we just concentrate on this?
[01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:22.720]   Why don't you do this story on No Agenda show?
[01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:24.280]   It's not a No Agenda thing.
[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:25.400]   You never talk to him.
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:26.560]   What is a No Agenda thing?
[01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:30.480]   Well, listen, if someone will back me, I will talk to him.
[01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:31.840]   I had no backing.
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:32.640]   Fortunately, what do you mean?
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:33.640]   You want weapons?
[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:34.320]   What do you want?
[01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:35.160]   Yeah, he wants to back up.
[01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:36.120]   What do you want to go in strong?
[01:51:36.120 --> 01:51:37.520]   What are you talking about?
[01:51:37.520 --> 01:51:40.440]   I'm talking about a sound engineer.
[01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:41.040]   Oh, I see.
[01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:43.000]   Oh, he needs a bullhorn.
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:43.520]   But you--
[01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:44.440]   Come on out, Ram.
[01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:45.360]   I know you're in there.
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:46.360]   Ram.
[01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:47.800]   I did what I can do.
[01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:48.720]   I wrote a piece.
[01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:49.520]   I'm a writer.
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:51.400]   Marty, Ram.
[01:51:51.400 --> 01:51:51.880]   Where are you?
[01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:54.400]   If he sees this, he's never going to talk to him now.
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:57.000]   It's kind of like that movie searching for JD Salinger,
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.360]   only not at all.
[01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:02.960]   Our show today brought to you by your shaving system, Harry's.
[01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:04.960]   We were talking about Harry's before the--
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:05.960]   Yeah, where's my Harry's?
[01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:07.120]   You want some Harry's?
[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:08.120]   I'll get you some Harry's.
[01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:10.800]   Get some Harry's from Mr. Devorak.
[01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:12.320]   Harry's is actually--
[01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:12.820]   Right.
[01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:14.880]   You can all go to harries.com.
[01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:17.280]   Sometimes people say shaving's not fun.
[01:52:17.280 --> 01:52:19.320]   Isn't this something you have to subscribe to?
[01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:19.960]   No, you don't.
[01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:21.960]   You can just go there and buy them whenever you need them.
[01:52:21.960 --> 01:52:24.040]   But it starts with the Harry's Kit.
[01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:25.560]   So get the Harry's Kit.
[01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:27.040]   I'll let you get the orange handle.
[01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:29.640]   Yeah, that would be the Truman.
[01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:31.680]   They have a Truman and they have a Winston.
[01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:32.840]   You got the Truman for me?
[01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:34.240]   That's the Truman, the Truman set.
[01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:35.520]   Oh, let's see what we got for you.
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:36.920]   Let's see what John's--
[01:52:36.920 --> 01:52:38.160]   This is what you come on the show for.
[01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:40.160]   By the way, I'm not going to tell John.
[01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:41.520]   This is only $15.
[01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:44.640]   And if you use the Uppercut Twit 5, it's only $10.
[01:52:44.640 --> 01:52:45.840]   Shh, it's just the best you can do.
[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:48.760]   When he sees what you get, though, he's just going to love it.
[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:52.040]   Because this-- for $10, you're going to get not only
[01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:53.640]   the incredible Harry's blade--
[01:52:53.640 --> 01:52:54.920]   oh, this is the Winston.
[01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:55.480]   It's the metal.
[01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:56.520]   I'm sorry, John.
[01:52:56.520 --> 01:52:59.560]   But you get three blades, the incredible handle.
[01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:03.120]   You also get-- and I think this is sometimes overlooked.
[01:53:03.120 --> 01:53:04.000]   Do not throw this out.
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:05.360]   This is not packaging.
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:07.360]   This is the travel cover.
[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:08.680]   So it's really great.
[01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:11.040]   You never cut yourself on the Dop Kit, right?
[01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:12.440]   Very important.
[01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:14.200]   I think this is not to be overlooked.
[01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:16.080]   Yeah, the things bounce around in your suitcase.
[01:53:16.080 --> 01:53:17.440]   Yeah, they get dull.
[01:53:17.440 --> 01:53:18.840]   You want a sharp blade.
[01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:19.400]   Cut wide open.
[01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:20.600]   Exactly.
[01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:21.960]   It also-- now you have your choice.
[01:53:21.960 --> 01:53:23.880]   They have a-- I personally prefer the cream,
[01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:25.240]   but they also have a foaming shave gel
[01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:27.800]   for those gentlemen who like a foaming shave gel.
[01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:28.880]   Would you like to shave right now?
[01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:29.720]   No.
[01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:30.760]   You have a pretty clean shave.
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:32.280]   It looks like you actually shave before the show.
[01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:33.400]   I always shave before the show.
[01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:33.920]   Yeah, sure.
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:34.440]   Nice of you.
[01:53:34.440 --> 01:53:35.760]   There are those who don't.
[01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:39.440]   There are those who like baseball players shave after the show.
[01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:41.440]   They like to play with a little bristle.
[01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:42.600]   They like to stubble.
[01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:43.920]   The stubble.
[01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:44.800]   This is $10.
[01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:47.480]   It's a great gift for dad or grad.
[01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:49.400]   Great gift for yourself.
[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:53.240]   The thing to understand about Harry's that's unique--
[01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:55.280]   the guys who started it-- and it was one of the guys
[01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:57.560]   was Jeff who started Warby Parker--
[01:53:57.560 --> 01:53:58.600]   were doing the research.
[01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:01.400]   How do you make this a better experience for people
[01:54:01.400 --> 01:54:02.720]   shaving a better experience?
[01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:05.160]   And what he found out is, well, of course,
[01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:06.920]   it comes down to the blade.
[01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:11.960]   There's two factories in the whole world in Solingen, Germany.
[01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:12.800]   Deutschland.
[01:54:12.800 --> 01:54:13.760]   In Deutsch, right?
[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:15.360]   That's where the knives are made.
[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:18.440]   The Germans make good blades.
[01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:20.840]   They bought the freak in factory.
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:22.360]   They actually went to Germany.
[01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:23.640]   And they bought the factory.
[01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:25.120]   So now you're buying-- you're in effect.
[01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:26.240]   You're buying direct from the factory.
[01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:27.560]   And you're buying from Harry's.com.
[01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:28.360]   That means two things.
[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:30.280]   First of all, they're engineered for precision,
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:33.120]   for performance, for accuracy, for sharpness.
[01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:35.200]   But also, of course, you're buying direct.
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:36.840]   So you don't have to pay those drugstore prices.
[01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:38.280]   There are no middlemen.
[01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:39.760]   Harry's.com.
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:40.800]   It starts with a kit.
[01:54:40.800 --> 01:54:41.680]   Go get a kit.
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:44.880]   Get $5 off that kit when you use the off-code to it 5.
[01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:47.000]   You don't have to subscribe, but you're probably going to want to.
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:48.840]   You can subscribe and get blades by mail.
[01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:51.840]   You can get the razor, the shaving cream,
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:53.080]   or the foam.
[01:54:53.080 --> 01:55:00.000]   They also have-- I love the aftershave lotion, which cools and calms your skin
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.560]   and makes you smell fantastic.
[01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:04.400]   You might like this, too, John.
[01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:05.920]   This is-- I love this.
[01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:07.120]   This is a razor stand.
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:08.640]   And you get that engraved.
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:09.640]   Put that right on the sink.
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:11.920]   And your razor's always upright and ready.
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:12.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:13.080]   Yeah.
[01:55:13.080 --> 01:55:13.600]   Yep.
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:13.800]   Yep.
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:14.600]   That's the way to be.
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:15.640]   There you go.
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:18.320]   Harry's, H-A-R-R-Y-S.
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:21.560]   Do they have anything for us bearded gentlemen, Leo?
[01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:22.440]   Well, now wait.
[01:55:22.440 --> 01:55:23.120]   Let me ask you.
[01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:24.600]   Do you got a shave like underneath?
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:26.320]   You don't want to have a neck-tape or a cheek in the neck.
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:26.800]   Yeah.
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:28.400]   So you still need a razor?
[01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:29.560]   Throat beard.
[01:55:29.560 --> 01:55:30.480]   Unless-- I'll do this.
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:33.720]   Are you not one of those electric shaver razor guys?
[01:55:33.720 --> 01:55:35.560]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:36.560]   That's something I need.
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:37.640]   I need electric trimmer.
[01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:39.000]   You don't have to help-- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.280]   That's to keep the beard under control.
[01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:42.320]   You're not going to use a razor for that.
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:43.840]   I don't get yelled at at work.
[01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:45.200]   You are going to like this a lot.
[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:46.200]   You yelled at it at work.
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:48.160]   You'll smell great afterwards.
[01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:50.880]   Harrys.com, off-code is Twit and the number 5,
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:52.880]   just so you know to get five bucks off.
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:53.720]   Twit.
[01:55:53.720 --> 01:55:54.240]   Twit.
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:55.240]   Twit.
[01:55:55.240 --> 01:55:56.080]   TW-I-T5.
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:55:58.920]   That's actually probably the best deal you have on the show.
[01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:01.040]   For $10, all of this?
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:02.160]   Yeah.
[01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:04.320]   $10, I buy you two blades at CVS.
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:04.800]   One.
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:05.640]   That's not even two.
[01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:07.760]   And then you get electrocuted.
[01:56:07.760 --> 01:56:09.680]   That's the Winston with the metal handle.
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:11.040]   Steve Gibson likes the Truman.
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:13.920]   He likes the-- because the metal handle is cold in the morning.
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:14.960]   He likes the plastic handle.
[01:56:14.960 --> 01:56:16.840]   And the plastic handle has a flat side,
[01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:18.360]   so he always has it in the right direction.
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:19.800]   I guess Steve-- I don't know.
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:20.640]   Maybe sheaves in the dark.
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:21.640]   I don't know.
[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:22.640]   Some people do.
[01:56:22.640 --> 01:56:24.040]   Shaves in the dark.
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:25.240]   Shaving in the dark.
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:26.520]   Yes, that's a good one.
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:28.720]   What were the chances?
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:30.160]   Hey, I promised you we'd get you out of here
[01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:31.960]   before the Niners Cowboys came.
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:32.840]   Yeah, you missed it.
[01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:33.760]   I missed it.
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:34.840]   I got a couple of headlides.
[01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:36.360]   I think kickoff's probably not--
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:37.520]   OK, we've got a couple of headlides.
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:38.120]   A couple of headlights.
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:41.440]   Chinese, Chinese police.
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:46.080]   Arrest 15,000 people this month for internet crimes.
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:46.600]   Yeah.
[01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:48.200]   So you see, you think they're maybe
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:50.160]   not paying attention to the hackers?
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:50.760]   Oh, no.
[01:56:50.760 --> 01:56:53.160]   They are paying attention.
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:55.320]   Police said in China on Tuesday they had arrested
[01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:59.280]   15,000 people for crimes that jeopardized internet security.
[01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:03.640]   Who were they doing using a VPN?
[01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:06.240]   Yeah, they were-- I'm thinking they were searching Google
[01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:08.160]   for Tiananmen Square.
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:08.680]   I don't know.
[01:57:08.680 --> 01:57:10.800]   The thing I really guess was that Falongong operation.
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:11.840]   Falongong, yeah.
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:13.000]   They look crazy over that.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:16.360]   They did not make clear over what period those arrests were
[01:57:16.360 --> 01:57:16.880]   made.
[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:19.040]   And they were just like, oh, I'm going to say,
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:21.640]   I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to say,
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:23.840]   I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to say,
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:26.840]   oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:29.640]   say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:33.640]   to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going
[01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:36.200]   to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:39.200]   to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going
[01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:41.640]   to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going
[01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:48.640]   to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going

[01:57:56.640 --> 01:58:00.640]   to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going
[01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:03.640]   to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:06.640]   to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:09.640]   to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going
[01:58:09.640 --> 01:58:14.640]   to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going
[01:58:14.640 --> 01:58:19.640]   to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going
[01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:22.640]   to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:26.640]   to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going
[01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:29.640]   to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going
[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:33.640]   to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going

[01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:42.640]   to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going
[01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:44.640]   to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going to say, oh, I'm going
