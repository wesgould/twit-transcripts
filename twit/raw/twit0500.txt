[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech.
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.200]   Well, boy, we got to have a great week at Mobile World Congress.

[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.360]   Show where we cover the week's Tech News great panel here.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.360]   Starting with Miriam Jowar, just got off the plane from Barcelona.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.360]   Thank Girl.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.360]   Who?
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.360]   Was in Barcelona for Mobile World Congress.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.360]   Madness.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.360]   And you must be exhausted.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.360]   Did you get to sleep a little bit?
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.360]   No, no, I'm not exhausted.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.360]   Yeah, I slept for one thing.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.360]   It's just a really long day.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.360]   And I slept before I went to the plane.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.360]   I slept on the plane.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.360]   You know, now I'm really happy to be here.
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.360]   It's way more entertaining than watching movies.
[00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.360]   Good.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.360]   Welcome back.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.360]   Yeah.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.360]   Nice to have you also here from the register Ian Thompson.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.360]   It's great to have you, Ian.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.360]   Welcome back.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.360]   Anything, Sloeb?
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.360]   Good to be back.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.360]   We discovered that Ian lives nearby.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.360]   I thought he lived in England.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.360]   What did I know?
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.360]   No, I've been out here for nearly seven years now.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.360]   Yeah.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.360]   Haven't said, I'm still saying gas now rather than petrol,
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.360]   but other than that, still solid.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.360]   What kind of accent do you have?
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.360]   Is there a characterization for your actor?
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.360]   Oh, probably Poshal Peaks.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.360]   I went to a boarding school.
[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.360]   Poshal Peaks.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.360]   I thought it was kind of posh.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.360]   It sounded a little Sloan Ranger-y.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.360]   I wasn't.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.360]   Oh, you take that back.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.360]   I wasn't sure.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.360]   Do I look like a where Red Trash is?
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.360]   Anyway, great to have you, Ian.
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.360]   Also, from parts unknown, from a drop box somewhere in Pennsylvania.
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.360]   Oh, and J.J. Stone.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.360]   Hello, Owen.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.360]   Oh, he's muted.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.360]   Did you mute your beats?
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.360]   Oh, there we go.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.360]   Speak to me.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.360]   Talk to me.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.360]   Oh, doctor.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.360]   I missed you on Gileo.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.360]   Episode 500.
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.360]   How can I miss you if you won't go away?
[00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.360]   This is the point I'm trying to get.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.360]   I'm trying to get on Twitch.
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.360]   I'm like a little mini Leo.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.360]   I'm going to have 87 shows.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.360]   I'm going to talk about things.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.360]   I'm going to go.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.360]   I'm going to get a hand radio and an old camera and iPad.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.360]   And I'm going to like, I'm going to register mini-tuit.com.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.360]   But you know what you need?
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.360]   You need baseball suspenders.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.360]   Bitches and catchers are reporting on my braces.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.360]   I need those.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.360]   Nice, huh?
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.360]   Especially for people with my younger age, hold up their bridges.
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.360]   Yeah, it's nice.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.360]   The bridge is up.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.360]   Nice to hold up the bridges.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.360]   So, people are noting this is episode 500 of this little program.
[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.360]   We've been doing this for quite some time.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.360]   And wondering, why aren't you doing something like, where's the cake?
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.360]   We are.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.360]   But the reason we're not doing it today is because next month is the 10th
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.360]   anniversary of the very first twit.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.360]   So, April 19th, that's when we're going to do all the celebrating.
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.360]   I figured 500, 10th anniversary.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.360]   Let's do 10th anniversary.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.360]   So, 10 years we've been doing this show, the first twit was April 17th,
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.360]   2005.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.360]   And all of the original cast members are coming back for that.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.360]   So, it'll be John C. Devorak.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.360]   It'll be Kevin Rose, Patrick Norton, David Prager.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.360]   The only person I think who hasn't committed, Roger Chang.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.360]   Roger Chang is a maybe.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.360]   He just had a baby.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.360]   So, he's a maybe because he had a baby.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.360]   Exactly.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.360]   So, that's-
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.360]   You just saw him in Barcelona.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.360]   Yeah, you know, Roger's holding out.
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.360]   I think he's holding up for more money.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.360]   You got a son of a special gift, Uncle Leo.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.360]   You got a son of that little baby rattle.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.360]   You got to entice him out.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.360]   Mm-hmm.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.360]   Some Cheerios.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.360]   There you go.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.360]   So, anyway, that's why this is, I mean, this is a special show,
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.360]   but this is why we're not doing a big party or anything.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.360]   And also, the director's chairs didn't come and the crown.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.360]   And the crown is missing.
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.360]   So, as soon as we have to wait for everything to arrive.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.360]   So, I guess we should start.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.360]   You know, tomorrow is the Apple Watch event or with something spring forward.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.360]   We'll certainly talk about that, but I think we should probably start with what happened,
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.360]   because frankly, we don't know much about what's happening tomorrow,
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.360]   but we do know what's happened in the past, and that's Mobile World Congress,
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.360]   and it just happens.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.360]   Miriam Jwars, just back from Barcelona.
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.360]   First of all, was it fun?
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.360]   It's always a fun show.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.360]   It's a busy show.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.360]   It's harder than CS in many ways.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.360]   Because you have to jump around the whole city for a lot of the press venues.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.360]   So, just like CS, you have the actual show days,
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.360]   which are not really that big of a deal for the media.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.360]   And then you have the days before the show when, you know,
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.360]   all the press conferences happen, like the Galaxy S6 launch,
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.360]   the HTC M9 launch on Sunday, March 1st.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.360]   That's the stuff you have to run around the whole city for it.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.360]   You know, that's not the only two that happened that day.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.360]   So, it's a great show.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.360]   It's really crazy.
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.360]   I had a really good time, as always.
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.360]   A lot of really exciting announcements this year.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.360]   Actually, Ian, you used to go.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.360]   You didn't go this year.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.360]   No, no, I haven't been now since 2008 since I came over here,
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.360]   but I was going back to it when it was still through GSM in Cannes.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.360]   So, it's a wonderful lot.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.360]   I remember those days.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.360]   It feels badly forgotten.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.360]   It feels to me now, like this is in many ways more important than CES.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.360]   Certainly, as mobile computing becomes more important.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.360]   And really, there weren't many cell phone announcements in January and Vegas.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.360]   Everybody said, "Well, let's wait till till March."
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.360]   Well, yeah, I mean, if you actually announce --
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.360]   so it makes sense to do that because there's so many news announcements coming out
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.360]   and CES and Mobile World Congress is the mobile show.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.360]   So, I've got -- it's a bare pit out there.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.360]   I have to say, much respect to you for doing it.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.360]   You must be exhausted.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.360]   Is the show floor is big as CES?
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.360]   No, it's probably -- I don't know.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.360]   It's probably about as big.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.360]   It's hard to tell because it's a different venue, right?
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.360]   Now, they've moved it to this new space that is gigantic.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.360]   It's bigger than the Las Vegas Convention Center, it seems.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.360]   But it probably isn't because the Las Vegas Convention Center is one of the biggest in the world.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.360]   It's big.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.360]   And you know what was interesting this year is this is the first time in many, many years
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.360]   that we've had that many launches of phones and devices at Mobile Congress.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.360]   The trend in the past few years had been for at least Samsung and HTC
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.360]   and a few of the mainstream players like LG to launch their phones
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.360]   at their own press events separately and ahead of time or after Mobile Congress.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.360]   Think Galaxy S5, think HTC One M8 last year.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.360]   They did not launch at Mobile Congress.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.360]   So, this is the kind of a return to form.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.360]   The GS2 was the last major phone that was launched at Mobile Congress.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.360]   I didn't realize.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.360]   That and the M7, actually, let me think.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:14.360]   The M7 on the One X, I can't remember, but it's been a while since the big players
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:17.360]   have launched anything major at Mobile Congress.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.360]   And I guess if you're big enough, like Samsung, that you're going to have your own events
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.360]   and the press will come, Apple is a good example.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.360]   You don't really need to be in all the noise of something like Mobile World Congress.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.360]   It's convenient for us, though.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.360]   It's very convenient.
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.360]   It's also a bit of a bio show as well.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.360]   Just as with CES, if you've got a bias tag on, everyone wants to speak to you.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.360]   And if you've got a press tag on, nobody wants to speak to you.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:44.360]   Mobile World Congress seems to be moving towards that being a bio show,
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.360]   but there's still a lot of decent tech out there.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.360]   I mean, Samsung's launch seemed to go fairly well.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.360]   Yeah, a huge improvement over previous Samsung events.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.360]   It's the biggest launch that I've ever seen.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.360]   It was massive.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.360]   I have never seen a press launch like that.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.360]   The demo room was literally thousands of people.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.360]   Wow.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.360]   Yeah, people.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.360]   They had a separate demo room for partners, which are the carriers and people.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.360]   I have never seen anything like it.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.360]   It was the biggest launch of all of the history of launches that I've ever attended.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:15.360]   And thank you, Maryam, because we used your footage from that demo room last week on to it.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.360]   We also used your footage of the M9 from their press conference.
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.360]   Yeah, I'm sorry I didn't get the chance to get you more stuff.
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.360]   That's plenty.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.360]   Those are the two.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.360]   Those are the two.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.360]   Those are the most about.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.360]   I think these are the big ones.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:31.360]   And a lot of people don't know this because I've had some people tweeting at me saying,
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.360]   "Why aren't you covering this for Twitch?
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.360]   Where's your coverage?"
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.360]   I didn't go for Twitch.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.360]   I went for mobile geek because I'm a freelance tech reporter, tech journalist.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.360]   So my gig was with mobile geeks.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:49.360]   And I know you sent Mike there and he got some great coverage for you guys too.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.360]   If you go to our special feeds, we have three full day content.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:58.360]   We have a full day coverage of day one, day two, day three on the Twitter.tv/specials.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:04.360]   And of course on our news shows, Mike was right there skyping in and stuff.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.360]   So yeah, we had a lot of coverage, but I really appreciate what you did for us too.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.360]   That was really great.
[00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.360]   Oh, no problem.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.360]   I just do a lot of these hands-on videos.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.360]   I can just wing them and put them together real fast.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.360]   I told Jason that I figured the timing would be perfect, right?
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.360]   You had your show coming up and it was later that day, basically.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.360]   Right.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.640]   So I was like, if I get the stuff and I put it in a Dropbox and the pressroom is really
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.360]   fast internet, so I could upload that in like 10 minutes, which is exactly what I did
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.360]   and all it went very well.
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:37.360]   So I actually don't think the big item there was a phone, but we're going to talk about
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.360]   that.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.760]   I think the HTC Vive might be more interesting, but let's talk about the phones before we.
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.360]   I got to try it out so I can.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.040]   I want to get your impressions, but the S6 looks pretty good.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:53.000]   I was impressed that Samsung kind of got off of its tone deaf presentations.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   They didn't have the Broadway show.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.440]   Oh, they was awful with it.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.440]   It was terrible.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.440]   It was painful to watch.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.440]   And it was also less sexist.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.720]   Actually, three of the four presenters were women or two of the three percenters were women.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:07.520]   It looked a little bit more professional all around.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.880]   And I think the phone looks better than any phone they've ever done.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.960]   It's got a glass back and front.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.960]   It looks more solid.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.600]   I'm sure it feels better too in your hand.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.600]   I love that edge.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.600]   It is.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.600]   It is beautiful.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.600]   I love it.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.080]   It is the most beautiful Android phone I've handled yet.
[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.080]   Better than the M8.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:34.240]   Better than the M8, but the M9 itself, the new one is better than the M8.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.800]   So it's a toss in terms of feeling hand.
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:43.760]   It's a toss between the M9 and the six edge in particular.
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:50.840]   But I would say that in terms of detail and design, I think the M9 still wins.
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:59.480]   But what to me brings the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 edge kind of on top in a way is
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.760]   all the other things that they got right this year.
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.560]   They seem to have just completely nailed this phone in this incredible way, which we all
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.080]   know Samsung can do if they apply themselves.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.720]   And now that they have the heat, you know, the fire under their butts, they actually are
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.720]   doing it.
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:21.600]   And it's incredible to see what they need to because the S5 was kind of a flop.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.600]   It was a turd.
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:30.000]   I've been very, very public calling the S3 S4 and S5 a turd.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:41.520]   The S2 was the last great flagship device from Samsung, and of all the note four is by far
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.600]   the best one.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.960]   Yeah, I'm carrying a note four after going back and forth for a while with all the different
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.920]   new flagship phones, including the Nexus 6, I ended up going back to the note four.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.440]   Oh, and why did you get rid of your S?
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.960]   You said you had it for a week, the S5.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.480]   Want somebody to need a phone and I buy stuff like that just to test it out.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.360]   So I was like, look, I'm not going to use it.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.160]   I took it into pool for like two days when I was with my kid.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.160]   And I took it.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.160]   I thought that was the coolest part of the phone.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.400]   Because it was the waterproof.
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.160]   Don't take the new one in the phone.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.920]   No, well, and that's the thing.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.480]   The way it felt, it felt cheap.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:15.840]   And that's the thing I didn't like about it.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.520]   Like I felt like I was going to personally break it at some point.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.240]   And then once you with the water feature, I feel like you take that back off a couple
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:26.160]   of times, get into the SD card and doing things, that seal is going to wear out on you and
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.160]   then your beat.
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.760]   So what this new phone looks amazing.
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.760]   No, it looks small though.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.400]   I don't know whose hand that was.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.400]   That was that was Mary and something.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.000]   Yeah, I think hands.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.880]   She is lady like it does look a little small.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.480]   It's only 5.1 inches.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.200]   That's for now a days that's small.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.200]   And that's funny to me.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.200]   Like it's like, okay.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.360]   I like what do you think, Mary?
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.440]   I'm edge or not?
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.800]   Absolutely for me, it's edge.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.040]   But I think it's very divisive.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.880]   A lot of people like very poor, I think a lot of people much prefer the regular Galaxy
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.640]   S6 and some much prefer the edge.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.840]   I think personally, I think the edge feels better in hand.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:10.280]   It has a bit more of that kind of sharp, not sharp edge, like the note for edge that
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.320]   was terrible, was really sharp.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.280]   This is very nice in hand.
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:19.400]   I think the Galaxy S6 for me, what I don't like it about it is that it feels, I mean,
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.400]   it feels really premium, right?
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:26.280]   Because all metal and glass, but it doesn't look that much different than the Galaxy S5.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.280]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.280]   Like it kind of look boring.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.280]   It looks in fact like it looks boring.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.280]   The S5 was uninspiring.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:32.280]   Right?
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.560]   The S6 looks boring, even though it's beautifully made.
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:40.400]   The GS6 looks boring and I guess Samsung's going for that kind of like on an inoffensive
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.400]   look.
[00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:48.080]   But with the edge, they literally, apart on the part, they really have kind of on an
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.580]   edge device.
[00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.580]   It is edgy.
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:54.600]   It feels and looks like they're really pushing the design envelope in a really significant
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.600]   way.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.600]   And it is a complete gimmick.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.600]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.960]   But there is one thing about it that's great.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:08.560]   And it's that a lot of Android apps that you swipe from this like this, from both sides,
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.880]   like the Google+ app is a good example.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.720]   And that feels so incredible with that curved screen.
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.240]   It's like a marriage in heaven.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.960]   Like it's like, wow, perfect.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.760]   Now I get why they've done the edge.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:24.600]   Do you think Samsung, so the note four or the note is on a fall release, they announced
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.040]   this note for it, IFA in September.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.680]   And presumably they'll do it this fall for a note five.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:35.080]   Do you think the note five will continue to have a removable back, removable battery
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.240]   SD card?
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.240]   Or are they?
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:43.720]   I have a feeling that they're going to kind of do, tunnel the note as a pro device and
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:50.600]   the GS, the S series as a, as a kind of like a design centric and flagship phone.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:56.880]   And as such, I totally understand their choices of removing the, like mixing the removable
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.200]   battery and SD card slot.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.560]   Look, the iPhone doesn't have removable battery and SD card slot.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.480]   That's why I carry a note four.
[00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:08.040]   Just because the iPhone has exactly why I don't carry an iPhone.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:12.040]   We're not the kind of audience that this phone is going after, right?
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.320]   Like, I have a note four and I love it too, right?
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:18.920]   But I think that you have to understand where they're coming from.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:24.440]   They're going, they're lunch eaten by Apple and others this year and they're literally
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.280]   going straight for that, for that market.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.480]   It may even be somewhat.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.480]   64 gig.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.400]   Sorry, 32 gig, 64, 128 devices, you know, right?
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.880]   Well, after you saw this, after you saw the sales of Apple, you know, they're desperate
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.880]   for that market.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:38.880]   Right.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.320]   The iPhone just blew everything out of water.
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.400]   So you need something to get a market.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:45.920]   My biggest problem when you just said the space and the phone is dedicated, we know SD card.
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.880]   I can't trust how much bloke where they're going to put on these phones.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.280]   Because are they backing off on touchways?
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.680]   They put some of these phones.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.560]   Yeah, I mean, this note four doesn't have a lot of touchways on it.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.880]   It's got a little touchways on it.
[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.200]   So this is a touch with and is still a pain in the ass.
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.200]   Never to bother.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.760]   They've bundled a bunch of Microsoft apps, which is really interesting.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.760]   Not a bunch.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.760]   Just Skype, OneNote and OneDrive, just three.
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.480]   The rumor was they were going to do a lot more than that.
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.040]   None of that matters though.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:22.200]   We're still haven't talked about where it really makes these two phones absolutely incredibly
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.760]   awesome and blow away the M9 to smithereens.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.760]   The fingerprint.
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.560]   No, no, that's that's cool because that's like Apple.
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.520]   You don't have to swipe any more.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:33.520]   That's nice.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.000]   It's the display and the camera, the camera in particular.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.560]   That display is unbelievable.
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:44.320]   If you see that display in person, you will like think you had brand new eyes installed.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.320]   It's unreal.
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:50.760]   And then, you know, just because they hadn't had enough fun yet with one of the best displays
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.840]   ever made Quad HD 5.1, the highest DPR any display.
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.720]   Well, let's curve it.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.800]   Like they didn't go 1080p for the edge version.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.320]   They went Quad HD.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.000]   They curved that display.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.840]   That is unbelievable to me.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:10.120]   Technically, like this is like their way of saying, I'm dropping the mic.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:12.760]   We've made the best display camera in the history of smartphones.
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:16.640]   I want to see SK chin drop the phone and walk off the stick.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.400]   I want to see it.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.560]   Actually, don't drop that phone because I have a feeling with glass on the front, the
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:25.520]   back and the side, that thing is just waiting to get broken.
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.800]   I mean, really, you're going to...
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.720]   The first thing they're going to tell you is this new super ultra ultra ultra.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.880]   Yeah, it's a really glass for bulletproof.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.880]   That's one better.
[00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:34.880]   And then I might...
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.880]   Everything.
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:36.880]   How is that?
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.040]   So I am kind of convinced with fingerprint reading.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.240]   I am really convinced that that's important.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.520]   I work so nicely on the iPhone.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.320]   I think it's dangerous.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:53.720]   Well, if you look at the court rulings on this, if you get pulled over by the police,
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:57.080]   they can force you to use your fingerprint to unlock the phone, but they can't force
[00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.080]   you to give a passcode.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.560]   Passward to something in your head.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.360]   Where's the fingerprint is physical evidence?
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.440]   So this is the same thing as they can.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.240]   They can require DNA.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.800]   They can't take a hair from you.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.880]   Courts have ruled that that's not self incriminating testimony.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.880]   It's a fingerprint.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.080]   It's on your finger, therefore, they can take it.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:18.680]   But the courts have ruled that something in your head, you are protected to get self
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.400]   incrimination, so they can't force you to reveal that.
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.920]   Although if you're going into Canada...
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:23.920]   Oh, they're just...
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.920]   Apparently you're screwed.
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.040]   Well, actually, if you're pulled over by the border police within 100 miles of the border,
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:35.680]   which covers about two thirds of the US population, so you've got 100 mile limit between you
[00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.920]   and the border where the border police can force you to unlock your gear.
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:41.280]   And that just happened in Canada.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:45.320]   There's a case going on right now.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:49.560]   And apparently, your privacy protections are different if you're crossing a border.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.560]   You don't have any.
[00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.560]   You have none.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.360]   So they required somebody to unlock his phone.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.880]   He said, "What in what are you talking about?"
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.880]   That's private.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.880]   And he's actually...
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.120]   He's going to go to jail, I think, because of that.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.600]   So that's something to be very aware of.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.600]   But I don't think that's going to keep me away from it.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.880]   I mean, I'm not so paranoid that I'm not going to get a fingerprint reader.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.800]   Because the cops could make me do it.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.960]   Well, I mean, if someone travels across borders a fair bit, I always carry a clean gear whenever
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:15.960]   I go.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.960]   Right.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:17.960]   When I go on the border.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:18.960]   Just don't bring good.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.960]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.800]   But, I mean, fingerprints, they're great for convenience, but I just worry about the legal
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.800]   side of it.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:23.520]   I feel like they're more secure.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:27.560]   So when I'm using this to unlock my phone instead of a passcode, I feel like that's
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.320]   more secure, it's biometric.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.040]   If it's well implemented, it's going to be safer.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:37.320]   If it's done well, the problem I have with the Nexus gesture opening is that it leaves
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.080]   finger grease on the phone.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:42.320]   If you hand your phone over to call, you've got to screw it up.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.360]   Yeah, I'm sure you've got nothing there.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.720]   Miriam, did you try the new touch fingerprint reader in the?
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.760]   I didn't get a chance to try, but from people I've talked to, tried it.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.320]   It's basically just like the iPhone.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.880]   It's instantaneous and it just works.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:21:00.880]   So that works so well that makes a big significant difference between this and the
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.960]   iPhone and the Note 4, for instance, where you have to swipe just like you did on an
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:09.000]   old Lenovo laptops and think that's kind of a, you got to do it just right.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   Yes.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   Oh, and JJ's phone.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Oh, Doc.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Yeah, let me just tell you something about this.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   I'm so sure.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.360]   You haven't watched no spy movies, okay?
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.000]   If I want your password, you have to stay alive if it's in your head.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.840]   Otherwise I cut your hands off and I take your password.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:25.680]   If they want to put it on a retinal scan, again, I'm not that worried.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:30.080]   I'm much more worried that my kids will unlock the phone than the FBI will.
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:33.960]   Depending on what somebody's got on their phone, I'm not going to say myself in particular,
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:38.520]   but I just rather have you keep me alive so you get into my phone as opposed to cutting
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:39.520]   off my thumb.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.960]   I'm just freaking decent.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.960]   I don't expect somebody to say we would go, okay.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.200]   I don't know who's listening to special skills.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.200]   Secure is in here.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.200]   This is secure.
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.200]   Oh, come on.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.200]   This is not so secure.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.200]   Anybody can get this.
[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.200]   Okay.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.200]   Hard to get up in this day.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.200]   Okay.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.200]   All right.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.160]   Meanwhile, I'm going to use fingerprint when I pay for my potato chips at Whole Foods.
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.560]   That seems good like to me.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.600]   So there's a couple of things that we should talk about.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.080]   We should definitely talk about the camera because that camera is if you think about
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:12.000]   the demo, the demo was impressive, but I never trust a demo.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.560]   They had side by side low light comparisons, both stills and video.
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.560]   It's unbelievable.
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:19.560]   And you know why?
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:20.560]   Because F over 1.9.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.560]   That's why.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:25.560]   That's the only reason it is the fastest lens on any flagship today.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.360]   There's plenty of F2 lenses.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.640]   Yeah, but that's quite a bit different.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:34.800]   If you've ever used F1.9 versus F2, you'll know the difference.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.720]   And about, you know, you're getting an extra like doubling in light.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.120]   It's unbelievable.
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:40.880]   It just makes such a difference.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:46.360]   And then on top of that, you've got OIS 16 megapixel and one of the fastest, fastest
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.880]   camera apps, like it starts in .7 of a second.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.560]   You can double tap the home key for it to start and it's instantaneous.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.240]   Like you tap the shutter button, you got a picture.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.240]   It doesn't matter what you do.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.040]   It's like they're going after Apple.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:03.800]   And it's a huge because there's a lot of phones, including quite a few Android phones, where
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.640]   you touch the button and you wait.
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.080]   It has manual controls as an option.
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:15.440]   It has tracking focus now so you can tap on an object.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:21.760]   And if the object moves like a car person, it'll continue tracking it like live in the
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.760]   viewfinder.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.760]   That's cool.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.960]   So I mean, it's really, they've really gone crazy.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:32.600]   I'm not a huge fan of Samsung usually, but I have to say, you know, the camera on the
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.720]   M9 is a huge disappointment.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:40.680]   No OIS 20 megapixels with really small pixels that are really noisy.
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:44.600]   You know, so far hasn't impressed anyone, even though the rest of the phone is gorgeous
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.960]   and wonderful.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.880]   It's like Samsung is just really nailed it this year.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:54.200]   They've done everything right, except they're not waterproof, no remote battery and no microSD.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:59.080]   But that's a small compromise in my opinion compared to all the things they nailed.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:03.440]   And I think this phone is going to sell like hotcakes and I actually think, I mean, it's
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:07.000]   not going to dethrone Apple no way, but it's certainly going to give Apple a bit of a run
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   for its money.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Isn't it close though?
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.160]   I mean, isn't it, I know Apple's dominant, but isn't Android close and isn't Samsung
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.640]   kind of close within 10 points of Apple in terms of adoption?
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.160]   I haven't looked at the name of numbers, but it's pretty close.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.760]   The Android, Marbles, Flutter, other opportunities too, that's the one thing that dilutes that
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:26.160]   whole conversation.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:30.320]   But the one thing about the camera, every time a new phone comes out, I hear how great
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:34.400]   this camera is and I read all the statistical things about how much better these cameras
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.400]   are than an iPhone.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.760]   And everybody I know that does phone camera shooting, they all use iPhones.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:44.600]   If you see anybody without one, some people buy an iPhone just use it for their camera
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.600]   for that kind of stuff.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:46.600]   That's because people are cheap.
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:47.600]   That's because people are cheap.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.760]   I'm telling people you just use their camera.
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.480]   Their quality is better.
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.680]   No one disagrees that there are better camera phones out there.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:00.240]   The Nokia 1020, I think the 1520 arguably and certainly the-
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.240]   I'm talking about for mass production like-
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.800]   Yeah, because people are sheeple.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.520]   The S5 was supposed to be a better camera and it did all that fancy stuff for it.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.520]   Yeah, I didn't like the S5.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.520]   You could take 40 pictures of the four of the three.
[00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.520]   But I like to note four.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.720]   Every time I hear stuff, I gotta get it in my hand and see it.
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.760]   I'm sure there's no fours grade for you.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:22.240]   You have to point on, I'm someone who became a blogger because of camera phones.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.960]   So I actually started writing my own blog because I was absolutely fascinated by the
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:30.480]   concept of a phone being able to take pictures.
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:35.800]   I've used every major camera phone since 2005 and I'm telling you, there's one thing
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:40.880]   that the GS5 didn't have and that many of the competing phones right now that are supposedly
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.480]   good but I don't end up being good, don't have.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.640]   And that's OIS and a fast lens.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.880]   That is a killer combo right there.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.080]   And the note for is an example of that.
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:57.560]   The iPhone 6 Plus is an example of that and we're gonna get that out of the S6 and S6
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.560]   Edge.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:02.040]   They're gonna be incredible shooters and you will see.
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.760]   I'm gonna buy one of your shooters just to try it.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.880]   Yeah, you better and then give it to me, okay?
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.760]   Because you'd always give them away a week later, right?
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.200]   I do always give them away.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:14.160]   There's several other shooters out there that are really, really quite good because of the
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.000]   combination of fast lens and OIS.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.800]   And some of the Lumias and some of the LG phones actually.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.800]   But they're crippled.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.880]   The Lumias are crippled by delay, by like...
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.400]   But Denim fixes that.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.960]   I put Denim on my 1520 and they eliminated the delay.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.920]   Denim is a lot better.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:38.360]   But on LG, the problem is the software is crap.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.360]   So like the...
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.360]   How about the Sony?
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.960]   Isn't the experience supposed to be amazing with laser focus?
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:47.880]   No, they're not because no, the LGs are the ones with laser autofocus.
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.880]   Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.760]   And that works really well.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:58.640]   The Sony's are all missing OIS which is incredible because they make the sensor in the note for
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.640]   all.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.640]   I know.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.640]   Sony makes the sensors forever.
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.040]   So, I don't get it.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.040]   I mean, I have...
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.040]   Have you seen...
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.600]   I'll tell you, Apple knows how important this is.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:12.760]   If you go to apple.com right now, front and center, this new gallery of iPhone 6 photos
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:15.280]   and they're stunning.
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.280]   They're stunning.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:19.640]   Now, and most of these are coming from social networks.
[00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.480]   Apple spotted them and added them.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.480]   And they're just...
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.640]   I mean, I've never seen these.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.640]   These are DSLR quality.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.440]   Now, some of these guys are pro photographers.
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.440]   So the iPhone has...
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.440]   And it shows you the eye is important.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.960]   But this is iPhone 6.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.960]   The iPhone still has the edge over the GS6 and the Note 4.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.920]   And that's the fact that they refuse to go more than 8 megapixels.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:41.920]   Right.
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:45.760]   That gives you large pixels that are even cleaner and less noise.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.040]   And then here's where Apple blows everyone away.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.360]   It doesn't matter how good Samsung's GS6 phone is going to be.
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.160]   The software.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:56.160]   Apple has the best camera app and camera software.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:28:00.360]   So you combine that with a fast lens and OIS and now you have a really killer combo.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.800]   I use an iPhone 6 Plus right now.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.240]   And the pictures I'm taking with it blow my mind.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.040]   They're really incredible.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.480]   And I'm a person who can take good pictures almost any phone.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.480]   And it's like...
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.920]   They make it so easy and seamless.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.120]   It's amazing.
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:20.440]   But I do think that the GS6, like the Note 4 is going to impress a lot of people in terms
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.440]   of imaging.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.280]   And it certainly sets the bar.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:30.160]   One thing Andy and I co-pointed out is that if you know what your capabilities are,
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.600]   you notice all of these are in fairly bright daylight for instance.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.640]   If you know what your capabilities are, you can maximize that one's not.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.960]   That's the Eiffel Tower.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.200]   But there's a lot of light there.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:44.080]   You can maximize the capabilities by maximizing quality of the picture by knowing what your
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:48.640]   phone's good at and staying away from the stuff maybe low light for instance that your
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.280]   phone's not so good at.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:51.280]   And that's clearly here.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:52.520]   But I have to say these are amazing.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:54.200]   We're going to take a break.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:29:00.280]   I think this...we won't know until April 10th when this S6 comes out and then we'll all
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.680]   get one and then we can fight then.
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.360]   And I want to see your pictures, Miriam.
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:09.640]   And if you show me yours, I'll show you mine.
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:10.640]   Not you, O'Dokta.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.880]   I know, Nami.
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:17.280]   He's wearing a flyers shirt, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.960]   Is that a personal favorite of yours?
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.440]   Or is it just any Philadelphia team you love?
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.960]   I have to rent Philadelphia in general.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.440]   I'm not a hockey fan.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.720]   So I just got this because I like jerseys.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.280]   So if I ever go to a hockey game, it'll be a flyers game first.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:32.800]   You haven't even been to a hockey game?
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:36.720]   No, my friends are supposed to take me, but I've been busy and it's been snowstormy.
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.280]   So I'm trying to go to a Rangers.
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.280]   You must take...
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:40.280]   You should go to a fight.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.920]   I went to a fight once and a hockey game broke out.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.400]   It was a bad joke.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:44.920]   Bad joke.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.280]   Taking a break, come back a little more.
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:47.760]   Miriam Jwars here.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.800]   Formerly of Engadget fame.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:55.440]   Now just wandering around looking for work.
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:56.440]   Is that fair?
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.440]   She's gone.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.440]   Well, we're working on Connectivity.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.440]   Now she's working on Skype connection.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:01.440]   Yeah, we're working on Connectivity.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.440]   We're working on Connectivity.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.440]   Name is Skype connection.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.160]   We will get that better.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:09.280]   Also from the register, register.co.uk, the Fabulous E in Thompson.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:10.280]   Always great to have you here.
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.400]   Oh, it's very nice to be described as fabulous.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.960]   Fabulous.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.360]   You know, Dame Enda is retiring.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.360]   There might be a place for you.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.120]   Ah, I always look lousy in makeup.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.200]   That just doesn't blick me.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:24.720]   And Owen J.J. Stone, he is oh, doctor.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.040]   And no one knows what he does.
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.040]   Something about where she's like.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.040]   Where is it going to be?
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.040]   Fresh.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.040]   Fresh.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.040]   Is that Febreze?
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.040]   You're spraying yourself with Febreze?
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.480]   Gotta stay fresh, Uncle Ian.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.040]   Not recommended.
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.040]   Or is it Windex?
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.360]   A little on my Greek wedding, my big fat Greek wedding.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.760]   Is Febreze?
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:43.760]   It's Febreze.
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.760]   Okay, just checking.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.280]   Our show today brought to you by Fresh.
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:47.840]   How did you know?
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:48.840]   Fresh books.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.960]   I know everything, Uncle Ian.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.640]   Can you smell the freshness at freshbooks.com/twit?
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.760]   Fresh books is a great solution for anybody who's a freelancer or small business.
[00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:01.720]   If you're sending out invoices, you know that it's painful.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.720]   Come the end of the month.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.200]   I used to hate that on the 30th.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.760]   In fact, I've told this before.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.000]   Forgive me for repeating myself.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.360]   But I got to the point where I just put it off until the next month and the next month.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:16.600]   I literally submitted five invoices to Rogers at once.
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.040]   And their accountant said, "What?
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.040]   What?"
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.880]   She was mad.
[00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.360]   Nice, though.
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:27.720]   And actually, that's when Amber told me about Freshbooks, freshbooks.com/twit.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:33.800]   It lets you make beautiful, professional-looking invoices and update them and send them out
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.800]   almost automatically.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:38.440]   In fact, they do have an automatic invoicing feature.
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:43.800]   If you do time in hours, use their smartphone apps on Android or iOS to automatically record
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.280]   and input them into the invoice.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:50.400]   You can use the same apps to keep receipts, take pictures of receipts, add your time and
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:51.560]   expenses.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.560]   It's so great.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.560]   Travel and expenses.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.560]   It's so great.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:56.080]   I am a big fan.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:00.200]   One of the very first modern websites I've ever used, and they've just gotten better and
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:01.200]   better and better.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:05.120]   Billing clients has never been easier.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:10.560]   And if you ever need help, great support right from their office and support is free
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:11.560]   forever.
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.480]   So, I want you to try it.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.200]   It is built for growing businesses.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:20.120]   In fact, on average, Freshbook customers double their revenue in the first 24 months and get
[00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:21.920]   paid an average of five days faster.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.600]   It's because they make it easy for your clients to pay you.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:32.080]   If you have a slow-pay client that happens, Freshbooks has automated reminders that make
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.080]   it easy.
[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.320]   You don't have to make that awkward phone call.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.320]   It is just great.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.840]   CNET says Freshbooks has a refreshingly straightforward approach.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:40.840]   I agree with that.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.720]   It's very straightforward, very easy and yet very powerful.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.480]   I want you to try it free with no obligation.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.320]   30-day free trial.
[00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.320]   Freshbooks.com/twit.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:53.200]   And if they ask you where do you hear about it, just put this week in tech.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.520]   Freshbooks.com/twit.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:59.760]   So we called Miriam back on Google Hangouts now.
[00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:00.760]   Is that what we're going to use?
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:01.760]   We're going to see how that works.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.760]   Skype is failing us.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:03.760]   Is it better?
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:04.760]   It's not pictures now.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.760]   It's good, but that doesn't matter.
[00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.200]   I want the audio to be good.
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.200]   One, two, one, two, one, two.
