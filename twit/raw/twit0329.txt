[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.680]   religiously when they're not playing Skyrim.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.120]   Joining me right now to my left, Mr. Dwight Silverman
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.840]   from the Houston Chronicle, tech blog,
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.520]   cronblog.cron.com/techblog, right?
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.280]   Yes, yes.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.280]   But it's on there on the screen.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.440]   I just had to read it.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.120]   Yes, he's also @dwightsilver.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.720]   And do you ever use Google+?
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.800]   Are you--
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.600]   Yeah, I dive in occasionally.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.720]   I've been doing this experiment while I post the same kind
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.440]   of question or link to Facebook and Google+ and Twitter
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.360]   and kind of see what the differences are.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.520]   It's been really interesting.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.640]   It's a really interesting experiment.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.640]   I don't know how much longer I'll do it.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.560]   But Google+ kind of is--
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.400]   Less relevant things.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.920]   Really?
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.760]   Thank you.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.320]   It used to be very relevant.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.240]   But I've always seen the most engagement on Facebook, right?
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.120]   You get a lot of engagement on Facebook.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.440]   I think the discussions have a little more depth
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.240]   on Google+.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.200]   But the problem is it's not a lot of normals there.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.680]   And it's a lot of techies and geeks and people
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.200]   who get really abnormal about this.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.480]   I don't care about normals.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.560]   You care about normals?
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.720]   I work for a newspaper.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.240]   I have to care about that.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.320]   That's why Twitter's never catered to the normal.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.520]   We've only catered to the--
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.880]   Here I get the opportunity to kind of exercise my geekiness.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.480]   I do geeky on the blog, too.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.960]   Also non-normal.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.120]   But they seem normal, but that don't be deceived.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.600]   Natalie Morris, Natalie Del Conte Morris, joining us
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.200]   from their mountain chateau.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.040]   No.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.600]   They're airing--
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.200]   They're not in the mountain.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.880]   Are you in the city?
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.880]   We're in New Jersey.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.840]   Technology contributor to CNBC.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.960]   Is that new?
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.440]   You left CNET--
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.720]   Yeah, it's relatively new.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.600]   You left CNET and you were doing your own thing.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.320]   But you've decided to take a job.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.040]   Yeah, I decided to take a real job, as they say.
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.360]   But I'm freelancing for CNBC.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.840]   OK.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.480]   As their technology person, joining the ranks of John Fort,
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.640]   who is their full-time technology guy.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.720]   Always great to see you.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.720]   And all the best.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.120]   And congratulations to you and Clayton.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.680]   Thank you.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.640]   Yes, I'm with Child.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.680]   Child number two.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.720]   How old is Miles now?
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.840]   He's a year and a half?
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.000]   He's about a year and a half.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.920]   He's 16 months.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.680]   So they'll be just under two.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.040]   And then I figure I might as well have another baby
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.280]   before I talk myself out of it.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.480]   Get it out of the way.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.680]   Quick, quick, quick.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.680]   You'll still be--
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.680]   One more.
[00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.520]   No more, Natalie.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.360]   You'll still be young and vital.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.680]   And you'll be ready to go.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.600]   Thank you for saying that.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.440]   Just feel that way.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.040]   I'm glad that you're a big question.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.840]   I know.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.600]   Anyway, great to see you again.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.960]   Also joining us, Veronica Belmont.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.560]   Host of--
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.880]   Not only "Texts" along on revision three,
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.440]   not only the Sword and Laser, but our new show "Game On,"
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.080]   which will debut next month on the Twitter.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.600]   Yay.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.480]   Actually, January, not next month.
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.120]   January 15th.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.360]   About--
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.120]   Yeah, I'm so super excited.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.360]   Great to see you.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.880]   Good to see you.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.840]   Thank you for having me on the show.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.240]   On the eve of your trip to Costa Rica.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.200]   Costa Rican.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.880]   I'm excited.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:52.880]   Next Saturday, though.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.360]   All right.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.760]   Got another week to go.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.880]   Week left of work.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.280]   Glad you could be here.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.520]   So thank you, Dwight, for filling up.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.360]   Because this has not been a big week.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.440]   And in fact, Tom Merritt, you normally
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.000]   does the week ahead for us every week, he said,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.560]   ah, there's nothing coming up.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.040]   It's going to be-- we're getting into the slow, slow,
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.640]   silly season as we approach the end of the year.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.760]   But there have been a few things.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.440]   I guess the big story was Chairman Genikowski of the FCC
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.640]   deciding that the AT&T T-Mobile merger wasn't going to make it.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.320]   He asked for an administrative hearing, which is essentially
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.400]   the FCC's way of saying, eh, eh, eh.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.240]   So AT&T pulled back their FCC application.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.560]   They said, well, we're going to deal
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.920]   with the Department of Justice first.
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.040]   They were also investigating.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.360]   See if we can get it through there.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.680]   Maybe we'll go to the FCC.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.240]   But I think we're getting a hint that this thing may be off
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.320]   the AT&T T-Mobile merger, because AT&T has taken a $4 billion
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.640]   right off.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.440]   That's the $3 billion cancellation fee
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.120]   that the AT-Mobile plus a billion dollars in spectrum.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.640]   I think it's all over.
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.600]   Dwight, are you shocked?
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.360]   No, I'm not shocked.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.960]   Well, actually, I'm shocked.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.440]   I thought the government--
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.200]   I thought I could never say no to anything.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.680]   Right.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.640]   And in this case, they jumped in and said,
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.320]   but the Justice Department said, well, no,
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.960]   we're going to try to stop this.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.240]   The FCC's action was largely administrative,
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.840]   but it would serve at the very least a further delay it.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.440]   And I think AT&T has got to see the writing on the wall.
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.560]   What's interesting is there's this other kind of side story
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.200]   that appeared at the same time that the FCC's story did
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:44.000]   about them offering to sell off 40% of T-Mobile's assets
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.440]   as much as that in order to get it past the Justice Department.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.600]   So maybe they're in the process of negotiating
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.600]   with the Justice Department, don't want anything from the FCC
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.440]   to essentially mess with that deal.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.280]   And then once they're hoping they can get a settlement out
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.320]   of the Justice Department instead of a trial,
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.280]   and then go back and deal with the FCC.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:02.920]   Well, I explained.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.320]   I couldn't figure out why they withdrew it.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.400]   So the idea is to let's figure out if there is a deal here
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.120]   that we can make, that we can get approval,
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.760]   and then we can go back to the FCC.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.960]   Plus, if they have a settlement with the Justice Department,
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.280]   it makes a lot more sense for them
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.040]   to then go back to the FCC and say, hey, look,
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.320]   Justice Department approved.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.120]   And that helps their case, I think.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.920]   If the Justice Department is still breathing down their necks,
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.320]   it doesn't make much sense to deal with the FCC.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:38.960]   Do you think that T-Mobile will survive
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.720]   as the number four cell phone company?
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.560]   If this thing doesn't go through Veronica?
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.720]   No, I don't think they'll survive at all.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.000]   And I'm normally not a big fan of giant mergers like this.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.240]   But at this point, there's just not enough spectrum
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:50.840]   to go around.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.040]   The government isn't releasing enough spectrum.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.040]   And so combining this might be the only thing
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.320]   that gives customers better access and will save T-Mobile
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.520]   in the end.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.800]   Is it the case that the fear is that if T-Mobile and AT&T
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.640]   merge, then Sprint is a sitting duck, that's going to go away.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.640]   And then you'll basically have two cell carriers in the US.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.400]   And that's really not competition.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:12.680]   I know.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.160]   I think Sprint could definitely be one of the casualties
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.640]   of this situation if it happens.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.440]   But they need to kind of step it up
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.520]   and work on some of their issues as well.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.240]   And I don't know.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.920]   It's definitely a huge situation going on right now.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.520]   Yeah, it's fantastic.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.360]   And I'm very curious to see how it's going to end up.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.440]   Because I mean, everyone's been having problems with AT&T
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.600]   for years now.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.520]   And I think that combining the two
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.720]   will definitely make the situation better for customers.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.960]   But there is a lot of that monopoly situation going on also.
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.840]   Any thoughts, Natalie?
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.320]   Are you a T-Mobile customer?
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.000]   I am.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   I have a T-Mobile phone.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.320]   In fact, I just ordered--
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.280]   You know, I do have--
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.040]   Go ahead.
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.040]   I do have a lot of empathy for T-Mobile,
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.120]   though, because this has put them in a holding pattern
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:54.800]   since March.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.960]   They can't really go out and make negotiations
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.400]   to get the iPhone, which would be good for them
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.960]   if and when the deal dies.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.320]   They can't go to new tablets, new Android phones.
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:07.480]   They basically are stuck waiting and crossing their fingers.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.560]   So they're kind of hosed.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:12.920]   That's, I guess, why the $3 billion cancellation
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.440]   fee to kind of compensate them for you're right.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.120]   This is a very horrible waiting period.
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.120]   With the New York Times points out,
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.160]   the New York Times points out will probably not even
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.920]   cover what their actual losses are.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.240]   I mean, this is high-end economics
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.920]   is an opportunity cost that you can't even really calculate.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.960]   It's worth certainly more than $3 billion.
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.400]   Look, with Sprint spent basically $20 billion
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.520]   to get the iPhone.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.400]   That'll give you some idea of how big a deal not
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.400]   having the iPhone is.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.040]   Also, T-Mobile has probably put aside
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.840]   a lot of the other deals and contracts
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.800]   that they could have made in this period in order
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.440]   to work on this deal with AT&T.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.600]   So anything that they could have done to improve
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.960]   their situation has been also put on hold.
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.640]   So Leo, you had suggested and Veronica agreed
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.440]   that T-Mobile can't survive.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.040]   How does T-Mobile die?
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:00.880]   What happens?
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.960]   Do they get absorbed by somebody smaller?
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.360]   Do we see Sprint and T-Mobile merging?
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.800]   Although that would be awkward technologically.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.520]   I mean, what's the in-game for T-Mobile
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.360]   if this doesn't happen?
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:15.120]   It could even be bankruptcy, right, Dwight?
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.800]   I mean, they could actually just go out of business.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.800]   Well, there's all that spectrum that they have
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.120]   that AT&T wants and then--
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:22.920]   Well, there's this--
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:23.880]   You have a fire sale.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.120]   You have a fire sale.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:25.640]   Right.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.960]   And remember, they're owned by Deutsche Telekom,
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.360]   a big company that is not going out of business.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.200]   Well, this New York Times article says
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.720]   that if Deutsche Telekom doesn't go--
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.360]   if they don't go through with this merger,
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.120]   then they're going to see Saul business in the United States.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:38.320]   Right.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.520]   And that they always spin off the unit as an independent entity
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.880]   and sell it at less attractive price to someone
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.560]   like Sprint, for example, or sell it off in pieces,
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.600]   the little bits and pieces of the company to discount.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.800]   That could be disinformation aimed
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.120]   at the Department of Justice, of course,
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.960]   because the reason this merger isn't going through
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.920]   is Department of Justice is it all will lose these jobs,
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:55.880]   will lose competition.
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.440]   So what you say if you're Deutsche Telekom
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.160]   is you're going to lose it anyway,
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.680]   you might as well lose it in this way,
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.280]   rather than where there's some benefit,
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.840]   rather than lose it because we pull out.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.680]   That's a big thing to think about.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:13.640]   Also regarding the iPhone, isn't there a technological issue
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.840]   regarding the way Apple is building it,
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:20.760]   that it's not just a matter of taking the chip
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.600]   that they have in it, the GSM/CDMA chip in it,
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.760]   and tuning it to T-Mobile,
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.720]   wouldn't they have to have a different chip
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.520]   the way T-Mobile works as I understand it?
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.520]   Oh, that's it. I do not know that, because of the FreeTays.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.960]   I think that it's not that simple.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.760]   That's why they do it this way.
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.280]   So that may be one reason why they don't have it.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:44.240]   I'm actually very curious about the notion that
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.640]   even maybe this is really speculative.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.520]   The idea of sell service is old hat
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.600]   and that we will eventually just have Wi-Fi everywhere
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:00.040]   and then anybody can play without even having a carrier.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.280]   It's VoIP everywhere. What about that?
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.240]   Is that crazy?
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.280]   That would be great.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.440]   If you're Google or Apple, wouldn't you be interested in that?
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.320]   I think municipal wireless.
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.480]   Not just mini wireless.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.320]   Partly, mini wireless, but there are two companies,
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.520]   to my knowledge, that are attempting to put Wi-Fi everywhere
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.320]   using satellite and other weird technologies.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:29.320]   If you had unlicensed internet access everywhere you went,
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.080]   you just use VoIP everywhere.
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.400]   You use T-Mobile as UMA.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.200]   You just use that everywhere.
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.560]   That was Steve Jobs' original idea,
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.760]   according to a story last week about that.
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.960]   That's what made me think about it.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.160]   Is it a light square?
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.560]   It's all one of the companies that's trying to do the...
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.560]   Light square.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.640]   Light squared is the one.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.160]   But they had problems too, because their frequencies
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.080]   were infringing on GPS.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:52.600]   Right.
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.360]   So there's a lot of technological issues.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.520]   And then, of course, Google has been trying to get the fiber thing going
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:01.760]   in a lot of places and also offer free municipal Wi-Fi
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.920]   in a few different cities.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.880]   So it's only a matter of time before that gets really kicked off
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.640]   in a lot of ways.
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.200]   I wish light squared would succeed,
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:11.000]   because I think they've got great ideas.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.920]   But it's unfortunate about the...
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:13.480]   Well, there's another...
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.560]   They didn't make the whole GPS thing into account
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.280]   when they were developing their technologies.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.280]   And you might be able to move frequencies a little bit.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.280]   I've heard...
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.280]   It's so hard to know what's going on, technically.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:25.520]   I've heard people say, "Oh, it isn't a problem.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.480]   I've heard people say it is a problem.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.200]   I've heard other companies want to come along
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.920]   and do something similar."
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:35.000]   I think that it's very possible that...
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   We just assume, "Oh, the cell system is the way it works,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.520]   and it's the way it's going to continue to work."
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.480]   All of this may be moot if it all...
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.800]   I mean, don't you think companies like Apple and AT and Google
[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:49.360]   would love to just say, "The heck with you, phone companies?"
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.200]   It's a broken system.
[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:52.400]   It's a broken system.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.000]   It's a broken system.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.600]   I mean, there's so many issues with...
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:59.280]   Brought with the frequencies and the pricing.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.600]   It's just gouging customers at this point.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.320]   I can't even believe how much you're paying
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.000]   for cell phone services days.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.360]   I mean, I think it's going to get some point
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.280]   where consumers and companies like Google and Apple,
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.200]   for example, do exactly what you said.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.720]   Just throw their hands up in the air and say,
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.360]   "This isn't working for anyone at this point,
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.440]   except for the telecoms.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.320]   This isn't working for anyone, except for the cell providers.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.040]   So then maybe we'll get a change."
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.120]   So what was Steve Jobs thinking about, Dwight?
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.720]   And is it feasible?
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.160]   Is it something he could have done?
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:31.560]   Well, I think he was doing this in supposedly
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.640]   according to the four...
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.240]   Before the iPhone came out.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:34.880]   Right.
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.400]   It was before 2007.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.520]   And of course, Wi-Fi, at that same time,
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.960]   you have to remember also that there was...
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.160]   That was the period where there was a lot of discussion
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.960]   about municipal Wi-Fi on a grand scale.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:51.040]   Remember EarthLink's attempts to be kind of the big dog
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:51.720]   in that hunt?
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:55.480]   They came into Houston and tried to set up citywide Wi-Fi here
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.480]   and kind of imploded here and otherwise.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.040]   Well, you know, I'm fighting it tooth and nail.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.000]   Verizon Sprint AT&T.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.320]   And, you know, Veronica, you mentioned the idea
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.280]   that it's broken, but the thing is,
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.360]   is that people are paying these prices.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.160]   They're buying it.
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.960]   We love our cell phones.
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.880]   We love our cell phones.
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:16.880]   It is the world.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.360]   But all it's gonna take is a better technology to come
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.960]   where we're like, okay, well, now we can have this clear quality.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.880]   Can't say that.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.160]   Clear quality.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.160]   You know, have easy access to all our data
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.760]   and make voice calls on the cheap.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.480]   I mean, I've got at home, I have a phone that's my house sign
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.840]   that runs on Google Voice.
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.760]   And I barely, I don't pay anything for it.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:36.160]   Right.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.520]   And it's just getting that to the convenience level
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.520]   of using your cell phone to be the point for where everyone's like,
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.200]   okay, well, this is obviously a better situation.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.320]   Let me get this straight.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.880]   So you don't have phone service in your house at all?
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:49.360]   No.
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.600]   You don't have an AT&T line in your house at all.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.960]   Wow.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.600]   And so you use your internet access,
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.600]   but you don't use Vonage or some specialized VoIP.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.560]   You just use Google Voice.
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:03.520]   Yeah, we have a phone that's Google Voice enabled,
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.600]   the Panasonic phone that we have.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.520]   We did a whole segment on it on the Pixel.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.800]   I think that's the future.
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.200]   The downside is it doesn't have 911.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.520]   Well, and if the power goes out or the internet goes out,
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.160]   you're screwed.
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:14.640]   Right.
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.240]   And your cell phone is not having--
[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.080]   Making allowances is not having--
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.320]   But your cell phone is a backup, right?
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:20.880]   Right, correct.
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.640]   I think this is really like cord cutting for TV.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.600]   It's the same thing.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.880]   This is what people want to do.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.080]   And this is directly in response to overpriced,
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.120]   crappy service from the phone companies and the cable companies.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.440]   Of course, you can't give both because you need your internet access for somebody.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.360]   Right, but what makes you think that Wi-Fi would not have these same problems structurally?
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.440]   See, Wi-Fi has a lot of issues technologically.
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.520]   It's hard to be ubiquitous.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.280]   It has a lot of interference issues.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:53.600]   Wi-Fi's technology would have to change dramatically
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:58.240]   in order for it to be robust enough to serve in the way on a grand scale
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.320]   that Veronica is referring to.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.000]   And you know, you kind of--
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.040]   Like just calls.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.560]   I mean, walls are in the way.
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.520]   You can't have--
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.000]   Right.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.280]   You can't have that.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.120]   I mean, I don't get cell phone service in my house either.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:13.600]   I have to have a freaking microcell in my house in order to make phone calls on my cell phone.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.360]   So, you know, we're already making allowances to get this kind of stuff to work in our homes.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.720]   I don't see why just adding a couple of routers in your home anyway
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.400]   is going to make that much of a difference.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:27.200]   Plus, broadband is becoming so much more easily accessible for people all over the country.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.080]   And it can be provided by things like fiber.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.800]   And you've got, you know, you just have to open the pipes a little bit
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.480]   and you can get a lot more access.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.400]   I don't know. It seems like a much more viable future option
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.600]   than working with what the telecom providers are giving us now.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.600]   So we're going to take a break.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.080]   For what I thought that Ymax would really be the solution and would just live from Ymax.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:48.880]   So do we all.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:54.800]   Because YFi is the weaker of the two, but that is also controlled by the mobile carriers.
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.160]   So it would just be structurally the same problem.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.320]   They're going to fight like hell to keep this from happening.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.720]   We're going to take a break.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.800]   Natalie Morris is here from CNBC.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:05.440]   I like saying that.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:11.920]   Great to have you Veronica Belmont from TechSilla, Dwight Silverman from Houston's Chronicle.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:20.080]   Did you see this story about the Chinese kid who couldn't afford an iPad?
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:25.600]   So he got all the pieces and he built a $145 iPad for his girlfriend.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.760]   Touch screen battery cobbled together parts for an old laptop.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.040]   It's running Windows 7, okay?
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.680]   But it looks a little bit like an iPad.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.840]   It even has the Apple logos on it.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.200]   Well, we have viewers who are equally intrepid.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.640]   They wanted an iPad.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.320]   They didn't have to build it from parts.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:42.960]   They tweeted.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.440]   And thanks to GoToMyPC, we have a winner.
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.640]   I'm going to tell you about this in just a second.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.120]   But let me first tell you about GoToMyPC.
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.520]   With the holidays here, lots of travel ahead, bad weather, sick days.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.040]   You don't want to be in the office.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.240]   Last place you want to be, but you might need to still get worked on.
[00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.840]   That's where GoToMyPC is so cool.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.120]   This is, I love this offer.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.800]   This 45 day free offer.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.600]   That's longer than we've ever offered before.
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.120]   Right now is a perfect time.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.440]   You can sign up now and get right through into 2012 with GoToMyPC.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.000]   What does it do?
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.560]   You put it on your office computer.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.360]   Mac or PC, it doesn't matter.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.320]   It's very easy to install.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.920]   You don't need help from the IT department or anything.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.280]   Take a 30 seconds to download.
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.440]   Go to myPC.com.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.200]   I'll tell you the offer codes.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.240]   You can get it free in a second.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:31.840]   And then wherever you go, you can access that computer.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.480]   You can send and receive me email, run any programs, access any network.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.800]   Just like you're there, even on an iPad.
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:37.840]   And the iPad app is free.
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:39.680]   This is really, really cool.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.200]   Of course, you can do it with a laptop.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:45.760]   There's a lot of devices you can use to access your office anytime you need to.
[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:46.880]   It's just a click away.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.200]   Now, for the holidays, we've got an extended offer.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.640]   45 days free.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.200]   All you do is go to the website.
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.880]   Go to myPC.com.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:01.360]   And the offer code is Twitch.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.680]   So click that try it free button and use the offer code Twitch.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:09.120]   And you'll get it free for 45 days.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.280]   Now, I have our winner.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.360]   So two weeks ago, we said we had a way for the holidays giveaway,
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.960]   a free iPad 2 to somebody.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.680]   We asked people to tweet us, tell us where they're going for the holidays.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:26.240]   Pauli, uh, Pauli Alita said with an iPad 2 and go to my PC,
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.880]   she could work while basking in the glow of the Christmas tree.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:35.360]   Conrad Farugia said he would be able to work remotely while visiting his sister in Detroit.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:40.480]   Santeevi Santiago Vargas said he would work from the iPad 2 while sharing the holidays with his family.
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:46.640]   Newfers at Newfers said his computer is downstairs, his iPad 2 would be upstairs.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.880]   And he wouldn't have to go up and down the stairs.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:55.520]   But none of them won the winner and was randomly selected by our friends that go to my PC.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.080]   From all of the tweets received.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:58.720]   Are you ready?
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.080]   I love her handle.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.720]   Cougars 1969.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.320]   Perhaps her high school football team.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:13.760]   Jessica Lure, she said she would go, she's going to Miami on vacation.
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:16.720]   She'd use it to access her work computer from Miami.
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.680]   Congratulations.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.560]   Jessica Lure, you're the winner of a new iPad 2.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.480]   Thanks to Citrix and go to my PC.
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.040]   Citrix will be in touch with you at your Twitter handle.
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.040]   And thanks to all of you for participating.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.800]   Cougars 1969.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.320]   Oh, you think it's the car?
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:30.960]   It's a cougar?
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.880]   She's the night or she a cougar.
[00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.600]   Her said, I don't know.
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.680]   I don't know.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.920]   Anyway, Jessica, congratulations.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.920]   And thanks for playing our little game with us.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.520]   We'll do that again.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:41.920]   It's fun.
[00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.680]   I love giving away iPads.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.520]   And thanks to go to my PC.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.800]   Go to my PC dot com 45 days free when you use the offer code.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:49.920]   Twit.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.320]   Black.
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:53.760]   Did you guys go Black Friday?
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:54.240]   Anybody?
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.800]   Did anybody get in line at Walmart at four in the morning?
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.040]   I was up at four in the morning.
[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.080]   Yeah, with your baby.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:00.560]   Miles.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.160]   Miles.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.520]   We'll go with my husband.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.840]   Clayton gets up at three thirty to do Fox and Friends.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:06.800]   Oh my gosh.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.640]   And he was already up and I'm pregnant.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.040]   You don't really sleep great when you're pregnant.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.360]   And we had my in-laws here, so I had a babysitter.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.000]   So he got up at three thirty and I was like,
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.200]   I'm awake.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.240]   Maybe I should just go.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:18.960]   Maybe I'm going to.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.600]   Did you go?
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:20.640]   No, I did.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.720]   I'm caught in my car and went in my pajamas.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.000]   It's quite a scene, isn't it?
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:24.640]   I've never gone.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:25.120]   My son.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:26.240]   He was dead.
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.040]   It was dead.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:27.680]   It was dead.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.040]   The stores were open at midnight.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:29.520]   Oh.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:32.000]   And so they had been open for five hours,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.520]   so there was no one left.
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.200]   And they're like, no flat screen TVs.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.880]   And I was like, that's all right.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.560]   And I ended up just buying 409.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.160]   That's all right.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.560]   But your house is clean.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:44.000]   That's true.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.960]   There were a couple.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.000]   There were some fist fights.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.880]   Yeah, I didn't even have the chance.
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.160]   There was nobody there.
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.840]   There were noble people, you know.
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.480]   I mean, you really want to play the pregnancy card when you can.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.160]   So I thought that maybe if there was a line,
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.200]   you're not even showing.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:22:59.840]   Are you showing?
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.760]   A little, a little.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.360]   They just thought she's chubby.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.280]   So you're not pregnant.
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:05.840]   You're chubby.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.200]   It's too heavy on the turkey.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.800]   Porter Ranch, Walmart,
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.280]   Los Angeles, California, two minutes before it opened.
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.560]   A mother of two used a can of pepper spray
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.840]   to attack other shoppers waiting in line.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:25.840]   She was trying to get the $100 discounted price on an Xbox 360.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:29.920]   She had her children with her.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.960]   She began spraying customers as soon as the store employees
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.800]   started pulling back the packing plastic off the discounted items.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.200]   Once the doors opened,
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.240]   the woman also used the pepper spray to gain a favorable position.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:46.080]   Oh, this is disgusting.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.600]   Customer.
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.520]   Somebody tweeted during this.
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.880]   Of course it was on Twitter, right?
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.880]   People are screaming.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.360]   The LAPD and firefighters responded,
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.200]   treated 20 injured customers.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:05.360]   The woman fled the store unclear whether she got the Xbox.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.080]   No, oh my God.
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.200]   That's the best line.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.320]   So did they arrest her?
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.600]   The police?
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:14.320]   No, they didn't find her.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.600]   They were looking at surveillance footage to try to figure out who she was.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.000]   So people in the chat room are saying she turned herself in later,
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.360]   but I didn't see that in the story.
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.040]   Unbelievable.
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:23.680]   Really?
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:28.800]   Police had to use a stun gun on a shopper because he was getting in fights with other customers
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.920]   over merchandise in Smirtle Beach, South Carolina.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.520]   Two customers suffered injuries during an armed robbery attempt.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.760]   It's crazy.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:38.880]   And by the way,
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.680]   Cara Swisher, who was here last week, said,
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.360]   "I've been covering retail for years.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.520]   The biggest shopping day of the year is not Black Friday.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.840]   It's the last Saturday before Christmas always has been."
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.560]   Right.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.120]   That makes a lot more sense.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.480]   Somebody made this up.
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.920]   They made it up.
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:59.600]   And people get trampled to death and people get pepper sprayed and people get injured every
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:00.240]   single year.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.280]   I don't understand.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.400]   What is the cost benefit analysis to Black Friday?
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.320]   Like are these stores actually making any money?
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.680]   No, I blame Walmart.
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.640]   Having these deals?
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.680]   Blame Walmart.
[00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.600]   They're the ones that are creating this frenzy.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.120]   Opening it, you know, midnight or four in the morning or whatever.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:16.400]   The whole thing is ridiculous.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.440]   And you get some pissed off employees.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.200]   This is my second time being there.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.320]   And they don't want to be there.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.800]   They look at you like they absolutely loathe-
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:25.520]   They blame you.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:27.680]   How dare you come here.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:32.400]   Make me get up at three in the morning to sell you some slippers for $2.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.680]   Hate you.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.120]   It's not the Christmas spirit.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.480]   So it's an anti-haul experience.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:46.640]   Brian Lamb did a post at the Wirecutter about when the real best days are to get
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.960]   deals both online.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.560]   I think the deals are very good.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.080]   I mean, we are seeing good deals, right?
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.280]   I mean, these aren't real deals.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:53.920]   Well, I don't know.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:54.960]   You know, I was looking at them.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:59.520]   For example, we have fries here like there are in a lot of other places.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.920]   And I was looking at those deals.
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.760]   And they didn't look that much different from the deals you get at fries,
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.760]   you know, on any given weekend when they have their regular sales.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.520]   I mean, that Xbox deal was pretty good.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:12.480]   A hundred bucks.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.040]   So it was what-
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.320]   That was a pretty good deal with a few games.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.120]   I think you wanted it.
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.960]   Me?
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.560]   I already have an Xbox.
[00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:19.200]   All right.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.480]   You can always have another.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.960]   That way you can play Skyrim in all the rooms.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.680]   Now, are you playing Skyrim on PC or Xbox?
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:26.080]   PC.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.080]   Do you think that's a better experience?
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:32.000]   Well, I think that Skyrim, you know, the consoles are just ports.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.520]   I think it was meant for PC.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.880]   Actually, I think it's the other way around.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:40.800]   I'm not sure, but somebody was telling me in the chat room that Bethesda developed for the Xbox first.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.480]   That's not my understanding, but I guess I could be sure.
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:44.640]   You know what?
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.080]   This is something for Game On.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:51.360]   You got to get the- I have to say, even if you don't game, and I know Natalie's going,
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.880]   I don't- this is stupid.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:58.640]   Even if you don't game, I am blown away by the amount of creativity and artistry.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:03.520]   And the- for 100 people worked for three or four years on this game.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:10.320]   And the textures, the landscape, the open environment, the music.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.600]   This is unbelievable.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:19.040]   They did a whole video about the music of Skyrim, and the words that they sing in the Skyrim theme
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.760]   are actually words in the language that they've even read.
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:26.800]   It's in the dragon language, which is being sung by these monks,
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:31.600]   and it was like 30 guys, and they multiplied it by three, so it sounds like 90 guys.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:32.080]   Yeah.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:37.840]   And it's just an unbelievable amount of work that they put into the audio and into the soundtrack.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:42.320]   And it's definitely one of the most ambitious games that's been created in the past 10 years.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:48.480]   Although I- as good as it looks and as good as it feels, it doesn't seem that different to me,
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:53.040]   even with the new creation engine, then fall out new Vegas or fall out three or even with-
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:54.480]   It's very fall out like it's very-
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.000]   Because it seems more like fall out three to me almost than oblivion in a lot of ways,
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.960]   especially with the critical kills and the little things they do for that,
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.040]   the close up shots during the kills. It's very-
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:05.600]   It's slow motion.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:05.600]   Very fast.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.120]   The voice acting.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:12.480]   They improved all the NPC voice acting and close up shots, so I appreciate that in a big way.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:16.560]   There's some good actors on this. In fact, right at the beginning, and I know they do this on purpose,
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:21.120]   right at the beginning, one of the guards is that guy from Battlestar Galactica.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:23.440]   Yeah, Ty, Colonel Ty.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:23.600]   Ty.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.760]   He has such a distinctive voice. You know, immediately it's Colonel Ty.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.120]   He's in a lot of video games.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.320]   He does a lot of voice acting work.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:28.880]   I love it, though.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.000]   For good reason.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:30.560]   Right.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.880]   He's distinctive. He's a good actor.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.800]   Voice acting is usually pretty bad in these, so it's not a high bar to-
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.200]   I don't know. The voice acting in Fallout New Vegas, Old World Blues was pretty good.
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.160]   She really had me.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:42.720]   I do say so.
[00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:47.680]   You play far more games than I do, but I just have to say the depth of this game
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:52.560]   and how gorgeous it is really makes me think the video games have come of age as a creative
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:54.080]   pursuit.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.040]   They're an art form.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:55.520]   Absolutely.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.800]   They're absolutely an art form.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.720]   We have to be real.
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.520]   I apologize.
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:00.960]   So Veronica-
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:05.440]   I wanted to know that the Black Friday deal was $10 off of Sky Rim at Target.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:07.440]   See, so 50 bucks instead of 60.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.000]   Big deal.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   That's kind of a big deal.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.200]   That's a hot game, though.
[00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.080]   So Veronica-
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:14.720]   50% did.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.240]   If I could do that in my head quickly.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.600]   It's 1/6.
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:20.960]   1/6.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.080]   What is that? 13%.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:22.480]   I don't know.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:27.920]   So Veronica, a question about voice acting, because you've done some.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:33.200]   Why do you think voice acting in games is just usually really bad?
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.000]   I mean, why should it be different from say cartoons?
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:42.480]   I think the main reason is one, because until recently they haven't hired a good number of
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.840]   voice actors for each game.
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:48.000]   So it's usually been a handful of actors doing multiple parts.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.040]   So I think in Oblivion, for example, they had-
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.840]   There were like-
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:54.240]   60.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.840]   I think they said 60 voice actors.
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.440]   No, I think actually-
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:57.440]   More?
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.400]   In Sky Rim, there were 70 voice actors.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:00.400]   Okay.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.280]   But there were like-
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:01.840]   I don't know about Oblivion.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:04.480]   Twice that many parts, or maybe three times that many parts.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:09.600]   So it worked out better than it did in Oblivion, where there were fewer voice actors for more parts.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.760]   So now they're getting a lot more-
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.440]   They're getting a lot more-
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.720]   What's the word?
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.720]   A lot of different voice actors doing different parts.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:19.200]   Variety.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.960]   You couldn't think of that word for some reason.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:21.600]   Variety.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.640]   There's a lot more variety.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.360]   They have a little more time to get it all done.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.040]   Usually games are a lot more rushed.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:30.160]   They're not doing that quick cycle that they used to in a lot of-
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.480]   Like they've been working on this game for many, many years now.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:37.920]   So they've had a little bit more time to kind of really fine-tune the voice acting and the sound
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:38.960]   creation that they've done.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.720]   There was another reason too.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:47.200]   I mean also voice acting looks bad because the AI and the lip sync with the characters
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.040]   never looked as good as it does now.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:54.560]   So there's a lot of reasons both technologically and economically that this is getting easier and better.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:58.720]   You know, radio acting used to be-
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:30:59.040]   Remember-
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.000]   Remember Dwight when radio-
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.320]   No, I'm not at all-
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.720]   Radio acting used to be really bad.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:11.360]   It was very broad and I think that that's the sign of a new medium a little bit.
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.800]   And I think voice acting is tough.
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:17.520]   Cartoon is a little different because it's a character voice.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.000]   I don't know.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:18.560]   I just-
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.760]   I think it's a hard thing to do.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.640]   Well, the same thing happens in cartoon acting.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.000]   You have multiple people.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.520]   One person doing multiple-
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:25.920]   I agree.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:26.400]   Roll.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:26.960]   Yeah.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:27.360]   But I-
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:28.000]   But I think-
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.200]   I think Veronica's right.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.120]   I think it's rushed and it's quick.
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:34.160]   And my suspicion is that in the past it's been-
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.920]   Oh, this is just a game.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:39.360]   And I don't have to bring my full game to the game.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:39.920]   You know?
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.880]   A level of-
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.040]   A level of-
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:41.360]   I think-
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:41.360]   A level of-
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:41.840]   A level of-
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:42.000]   A level of-
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.120]   Or taking it more seriously.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.040]   The level of immersion too.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:49.680]   I mean people expect to be fully immersed in these virtual worlds at this point.
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:54.160]   And so to have bad voice acting, it really takes you out of that moment in a lot of ways.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.440]   If you wanted to be realistic,
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.960]   you want the voice acting to look right, to sound right,
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.760]   to feel like you're having a conversation with an actual person,
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.080]   as opposed to just kind of set dialogue.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.480]   I don't want to get in a big long discussion of video games.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:10.000]   We will move on in a second, but I can't help it.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.880]   One of the things that's changing is in oblivion-
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.480]   And this has to do with the voice acting.
[00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:19.200]   When you talk to an NPC, a non-player character,
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.240]   it would kind of zoom in in their face and you couldn't move around, look around.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.280]   You had to watch them.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.520]   Now in this game, it's kind of wild.
[00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:28.400]   You can look around and you can even walk away and they'll still talk.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:31.840]   And they'll drift off in the background as you walk away from them.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:36.640]   Which is intensely satisfying when somebody's going on and on,
[00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.080]   you're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm going to leave."
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:40.720]   And you walk away and they keep talking.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:41.440]   It's pretty funny.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:46.480]   And I think that it's things like that that make it feel like a more realistic experience.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.960]   So even if the voice acting isn't better, which I think it is,
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:54.320]   but even that it's just a more realistic overall experience that helps that, I think, a little bit.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.280]   You don't have- you know, I like-
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.680]   focused in on the person in all that.
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.600]   Game on, premiering January 15th.
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.160]   Yeah, please.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.160]   This is where we'll discuss all that stuff.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:06.720]   But I think it is actually a news story.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:10.640]   First of all, because it came out at the same time as Modern Warfare 3.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:14.320]   So it was up against the biggest franchise in gaming,
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:20.320]   which in the first 24 hours sold $400 million worth of units.
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:20.960]   I mean, it was huge.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.720]   It was going to be a billion dollar game.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:27.200]   And I think Skyrim although hotly awaited and everybody had high expectations for it,
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.600]   kind of stole Modern Warfare's thunder a little bit here.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.040]   It may be different audiences too.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:37.120]   I definitely know people who, like at my house, for example,
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:41.520]   Ryan's been spending almost as much time playing Modern Warfare as I've been playing Skyrim.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:43.920]   So it just goes to show, you know, if you're passionate about a game,
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.520]   you're going to put that effort into it.
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.000]   True.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.840]   So I think that there is overlap for sure, but there are definitely different markets.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:34:01.440]   I'm just very intrigued by the artistry, the obvious clear talent in story, in art,
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:06.560]   in acting that goes into a game like music, that goes into a game like this.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.760]   It's really mind boggling.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:10.000]   These are absolutely art forms.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.200]   And I'm very excited as the technology advances.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:20.160]   The problem is they're using now, you know, relatively ancient hardware on the Xbox
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.200]   and PlayStation through what is it?
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:24.240]   Five years old now, hardware on these things.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:29.600]   And although I have to say the PC version is not to me much different than the Xbox,
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.920]   or I haven't seen the PlayStation for three version, but they're very similar.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.000]   The reason people ask me, why do you like the Xbox better?
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:36.960]   And I'll be playing it on both.
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:41.360]   I like the bit watching on a 15-inch display with, or 16-inch display with my feed up.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.000]   That's all.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.480]   So I need to be in my in my lady den.
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.400]   You like to be focused on the screen.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.680]   My lady cave, I call it.
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:48.480]   It's not a man cave.
[00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.840]   It's a lady cave.
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:50.640]   That's where I have to put it.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:51.920]   You got to lean into a game.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:52.400]   Really?
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.200]   Particularly one.
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.000]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.440]   I think it's a lean-in experience.
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.400]   I don't think it's a lean-in experience.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.800]   No, I'll tell you why I like it.
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.640]   Because I darken the room, this game is scary.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.000]   Stuff happens that you jump.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.440]   There's a lot of emotion.
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.720]   Battles are hairy.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:10.160]   It is a very, and I'm sure there's true modern warfare three many games nowadays,
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:14.880]   really are emotional, which is I think a testament to the realism that's going into these games.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.640]   And then if it's in a darker room on a big screen,
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:20.960]   it's your heart really can really pound on these things.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:21.920]   And it's very exciting.
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:24.080]   I have a cave.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.080]   It's called a barrow.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:30.240]   Anyway, it's my ghost cave.
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.880]   Online spending on Black Friday, up by 24.3% of her last year.
[00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:39.840]   Online Thanksgiving day was the big day.
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.280]   It was up 39.3%.
[00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.480]   I guess because stores started their deals early.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.880]   Amazon's been offering deals all week long.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.480]   Amazon wireless, for instance, offering cell phones for a penny,
[00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.320]   everything but the iPhone for a penny.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:58.400]   So I think if you, if, if, why wait and line, go online and buy,
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.880]   then no clerks will be discomforted.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.520]   I'll talk about a baker.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:04.240]   No pepper spray.
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:05.280]   No pepper spray.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.120]   We'll talk about pepper spray.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:07.440]   Spray.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.240]   No, you're meme.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:13.520]   And a baker who's very sorry, she did a group on deal in just a moment.
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.840]   But right now I want to talk about Epson.
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.720]   These are my, I was really happy when Epson said,
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.800]   we were thinking about doing some advertising on Twitter.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:21.840]   I said, let me tell you something.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:24.640]   I have been, I even made a video.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:30.160]   I have been, I just want to give you a tour of, of my house and my, and my studio.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.280]   Epson's everywhere.
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:36.480]   The printers for photo printers, I use the big carriage 14 by nine inch,
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.840]   14 by 19 inch Epson.
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:41.280]   Beautiful photo printers.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:43.680]   I've used the Epson art as in a home for years.
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:46.640]   Epson projectors for business and the big movie projectors.
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.680]   I love Epson and they've got a great printer now.
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.560]   And they, I was just thrilled to be able to talk about it.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.240]   And now, but I have to question their strategy on this.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.240]   They want to sell this printer for the holidays.
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:05.120]   The idea is that you will, okay, you've got, I'm going to read you this.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:08.160]   Most of us have tech gadgets on our shopping list to give friends, family,
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.720]   and coworkers plus new gadgets for our businesses.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.240]   What?
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.040]   Do you have, do you have a shopping list for your business?
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.000]   I guess, you know what?
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:16.560]   That is true.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.680]   It's not the holidays it's doing.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.200]   It's the fiscal year.
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.000]   You want to spend this so you get the tax credit next year.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:22.960]   Maybe that's what it is.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:27.040]   So if you are, if you are spending for the holidays on your business,
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.960]   this is the printer you want.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.120]   It's the Epson workforce pro.
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.480]   We got one for the office.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.400]   Lisa immediately stolen.
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.000]   She's got it.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.520]   And I liked it so much.
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.600]   I've actually gone out and I bought one for my house.
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.680]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.440]   We had it.
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.640]   We, as I said, we had an artisan, but the kids print a lot.
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.880]   You know, when you're in school, you print a lot.
[00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:53.360]   And I really needed something that had a big paper.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:38:00.160]   Reservoir had a big ink reservoir, but mostly that could cut the costs of printing down.
[00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:06.480]   And this is an amazing printer, the workforce pro 4530.
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:10.240]   First of all, double-sided, which makes things look better.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.200]   It looks more professional.
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.000]   It looks like a book.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.080]   There's printing on both sides and it saves paper.
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:18.640]   It's the fastest automatic double-sided printing anywhere,
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.040]   copying, scanning, and faxing to.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.640]   I use it for the fax machine occasionally.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.640]   He's doing the send faxes.
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:31.360]   It has a, it comes with standard paper and extra paper tray for 580 sheets,
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.720]   more than a ream of paper.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.040]   The cartridges are very big.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:39.280]   In fact, the black and white cartridge goes for 2500 pages.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.200]   That's unheard of.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:45.680]   And as a result, it is 50% less per page than a color laser.
[00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:49.120]   These guys have made an amazing printer.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.560]   This is for your office.
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.600]   Before you look at any other printer, I want you to go to the epson workforce pro.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:56.080]   You can go to epson.com and take a look at it.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:58.480]   It is an amazing, fantastic printer.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:38:59.440]   And I'm a huge fan.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:03.600]   And obviously, so is Lisa, because she immediately took ours and put it in her office.
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:08.960]   Four pages in 19 seconds, 50% less expensive, double under the ink.
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:12.080]   Plus, of course, you'll save on paper too with double-sided printing,
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:13.760]   half the cost.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.840]   It's easy to use controls.
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.920]   It's Wi-Fi and ethernet.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.440]   Look at the size of those cartridges.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:23.840]   And if you need one more thing, it prints from your iOS devices.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:27.040]   Automatically, you don't need any of the extra software.
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.520]   You just select print, choose the printer.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.200]   It's there on the Wi-Fi network.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.560]   It will print to it just like that.
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:36.160]   The epson workforce pro, check it out at epson.com.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.680]   When they said, "Would you do an ad for epson?"
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:39.360]   I said, "Well, I do an ad for epson."
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.760]   Yes.
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:47.600]   I've been using epsid forever and ever, and I'm so happy to have them on the show.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:48.400]   Thank you, epson.
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.360]   And happy holidays.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.760]   And yes, buy your business a printer for Christmas.
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.080]   Does that make sense?
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:59.040]   Every business needs a Christmas gift.
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:03.360]   Actually, Veronica, I guess we should get one for these guys too.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.520]   We've been thinking about our host gifts.
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:07.120]   Welcome to the Twit family.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:07.840]   Thank you.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.280]   Every year we give a host gifts.
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:11.200]   You missed the fizzes last year.
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.240]   We gave everybody fizzes.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.280]   This year--
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:14.480]   I didn't get a fizz.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:14.720]   What?
[00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.440]   I did not get a fizz.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.680]   Well, it was kind of the staff host.
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:20.960]   You've been on so much.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.000]   You really are family.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.480]   Natalie and Clayton too.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:27.920]   So maybe you could find an old fizz and send them fizzes,
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:31.680]   but then the rest of the outfit is going to come today, this year.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:32.640]   And you're going to get it too.
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:34.400]   That's all I'm going to say.
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.320]   And like presents.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:36.800]   Presents.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.480]   I just--
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:41.760]   Well, we've been agonizing because the fizzes were such a great gift last year.
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.080]   I didn't know what we were going to give our hosts this year.
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:44.800]   And I found it.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.560]   He had a fabric, I thought, at one point.
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:46.960]   He did.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:50.560]   He can't make any more of that exact kind because he found that fabric.
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:54.560]   Like he found a bolt of it somewhere and they're not making any more.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:55.680]   It's a beautiful velvet.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:56.080]   They're really nice.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.920]   Do you go to a special habodashery?
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:40:58.320]   We do.
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.760]   Fezzorama.com.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:00.800]   Fezzorama.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.480]   And he ran out of the fizz material?
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.480]   What kind of businesses he running over there?
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.520]   For our fizzes.
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.240]   He's actually--
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.520]   You know, this guy is interesting.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.240]   He's a customer.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.960]   He teaches costuming at a big--
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.160]   I can't remember the name of it--
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:16.880]   place in LA, a very big school, design school in LA.
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:19.120]   Fezzorama, they do velvet fizzes.
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:23.280]   But our twit fizz had a particular color that he doesn't have anymore.
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.160]   I think.
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:24.800]   Oh, thank you.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:25.360]   Gotcha.
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:26.240]   Oh, there it is.
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:28.000]   Yeah, this was a very special fizz.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.440]   He says here limited edition.
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.920]   It's the slate blue profile.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:34.720]   Oh.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.840]   I'm-- I have a-- he gave me a special chief twit, Fezz.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:38.400]   That's tall.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.320]   So I guess I still do have him.
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:45.280]   So we'll order a few for you guys to go with the rest of the outfit.
[00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:50.960]   And for you, Veronica, a special dragonborn sword.
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.800]   She's having--
[00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.200]   Do you-- do you-- you got the dragon sword, right?
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.400]   The dragon's bane.
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.520]   Dragon's bane.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:02.240]   Does 25% extra damage against dragons?
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.440]   So here's the thing.
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.200]   Should you go up to the dragon and hit it?
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.720]   Hit the crap out of it.
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.600]   That's stupid.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.160]   Doesn't it just go inflamed?
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.080]   So you use some anti-- you know, some--
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:12.640]   Oh, you have to have--
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.560]   --prestance potions or whatever.
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:15.360]   See, I like rain.
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.560]   I don't want to get close.
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:19.920]   I just shoot like a lot of arrows or a fireball in from afar.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:20.640]   Okay.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.440]   You go right up--
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:22.080]   Take the mains.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:22.960]   It takes a long time.
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.400]   You go right up to the dragon you hit it.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:28.400]   Oh, if you have the dragon spain, you dual-wheeled swords,
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.720]   chwads, it takes a long time.
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:31.760]   Do you hit it on the nose?
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.160]   Wherever.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.480]   You want to stay away from the tail and the head, generally?
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.520]   Ah, you want to--
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:37.840]   Okay.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:38.640]   --generally speaking.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.240]   I prefer just--
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.360]   The business sense.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.720]   Stay away from the business sense.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.880]   Just call me Death from afar.
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:47.280]   I ain't going near that dragon.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.000]   You are amazing.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.040]   I want to watch her play.
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.480]   We've been doing this lately.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.520]   Yesterday, Brian played Star Wars the Old Republic.
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:55.520]   We've been doing this lately,
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.520]   where you play a game on the Twit stream,
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:58.560]   and I was playing Skyrim.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.920]   I want to watch you play.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.120]   Sure.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.800]   Your 23-level high elf.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.160]   Mage.
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:04.800]   Dark elf.
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:05.360]   Dark elf.
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.400]   Destruction mage.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:09.920]   We'll figure it out.
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:10.640]   We'll make it happen.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.000]   It just sounds so pathetic.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.440]   I have totally taken over the Twit path talking about video games.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.400]   I love it.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.520]   No, I love it.
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:18.160]   I just--
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.680]   You're encouraging me.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.200]   Groupon, there's always been this debate,
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.760]   whether Groupon is good or bad for retailers.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.520]   And I guess it could go either way.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:26.800]   A lot of retailers say,
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.080]   "Well, we do a Groupon deal,
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:29.520]   and we get a lot of customers from the deal,
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.800]   but they never come back."
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.240]   Others say, "No, this is great.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:33.360]   It's been the best way."
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:34.880]   And I think a lot of it has to do
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:36.800]   with not only the product,
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:37.840]   but how you do it.
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:42.480]   So there's a baker named Rachel Brown.
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:46.320]   She owns a small bakery.
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:47.440]   This might have been her mistake,
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.600]   called Needed Cake Bakery.
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.400]   And there she is.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.440]   Oh, she's so sweet.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:00.240]   She did a Groupon deal where it was like 75% off.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:02.400]   And I don't know what she thought.
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:05.360]   She thought maybe a few hundred people take advantage of it.
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:08.960]   It's in a Reading Berkshire in England.
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:12.480]   8,500 people ordered cupcakes.
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:18.800]   She has had to make 100,000 cupcakes.
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:24.320]   And she's-- because she's losing between two and a half and three pounds in every batch,
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:29.360]   she's also had to hire extra staff to send out the--
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:32.320]   she basically wiped out her entire year's profits.
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:37.760]   It's my understanding that you're supposed to be able to set sales limits
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.840]   when you work with Groupon.
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:43.280]   And Groupon should have some responsibility
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:47.360]   to make businesses aware of this kind of thing that can happen
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:48.240]   when you sign up,
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:50.640]   because it doesn't make them look good at the end of the day
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.160]   when orders can't be fulfilled.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:55.360]   And when customers are mad that the quality they're expecting
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:57.920]   isn't on par with what they're ordering,
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:02.560]   because if she has to hire outside contracts to help make these cupcakes--
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.280]   Okay, that's wrong.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:06.480]   --and they're not as good as what she normally makes in her shop,
[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.480]   then everyone is losing.
[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.640]   Groupon looks bad, she's looking bad,
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.960]   customers aren't getting what they wanted and paid for.
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.880]   It's just a bad deal all around.
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.200]   The Groupon eventually put a message on its site saying--
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:20.240]   The quality control, I think, was the big issue here,
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:22.720]   where she said these people have never been trained by me.
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:23.920]   They don't know the recipe,
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:26.800]   they don't know how to decorate my cupcakes the way I normally do.
[00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:31.440]   So even if she would have otherwise been gaining repeat businesses,
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:34.320]   maybe the cupcakes were not quite as delicious
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.080]   because they were not the normal cupcakes.
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:37.440]   A hundred two thousand cupcakes.
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.000]   So she's not even really gonna get any kind of loyal customers
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.480]   unless the new people made good cupcakes.
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.800]   But then they wouldn't come back for those cupcakes.
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:45.600]   Who wouldn't do this?
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:49.360]   She was offering a dozen cupcakes with a choice of flavors and designs.
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:54.480]   Normally, 26 pounds, which is what, $35, $38,
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:58.800]   for six pounds, six and a half pounds, for like 10 bucks.
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:01.040]   Who wouldn't do that?
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:03.760]   A hundred and two thousand.
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.360]   You know how you would do that?
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.880]   She looks like a nice lady.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:07.920]   She does.
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.160]   Probably someone who she knew.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.760]   She looks like she's working in her kitchen.
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:12.560]   She's great.
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:13.760]   She's a good young group.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.120]   She just thought it was a good idea.
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:17.200]   Was this an online order?
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.240]   Or did you have to walk into her store to do it?
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:23.520]   It looks, it must have been to have had 8,500 orders.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.440]   It must have been online, right?
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:27.760]   Anyway, you know what?
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:29.920]   I bet next year she's gonna be huge.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:34.400]   Because look at all the publicity she's getting.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.480]   So at least she's getting that, I guess.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:37.360]   She's getting something for it.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.840]   I just think it's an interesting story.
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.920]   Yes, it is her fault at the end of the day.
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:42.920]   But I think group-
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:43.360]   Group-on-ship protect.
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:45.520]   Have some responsibility to protect the people
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.440]   that they're working with in some regard.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:49.360]   At least make them aware of what can happen.
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:49.760]   Right.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.480]   It seems like it was someone who said,
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.840]   "Hey, this is a cool thing.
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:54.720]   You should do this."
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.200]   But didn't really walk her all the way through it, poor thing.
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.280]   So she was like, "Oh, let me sign up for this."
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:03.040]   And maybe she was left alone to her own devices and didn't.
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:07.600]   On a side note, now I would like some cupcakes, please.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.680]   Is that what happened to Cake Baby and Bridesby?
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:10.960]   No, I'm hungry.
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:12.800]   Is that what happened to Cake Baby and Bridesmaids?
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:14.400]   Is that why she went out of business?
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.600]   I think it was just a recession.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:16.960]   I think she just went out of business.
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.640]   So Craig-
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.560]   Did she blame to her ex-boyfriend in the week?
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:21.360]   She had a bad ex-boyfriend.
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:25.280]   With the ex-boyfriend who was helping her run the business,
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:26.960]   but wasn't so great at business.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:27.360]   Right.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:28.720]   He probably did a group-on deal.
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:31.520]   Craig Munday of Microsoft,
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:34.800]   he's their chief research and strategy officer, said,
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:38.720]   "Eh, Siri, no big deal.
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:41.200]   We've been doing it for years on the
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.000]   Windows phone with Tell Me."
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   So it's actually very funny.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.800]   An Australian blogger did a video where he actually talked to both his
[00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:55.520]   Windows phone and his Siri phone at the same time.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:56.640]   And it was almost comical.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:59.440]   It allows each other to have the Windows phone.
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:02.640]   But I want to say it was also unfair because there are things the Windows phone will do
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:03.520]   that Siri won't do.
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:05.360]   You can launch an application with Windows phone.
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:05.920]   Mm-hmm.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.680]   That drives me crazy.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.920]   So it's not really fair.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:10.960]   There's different commands.
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:15.200]   So Leo, have you played with Dragon Go?
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.480]   No.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:17.360]   This is on the iPhone?
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.520]   This is an app for the iPhone.
[00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:21.200]   And it's interesting.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:27.680]   It's a, you know, Dragon's nuances of speech recognition technology is part of Siri.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.680]   Don't say Dragon because Veronica's doing the Siri.
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.880]   I know this is writing in chat.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:31.600]   It's like she wanted to tell us.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:32.080]   She wanted to tell us.
[00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:36.000]   I have a Dragon's Bane and I'm not afraid to use it.
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:42.240]   So what Dragon Go will do things that Siri won't.
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:45.040]   Like you could get it to launch a third party application.
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:46.240]   And it's just a smart connection.
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:46.400]   Right?
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.560]   Because it's the same recognition engine.
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:49.440]   It's the same recognition.
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:53.360]   It doesn't have kind of the context that Siri has,
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.200]   which is what makes Siri cool.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:59.040]   But it does a lot of things that Siri won't do.
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:02.000]   So in, if you have a 4S and you have Dragon Go,
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.080]   you can get Dragon Go to launch, for example, the Yelp application
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:08.640]   and find stuff in the Yelp application for you.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:15.600]   So I've been using that on my iPhone 4 and feeling almost smug that I don't have an iPhone
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:16.000]   for it.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.120]   This is pretty impressive.
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:17.360]   I don't need it.
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:23.040]   There's a lot of good apps out there, but Dragon dictation and the company that makes it,
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:24.480]   they have a lot of really good stuff.
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:25.520]   New ones, right.
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:31.520]   There's a, I think, Mashable or one of the sites did a whole list of similar to Siri applications
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:34.800]   that you can download for your iPhone 4, which is nice.
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:39.280]   I think though that this is, you know, initially my thought with Siri was,
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:42.240]   well, this sounds like FaceTime where it's something cool, demo's cool,
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.040]   nobody's going to use it.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:47.840]   I'm starting to think that this is actually the revolution in user interface that we've been waiting
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:48.160]   for.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:55.200]   And if every phone doesn't have this in a year, it's going to be a big deal.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.480]   This, you've got to have this.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:00.960]   So Craig Monday, pay attention and beef up, tell me, because it's got to be as good.
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:04.960]   I use Siri all the time and I'll have to try this, Dragon Go.
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:10.720]   I think it's really surprisingly good, surprisingly interested.
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:12.960]   I hear from a lot of people on Facebook.
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.040]   Yeah, it should launch apps.
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:15.520]   That's crazy.
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.920]   And Apple, the Apple's a little conservative on this stuff.
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.800]   And the other problem Apple's having, which is a big time problem,
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:25.840]   is that because it's on every iPhone 4S, their servers are down all the time.
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:27.600]   You know, it just, it's, yeah.
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:30.320]   Yes, Siri needs to act, needs to work better.
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:34.800]   I hear from a lot of iPhone 4S users who think it doesn't work very well.
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:35.360]   Right.
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:38.080]   That it gives them results that they did.
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:41.920]   They modified, they modified, it turns out Siri has to go to the network all the time,
[00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:42.880]   every time.
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:43.120]   Right.
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:45.600]   And they modified the response now.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:48.480]   She now says, I'm so, so sorry, but I can't help you right now.
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.880]   She's like really apologetic.
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:52.960]   All right.
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:54.000]   I'm sorry, Dave.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:54.640]   I'm sorry, Dave.
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:57.040]   My buddy likes to, he understands how to,
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:59.920]   my son understands how to get Siri working.
[00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:01.760]   So he holds down the button and she beeps.
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:05.440]   And he doesn't say any words that anyone besides his dad and I understand.
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:08.480]   So she goes, I'm sorry, I don't understand you.
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:11.520]   And he just going, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:12.240]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:17.440]   You know, kids are really interesting because they watch what mommy and daddy do,
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:18.400]   and they duplicate it.
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:22.320]   It's true.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:27.120]   And you know, I feel like the onus is on me a lot of times to remember what Siri can and can't do.
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:31.280]   So when I try and get her to play my voicemails and she says, I'm sorry, I don't do voicemails.
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.760]   I'm like, well, but you do text messages.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.120]   Why should I have to remember that?
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:36.880]   Those are the little things that bug me about her.
[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:39.680]   I think Siri will get you more useful, but you never know with Apple.
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.160]   They're a very strange company.
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:45.200]   And sometimes they don't prioritize what we think they should.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:48.240]   And you're really at their mercy, whatever Apple does.
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:49.920]   So that's why it's good to see a dragon.
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.680]   It's interesting that dragon did that.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:52.480]   Nuance did that.
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:55.520]   They put out a dragon version that competes with Siri.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:56.080]   I'm surprised.
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:57.520]   Wow, it's been out for a while, I think.
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:00.480]   Well, they've had, I think Dragon Go is new, or is it?
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:00.960]   Is it new?
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:02.640]   Dragon Go has been out for a little while.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:05.280]   They had Dragon before.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:06.240]   Dragon dictation.
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:07.760]   Dragon dictation, right?
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:08.400]   Dragon dictate.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:15.440]   Dragon Go is, and they recently put out another version, a version recently that is a lot better.
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:18.400]   I tried that when it first came out, wasn't that impressed?
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:20.480]   Tried it again on the recommendation of somebody.
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:21.760]   And I've been using it a lot.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:26.240]   All right, Google+ says we're going after Facebook.
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:27.760]   They've actually bought an ad.
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:29.680]   What was that ad on with the American Music Awards?
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.080]   No, it wasn't on football.
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.920]   Football, that's where I saw it.
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:35.200]   On Thanksgiving.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:39.120]   It was on the 49ers Ravens game.
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:45.920]   And it looked a little bit like this, thinking, you think the YouTube version of this would be
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:46.640]   very fast.
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:49.520]   They would prioritize this.
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:50.320]   Maybe it's just me.
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:51.200]   Maybe it's my computer.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:51.920]   It's not playing.
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:54.320]   One more time, let's try it.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:54.960]   Come on.
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:55.440]   There we go.
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:53:00.640]   [MUSIC]
[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:03.760]   I found this annoying, to say the least.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.040]   It's such a snooze fest.
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:08.320]   It's not a, they've done so many good ads in the past.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:14.480]   And I think that they're still fundamentally driven by the same internal needs, the same desire.
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:18.400]   So the thrust of this is that humans have always needed to connect.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.640]   It's so relevant to talk about certain things with this.
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:25.920]   But then they show the complex circling stuff.
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:30.800]   And it makes it look much harder than it actually is.
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:34.880]   Once you like step back and get away from that, you realize,
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:36.880]   oh, these are the people that were actually there for me.
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:39.200]   This is, I think just-
[00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:41.440]   On my favorite epic bros, it's my favorite group.
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:41.840]   And it grows.
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:43.360]   I want to have an epic bros circle.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:43.920]   I'm showing you.
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.040]   To me, this is confusing.
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:45.520]   You think it's already?
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:49.680]   Leo, you're in my epic bros.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:50.720]   I am an epic bro.
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:51.440]   It's just a period of time.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:52.880]   Epic bros, dude.
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:55.200]   All right, I'm going to stop it.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.080]   Because I just-
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:56.640]   It's like a commercial.
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:57.600]   Isn't this the worst?
[00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:59.200]   It's fun.
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:00.400]   They should have broken it up.
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:04.240]   They should have had multiple short commercials, one showing circles,
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:09.360]   you know, basically sort your friends into the groups that really matter,
[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:14.640]   show a hangout, do things that are, break it up.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:17.280]   That's what a 90 minute commercial and a second commercial.
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:17.920]   Felt like it.
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.440]   And that run- It's a minute and 30.
[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:20.400]   Felt like a 90 minute.
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:23.280]   And yeah, they need to break it up.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:24.560]   I think that it's worse than that.
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:26.400]   It usually works for Google.
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:26.800]   Yeah.
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:32.400]   Normally, you know, it's a dad emailing his little girl throughout her childhood.
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:32.720]   Oh, look, look, look.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:37.120]   There's the other one where the couple meets and they're googling things like
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.680]   where to go on a first date and what to talk about on a first date.
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:41.200]   And then eventually you see them get married.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.960]   And that kind of delay-
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:43.760]   Yeah.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:44.880]   Actually, what is going on here?
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:46.000]   Usually works for them.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.440]   It didn't work in this context.
[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:48.480]   And I can't really put my finger on one.
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:50.320]   There was no emotion in this context.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.560]   Those were all very emotional ads.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:54.400]   They pulled at your heart.
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.000]   But they're trying to appeal to you viscerally.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:01.920]   They're trying to appeal to you as a person who needs to connect with other people.
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:06.080]   And you normally are Facebook and you can do it here and this is better and this is why.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:06.720]   Here's what I think.
[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:07.920]   It fails on many levels.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:08.720]   Here's what I think.
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:10.480]   I think you can blame the ad agency.
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:11.680]   You can say it was a bad ad.
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:15.600]   I think the real problem is the interface is so ridiculously complex
[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:19.440]   that there was no room to show this beautiful love story, emotional ad.
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:24.000]   All of the energy was spent on the details of your drain and drain and drain and drain
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.400]   and you press this button here and you didn't.
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:27.520]   You couldn't show it.
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:32.480]   I think that there's an underlying problem which is this is too damn complicated.
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:34.800]   No?
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:36.560]   It's not that complicated.
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:39.520]   No, I don't think it's that complicated.
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:41.360]   But the way they were showing it was complicated.
[00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:42.960]   Maybe it looked really hard.
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:48.320]   You could do that without making it look all geeky, which is what it looked like.
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:48.480]   Right.
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:53.840]   Senator Joe Lieberman walks into a bar.
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:54.320]   No.
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:58.240]   Senator Joe Lieberman says, it does feel like a joke.
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:02.800]   Senator Joe Lieberman says Google's blogger needs a terrorist button.
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:09.520]   I think this is what really is missing on the internet is a button that you could flag
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:11.680]   content as terror related.
[00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:13.440]   I don't want to stab him in the eye.
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:14.720]   That's terror.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:15.680]   That's terror.
[00:56:15.680 --> 00:56:16.720]   I heard it.
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:17.680]   Flagger.
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:24.240]   He is just the worst and I'm from Connecticut and I can say patently that he is the worst at
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:26.320]   everything, everything.
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:29.200]   And this is, I mean, I can't even get into it.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:29.920]   I'll get too mad.
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.040]   It's not worth it.
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:33.680]   He's really, he's the droopy dog of senators.
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:34.720]   Isn't that what John Stewart?
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:38.720]   Oh, I think he just doesn't understand anything.
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:41.680]   He acts like he does, but he doesn't understand anything.
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:44.720]   Every mong, he's a terrorist thing, but.
[00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:46.320]   And really, blogger.
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:46.800]   Come on.
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:47.920]   Blogger.
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:50.480]   Well, apparently there was a terrorist blog on blogger.
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:50.880]   Okay.
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:51.520]   That's fine.
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:54.560]   So yeah, really you're going after blogger.
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:58.560]   All the terrorists have blogs on blogger now.
[00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:02.560]   It's the new thing because he doesn't know about WordPress.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:03.760]   Yeah, maybe that's it.
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:04.320]   Word what?
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:05.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:06.000]   WordPress.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.320]   Slap.
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:12.320]   Yeah, he makes me really angry.
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:14.960]   So are you going to use Natalie?
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:19.280]   Are you going to use Google to narrow down baby name searches?
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:23.680]   I saw this story and I thought, oh gosh, I'm going to have to talk about this.
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:24.400]   Yes, you are.
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.000]   You're the token parent.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:31.360]   Yeah, there are much better ways to look at name sites.
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:34.480]   I've learned all the apps and all the name sites for baby names.
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:38.320]   And of course, you do the perfunctory Google search of your child.
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:39.200]   Well, that's what they're saying.
[00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:44.960]   The 64% of all baby names were searched for on Google before they chose it.
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:46.800]   Right.
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:50.640]   Because you want to make sure that there's no rapist or serial killer named that
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:52.480]   that you might not have otherwise known about.
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:54.400]   So yeah, it's a good thing to do.
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:59.680]   But I prefer nameberry and also the SSA, the Social Security Administration,
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:03.840]   has an app that I sometimes look through where you can save names and
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:09.680]   sometimes on some of these sites, you can make lists and then send them out to your friends and
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:12.320]   family so that they can vote on it as if it's a democracy.
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:17.440]   But I never do that because I don't really care what other people think of my family.
[00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:22.560]   My family ruined so many names because they had they all had like an image in their head of what
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:23.360]   that name meant.
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:29.200]   So like we were going to name Abby Clara and some my mom, which I like is a beautiful name,
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:29.920]   Clara.
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:32.320]   And my mom said, oh no, that reminds me of Clara Bell the clown.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:33.920]   And now I can no longer use that name.
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:34.320]   It's gone.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:34.880]   Strike it off.
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:36.080]   Put it, take it off the list.
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:38.480]   So I'm not sure it's good to look up this stuff.
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:41.760]   The lead in this article by Alan Socken in the New York Times.
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:45.920]   Kalia is a stripper name when spelled with an I.
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:51.280]   But Kalia spelled with an EY is not according to her parents.
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:57.040]   They searched Google for K-A-L-I-A and they found a bunch of scantily glad women.
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:00.080]   So they decided to spell it differently.
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:01.600]   How do you like that?
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:03.600]   I guess that makes sense.
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:05.600]   The problem is the times change.
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:09.760]   When we named Henry, Henry, nobody was named Henry and now there's four or five kids,
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:12.000]   he knows he has to be Hank because they're all named Henry.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.480]   So it's just everybody everybody assumes that I was
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:17.840]   names are really in.
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:18.320]   I know.
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:18.800]   Miles.
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:20.320]   Is there a lot of miles in the preschool?
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:21.440]   You don't know.
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:22.240]   It's too early still.
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:24.960]   Well, there's one other in his class.
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:26.480]   He starts he starts on Thursday.
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:27.600]   See see what I'm saying.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:29.120]   See what I'm saying.
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:29.920]   There is one other.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:36.080]   Yeah, but and I like the really, really old names like Bard and Balter and Clayton thinks I'm crazy.
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:37.520]   So it's it's hard.
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:40.720]   He doesn't want his son to be a grandpa before he's born.
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:44.640]   So let me let me let me ask you that's why we like Henry by the way.
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:45.280]   It's an old-fashioned name.
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:46.240]   Let me ask you about Miles.
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:47.200]   Was that a family name?
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:48.000]   Where did you get Miles?
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.400]   I have a theory.
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:53.440]   It comes from the Woody Allen film, "Sleeper."
[00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:57.760]   I had a professor who.
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.160]   Or is there a connection?
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.720]   And his child Miles and we'd talk about him.
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.920]   Did it in the Miles Davis?
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.360]   Miles Davis.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:05.680]   Okay.
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:08.720]   But you know that Woody Allen's name is "Sleeper."
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:09.040]   Miles Standish.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:09.840]   Miles Standish.
[01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.160]   Thanks, Kevin.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:14.320]   You knew Englanders.
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:21.440]   Everybody assumes that I was a baby boomer in 1956.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:24.320]   Everybody assumes that I was named because of Dwight Eisenhower.
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:25.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:25.680]   Sure.
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:33.280]   But no, I was named for my mother's father who was in turn named for Dwight L. Moody.
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:36.960]   Moody Baptist College, the guy who invented the tent revival.
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:40.240]   So I could trace my name back to that.
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:41.120]   That's very interesting.
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.920]   No, it had nothing to do with Dwight Eisenhower.
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:46.400]   The chat room is saying, and I think this is a very good idea,
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.880]   don't Google it, Wolfram Alpha.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:49.360]   Oh.
[01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:51.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:57.200]   So Dwight is rank is well below one thousandth in the US.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:02.240]   Fewer than one in 12,500 people have the named Dwight.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.800]   Fewer than 200 people a year are named Dwight.
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:09.040]   It peaked, you're right, in the 50s when Dwight D. Eisenhower was president.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:09.680]   Oh, check mine.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:10.240]   I want to know.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.600]   Oh, let's look up Veronica.
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:12.720]   How do you learn after my great own?
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:14.080]   How many of me dot com?
[01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:14.880]   That's a great site.
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:15.840]   How many of me?
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:16.720]   How cool?
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:20.640]   Dot com, you put your first and last name to see if anyone's got that same combination.
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:21.920]   Oh, I bet there's a lot of me.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:22.720]   Oh, wow.
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:26.720]   So Veronica is 295th, one in 1770 people named that.
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:35.600]   Every year, 1,097 new Veronica's are born, peaked in 1975, started going down after that.
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:39.440]   There are about 185,000 people with your name Veronica.
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:42.400]   And most of them are 31 years old.
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.320]   Oh, that's interesting too.
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:44.880]   Yeah.
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:46.480]   Yeah, so you're just a little behind the curve there.
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:47.600]   Little behind, look back.
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.880]   Here's alternate versions.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:50.640]   Fanny.
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.160]   Frankie.
[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:55.120]   I'm calling you Fanny from now on.
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:58.240]   Ron, Ronna, Ronnie, Ronnie, or Vanni?
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.320]   Vanni, I've never heard Vanni before.
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:00.960]   That's a good one.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.560]   Anybody ever call you Fanny?
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:03.920]   Is it derivation of Ron?
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.600]   No, I've never heard that either.
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:09.360]   I've gotten Ron, Ronnie, I mean, Ronnie.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:09.840]   Ronnie.
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:11.840]   And, uh, I like me best.
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:12.880]   What was my favorite?
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:13.440]   It was Frankie.
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:14.000]   It was just easier.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.040]   Frankie, I know it's weird.
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:15.360]   Frankie.
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.960]   I think they made that up.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:17.920]   I think Wolfram's wrong.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:23.760]   Now, Natalie, I'm sure, as you spell it, is probably very unique.
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.600]   It's uncommon.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.080]   Yeah.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.600]   But you can't find it on a pencil.
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:29.040]   But I was named after Natalie Wood.
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:32.000]   Oh, now what do you think of this whole, uh,
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.880]   they're dredging her up, so to speak?
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.560]   I know.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.720]   The ghost of Natalie Wood has been arisen.
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:41.600]   And I think she was wrongly murdered.
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:43.440]   I always thought that that was, uh,
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.600]   there was some fishy there.
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.520]   So Natalie Wood was on the--
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.720]   She's not a stupid drunk.
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.560]   That's what everybody said.
[01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:54.560]   So Natalie Wood, beautiful, gorgeous actress, child actress,
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:56.400]   who was later married to Robert Wagner.
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.960]   Famous, famous romance.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:01.120]   Uh, and what is it?
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:03.280]   The 20th anniversary of her death?
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:03.760]   30th?
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:04.320]   Oh, man.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:04.800]   30th?
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:05.200]   Yeah.
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:05.920]   Long time.
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:07.840]   She drowned on the--
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:10.400]   She and Robert Wagner were on their boat along with the--
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.720]   And, and, and Christopher Walken.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:13.040]   Christopher Walken.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:13.680]   Also on the boat.
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.720]   Yes.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:14.720]   Yes.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:15.680]   There was some, uh, some--
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:17.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:18.960]   I never trusted him.
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.560]   Oh, they were fighting a strange character off the boat.
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.000]   It's got a Christian fucking--
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.400]   I would do my Christopher Walken now,
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.640]   but I don't want to freak people out.
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:30.080]   Interesting.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.440]   So that's all been dredged up because of,
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.360]   but the captain wrote a book, a tell-all book,
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:35.600]   then he said, "Nersh, I want to seem to be.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:38.160]   Arr, something else should happen there."
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:38.960]   Is that what he said?
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:40.000]   Arr, arr, arr.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   He passed to my detector test.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.440]   Oh, very interesting.
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:47.840]   So I'm sure you're following this with great interests.
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.520]   Not really.
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:50.080]   Oh.
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:52.720]   This doesn't really make a difference.
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:53.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.680]   Oh, so how about that technology?
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:56.240]   You know, my mom did--
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:58.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:58.560]   Yeah.
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.000]   What is the weird spelling?
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.200]   I think I could have used Google.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.400]   She did that Natalie with an eye,
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.320]   and then my sister is L-I-N-Z-I,
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:06.080]   even though she was named after Lindsay Wagner
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.360]   from the Bionic Woman.
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:08.720]   No, I wouldn't admit to that.
[01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:11.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:14.800]   So it does make, it gives us our own unique Google juice.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:17.040]   So that she uses that now,
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.040]   but back in elementary school.
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.560]   Oh, we're having such trouble with your Skype, Natalie.
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.640]   Of course, it's so much better when you're in the--
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:25.200]   Oh, I'm--
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:26.080]   --up in the Catskills,
[01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:27.680]   and now that you're in Manhattan, it sucks.
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:28.560]   I don't know why that is.
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:29.680]   It's terrible.
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.760]   And it's rising fire, too.
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:32.400]   We're on fire.
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:33.200]   Wow.
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:35.120]   You got a backup running or anything in there?
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:35.920]   And something going on?
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:36.640]   I do.
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.400]   In the back, it's--
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.080]   I can give you a whole explanation,
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:41.120]   but it'll make me want to--
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:41.840]   Just blame Clayton.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:43.280]   Jump off a boat myself.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:44.640]   My advice, blame Clayton.
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.440]   That's what my wife would do.
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:48.640]   She blames Clayton all the time.
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:56.480]   Andrew Sorkin says, yes, I was pitched to write a Steve Jobs biopic.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:59.280]   Of course, a lot of speculation.
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:02.800]   Sony, I think, bought the rights to the Isaacson biography.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:03.760]   Yes.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.280]   Of Steve Jobs.
[01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.040]   And he talked to E Online this week and said,
[01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.360]   "Sony asked him to write the movie, and he's considering it."
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:12.560]   Boy, I hope he does, because he wrote the Facebook movie,
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:15.040]   and he did such a job of getting it exactly right.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.840]   Are you being sarcastic?
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:19.200]   I am being a little sarcastic.
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:22.880]   Sorkin, it's very--
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:24.000]   We had entertaining.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:24.640]   Yes.
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:27.600]   But it's pretty obvious that Sorkin does not like geeks.
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:28.400]   He's always--
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:31.520]   In all of his shows, he's written about bloggers and their jammies
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.160]   and the basement.
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:33.360]   He just doesn't like the internet.
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:34.000]   You could tell.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.200]   So I'm not sure he is the right guy to write this,
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.080]   but he is a good writer.
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:41.520]   I don't know that Steve Jobs liked the internet either.
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:42.480]   That's true.
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:44.320]   Same level of disdain for people,
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:45.440]   that Steve Jobs had.
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:46.880]   So it may work out really well.
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:47.840]   Yeah, right.
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:51.520]   And I love their saying that they're jocking George Clooney
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:52.560]   to be Steve Jobs.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:53.680]   No.
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:55.840]   He just says what the article says.
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:56.880]   That's one of the names.
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:59.040]   Of course, the guy who played him--
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.800]   The "No, No, No, No, No, No, No,
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.240]   Wiley who played him in the tribe owners."
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.280]   No, Wiley.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.520]   And then, of course, for some reason,
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:06.880]   Justin Long keeps coming up,
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.400]   maybe because he was in the switch ads.
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:10.240]   But the problem is,
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:11.760]   and we talked to actually Dana Burnett,
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:12.720]   who did bid on this.
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:14.800]   He was the guy who produced the social network.
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:15.920]   And he said, "The problem is,
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.280]   you've got to decide which
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:18.080]   Steve Jobs you're playing,
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:21.440]   because the book spans from when he was a kid to when he died.
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:22.960]   So what age are you going to play?
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.800]   I mean, Clooney would be great for the older Steve,
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:26.560]   maybe great for the older Steve Jobs.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:28.560]   But how's he going to play the younger?
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:29.360]   Maybe you do both.
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:32.480]   The younger Steve Jobs doesn't look so much like Ashton Coocher.
[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.920]   That's what Clayton was pointing at.
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:35.040]   I hope they don't.
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:35.680]   A little bit.
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:36.640]   Yeah, I can see that.
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:37.440]   Don't get the pictures.
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:39.200]   He looks a lot alike.
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:39.680]   No, he does.
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:40.880]   If Ashton grew a beard.
[01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:42.560]   I wouldn't want to see Ashton play.
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.200]   No.
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:43.760]   No.
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:44.080]   No.
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:47.280]   I don't need Steve Jobs, the stoner version.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:51.440]   You could do it like they did the Bob Dylan movie.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.920]   I'm not here where they had different actors play.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.400]   Sure.
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.840]   Dylan at different times.
[01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:57.840]   Of course, that was like completely bizarre.
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:00.400]   But that would be an interesting way to do it.
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:01.200]   It would be kind of...
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.360]   Because he really was different people at different times,
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:04.400]   to a certain extent.
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:05.360]   Even at the same time.
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:05.840]   That would be the same question.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:06.320]   Bail.
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:06.640]   Yeah.
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:07.360]   Christian Bail might be...
[01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:08.080]   Christian Bail.
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:09.360]   Perfect.
[01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:10.640]   Stanley Tucci.
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.000]   Stanley Tucci.
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:14.400]   And Harris.
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.320]   And Harris.
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:18.000]   Actually, that would be interesting.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:18.800]   It would be good towards the end.
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:18.800]   Yeah.
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.080]   That would be the ball this.
[01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:21.040]   Yeah.
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:21.600]   Interesting.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:24.560]   Steve Jobs, Clooney or Wile,
[01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:25.360]   are Wile.
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:26.720]   I think it's pronounced Wile for some reason.
[01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:27.280]   I don't know why.
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.240]   But maybe...
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:30.960]   Christian Bail could play him at all ages.
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.480]   Christian Bail is perfect.
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.480]   He's good at gaining and losing weight
[01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:36.160]   very quickly too for his different roles.
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:36.560]   That's right.
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:37.840]   I don't know.
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:40.400]   Do you...
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:41.760]   Did you all read the book?
[01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:43.920]   I'm about to start reading it.
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:46.160]   I had a lot of reading to do for a certain laser.
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.200]   So I had to put it off.
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:49.120]   I don't know how you keep up with your show.
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:51.440]   I have no idea how you do that.
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:52.000]   A lot of...
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.920]   A mixture of audiobooks and reading.
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:54.160]   You must...
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:55.280]   On the Kindle at the same time.
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.840]   Do you read while you're playing Skyrim?
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.680]   No, I don't actually.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.040]   But that's not a bad idea.
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.000]   I have to...
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   A lot of my mental faculties have to go
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.280]   towards Skyrim when I'm playing.
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.280]   So I don't think I could listen to a book at the same time.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:09.040]   I think you have like 36 hour days.
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:11.440]   You have some sort of weird bi-o-rhythm.
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.000]   Because how do you get all that done?
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.160]   A lot of amphetamines.
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:16.480]   Wow.
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:16.800]   Okay.
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:17.520]   Well, that makes sense.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:18.080]   I believe that.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:18.560]   Sure.
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.400]   No, the reason I bring it up is that we had a discussion
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:21.120]   on Mac Break Weekly.
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.080]   There's been a...
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.320]   There's this whole revisionist thing going on among...
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:27.120]   Really the most hardcore Apple geeks.
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:30.080]   John Syracuse, primarily among them,
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:30.960]   Dave Weiner and other.
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:32.800]   Complaining about the book,
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:35.840]   saying Walter Isaacson was the worst guy they could have picked
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:36.960]   because he was a business writer.
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:37.760]   He wasn't a tech writer.
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:40.080]   He didn't understand anything that he was writing about.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:42.800]   He focused on the human drama, the anecdotes,
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:47.920]   but completely muffed all the history and the story
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:51.200]   and didn't ask any of the german questions.
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:52.640]   And I was thinking...
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:52.880]   You know what?
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:53.200]   I...
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.320]   Go ahead.
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:56.720]   Oh, I was just going to say the human element is actually
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:58.240]   what made me have to put it down.
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:01.440]   Because I was in, I think, my ninth week of pregnancy.
[01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:03.200]   And I started to read about the mothers,
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:04.880]   giving up the biological mom,
[01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:06.000]   had to give up the baby.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:06.480]   Right.
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:08.000]   And the adoptive mom was really,
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.600]   you know, emotionally attached to the baby.
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.200]   And I was crying so much.
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:12.400]   Hey, spoiler alert.
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:15.760]   I was like, I can't read this right now
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.920]   because it was about, you know, pregnant mommies
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:19.200]   and not being able to conceive.
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:20.320]   And I just had to stop.
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:21.360]   It's really true, Natalie.
[01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:22.160]   As soon as you have kids,
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:25.200]   you can no longer watch movies about children in jeopardy.
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:28.720]   All that stuff, your whole perspective changes.
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:30.400]   Because you take everything very personally.
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:32.080]   You just can't put it in your head.
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:32.240]   Right.
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:34.640]   Since I was only in my ninth week of pregnancy
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.560]   and crying about everything.
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.080]   I just said, I have to come back to this.
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:40.000]   I only got through two chapters.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.680]   You'll like Skyrim because
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.440]   you cannot kill the children in Skyrim.
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:45.200]   I know I've tried.
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:49.440]   No, they have never let you do that in any.
[01:09:49.440 --> 01:09:50.640]   In any, in any, in any.
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:54.320]   The yarl of windrun or white run or whatever it's called
[01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.720]   has the worst snotiest, bratiest kids.
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:57.920]   And you just want to smack them.
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:00.400]   Actually, I'm tempted.
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.720]   There's a mod on the PC that you can do that lets you.
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:04.160]   I have heard of this.
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:07.360]   You know, regarding jobs,
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:10.400]   keep in mind that he went to Isaacson and sought that.
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.200]   I know.
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:14.240]   There later, there's the question of why he wanted the book written.
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:16.080]   And it was so his kids would know him.
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:18.720]   And so given that context,
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:23.600]   I think the focus on the human is kind of exactly what he had in mind when he picked Isaacson.
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:24.880]   And I got a lot of the book.
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:26.560]   And another reason though, that it's not for pregnant lady.
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:31.600]   Can't read and think about like leaving your kids behind and all of that stuff.
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:32.960]   It was just too much for me.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:35.680]   I got a lot out of the book and I heard anecdotes we'd never heard before.
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:37.200]   And so I thought it was quite good.
[01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:39.120]   Isaacson had an unprecedented access.
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:41.440]   And this is one of the things that irritated both Syracuse and Weiner.
[01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:44.640]   They said, nobody ever will have this opportunity again.
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:47.840]   Why didn't they pick somebody who knew what questions to ask?
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:50.880]   But I got to think with hundreds of hours of interviews,
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.960]   if they were and this is what I want to lobby for,
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:55.840]   if Isaacson and I think if he cares about history,
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:56.800]   we'll do this.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:59.760]   Would please release those audio interviews at some point?
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.120]   Doesn't have to be right now,
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:04.400]   you know, in a few years to a university or library of congress,
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:08.320]   so that other historians and biographers have access to them,
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:11.680]   so that somebody can write a definitive history of Apple,
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:15.520]   somebody else can write a more technical biography of jobs.
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:17.040]   I think that would be great.
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:18.880]   But I have to say for all its flaws,
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:21.600]   and there were certainly numerous technical flaws,
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.120]   all of which Syracuse points out,
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:26.160]   I thought it was a fascinating book.
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:28.240]   I just want them to release the tapes of it.
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:35.520]   There is a movie going around, my dad saw it of all people
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.560]   and said it was great.
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:39.440]   The Lost Eve Jobs Interview interviewed, he did it in 1995,
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.680]   that is going, I'm sure it's unlimited release,
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:43.840]   but it's out there somewhere.
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:48.960]   There's a lot of information out there about jobs.
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:53.920]   There's this PBS documentary from 1986,
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:56.320]   you can actually watch online.
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:02.240]   I think that we're going to get many biographies of jobs.
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.960]   There will be something for everybody.
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:08.880]   I think this is a great biography for people who are not geeks,
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:13.040]   but kind of, and I think it painted a very accurate picture,
[01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.600]   both good and bad, of which who jobs was.
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:18.560]   And I think that's enough for now,
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:21.200]   and I'm sure we'll see even more down the road.
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:22.800]   I loved it.
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:23.840]   Did you read it, Dwight?
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:26.080]   I'm in the middle of reading it.
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.040]   It's a long ask for you.
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:30.320]   I've read so much about it, I feel like I have read already.
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:32.080]   Yeah, I've read all excerpts.
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:35.280]   Hey, here's who should direct it, the Coen Brothers.
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:38.080]   That'd be awesome.
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.800]   It could be like no country for old men,
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:45.200]   except Steve Jobs instead of having a cattle stunner.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:49.280]   He uses his voice, he uses dragon speech, his stare.
[01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:52.960]   I've been trying to perfect that thing where you grab your beard,
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:54.800]   you know, hold your beard and kind of stare.
[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:56.560]   I can't do it.
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:00.080]   We interviewed Dan Kocky, who was Steve Jobs' roommate at Reed
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:04.560]   on triangulation, and he talked a little bit about that stare.
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:08.240]   And because Steve perfected it while he was there,
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:11.280]   and so Dan was kind of the early subject of it.
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:16.000]   And he said, and this is, you and I are roughly the same age,
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.760]   we both are children of the 70s,
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:20.160]   and this is very much that era.
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.480]   He said the stare is all about,
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:24.880]   you have a left brain and a right brain, a left eye and a right eye.
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:28.720]   You want the left eye to look into the right eye to query the right brain,
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:31.360]   then the right eye to look into the left eye to query the right brain,
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:34.960]   and then vice versa, and that way you get a full picture of the,
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:36.400]   so all this stare--
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:37.680]   And you go cross eye.
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:40.160]   You think that Steve's doing the intimidation stare,
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:42.880]   he's just trying to figure out what's going on in the brain there.
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:45.520]   I believe that. They were hippies.
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:47.280]   Yes.
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:48.320]   William Shatner.
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:53.600]   It was National Unfriend Day.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.040]   This is a Jimmy Kimmel thing, right?
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:56.640]   Yes.
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:58.240]   Did anybody end friend any--
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.240]   I don't even understand why this is a day.
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.640]   I don't know.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:04.000]   It doesn't make sense.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:09.840]   Anyway, William Shatner, his steps to recovering from being unfriended.
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:12.160]   This was on the Jimmy Kimmel show.
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:14.320]   I'm told this is funny at the beginning,
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:16.800]   boring in the middle, and funny again at the end.
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.480]   Very much like the Jimmy Kimmel show, so.
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.240]   Fern!
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:22.400]   I've never watched it.
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:24.000]   I don't know. I'm not up that way.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.200]   Yeah, the National Unfriend Day.
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:28.240]   This is day on which we asked everyone with a Facebook page
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:30.080]   to cut back their friend's list.
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:30.800]   It was a huge--
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.000]   Is this the funny part?
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:32.480]   No.
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:34.320]   This is just a Jimmy part.
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.320]   That advertisement is hilarious.
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:37.200]   This is an ad.
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:37.840]   Where's the ad?
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:38.800]   I don't understand.
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.080]   Oh, there's pre-rolls sometimes.
[01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:42.480]   But, William, there's pre-roll after the thing begins.
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:43.040]   That's weird.
[01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:44.160]   That didn't happen to me.
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.520]   This is something new that ever--
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:47.040]   I think maybe I have two copies open.
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:48.160]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:50.640]   Yeah, you should have gotten the pre-roll before you saw Jimmy, but--
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:52.800]   Maybe YouTube decided--
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:53.280]   Wait a minute.
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:56.160]   He hasn't seen the pre-roll yet.
[01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:57.600]   Wait, but there is a button that says,
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:58.720]   "Skip this ad now."
[01:14:58.720 --> 01:14:59.760]   All right, here we go.
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:00.400]   One more time.
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.200]   I'm going to put it in 720p.
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:06.240]   Almost 100% of the feedback I've heard has been--
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:07.680]   What?
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:08.080]   What?
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:08.480]   What?
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:08.880]   Tell me!
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:09.600]   Don't pause!
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:12.080]   Why is YouTube the worst?
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:12.480]   It does--
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:14.000]   Is it do this to you, Veronica?
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:14.800]   Constantly.
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:16.560]   I thought it was just me.
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:18.640]   It seems like it always starts and stops.
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.080]   It's terrible.
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:20.560]   Terrible.
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:21.360]   Here we go.
[01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:25.840]   Plus, you got these three Skype streams coming in too.
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.520]   Oh, we got more bandwidth than God in here.
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:28.080]   It's not us.
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:28.480]   We got that.
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:28.960]   Yeah.
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:31.680]   We just put fiber in the thing.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.760]   We got 35 megabits up and down,
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.120]   and we got another 100 coming.
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:35.600]   Wow.
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:36.800]   I'm just telling you that we shouldn't play it.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:41.600]   Well, I know it will get pulled from--
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:43.920]   Even though this is on YouTube,
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:45.120]   and anybody can watch it.
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:47.440]   If I play it in our show,
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:49.440]   it will guarantee that our show gets pulled from YouTube.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:50.960]   We try to reverse it to see if--
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:53.520]   Well, there's one theory--
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:54.800]   We're trying all different things.
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:55.600]   There's one theory.
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.440]   If I play it inside the page,
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:00.240]   the YouTube automatic content recognition system won't see it.
[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:01.520]   So let's try it this way.
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:02.400]   They're on their page.
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:04.240]   But some people were a little bit upset
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:05.360]   because they got unfriended.
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.480]   It's hard to get unfriended.
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:08.000]   It's a rejection from some more--
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:08.480]   I'm worried.
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:09.040]   Let's move on.
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.000]   I don't care.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:10.800]   Next subject.
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.440]   I didn't even get to William Shatter.
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:14.720]   I told you you get bored.
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:16.160]   But that was--
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:18.800]   Does William Shatter funny at the end?
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:21.280]   He just does a little bit of a homage to--
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:21.840]   Marginally?
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:23.040]   He just does a homage to Star Trek.
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:23.840]   But forget it.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:25.760]   Facebook's going to do a phone called Buffy.
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:27.600]   HTC--
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.200]   I thought Slayer was a much better idea.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:31.120]   A Slayer.
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.640]   Buffy the Android Slayer.
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:36.080]   It actually will be an Android phone heavily customized
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.200]   for Facebook HTC.
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:37.760]   We'll make it--
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:40.880]   Who cares?
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.400]   I think--
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:43.760]   Yeah, they've been talking about this forever.
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:44.800]   Yeah.
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.160]   I believe when I see it.
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:47.120]   Oh, I believe it now.
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.200]   I mean, at this point, I think the details are pretty clear.
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:49.680]   But--
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:53.600]   If it's just an Android skin, who cares?
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:54.880]   Is exactly right.
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:56.880]   Right. Although, I'm very interested in how
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:58.000]   Forked Android is getting.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.520]   I mean, if you look at the Kindle Fire
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:03.040]   and the Nook tablet, which are Android,
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:05.440]   you don't see any Google or Android in there at all.
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:06.240]   And it really is--
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:08.560]   I mean, I think Google's got to have to face a little issue
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:10.000]   by giving this away.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.760]   Eventually, you get to the point where it's not--
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.440]   You know, there's all different versions.
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:16.560]   Well, fragmentation is a huge issue.
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:16.560]   Huge.
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.000]   In the Android marketplace.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:18.240]   Right.
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:21.760]   But I think that when companies like Amazon do it right,
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:24.720]   it gives me a little bit of hope that these other companies
[01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:27.280]   that are just skinning other versions of Android
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:29.680]   and doing a really poor job of it
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:31.840]   will kind of step up their game a little bit.
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:35.200]   No, held in fragmentation is not a relevant chat room.
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:37.280]   It's an important issue.
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:38.480]   Well, it isn't an isn't it?
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:41.680]   I mean, it's the way Apple coined fragmentation.
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:42.720]   It was really a--
[01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:44.160]   There were really a sales spin on that.
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:46.080]   But I do think that it's going to be an issue if you've got
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:48.240]   Android forked in many different ways.
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:50.320]   I just ordered the Galaxy Nexus,
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:51.600]   which is the ice cream sandwich one.
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.320]   I'll be very curious.
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:57.680]   It's not so much an issue for end users, but they don't care.
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:00.160]   Most people buy an Android phone and they don't mess with it.
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:01.200]   It's confusing.
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:02.720]   It's confusing if nothing else.
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:05.360]   I mean, but it's really an issue for developers.
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:05.760]   Yeah.
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:08.000]   There's a new Android for developers.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:08.960]   Did you see this ad?
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:12.880]   I played this on Mac Break Week, but I got to play it again.
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.960]   This is the Samsung Galaxy.
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:16.400]   I got to play this ad.
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:17.520]   The Galaxy S2.
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:19.680]   This is just wild.
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:20.720]   It's just to see if there's pre-roll.
[01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:22.320]   No, there's no--
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.280]   It is on YouTube.
[01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:24.080]   It is on YouTube.
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:24.720]   Have you seen this?
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:25.600]   It's such a good ad.
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:26.480]   I'm so amped.
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:28.240]   I got to go full screen on this.
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:28.880]   I'm so amped.
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:30.320]   I can stay here for three.
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:31.600]   So these are the hipsters.
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:32.640]   Look, they all have--
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:33.600]   White headphones.
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:38.000]   Nine hours down, and we're almost in the dillah.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.280]   I think two people just left.
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:41.600]   Why would they be leaving when we're only nine hours away?
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:42.560]   I mean, this is an event.
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:43.520]   Uh-oh.
[01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:45.360]   Blogs are saying the battery looks sketchy.
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:46.480]   You know, it looks the same.
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:47.920]   How will people know I upgraded?
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:48.480]   That's insane.
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:48.880]   4G is a 4G.
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:49.840]   It doesn't say.
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:50.080]   Whoa.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:52.160]   I should have got there.
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:52.880]   So they see it.
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.720]   What is that?
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:55.920]   Guys.
[01:18:55.920 --> 01:18:56.880]   Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:57.680]   Hey, bro.
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:58.800]   Can we see your phone?
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:18:59.440]   Sure.
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:00.240]   Can I see with my hands?
[01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:01.040]   I just want to--
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:02.560]   I just got-- I got to go back here.
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:06.160]   These guys, the classic San Francisco hipsters,
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:09.040]   they got the Starbucks, they all got the White headphones,
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:10.160]   but one guy's got the hat.
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:11.200]   No, no, that's where you're wrong.
[01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:14.560]   If you're in San Francisco, do not drink Starbucks.
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:15.280]   OK, I'm sorry.
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.920]   That's a-- that's sight glass or blue bottle.
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:18.400]   There you go.
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:18.880]   Thank you.
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:19.280]   Thank you.
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:20.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:22.480]   I love it that they're behind bars.
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:24.800]   They're trapped-- the semiotics of this are great.
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:26.080]   They're all trapped behind these bars.
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:28.880]   As the normal people walk by with their normal phones,
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:32.160]   all these hipsters in line to get the next phone.
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:36.080]   They've all got the sweatshirts, the hoodies, the blue--
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:36.880]   you know, the khakis.
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:37.760]   Have you seen this thing?
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:39.680]   Check out the screen.
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:40.640]   This thing is huge.
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:41.440]   It's pretty massive.
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:42.720]   And it's got 4G speed.
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:43.520]   That's magnificent.
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:45.680]   Samsung.
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:46.320]   Samsung?
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.360]   That's a Samsung.
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:48.640]   Here comes my favorite part.
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:49.680]   I never get a Samsung.
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:50.880]   I'm creative.
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:51.600]   I'm creative.
[01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:52.640]   Did you have a barista?
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:53.840]   Dude, you're a barista.
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:54.880]   Why didn't you get barista?
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:56.560]   Why'd I just get a 4G phone, right?
[01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:57.760]   Yeah, it's a galaxy, that's two.
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:20:00.000]   This phone is amazing.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.920]   Oh, god.
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:04.400]   I just--
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:05.040]   The galaxy--
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:06.080]   I feel for them.
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:07.040]   I just feel for them.
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:08.480]   The hipsters.
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:10.320]   And barista is a creative art, OK?
[01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:11.840]   Say again?
[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:12.640]   Because--
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:14.160]   Big baristas are creative.
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:14.640]   I know.
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.520]   I'm creative, dude.
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:16.080]   I'm creative.
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:17.040]   You should see the latte art.
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:17.600]   It's amazing.
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:21.520]   They're international competitions.
[01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:22.080]   They're art.
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:23.360]   They're from Niall Ghost to them.
[01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:23.840]   All right.
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:24.400]   Oh, I know.
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:24.800]   I know.
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:26.320]   But it's not creative.
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:28.320]   So here's the question.
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:30.720]   Does this annoy Apple fans?
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:33.120]   No, it didn't bother me.
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.880]   And I'm an iPhone fanboy.
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:35.520]   It didn't bother me.
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:38.320]   Well, the one thing is that it points something out
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:39.440]   that people don't stand in line--
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:40.640]   They're technology-trans.
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:41.840]   --for Samsung phones.
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:42.800]   I stood in line--
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:43.360]   that's true.
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:44.480]   They don't stand in line for them,
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:45.120]   but they don't have to,
[01:20:45.120 --> 01:20:46.480]   because they can just pick one up any time.
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:49.200]   I stood in line for the iPhone twice.
[01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:51.360]   But I have a reason.
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:53.200]   I had to get one, so I could review it.
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:54.640]   But still, I stood in line.
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:55.840]   And it was kind of an nice experience.
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:56.800]   An interesting experience.
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:58.960]   The question is it offensive--
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:02.320]   Does that make you more pathetic than me
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:03.600]   for getting up at 3 a.m.
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:04.400]   to go to Target?
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.400]   To stand in line for an iPhone.
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:07.680]   It's cooler, right?
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:10.960]   Even though they're both kind of obsessive retail experiences.
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:14.240]   Oh, now I'm really in trouble.
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:18.640]   I guess you might have a point there, Natalie.
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.880]   If that's your real name.
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:24.480]   I think Dwight's silonning.
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:26.240]   Is it Dwight that's silonning?
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:26.880]   I can't tell.
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:28.800]   The Skype has been not kind to us this--
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:29.760]   Oh, it's been one hour.
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:30.800]   Okay.
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:33.520]   The clock is up.
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:35.520]   There's a bug, and there's a chipset bug that,
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:37.840]   after one hour, that does this weird thing.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:40.880]   You got to switch it over because now you're on the--
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:42.320]   Okay, good.
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:43.440]   Yeah.
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.880]   Yay.
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:45.920]   I like that ad.
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:48.880]   I do feel like it was attacking the users,
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.560]   not the phone, which is unusual.
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:52.880]   Even Apple went and did the switch campaign,
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:54.400]   didn't attack PC users.
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:56.880]   I mean, in fact, John Hodgman was kind of sweet.
[01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:58.640]   But he wasn't a user.
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:21:59.520]   He was a PC.
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:00.800]   It seems like kind of a cheap shot,
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:01.840]   but I see why they're doing it.
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:02.720]   It's funny.
[01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:04.240]   I don't think it'll air on TV.
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:06.560]   It's kind of a web thing, right?
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:08.240]   No, it was on TV.
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:08.720]   It was?
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:10.160]   Geez.
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:11.200]   Wow, that's interesting.
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:13.840]   I thought during the football games,
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:16.320]   when I saw the Google+ on Thanksgiving--
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:17.040]   It's amazing.
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:17.920]   All the tech ads.
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:19.760]   I don't think anyone, though,
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:22.720]   is not going to go line up, say, for the iPhone 5,
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:25.520]   because Samsung made fun of them in an ad.
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:26.000]   No.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.680]   Or will they get mad at Samsung?
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:30.160]   That's the question, right?
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:32.400]   Now, and now, if Samsung gets popular--
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:33.200]   Right.
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:34.000]   We can lock them.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000]   Stupid waiting in line for the galaxy.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:36.240]   Right.
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:40.000]   Are they damaging their own line cred?
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.920]   What time do you even know what we're talking about anymore?
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:43.200]   Let's move on.
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:43.840]   We're going to take a break.
[01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:47.120]   When we come back, the meme that will not stop the Pepper's Ray Cop.
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:50.800]   But first, Audible.com,
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.960]   I'd like to talk about audiobooks.
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:54.960]   See, now, Veronica's a big audiobook user,
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:56.400]   because she does not have time.
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:59.360]   She would like to read all the books that she reads,
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.800]   but she doesn't have time.
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:03.760]   So she supplements her paper consumption,
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:04.880]   with audio consumption.
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:06.560]   So when you're in the car at the gym,
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:07.920]   cleaning house, doing the laundry,
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:09.760]   Audible.com is there.
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:11.440]   And I'll tell you, that's the only time I get to read,
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:14.960]   because I got the Isaac Singing book in hardcover.
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:16.080]   I got it on a Kindle,
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:17.120]   and I ended up Audible.
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:19.200]   It was the only way I could get through the whole thing.
[01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:22.160]   And I have to say, that's really the key,
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:24.880]   because you'll listen all the time,
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:26.000]   and you can get through books.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.360]   And it's amazing.
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:29.440]   They, of course, have that book at Audible.com,
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:30.240]   and you can have it free.
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:31.520]   In fact, I'm going to set you up for two books.
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:32.000]   How about that?
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:38.000]   Go to Audible.com/twit2, the number two,
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.520]   and you can sign up for the Platinum account.
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:41.520]   That's two books a month, first month's free,
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:42.880]   first two books are free,
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:44.320]   cancel at any time.
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:47.200]   The books are always yours to keep.
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:49.680]   Bill Maher, I see, has a new book with a profane title.
[01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:50.560]   I won't be mentioning.
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:55.680]   What are you reading for Sword and Laser?
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:59.280]   Right now, we're reading A Lantress by Brandon Sanderson,
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:02.320]   and also our supplementary book is One Q 84,
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:03.280]   by Murakami.
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:03.920]   I'm reading that.
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:04.880]   Which I'm listening to on Audible.
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:05.920]   Yes, that's on Audible.
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:07.440]   That's a long book that's probably the only one.
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:08.880]   It's like six or eight parts.
[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:09.440]   Yeah.
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:10.720]   It's like 46 hours.
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.320]   It's my next book on Audible.com.
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:12.640]   Huge.
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:13.440]   Yeah.
[01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:14.640]   I downloaded it already.
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:15.120]   What do you think?
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:16.000]   Is it good?
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:16.560]   It's good.
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:18.000]   Yeah, it's starting out a little bit slow.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.440]   I'm looking forward to getting a little more sci-fi,
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:24.320]   a little more weird,
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:26.560]   because I know that's coming within the next few chapters.
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:29.360]   So I just need more time to listen.
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:30.480]   I haven't been driving as much.
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:32.480]   I need to get up to Petaluma more often,
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:33.840]   so I can get my Audible time in.
[01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:34.880]   Exactly.
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:36.080]   Exactly.
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:36.720]   You need a job where you--
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:37.840]   That's going to be my plan.
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:38.640]   Exactly.
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.320]   You need a job where you have to commute a lot.
[01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:41.360]   Yeah.
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:44.320]   This is absolutely a recommendation.
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:45.840]   In fact, I told Brian Brushwood
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:47.120]   who's looking for his next Audible book,
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:48.960]   and I said, Brian, everybody's raving about this.
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:50.640]   This was a huge hit in Japan.
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:52.000]   The other one I'm reading,
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.040]   is the one I'm reading right now.
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:54.480]   This will be next, is Reemdee,
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:56.960]   which is Neil Stevenson's book.
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:58.080]   I don't know if you've read that or not.
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.520]   I just finished that recently.
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:00.240]   Yeah.
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:01.600]   So I'm a little-- I think he didn't write this.
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:05.840]   It doesn't feel like Neil Stevenson booked to me.
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:08.160]   It feels like a Neil Stevenson book.
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:10.240]   It's just definitely more of a techno thriller,
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:12.400]   as opposed to what we're used to in some sort.
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:13.360]   I loved Anitham.
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:15.520]   I love Cryptonomica.
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:16.400]   Yeah.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:18.560]   Or even, it's-- or even like Snow Crash,
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:20.400]   you know, that's kind of the entry level,
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:23.120]   typical entry level Stevenson book that people read,
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:25.840]   even though it's an amazing classic.
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:27.120]   This is definitely, like I said,
[01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:28.480]   a little more accessible to people
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:30.240]   who maybe don't want something quite so,
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:32.960]   you know, sci-fi fantasy driven.
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:34.320]   But it's really great.
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:35.520]   And if you like video games,
[01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:38.880]   and if you like action thriller kinds of books,
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:40.320]   it's got a lot of great elements
[01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:43.200]   that geeky people would love to read in a book like--
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:44.480]   Kind of reminded me of like,
[01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:48.240]   Daniel Suarez-Daman meets the Da Vinci Code.
[01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:48.960]   Oh, God.
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:50.320]   Damon is such a great book.
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:51.120]   I love Damon.
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:51.840]   Daniel Suarez, yeah.
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:53.600]   We interviewed him for Sword and Laser,
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:55.120]   and he's just super smart.
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:56.080]   And Freedom TM,
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:58.240]   which was the follow-up in that series.
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:02.080]   But yeah, I mean, all the jargon that Neil Stevenson uses
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.520]   as always is dead on--
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:04.080]   Very agree.
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:04.960]   I mean, he's speaking--
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:07.200]   If you weren't a geek like us,
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:09.920]   you wouldn't understand some of the things that they go--
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:11.200]   that they talk about in the books,
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:12.800]   because he doesn't explain them.
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:13.680]   He just expects--
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:17.760]   No, he expects that he's speaking to an informed audience
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:18.960]   on the subject matter.
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:20.480]   So it's kind of cool in that way.
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:21.520]   And then I also got--
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:23.920]   I have a lot of books, Ready Player One.
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:25.600]   Also excellent.
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:27.280]   I know you recommended that.
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:28.640]   So here's the problem.
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:30.560]   There's so many great books on "Offinable."
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:31.600]   It's hard to choose.
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:33.120]   Just two, but you only get two
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:34.480]   for your first month free.
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:35.840]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:40.480]   If you got Reendy and 1Q84,
[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:42.480]   you'd have like 90 hours.
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:43.120]   You'd never have to read again.
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:44.000]   Never have to--
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:44.480]   Never have to--
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:45.840]   Ready Player One is a good one,
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:47.760]   because it's definitely bite-sized.
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:49.520]   It's narrated by Will Wheaton,
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:51.600]   and it's super enjoyable to listen to.
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:53.360]   But it's only like a two-parter.
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:54.960]   It's not that long.
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.560]   I think the reason--
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:58.240]   Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:01.040]   Sword and Laser came from an off-hand comment of mine.
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:02.000]   Probably--
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:02.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:04.240]   You would like to think that, wouldn't you?
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:06.960]   Yeah, because I would think we were doing an audible ad,
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:09.760]   and I was talking about we should do a sci-fi book club.
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:12.080]   And I think you and Tom were there.
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:13.520]   No, I actually--
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:14.000]   I did.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:15.920]   I had to go back to those early emails
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:19.760]   because we were filing our LLC for the company for Sword and Laser.
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:22.720]   And I was like, yeah, we talked about this with Leo way back in the day,
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:23.920]   but you were just too busy.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:25.760]   You could have been in on the ground floor, Leo.
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:27.760]   I know. I regret that now bitterly.
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:30.640]   And I know big things are happening for Sword and Laser,
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:33.120]   but I'll let you tell the story when it happens.
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:36.880]   Meanwhile, audible.com/twit2,
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:40.080]   even if you should listen to Sword and Laser.
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:44.640]   And I think you guys do a very good job of picking books that are almost always unaudible.
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:45.840]   I don't know if you do that on purpose.
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:49.120]   It's one of the factors for sure, because our listeners,
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:53.440]   they take in content through a myriad of sources,
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:55.440]   and Audible is definitely one of their favorites.
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:56.160]   Yeah.
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:56.640]   As well.
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:57.120]   As well.
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:27:58.400]   It's the only way I can read these days.
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:27:59.680]   So look at this is on the front page.
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:01.520]   How have you told others about Audible?
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:05.360]   Audible has gone quickly because members like you tell colleagues.
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:09.440]   Tell us how many Audible members have joined because of your recommendation.
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:10.640]   Can I ask the chat room,
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:14.240]   how many of you have joined Audible because of my recommendation?
[01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:15.600]   Just so I can get a quick account,
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:17.040]   I'd like to put that number in here.
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:20.640]   10 trillion, me, me, me,
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:24.560]   me, one, two, women, slow down, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:26.640]   12, 11, 23, 74.
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:27.040]   Ow!
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:27.840]   Oh my gosh.
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:28.560]   Basically everyone.
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:32.080]   Okay.
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:34.160]   Can I write everyone in here?
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:38.240]   Let me just put, I'll put 9,999.
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:40.160]   Can you put the infinity sign?
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:40.880]   Infinity.
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:43.360]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:46.320]   We really, really love it.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:47.280]   And I know you will too.
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:49.280]   And look at all the people in the chat room who have joined because of this.
[01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:50.720]   I'm reading a fun book right now.
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:52.000]   Are you an Audible listener too?
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:52.560]   I thought.
[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:53.200]   What do you?
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:54.560]   I do every now and again.
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:55.520]   I, yeah.
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:56.560]   So you're reading this one?
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:59.680]   This one I'm reading, but it's also available in Audible.
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:00.800]   And what is that?
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:03.440]   It's called @Home, a short history of private life.
[01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:07.040]   And it's basically an anthropology or an artifact book
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:09.760]   about the way in which we live in Western world.
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:15.200]   And so he goes from room to room and does a history of why we have desks and tables and chairs.
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:15.840]   It's Bill Bryson.
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:16.560]   Hallway.
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:16.880]   Yeah.
[01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:17.760]   Oh, I love him.
[01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:19.520]   It's really good.
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:20.080]   That sounds cool.
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:21.040]   It's long.
[01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:22.480]   It's long, but it's a fun book.
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:23.840]   I cannot wait.
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:26.000]   I'm putting this in my Audible list right now.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.920]   Bill Bryson, first of all, is hysterical.
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:29.280]   If you haven't read his other stuff.
[01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:31.520]   You should just read everything Bill Bryson writes.
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:33.120]   This is a great subject.
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:36.560]   I know that Natalie is a, well, we probably, I don't know if people know,
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:38.080]   is a massive intellectual.
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:41.600]   And you, you, were you an anthropology major?
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:44.160]   I know you, you do a lot of anthropology studies.
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:47.120]   I'm all but dissertation for a PhD in sociology.
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:47.920]   Sociology.
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:48.480]   Okay.
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:49.760]   Well, that's what this is too, right?
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:51.840]   No, not really.
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:52.640]   More anthropology.
[01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:54.240]   Yeah.
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:57.200]   It's more anthropology than sociology, but it's just a fun read.
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:58.000]   I can't wait.
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.760]   I'm adding it to my list right now.
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:00.880]   Thank you for the recommendation.
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:04.000]   And here's a bunch of other Bill Bryson stuff.
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.600]   I'm a stranger here myself, a short history of nearly everything.
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:10.720]   A walk in the woods, which is his talk about, a book about writing,
[01:30:10.720 --> 01:30:12.400]   and walking down the Appalachian Trail.
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:16.400]   I mean, this, this guy is one of my favorite writers.
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:18.480]   So I can't wait.
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:20.160]   I didn't even know about this.
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:22.080]   Just came out last month.
[01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:22.960]   Thank you, Natalie.
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:24.320]   You are welcome.
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:25.840]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:27.920]   You're going to see right away why two books is not enough.
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.120]   You need more.
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:30.800]   You need more.
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:35.920]   So let's move along to pepper spray guy who has become,
[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:39.920]   this is, you know, it's, it's really, I was talking about this at Thanksgiving.
[01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:42.960]   Isn't that where you have, is it unusual that political
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:45.120]   conversations that the, that the Thanksgiving table seems to me
[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:48.480]   that happens every year because we have some very conservatives in our family
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:52.960]   and I'm a, I'm a liberal and we, we have very good conversations at the Thanksgiving.
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:55.920]   And we were talking about Occupy Wall Street.
[01:30:55.920 --> 01:31:02.480]   And one of the things that has, it's been an interesting social media event, right?
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:05.440]   But one of the things that's held it back is this lack of cohesiveness.
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:09.280]   And every once in a while, something happens in, in the world that co,
[01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:10.480]   that everything congeals.
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:13.920]   And I think this pepper spray guy became the story.
[01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:20.080]   And in, in ways that he did not realize this University of California, Davis police officer,
[01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:24.480]   did more for Occupy Wall Street than anybody else ever.
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:27.120]   And you're seeing these pictures on the internet everywhere.
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:35.680]   Here he is spraying God in the eyes as he tries to animate Adam in that famous Michelangelo.
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:38.560]   The internet works in wonderful ways, doesn't it?
[01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:39.040]   It is.
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:41.120]   And you've seen the one strange and unusual way.
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:44.640]   Where he's pepper spraying Yoda, it says, you may be excessive force be with you.
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:52.720]   It's been really good for the Know Your Meme website, which was, I think, started by Andrew
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:55.360]   Barron and then was purchased by ICANN has Cheeseburger.
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:59.680]   Well, yeah, it was started by, it was offshoot a rocket boom for a long time.
[01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.520]   And then it got bought by the Cheeseburger Network.
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:04.880]   So it's separated now from Rocket Boom.
[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:09.360]   But I think, you know, Kenyatta and a bunch of other people were really the kind of the four runners
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:10.880]   for Know Your Meme.
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:14.720]   It's really a great idea because somebody like me, I'm so old and out of touch,
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:17.440]   this way I can be hip and current with the kids.
[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:23.440]   I didn't know about Nyanne Cat until like a few days ago.
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:25.280]   Nyanne Cat.
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:26.480]   Nyanne Cat is how he says it.
[01:32:26.480 --> 01:32:27.440]   See, I don't even know how to say it.
[01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:29.280]   I say Nyanne Cat.
[01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:30.640]   I've heard it said a few different ways.
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:32.160]   When does that take off?
[01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:35.600]   Because it just exploded into the world of consciousness.
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:37.520]   It's a magical cat.
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:38.080]   What do you want?
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:42.320]   I like this, the iPhone whale.
[01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:44.000]   And now there's a pillow.
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.320]   The whale.
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:47.600]   The whale pillows.
[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:49.200]   Have you seen the whale text messages?
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:50.320]   You've seen those, right?
[01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:50.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:51.680]   No, yeah.
[01:32:51.680 --> 01:32:52.320]   Yeah, that's cute.
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:53.120]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:53.440]   Yeah.
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:53.600]   Okay.
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:54.480]   It's a fun meme.
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:55.040]   Yeah.
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:56.000]   That's a fun meme.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:56.240]   Yeah.
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:57.600]   Anyway.
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:02.480]   So, uh, so, uh.
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.480]   That's the brightening that the holiday views.
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:09.840]   I gotta have that.
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:11.120]   This is from Game of Thrones.
[01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:14.320]   And so, this really mixes many genres.
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:17.360]   Wow.
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:18.720]   For those of you listening in audio,
[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:20.720]   you're just going to have to go to knowyourmeme.com.
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:22.080]   I'm sorry, I got distracted.
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:24.400]   Moving along.
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:26.560]   Easy to do on that website.
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:27.040]   Not sure.
[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:27.040]   For sure.
[01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:28.160]   That website.
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:30.560]   You know, Leo, you talked about the conservatives.
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:33.760]   A lot of people who are very conservative don't like Occupy.
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:34.400]   Wall Street.
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:36.000]   But everybody that I know,
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.280]   regardless of their political affiliation,
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:41.040]   loves the pepper spray cop picture.
[01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:41.680]   Exactly.
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:42.640]   They're perfect.
[01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:43.920]   Everybody wins.
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:45.520]   But that's kind of my point.
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:50.480]   Is it, it put a, it, it, it, it, it, it, coalesced the whole thing.
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:52.080]   It was, it was like the little,
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:53.840]   when you're making a rock candy,
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:54.880]   and you know, you put a lot,
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:56.320]   super solution of sugar,
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:57.440]   and then you drop a little sugar,
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:58.400]   and it crystallizes.
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:33:59.120]   It was like that.
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:00.400]   Crystallized it.
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:03.360]   Even for people who, who hate Occupy.
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:04.560]   Even for the 1%.
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:07.520]   There's one on the new, on the know you're being paid.
[01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:09.120]   One of the images is of him.
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:11.040]   Instead of pepper spray,
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:14.560]   he's painting black over the Constitution,
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:15.600]   which is probably,
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:17.600]   probably the most pointed one I've seen of those.
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:18.960]   Wow.
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:21.360]   Let's see.
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:23.120]   Moving on.
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:25.440]   I just want to make sure we get all of the big stories.
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:29.040]   Anything we've missed?
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:30.080]   Spotify.
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:32.000]   We're trying to figure out what to do November 30th,
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:32.880]   which is Wednesday.
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:37.920]   Spotify has apparently an event coming Wednesday,
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:38.960]   which they say is a big deal,
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:40.000]   but I can't think,
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:40.240]   you know,
[01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:41.200]   Eileen and I talked about this,
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:41.600]   and she said,
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:42.800]   "Well, should we do breaking news?"
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:44.400]   And neither of us could think of anything
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:45.680]   that Spotify would announce
[01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:48.240]   that would be like a big deal.
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:50.080]   Anybody here have an idea?
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:51.520]   I mean, they're already on Facebook, right?
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:52.640]   They're already part of Facebook.
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:55.120]   What could Spotify be announcing
[01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:56.400]   that could be such a big deal?
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:58.240]   I think it's sound Apple.
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:34:59.280]   That'll be a big deal.
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:00.320]   That would be a big deal.
[01:35:00.320 --> 01:35:02.240]   That's not what they would do
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:03.120]   at a press conference.
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:04.160]   I don't like that.
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:04.640]   Yeah, but you...
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:06.400]   Well, they'd be announced, right?
[01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:07.600]   Maybe everything's free.
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:09.520]   Maybe they're giving it all away.
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:10.080]   You know what?
[01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:12.240]   That may be possible.
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:14.560]   Chat rooms as movies and TV.
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:16.560]   That could be interesting.
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:18.080]   That could be interesting.
[01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:20.080]   So we had a good conversation last week,
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:21.840]   and I got a lot of hate mail because of it.
[01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:23.600]   We had Caris Swisher, Mike Elegan,
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:25.200]   Ralph Needleman,
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:27.360]   and Kevin Rose.
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:28.960]   Kevin Rose.
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:30.480]   And I was talking about Google Music.
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:31.520]   Like, "Oh, this is exciting.
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:33.040]   Google's selling music."
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:33.680]   And everybody said,
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:36.160]   "Too little, too late.
[01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:36.880]   Spotify.
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:38.400]   The world is Spotify."
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:39.920]   No one wants to own music anymore.
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:41.840]   And I thought I'd ask you guys,
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:43.520]   because we got comments.
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:44.640]   People said that's ridiculous.
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:45.200]   That's absurd.
[01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:46.400]   Of course, people want to buy music.
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:49.200]   Do streaming services like Spotify,
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:53.120]   MOG and RDO make it necessary to buy music ever again?
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:54.160]   There were...
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:55.760]   Time 100% RDO at this point.
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:56.480]   Yeah, see?
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:36:00.080]   There were numbers released a couple of weeks ago
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:03.040]   that show that even though it's on the decline,
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:06.560]   the majority of music sales are still CD.
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:08.000]   But that's a lagging indicator.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.440]   I think that's probably true,
[01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:10.240]   but that's a lagging.
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:11.840]   You clearly CD sales.
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:15.280]   The projection was off in 2015.
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:17.040]   It wouldn't decline until...
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:19.200]   No, 50% until 2015.
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:21.680]   See, now we're not even talking about buying iTunes.
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:24.480]   We're talking about buying a physical plastic disc.
[01:36:24.480 --> 01:36:25.040]   Do you see these?
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:25.280]   Yep.
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.320]   Yep.
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:27.920]   I think that's a lagging indicator.
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:28.800]   Yeah, they still sell.
[01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:31.360]   I think that's just momentum inertia.
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:32.640]   Don't you?
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:34.000]   It doesn't matter why it is.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.640]   But the future is not right for CDs.
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:37.600]   Right.
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:39.360]   No, the future's not right for CDs,
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:41.360]   but you ask that people are still buying music.
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:41.680]   Right.
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:43.360]   Yes, they are.
[01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:43.680]   Yes.
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:46.080]   But I think Veronica's a bellwether.
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:47.280]   All right, Natalie, tiebreaker.
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:48.720]   Yeah, I know.
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:51.120]   I don't really buy music anymore either.
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:52.960]   I have a Spotify membership,
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:55.520]   although my husband Clayton decided that he wanted to
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:58.720]   cancel his Spotify account because iCloud came out.
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:01.200]   Because he had a massive library,
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:03.280]   so we thought, well, I could just play my own music.
[01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:05.280]   Tell me how that works out for him, will you?
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:06.080]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:07.920]   It made sense to him,
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:09.440]   and he thinks it's a great solution,
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:10.720]   but I kept my Spotify account.
[01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:12.880]   Because he'd already bought everything he ever wanted to listen to
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:14.320]   for the rest of his life.
[01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:15.520]   Right, as if...
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:16.320]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:17.280]   And then he'd decide...
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:18.640]   And then he can buy a little card.
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:19.200]   I don't know.
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:20.480]   That's his solution.
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:21.520]   There is an issue.
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:24.000]   You know, and I thought that Spotify would make me a lot cooler,
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.080]   and I would maybe find a lot more music.
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:26.880]   It really does.
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:28.240]   No, you listen to the same old crap.
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:28.880]   Yeah.
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:29.600]   Yeah.
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:34.240]   So I would use that argument to say I'm still going to listen to the same crap,
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:36.960]   although his library is much cooler than mine.
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:38.240]   I would like to...
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:42.960]   Call out a comment from Bonnie who guessed that perhaps the announcement would be
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:44.480]   that they're actually going to pay their musicians.
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:46.080]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:48.320]   So maybe that.
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:52.400]   You know, it's interesting because there is a debate over...
[01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:55.440]   It seems clear that Spotify does not make money for the musicians.
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:58.000]   You get very small payments from any of these streaming services.
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:00.320]   I said that last week, the panel said,
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:01.120]   "Well, they should all tour.
[01:38:01.120 --> 01:38:02.880]   That's how you make money nowadays anyway."
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:05.120]   But then there's some dispute over that.
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:08.160]   I think that actually musicians do make some money on Spotify.
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:09.440]   It's certainly a good discovery.
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:14.160]   I use Spotify to sample things that I've heard that are good.
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:15.600]   I go, I listen to a whole album,
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:18.000]   and then if I like it, I buy it because I actually want to...
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.360]   I want to own the bits.
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:21.040]   Why?
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:21.840]   That's what I want to know.
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:22.320]   Because why?
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:26.800]   You know, I don't trust Spotify to be there next week.
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:29.360]   So then you'll subscribe to Arria.
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:32.320]   I like the...
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:34.880]   I don't need a CD,
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:37.760]   but I like having it stored on my home server
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:40.400]   and being able to stream it through all my devices.
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:43.360]   And I know with that format, I could do that.
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:44.720]   And I like that.
[01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:45.360]   I guess it's true.
[01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:45.920]   They've seen it.
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:48.880]   I'm a little private dance parties once you're down in the basement.
[01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:49.360]   You don't have to do it.
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:50.160]   Exactly.
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:50.960]   Well, it's true.
[01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:52.480]   If the internet gets it...
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:55.520]   Natalie gets it.
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:56.320]   That's it.
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:59.600]   I don't know how she knew.
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:02.960]   I guess it's true if the internet went down,
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:05.280]   that Spotify, Arria, and Mog would not be much help.
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:07.040]   You would not be able to listen to music.
[01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:09.360]   I download my music.
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:11.440]   I have the subscription plan on Arria,
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:13.680]   so I can have music on my devices,
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:15.280]   so I could still use it that way.
[01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:15.680]   All right.
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:16.160]   There you go.
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:21.040]   So I'm going to ask a question of you young ladies here.
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:23.520]   You're just about the right age.
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:24.960]   Which of you had a Tamagotchi?
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:26.800]   Oh, I definitely did.
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:27.360]   I knew it.
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:28.240]   Yeah, I did too.
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:29.200]   Have you fed it lately?
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:33.600]   It's bad.
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:34.880]   I really wanted these.
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:36.400]   Is there a Tamagotchi app for iPhone?
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:38.400]   Because I would really like to have that.
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:39.440]   I was wondering if there's...
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:41.360]   There's connectimals on the Windows phone.
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:43.040]   I think that's one of the big apps on Windows phone.
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:49.840]   The Tamagotchi turns 15 on November 23rd.
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:52.960]   The first Tamagotchi went on sale in 1996.
[01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:55.440]   I had one, actually.
[01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:57.040]   I think my kids had one.
[01:39:57.040 --> 01:39:58.000]   My kids had one.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:58.800]   Yeah.
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:39:59.920]   And they liked to kill it.
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:01.600]   I mean, that was kind of like, you know,
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:03.680]   they wanted to see what happened when it died.
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:04.720]   So for those of you wondering,
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:05.840]   what the hell we're talking about,
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:08.080]   this is like a watch fob,
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:09.680]   or a little bigger than that device,
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:11.920]   that you would have to pet, feed,
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:14.720]   and take care of your animals.
[01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:15.920]   And if you didn't, they would die.
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:18.960]   And they had babies too, not just animals.
[01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:21.680]   They couldn't have nanobabies, right?
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:22.320]   What did you...
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:23.280]   Pooped and pooped and pooped.
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:26.240]   All they ever do.
[01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:28.800]   And then you could tell you...
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:30.240]   The whole bad part of having animal change.
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:32.160]   How accurate is that, Natalie?
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:33.200]   Is that as inaccurate?
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:36.320]   My mother likes to bring up my nanobabies
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:38.640]   as proof that I would never have been a good mom.
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:40.960]   She's sick because I used to spank it when it cried.
[01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:41.200]   Oh.
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:43.360]   I don't do that in real life.
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:43.680]   No.
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:44.400]   No.
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:46.800]   So ladies and gentlemen, good news.
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:50.720]   Tamagotchi's are available on iPhones.
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:52.080]   For free.
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:54.800]   Free for free.
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:55.120]   And I'm...
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:56.080]   Now, now.
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:56.480]   Yes.
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:40:56.960]   Here it is.
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:58.320]   Tamagotchi,
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:01.120]   round the world light from Namco Networks.
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:02.960]   It's free.
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:05.200]   You can interact with your Tamagot.
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:06.320]   It doesn't seem quite the same.
[01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:07.200]   I don't want it to look like that.
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:08.400]   I want it to look like a
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:09.440]   ouchy Tamagotchi.
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:13.040]   You know what, somebody would be smart to make it just like a gray and black LCD.
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:14.240]   Exactly.
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:14.560]   Yeah.
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:16.080]   Oh well.
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:17.520]   That's still pretty 8 bit.
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:20.560]   It's pretty clunky.
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:24.080]   Anyway, that is from Namco.
[01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:29.360]   Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to conclude this edition of this weekend tech.
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:33.200]   I want to thank Natalie Morris for not getting up to pee even once.
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:34.400]   I did.
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:35.600]   You didn't notice.
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:36.320]   Sneaky.
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:38.560]   I did.
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:39.520]   Sneaky.
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:42.400]   Natalie is contributed to CNBC,
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:44.080]   but she also has a Twitter,
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:46.560]   very active Twitter cat Natalie Morris with an i,
[01:41:46.560 --> 01:41:47.040]   no e.
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:54.080]   And we just love her and congratulations on your upcoming blessed event, as they used to say.
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:55.200]   Thank you.
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:56.960]   And I have another podcast you can listen to.
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:59.760]   Oh, we have the trending show that I do with my husband Clayton,
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:03.040]   which we just run down the weird things that trend online.
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:03.520]   I forgot.
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:05.600]   And I have a mommy beta mommy beta podcast as well.
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:06.160]   I forgot.
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:08.080]   I don't want to my thinking of course.
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:10.160]   Where should we go to find that?
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:12.480]   Natalie Morris.com is that the best place to go?
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:14.800]   You can find it there or it's on Clayton's network,
[01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:16.880]   which is grislyproductions.tv.
[01:42:17.360 --> 01:42:19.360]   Grisly productions.
[01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:20.960]   Grisly like the band.
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:26.480]   Grisly, grisly productions.
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:28.640]   Great to see you again, Natalie.
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:29.120]   Congratulations.
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:29.920]   Thanks for having me.
[01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:31.280]   I'm sorry we had bandwidth issues.
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:34.000]   I have a lot more genius things to say, but um.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.880]   Yeah, that's what I only feel bad that you weren't able to get
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:39.200]   as much in as you would like to have.
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:40.720]   Oh, that's all right.
[01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:43.120]   I can do a monologue after the show if you want.
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:44.240]   Give our love to.
[01:42:44.240 --> 01:42:45.760]   Give our love to Clayton and Miles.
[01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:46.720]   We'll do.
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:48.000]   Thanks for having me.
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:48.400]   Thank you.
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:49.520]   Great to have you.
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:50.640]   Veronica Belmont.
[01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:52.880]   I'm so proud of Veronica.
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:54.960]   She's such a star.
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:55.520]   Texan.
[01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:57.920]   I remember when you were a little audio engineer.
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:43:00.640]   Yeah, you've known me for a long time.
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:02.000]   Hiding behind the console.
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:02.960]   It buzzed out loud.
[01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:03.760]   Yep.
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:06.160]   And then they had the good sense to give you more and more airtime
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:08.080]   and the rest and now whatever happened to them.
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:10.800]   Veronica is the host of Texan.
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:11.520]   Where is that, Tom?
[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:12.880]   Where did that happen?
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:15.680]   To him, that old Molly would, whatever happened to her.
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:18.320]   They're still awesome.
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:19.120]   Yes, they are.
[01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:19.920]   But so are you.
[01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:20.720]   Dovakin.
[01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:21.760]   Dovakin.
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:23.120]   For walks and autons.
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:24.960]   Got that.
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:27.440]   When you're not playing Skyrim, Veronica also hosts
[01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:29.840]   tekzilla.takzilla.com with my buddy Patrick Norton.
[01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:32.000]   She's of course, host of the Sword and Laser podcast.
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.040]   And we'll be joining us January 15th for a brand new show.
[01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:36.400]   So excited.
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:37.200]   Come on.
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:37.680]   Game on.
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:38.240]   Game on.
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:41.280]   Bringing you the best in gaming news and reviews
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:42.400]   and all sorts of good stuff.
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:44.800]   Every Sunday night right after Twit.
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:47.840]   And you'd think that I was going to be on that show
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:49.280]   talking about Skyrim.
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:52.560]   But no, I'm going to do a bit called casual encounters.
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:54.480]   Casual encounters with Leo the Port.
[01:43:54.480 --> 01:43:56.720]   It's going to be amazing.
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:57.520]   I can't wait.
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:43:58.400]   It's going to be so much.
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:43:59.040]   It's such a good show.
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:00.560]   If you didn't see the beta, you could see it.
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:03.680]   We put a YouTube version up on inside.twit.tv.
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:05.760]   I don't even want to call it beta.
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:07.680]   It was kind of a tech rehearsal.
[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:11.120]   Just playing with some of the gear and the prompter and different stuff.
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:11.920]   But you know what?
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:12.880]   It came out really well.
[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:14.880]   I thought it was a lot of fun.
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:16.480]   And we got great feedback.
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:20.880]   We're still taking stories and suggestions and comments over at the Reddit.
[01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:22.560]   The Twit game on Reddit.
[01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:25.920]   So you can add stories that you want to hear on the show over there as well.
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:28.080]   And yeah, we're having a blast with it already.
[01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:30.320]   So I'm really excited for the 15th of January.
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:31.440]   I am so excited too.
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:32.160]   I cannot wait.
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:33.440]   Thank you, Veronica.
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:34.400]   Great to have you.
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:37.280]   Of course, you can find her at about.me/foronica.
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:39.840]   There can be but one.
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:45.360]   Dwight Silverman hosts a fabulous show on Pacifica Radio in Houston called.
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:46.560]   And I never remember this name.
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:49.040]   Technology Bites.
[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:50.480]   Technology Bites with a Y.
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:52.000]   Yes.
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:59.840]   And of course, you can catch his blog role and his posts like hourly at blog.cron.com/techblog.
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:03.200]   I actually review it every week to find out what are the big stories because Dwight knows.
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:05.120]   Dwight knows.
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:07.680]   Now, I remember when the iPad came out a year and a half ago,
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:08.480]   you were disappointed.
[01:45:08.480 --> 01:45:09.440]   Are you still disappointed?
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:11.040]   In the iPad?
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:11.920]   Oh, no.
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:12.320]   Uh-uh.
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:13.360]   Was I disappointed?
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:13.680]   Yes.
[01:45:13.680 --> 01:45:17.920]   I think, well, that was at the launch before we actually had it in our hands.
[01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:18.320]   It was.
[01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:19.440]   We were talking about that.
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:20.960]   You expected more, I think.
[01:45:20.960 --> 01:45:23.280]   I expected more until you actually used it.
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:24.640]   And you know something?
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:29.280]   That's true about the iPad today is that you still have people who are kind of
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:34.000]   traditional computer users who poo-poo it and until they get one.
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.040]   And then they have one and they go, "Oh."
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:37.280]   Yeah.
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:38.320]   Yeah.
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:40.320]   I get it.
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:43.760]   And I think that that's really true about that kind of device is that you actually have to
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:45.200]   lay hands on it to get it.
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:45.520]   Yeah.
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:46.240]   I think you're probably right.
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:47.920]   I think you're probably right.
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:50.240]   Well, so good to have you as always.
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:51.360]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:45:51.360 --> 01:45:52.480]   Thank you for having me, Leo.
[01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:52.880]   Yep.
[01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:57.520]   And I'm very happy to be part of the first all-sky episode in the new studio.
[01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:58.000]   We don't news.
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:01.280]   Normally, we wanted people in studio and we thought, well, since we had,
[01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:05.360]   the problem is that we can't get Dwight up here because he's in Houston.
[01:46:05.360 --> 01:46:07.520]   We can't get Natalie here because she's in New York.
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:09.120]   Veronica, I think she was a lazier.
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:10.320]   I wanted to play more Skyrim.
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:11.120]   But anyway.
[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:11.680]   Lazy.
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:13.840]   Feeling lazy.
[01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:18.640]   It's figuring she got a pass because it was a holiday.
[01:46:18.640 --> 01:46:19.120]   Yes.
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:20.480]   That's it exactly.
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:22.080]   That's what it was.
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:24.080]   She got a pass because it was a holiday.
[01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:28.720]   Pay no attention to the fact that she sounds like she's playing a video game in the background.
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:29.920]   I know what.
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:30.080]   What?
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:34.320]   No, that wasn't me.
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:34.880]   I swear.
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:36.240]   I hear something.
[01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:38.320]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:40.080]   We'll see you next week.
[01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:41.040]   Keep it up.
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:41.520]   Keep it up.
[01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:42.160]   Another twin.
[01:46:42.160 --> 01:46:44.000]   Send the can.
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:56.320]   Thanks for watching, I'll see you then!
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:59.240]   [MUSIC - BELLS around the corner]
