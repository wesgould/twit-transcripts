[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.400]   We got all of the original characters together again.
[00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.400]   We got the old band back together again here, Kevin, a little champagne.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.400]   Thank you, sir.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.400]   Kevin Rose.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.400]   Let me pour you a glass.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.400]   Formerly CEO of Dig, host of Dig Nation, part owner of Revision...
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.400]   If I get full owner of Revision 3, I don't know who owns Revision 3.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.400]   And...
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.400]   And...
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.400]   And what's something else?
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.400]   Oh, that milk thing.
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.400]   He's in a Belgian trans band.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.400]   That's right.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.400]   Nice.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.400]   Cold.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.400]   Milk.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.400]   Ink.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.400]   Kevin Rose, great to have you back.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.400]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.400]   In the studio.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.400]   Thanks for coming up.
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.400]   I'm still here.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.400]   Six years.
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.400]   That's insane.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.400]   Six years.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.400]   We're going into our seventh year and it is...
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.400]   I'm just really thrilled.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.400]   We should take the 21st Amendment.
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.400]   I know.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.400]   Yeah, seriously.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.400]   Now, I'm not counting that one.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.400]   That was Twit Zero, which you were all at.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.400]   I don't know if...
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.400]   Robert, were you there the first one?
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.400]   I know.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.400]   I think I was like the second one.
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.400]   I still have those MP3s.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.400]   We still have to play it if you want to hear them.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.400]   We still have them online.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.400]   We still have a TV/1.
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.400]   There was no video back then at all.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.400]   No, we didn't do video.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.400]   The first video was 20 episode 23.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   You were recording on probably a $800 DAT player and you could
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.400]   probably buy something that does that now.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.400]   It's crappier than that.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.400]   I'll tell you.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.400]   You probably do with this.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.400]   You want to hear the first...
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.400]   This is a slave.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.400]   We call it revenge of the screens.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   I'll tell you.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   I'll tell you.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.400]   You probably do with this.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.400]   You probably do with this.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.400]   You want to hear the first...
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.400]   This is a slave.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.400]   We call it revenge of the screens.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.400]   We also hear Robert Heron Heron Fidelity.
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.400]   You were on the first one, weren't you?
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.400]   Yeah, I think it was Robert Kevin Patrick Norton and he's in
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.400]   absentia.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.400]   David wasn't on the first one but he was on the zero.
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.400]   Okay, I wasn't on zero.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.400]   I was on the one.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.400]   It was Robert.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.400]   And I was pulling you all up on Skype on one instance of Skype
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.400]   and we had to back up with the DAT record.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.400]   Cheers.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.400]   Wow.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.400]   Robert Heron.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.400]   It's ten more years.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.400]   Ten is that all I get?
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.400]   We had another gig.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.400]   All right, twenty-eighth.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.400]   Our seventh year of this week in tech.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.400]   John C. Du Bois, people say, "Well, where's John?
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.400]   John C. Du Bois did not join the show till episode five."
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.400]   You're right, Kevin.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.400]   Our first video episode wasn't until 23.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.400]   We did that at the Apple Store.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.400]   And I'm all sweaty in it because it was just me running around
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.400]   and wiring the whole thing up and I just worked up a hell of a sweat.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.400]   I forgot it was video, I guess.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.400]   That was challenging.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.400]   Roger McGwin was with us.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.400]   You were there for that, right?
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.400]   I think you were doing it at the Apple Store.
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.400]   It was definitely one at the Apple Store.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.400]   And then we started doing it in a bar for a while.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.400]   Remember that?
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.400]   That didn't work out so well.
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.400]   Oh, it was up here.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.400]   Yeah.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.400]   That was kind of fun, though.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.400]   You bought all those Canon XL2.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.400]   That's what you got all around you.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.400]   I bought those because I wasn't doing videos.
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.400]   So I bought these cameras.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.400]   Fourteen thousand dollars worth of cameras thinking we were going to do video
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.400]   and then we abandoned it because it was such a bad idea.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   It was so hard to do it in bars and coffee shops.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.400]   Came back here, continued to do it for audio.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.400]   Just started a video about three years ago.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.400]   And now we're streaming 40 hours a week.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.400]   We had 55 million downloads in the last 12 months, 5 million a month now.
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.400]   Wow.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.400]   That is awesome.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.400]   And we're building a 10,000 square foot studio, which we can barely afford.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.400]   But you need it.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.400]   But you can see we're jammed in this room.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.400]   I can't do any more shows.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.400]   You know, Tom Merritt does his new show, Tech News, today, every afternoon with this many people.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.400]   And this was never set up for that.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.400]   It was set up for me by myself.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.400]   So yeah, we're completely redesigning everything.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.400]   And that's kind of fun.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.400]   But you've been through this a few times, Kevin.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.400]   We were in the upstairs bedroom or something.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.400]   The smallest room in this room.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.400]   We were sitting on the floor.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.400]   You were sitting on the floor.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.400]   It was about five and a half years ago.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.400]   We did System Episode 4, which was about how to podcast.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.400]   It was how to podcast.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.400]   And here's the best example of how to go from the professionals you can get.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.400]   And at the time back then, I mean, it was nothing even compared to this.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.400]   Well, then that's why I wonder what net casting or podcasting will look like in five years
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.400]   from now and in 10 years from now.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.400]   I mean, I think it's when I was at when we were at the NAB show and Robert, next time you got to come.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.400]   I will.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.400]   I didn't make it this year.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.400]   What was clear was that all of this $100,000,000,000 broadcast equipment was just coming down, down, down, more and more affordable.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.400]   More and more people could do exactly what we do, you know, on a small budget.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.400]   So I think you're going to see a lot of networks like this.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.400]   I mean, right now it's revision three.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.400]   It's us.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.400]   Callie Lewis is Libid Lobster.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.400]   There's a handful.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.400]   But I think, you know, there's this.
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.400]   This tricaster is still like the core for a lot of the small video.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.400]   It is for us.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.400]   We couldn't do it without.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.400]   I don't see too many other solutions out there.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.400]   Black Magic showed a $1,000 box.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.400]   I was very impressed.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.400]   Hardware switcher.
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.400]   I saw that.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.400]   You guys, what do you use it?
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.400]   A revision three.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.400]   We use a switcher.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.400]   We use a slate broadcast picks slate.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.400]   No, not broadcast picks.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.400]   Who makes the switcher?
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.400]   It's Darnit.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.400]   It's going to ask Graham is your premium.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.400]   Graham is first failure.
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:36.400]   Actually, we have a lot of money in there.
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.400]   But see, you had venture capital.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.400]   And I think sometimes venture capital is bad for discipline because you have too much money
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.400]   you can spend.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.400]   We could only spend what we made.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.400]   Yeah, I'm going.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.400]   My new startup is all about the.
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.400]   I'm so excited.
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.400]   Tell me about milk.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.400]   So milk is essentially a small group of developers and one designer.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.400]   Myself is a product person.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.400]   Dan Burka.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.400]   Yeah, Daniel Burka joined us as our head designer.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.400]   Your old, he was the guy who helped you with Dig way back.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.400]   Yeah, so Daniel joined me at Dig probably two months in.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.400]   And he turned my nasty, ugly, utilitarian design into something beautiful and elegant.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.400]   One of the best designers out there.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.400]   He's awesome.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.400]   In fact, I want to ask you about Glitch because you probably know about Glitch.
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.400]   But we'll ask you in a bit.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.400]   But so this is milk ink.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.400]   The company is called Milk.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.400]   Yes.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.400]   It's called milk.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.400]   The website is milk ink.com.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.400]   We're at milk on Twitter and Facebook.com/milk.
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.400]   So all it says on the site, we build apps.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.400]   But what does that mean?
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.400]   So mobile?
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.400]   Yeah, we want to do mobile.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.400]   I think that mobile is a lot of fun right now.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.400]   It's just such a really cool space.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:44.400]   And there's all these new technologies like GPS and the cameras and all the stuff that
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.400]   the accelerometers that you have access to that I've never worked with.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.400]   So I'm just excited to build some new kind of next generation apps and like quality apps.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.400]   So you're the vision guy?
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:08:00.400]   Yeah, basically I've always been kind of a combination of a project manager/product guy/marketing/business/designer.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:10.400]   So I'll create like wireframe designs and a couple different programs I use.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.400]   Hand them off to Daniel.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.400]   It'll be all the kind of usability and flow of an application.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.400]   So I'll say like if a user presses this, it goes to this screen.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.400]   This is how this button should function.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.400]   This is what I want to happen here.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.400]   And then I mock that all up with all the flow and then Daniel actually makes beautiful, you
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.400]   know, nice versions that we debate some of the features and then we pass it over to the
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.400]   developers who then code it up.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.400]   And the developers are also part of the group or are they going to be contract?
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.400]   Yeah, so there's a total of six of us.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.400]   We have two iOS developers.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:44.400]   One back in kind of utility/iOS guy that does a little bit of everything, does all of our back in stuff.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.400]   It helps us scale.
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.400]   One BD person and then myself and Daniel the designer.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.400]   No Android guy.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.400]   No Android.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.400]   But our iOS developers have done Android in the past.
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.400]   So they could.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.400]   If something hits, we're basically going to launch an Android version probably six months later.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.400]   One of the things that you said, I think it was a tech crunch interview, you said, "We'll
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.400]   kill our babies fast if they don't fly.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.400]   You're not going to waste time with a dud."
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.400]   Yeah, I mean for us, we want to go after a couple of big ideas and we know, you know, I could
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.400]   go and build something that is just, I don't know, a slightly different version of a really
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.400]   popular app that's out there like say Quora or something like that.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.400]   And you can do that and that's kind of like, it's an interesting space.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:27.400]   I mean like, Yammer is a great version of a private version of Twitter for businesses
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.400]   and that's awesome.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:33.400]   But we want to try some bigger, bolder ideas and we know that some of those actually will fail.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.400]   I mean, it's just bound to happen.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.400]   So you're not, it's interesting because you're not an incubator.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.400]   First I thought, oh, it's kind of like IdeaLab, Bill Gross's idea.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.400]   But you're not an incubator.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.400]   People aren't going to come to you.
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.400]   No, they're not.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.400]   You're going to generate all the ideas.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.400]   Right, exactly.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.400]   We have two or three ideas on the table right now.
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.400]   I love this.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.400]   That we want to go after.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.640]   And we're going to build one first, launch it, iterate on top of it, you know, spend a
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.640]   few months working with it and if it doesn't work out, we'll just shoot in the head and
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.800]   move on to something else.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.960]   I'm super excited for this knowing Kevin fairly well and I think, you know, some of the things
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.440]   that you're best at is coming up with really cool, innovative ideas and sometimes they're
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.600]   good and sometimes they might not be good because they always have new ideas.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.040]   A lot of them either making someone else's process better or something that someone else
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.040]   hasn't tried.
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:17.120]   So having the kind of company that milk is allows you the freedom to fail and think of
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.000]   more ideas because I mean, we're all kind of ADD to some extent.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.200]   So you might get excited about something and if it sticks, that's great and you can still,
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.360]   even if it's doing well, go on to something else or just, you know, kill it like you said
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.000]   and go on to the next thing that you're excited about.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.080]   I think it's like perfect for what Kevin excels at.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.080]   It's going to be fun.
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.080]   I can't wait.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.080]   That's a great idea.
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.880]   And it's almost old fashioned.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:42.560]   It's kind of like a workshop where, you know, the whole thing gets produced handcrafted
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.560]   software.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.560]   I like the idea a lot.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.800]   Yeah, it's cool and that we spend most of our time working on one app and then, you
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.920]   know, like last Friday we sat down in that afternoon, had a couple of beers and they were
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.040]   like, okay, what are we going to do is kind of our nights and weekends project where,
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.800]   you know, it's like a small idea.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.160]   A 20% but with our own idea.
[00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:03.040]   So we have another one that we're kind of cooking up on the side and it's awesome.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.320]   Self funded, are you going to?
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.200]   I self funded the first few months and now I'm about to close funding so that'll be done
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.920]   sometime in the next week or so.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.920]   Okay.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.520]   So the whole idea though, like you said about venture capital, I'm really, you know, having
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:21.120]   raised a lot of money for both revision three and dig and all these companies.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.760]   There's pluses to that and there's also downsides that are taking on a bunch of capital.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.880]   I mean, you not only delete yourself but take on board seats.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.240]   You're no longer in control of the company.
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.040]   I mean, there's just a bunch of things there.
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.320]   So it means about control, not so much giving up percentage of the company.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.320]   It's giving up control.
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.160]   I have to say that probably your experience with dig and form that a little bit.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.160]   I mean, absolutely.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:43.840]   Must have been a little frustrating at times.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.760]   If you wanted to, I'm sure, like say you wanted more money to build your studio, you
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.040]   could probably get it in a heartbeat without losing much.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.040]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.040]   Nowadays you can, can't you?
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.200]   So for you, I bet you, you could get the money you need to finish off the studio immediately
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:58.720]   and I bet you'd give off 5%.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.720]   Okay.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.720]   Less than that.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.720]   Okay.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.720]   Done.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.720]   You should seriously do it.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.960]   If you said I'm entertaining, if you're together like 5%, I mean, that's not a big
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:09.960]   deal.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.760]   We've, we've, we've already set up an operating structure where 30% of the company is set
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.680]   aside for that and for employees and it's, and I still have 70%.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.000]   So I still have absolute control.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Is that right, Kevin?
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.480]   Even if I, as long as I can have more than majority, they can't take it away from me.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.120]   That's, that's what I care about, right?
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.120]   That's, that's a big piece of it.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.400]   I know so many entrepreneurs, I think of Steve Jobs, but I think of also smaller companies
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.120]   where the founder gets pushed out by the board and the investors.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.640]   Yeah, but there's other ways to structure it.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:39.320]   So another way, what you can do is, so you wonder how does Zuckerberg maintain control,
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.320]   right?
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.320]   No kidding.
[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.200]   So one of the things that he did, that was really smart and a lot of companies are starting
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.480]   to do this is where when you go in as the founder, if you have a product that's really
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.560]   successful, you can demand certain rights that other people wouldn't get.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.840]   So one of the things that I believe that he did was that you tell the other employees
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:01.400]   sign an agreement saying that their common vote goes with the founder.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.160]   So even though you don't control the stock, you control the common stock vote.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.160]   Which is what you want.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.920]   And as long as you control the vote, you won't get overthrown.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:13.000]   So we have class A, which I, I learned this from Paul Allen.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.320]   We have class A stock, which is mine.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.800]   And then I'm giving the other stock I'm giving out as a class B stock.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.200]   I remember Paul did that to us.
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.120]   Yeah, but I mean, he was saying, look, I'm losing money here.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.080]   So some people had stock that Paul Allen gave to serve.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.960]   I have 300 something thousand shares.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.960]   But he's sold.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.320]   But it was worthless.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.360]   But even like, you know, if, you know, but it applies, you have a percentage of the company
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.360]   but you're ready.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.360]   If you lose his money, you don't have any money.
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.040]   Well, I mean, if you run a company and you raise a million dollars in the company sells
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.920]   years later for a million dollars, those investors who invested the million dollars
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:40.920]   you get their money from.
[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.720]   And that's how I've set it up to.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:47.000]   I learned the hard way.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.480]   So there's other things to the consumer.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.480]   Like let's say, for instance, you go and you raise a couple million bucks and then you
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.400]   sell the company for five million dollars.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.400]   You think, Oh, that's great.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.840]   You know, you get paid out, right?
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:01.440]   In some cases, the investors that you're raising the money from, they have a guaranteed outcome,
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.760]   meaning that they want to see like a five X return whenever maybe.
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.920]   And so they can go in and claw back some of the shares from you.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.560]   And then you'll end up with absolutely nothing, you know, so that's, that's where you can
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.960]   really get screwed.
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.760]   So it's really tricky stuff.
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.680]   I, you know, Paul Graham said, you don't bootstrap your own company.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.280]   He also said you need two founders.
[00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.560]   I'm bootstrapping with my single soul self.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.560]   So I'm.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.240]   I'm actually raising money like you could go out there and do a convertible note right
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.600]   now and give away just like a percent or two and put, you know, a million and a half bucks
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.840]   in the bank and build out this entire thing.
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.880]   I could get my boat.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:41.320]   So what you don't do with the money, if you need a driver.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.320]   So tell me about glitch.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.720]   This is something that everybody's talking about.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:47.080]   It's going to go into beta, a little bit more public beta next week.
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:51.080]   Daniel Burka, the designer, somebody, I haven't played it, but a number of people have played
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.060]   it in the chat room said it's pretty cool.
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.060]   You must have played it by now.
[00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:56.460]   Yeah, I've played it.
[00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:00.840]   So massively multiplayer online role playing game.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.840]   It's really cool.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:05.960]   It's like a side scroller, 2D, really beautiful.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.480]   Well, that's already weird because I never heard of a massively multiplayer side scroll.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.600]   Yeah, it's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.120]   They've been working on it now for about a year and a half.
[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.120]   It's pretty.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.120]   Yeah, it's really beautiful.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.120]   Yeah.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.720]   And it's come from some of the Flickr founder.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.200]   So the founder, Stuart Butterfield.
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.200]   Oh, Stuart Butterfield.
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.200]   This is his new thing.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.540]   Well, you know, it's funny Flickr was a game before it was a photo set.
[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:28.540]   Yeah, so that's the idea.
[00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:29.700]   That's basically what they wanted to do was they actually--
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.780]   The actual thing that Flickr was supposed to be.
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:36.460]   So Cal, the CTO Flickr and Stuart joined up to create this.
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.820]   It's really pretty.
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.380]   Are these all of Daniel's drawings?
[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:43.580]   No, some of the stuff is his-- there was a couple other illustrators that worked with
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.460]   him on this stuff.
[00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:50.340]   He did pretty much all the UI stuff, so like that kind of stuff right there.
[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:57.180]   So it seems like this is an online role-playing game for people who don't want to do the
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:01.040]   sword and sorcery genre or the sci-fi genre.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.160]   This is, I think, more like sword and sorcery.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.920]   Well, it's not like--
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:05.920]   There's fantasy.
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:06.840]   It's a side-scroller like that.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.400]   It's maybe like a little big planet or something like that kind of.
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.200]   Yeah, I've spent a lot of time on it.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.200]   Are there's animals?
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.200]   You have to raise animals?
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.200]   He's the--
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.200]   He's like web based?
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.200]   Is it web based?
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.200]   Yes, it's web based.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.200]   Like Flash.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.200]   I mean, I like that.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.200]   There's alchemy.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.200]   There's home improvement.
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.200]   There's music.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.200]   All the crafting sports.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.200]   It's kind of the glee version of World of Warcraft.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.200]   You can make drinks.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.200]   But can you like--
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.200]   Interesting.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.200]   Can you sell cows though?
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:42.620]   I don't think you can sell cows.
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.500]   I am so damn hooked on these stupid farming games.
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:49.200]   Please, somebody, just tie my wrists and hang me from the mast.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.200]   I need help badly, Robert.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.120]   The old tech TV headquarters is all zing.
[00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.320]   It's all zinga, isn't it?
[00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.320]   Yep.
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.320]   It shows you how well they're doing.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.320]   Okay.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.320]   Well, good old 650 towns and streams.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.320]   650 towns.
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.800]   No, no, they took over the whole thing.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.800]   Oh.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.800]   That's a cool building.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:04.800]   The old-fashioned building?
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.600]   That incredible atrium lobby thing.
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:08.600]   They actually--
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.600]   They actually--
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.280]   When they had the exotic erotic ball there, that--
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.200]   They started putting like little planetoid objects in there.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.760]   And then they painted them into the walls to go along with the physical ones in the
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.760]   lobby.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.760]   Yeah, that was weird.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:19.760]   I missed that.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.760]   I missed that.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.760]   I must have left before they put the planetoids.
[00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.760]   No, you were there.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.760]   Really?
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:25.760]   Yeah.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:26.760]   Didn't we?
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:27.960]   It was in the front lobby.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.760]   We all left at the same time.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.760]   You know, I'm--
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.760]   No, we did not all leave at the same time.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.760]   No, we really, really--
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.760]   I made an early exit.
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.480]   In fact, I would like to point out that now, TWIT is-- I've been doing TWIT as long as I
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:40.040]   was at tech TV, actually a month longer.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.340]   He started in 1998, right?
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.320]   I started in May 1998 for tech TV.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.680]   That's when it launched May 11, 1998.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:52.160]   And the day they were sold, which I think was April 1, 2004, April 2004.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:57.160]   So after five years and 11 months, they were sold, they let me go.
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.160]   So I was gone.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.120]   But Comcast came and I went.
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.120]   I remember when it was--
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.800]   And so I've been here longer by a month.
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.760]   That whole deal was going down.
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.440]   And it was kind of cool because-- not cool that it went down, but it was cool that all
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:12.400]   of the three of us, anyway, not Robert, were all in DC doing all that DC stuff.
[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.400]   So back on the track--
[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.400]   Oh, I was there with you.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.400]   We were interviewing--
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.960]   I was happening in San Francisco.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:21.240]   We did a whole week of going through all the interesting, cool technology things going
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.240]   on in Washington.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.240]   And we interviewed Michael--
[00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.240]   I remember that.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.040]   --from the FAA down to-- heck, I remember traveling to Honeywell that does, like, body
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.040]   of--
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.040]   Oh, I did that.
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.040]   --tech technology.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.480]   And all these kinds of different-- everything from the government agencies down to just
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.800]   interesting military technologies that you might be able to see there.
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.280]   It was a complete side deal, but we just happened to be way over there.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:44.360]   It was nice to be away from kind of the devastating chaos that was taking place in
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.360]   the world.
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.360]   I was interviewing Michael-- what was his name?
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.360]   His chairman of the FCC.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.360]   Paul, Michael Paul, chairman of the FCC.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.360]   I remember that.
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.360]   And he was a fan.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.360]   He was a tech TV fan.
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.360]   And he said, "What's going on?"
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.080]   And I said, "Well, it's pretty much the end of tech TV.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.080]   Comcast has bought us."
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.200]   It was fun because you went-- I think one of the segments you did is you took a stroll
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.440]   through the Best Buy with the chairman of the FCC.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.440]   Wasn't that fun?
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.440]   I do remember that.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.440]   Yeah, it was fun.
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.280]   And he's just talking about all the gadgets that he wants to have at home and how he uses
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.280]   them.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.280]   Can I tell you something?
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:10.280]   I'm at the NAB show.
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.960]   And you know, you go around these things.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.600]   People come up to you, you know, every five minutes somebody comes up and says, "Oh, Leo."
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:20.080]   And invariably they say, "Screen savers, tech TV.
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.240]   I've been watching you since ZD TV or tech TV."
[00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:28.160]   And many of the younger guys said, "I grew up watching the screen savers as why I'm a geek,
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.120]   as why I'm in this business."
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.520]   Still, to this day.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:34.080]   I mean, we did something there, Kevin.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:36.360]   I still get that at the dignity and events.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.360]   People come up and say, "Of course."
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.360]   "Watching you since tech TV."
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.160]   Since tech TV, yeah.
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.680]   I call it tech TV because I'm not going to say ZD TV then tech TV and all that.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.960]   Has anybody read Paul Allen's book where he slams Bill Gates?
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:52.040]   He just came out with a tell all somebody in the chat room mentioned he's on 60 minutes
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.040]   tonight.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.040]   Tonight he's on 60 minutes.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.040]   I don't know.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.040]   I haven't seen 60 minutes episode yet.
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.040]   It's on tonight.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.040]   I wonder if he mentions us.
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.800]   No, he's not going to mention us.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.360]   Just one of many bad business deals that Paul Allen made.
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.360]   All right.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.440]   Well, there's a lot to talk about in just a little bit.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.440]   We're going to talk about Portal 2 and an interesting promotion as long as we're talking
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:10.440]   about video games.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.440]   I'm from rumored.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.120]   I preloaded that game.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.120]   Did you?
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.120]   I'm excited.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.120]   Ready to go for Tuesday.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.120]   You can't run it until they release it, right?
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.120]   On Tuesday.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.120]   Middle of the work week.
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:21.120]   That's good timing.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.800]   Such a good game.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:23.800]   I can't wait.
[00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:24.800]   I'm actually excited.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.360]   I have a Nintendo at E3 perhaps.
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.600]   That's exciting.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.600]   That's the rumor.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.600]   That could be cool.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:31.600]   I will talk about it.
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:36.240]   And is France plotting to kill the free internet plus a video recorded greeting from Patrick
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.240]   Norton?
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.480]   It's in the desert as usual.
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.400]   Patrick just can't sit still, can he?
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.160]   None of that surprises me.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:50.360]   You know who's been with the Twitter for longer than, well, we have three sponsors who have
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.360]   been with us.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.360]   It's almost the beginning.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:53.360]   Citrix is one of them.
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:57.120]   But here's a product that they did not have or they weren't promoting at least when we first
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.680]   started.
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.360]   Really great product called Go to Assist Express.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.320]   I want you to give it a try today.
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.320]   They tell me.
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.680]   Well, I only dimly remember this, that we use this on the screen savers where we're trying
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.680]   to use this on the screen savers to help people with their computers.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.720]   Well, it's come a long way since 1998.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:19.480]   Go to Assist Express uses that Citrix remote access back end to make it easy to do remote
[00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:20.480]   support.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.200]   Stop doing phone support.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.600]   Just reach into their computer and fix it.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:26.840]   It's so much easier.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:30.960]   And because you can do eight sessions at once, you can do unattended sessions.
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.320]   You can work with a Mac on a PC and vice versa.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.400]   Really, the sky's the limit.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.120]   We're talking about a major improvement in productivity.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.080]   If you're in the support business or if you just do as I do and I'm on the phone with
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:49.480]   my mom, she says, I can't figure out how to, where my quickened data went.
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.720]   Go to assist express.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:56.120]   Go to assist.com/twit right now to try it free for 30 days.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.760]   They have day passes as well as month subscriptions.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.240]   So you can use the plan that makes sense for you.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.320]   But for now, try them on the subscription free.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.520]   Go to assist.com/twit.
[00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.160]   Did anybody get invited?
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.640]   You get invited to France?
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.520]   What was France?
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:13.520]   I'm waiting.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.520]   I don't know if this is a hoax or not.
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:21.160]   I got an email this week from the deputy minister of the interior in France, the G8
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.320]   summit to the end of May.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:23.760]   Ah, G8.
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.000]   And they're doing this thing called EGA.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.800]   Sarkozy, I'm supposed to get a gilt-edged envelope on Monday.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.120]   I think it might be a hoax.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:32.120]   I'm not holding my breath.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.400]   Although I called Lewick and he said, oh no, I was invited.
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.400]   You're going.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:36.400]   Nice.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:41.600]   So they asked internet leaders, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Google's former CEO Eric Schmidt,
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.120]   I guess he's chairman of the board now, so that counts.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:52.760]   Mark Zuckerberg and me, and I'm sure 500 other close friends, to go and talk about internet
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:23:00.160]   and security, internet and economy, internet and society with Sarkozy and his leaders prior
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:05.560]   to the G8 summit to prepare a white paper for the G8 about the internet and how it should
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:07.640]   be treated.
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.760]   And why is France wanting to be the catalyst in this?
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.800]   Well, G8 is in France, is in Doville.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.560]   So this is three days before the G8 in Paris.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.560]   Is it getting them up to speed on the current events?
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.560]   I think they're trying.
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.440]   You know, Sarkozy is notorious for kind of being anti-internet.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:25.000]   He's the guy who kind of formulated the three strikes laws that are in effect in France,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.720]   you know, three accusations of piracy and you're offline forever.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:29.720]   Wow.
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.800]   Meaning longer than Nick was a lot, not rather be online.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.320]   Yes, forever.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:36.320]   And other things.
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:40.720]   So he's kind of notoriously kind of pro business, pro big business and anti internet neutrality.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.320]   So I'll be curious.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.520]   It's a chance in some ways it's a chance.
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:49.240]   I think for people like me who are feel very strong on the other side to say, hey, wait
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.240]   a minute.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.240]   Nick, baby.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.720]   Anyway, I don't know.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.160]   So I was just curious if anybody else's maybe I think it's a hoax.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:00.920]   I think there just needs to be more honest discussion about the damages that are possible.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:05.360]   It seems like they always overestimate or overstate how much money is lost when somebody
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.880]   pirates software or something like that.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.840]   I guess what I would say is what is the damage to society?
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:16.120]   If you bend over backwards to protect these content holders, there's the pendulum swings,
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.360]   of course.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.240]   And I believe, I mean, content holders have rights.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.080]   I'm not saying that you create something of value.
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.880]   You have the right to protect it.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.120]   I'm not saying that.
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.960]   But when they go so far as to knock people off the internet for three accusations, when
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:36.680]   they kind of go to the point beyond, you know, do process, then your the pendulum is swung
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.680]   too far.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.480]   That internet services become something akin to, I'd say a utility that's almost necessary
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.480]   nowadays.
[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.480]   Well, yes.
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.680]   Not to say as water or air, but well, there was a country.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.680]   It's close.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.040]   It's said that it should be an akin to an inalienable right.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.040]   It should be a right.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.040]   It's a human right.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.600]   I guess you'd open it up to more people.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.000]   Should be and let's face it.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.480]   Look at what Kevin's doing.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.480]   Innovation.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.480]   Want to drink?
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.480]   Have a drink.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.480]   Innovation.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.680]   An open internet is calling me out.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.520]   It's like, Oh, look what Kevin's doing.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.520]   He's drinking.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.320]   No, I was talking about milk, but I'm just saying that's because of the internet that
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.680]   you can create a little startup, create this little thing.
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.360]   And yet it is an international, it's a global company out of the box.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.360]   Right.
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:23.320]   It's like to say like you could never block someone from starting a business, right?
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.680]   Even if you go to jail, you become a, you know, you go to prison and come back, you
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.320]   can still start at any new company and why?
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.880]   How could you not start something on the internet?
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.880]   Right.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.880]   Did you see what happened with Amazon?
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.880]   No.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.640]   With the lawsuit with the streaming music service.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.640]   Yeah.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.680]   So Amazon's cloud service, the music industry's pissed.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:38.680]   Sony's pissed.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:42.920]   They wrote a little other example of just Amazon responded saying screw you.
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.080]   I agree with Amazon.
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.080]   So do you see what, what is it?
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.080]   Do you have a letter or funny?
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:50.360]   No, but the story, I mean, the story that I just read on the way up here is that if you
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:55.240]   buy, if you buy, if you buy, Kevin was driving very fast, I was hiding in the back reading
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:56.240]   the articles.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.240]   But did you drive the career?
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.240]   I did.
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.240]   I turned on my Wi-Fi.
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.960]   And so I have Wi-Fi on the little Verizon phone.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:03.960]   Awesome.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:04.960]   And so we were surfing the web.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:09.160]   But the story essentially says that, you know, if you own a piece of music and you store
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.040]   it on the cloud, in order to access the piece of music that you bought that's stored on
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.600]   the cloud, you should not have to pay a licensing fee.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:16.600]   And I agree.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.600]   Of course.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:18.600]   If you buy a piece of music, you own it.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.600]   Right.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.600]   They want to try to stream your feet.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.600]   You don't own it.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.600]   And so Amazon said back off.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:23.600]   They wrote and said back off.
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.600]   No.
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:29.640]   Which is basically protecting their clients who are keeping data on the cloud, among other
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.640]   things.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.640]   We talked about this last week.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.320]   It's my opinion that Apple was poised to launch this service.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.360]   They knew Amazon was getting close.
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.600]   They said, okay, go ahead.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.600]   You first.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.280]   Because they figured the lawsuits would all hit the first guy, which of course they're
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.280]   going to.
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.280]   And Amazon defend this.
[00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.720]   And then if it goes well for Amazon, we'll do it.
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:50.680]   Amazon wrote, there's been speculation that we are looking for licenses for cloud drive
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.640]   and cloud player licenses from the record companies.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.320]   We're not looking for licenses.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.960]   No licenses are required.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:06.280]   Cloud player is a media management and playback application, not unlike Windows Media Player
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:12.080]   and any number of other media management applications that let customers manage and play their
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.480]   music.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:17.360]   It requires a license from content owners, no more than those applications do.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:18.440]   It's really that simple.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.280]   So they're saying whether you store it on the cloud or on your hard drive, it's your
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.280]   music.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.280]   No one else has access to it.
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.280]   But it's the same thing.
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.280]   The cloud is the hard drive.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.280]   It's a hard drive.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.880]   It's just a remote hard drive over IP that happens to be owned by another company.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:30.880]   But still, who cares?
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:31.880]   Who cares?
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:33.880]   Because you're paying money.
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:34.880]   What does it matter?
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.880]   If I lease my computer, so somebody else owns it doesn't mean I have to get a license
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:41.440]   from Sony to play the music on the computer.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.600]   I think they're in the right on this course.
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.880]   You never know what the courts will say.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:45.880]   I mean, it's kind of unpredictable.
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:49.520]   And then you have another story about music, which is if you're not buying the music, it's
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:54.560]   a Spotify story about whether or not ads can support your usage of music.
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.520]   So they used to be able to get free.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:00.240]   If you want to be a free subscriber to Spotify and not a paid subscriber, you can stream
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.200]   so much, so many hours of music a month.
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.200]   And it's not sustaining.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.200]   What is it?
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.200]   20 hours.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.400]   20 hours another bringing it back to 10 and other restrictions.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.360]   And you can only listen to one song five times ever in your whole life.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:12.800]   And it's not because Spotify is trying to be a holes about it.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:17.000]   It's because Spotify can't recoup the cost that it requires for them to provide that
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   service.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.880]   So then for companies like Spotify and RDO or if it's called radio, is it RDO or radio?
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.880]   Radio.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:24.880]   I say RDO.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.880]   And Pandora.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:26.880]   There's no way in it.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.920]   You say radio more difficult to support it with ads.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.040]   And so Spotify is saying it.
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.520]   I love, you know what my favorite though and I know how to pronounce it is MOG.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:35.520]   Have you tried MOG?
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.520]   Yeah, MOG.
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:37.760]   It's like RDO.
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:42.440]   But it's got 320 kilobits and it's got twice as many songs.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.440]   How much is MOG though?
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.440]   Same price, 10 bucks.
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.440]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.360]   Oh no, I was just saying that Spotify is saying to those people that are really upset
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:52.560]   at them that if you're someone that's going to be impacted by these new rules, then you're
[00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.360]   obviously a heavy enough user that maybe you should consider.
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:57.480]   Maybe you should pay for the services that are being provided.
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.960]   I'm kind of a fan of, you know, sometimes when you pay money for something, you're going
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.720]   to get a quality product.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:06.040]   Like if Gmail all of a sudden had a Gmail Plus, I'd probably sign up immediately because
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.240]   I'd assume it'd be that much better.
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.840]   I feel like I'm paying them now.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:10.080]   Now I feel like it deserves some money.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.080]   It's like ever known.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.080]   Just the two gigs of storage.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:16.520]   We showed this Brian Brushwood told me about this and I'll show it again.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:21.120]   We showed it on Twitter a little while ago from an information visualization site called
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.760]   informationisbeautiful.net.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.920]   How much do music artists earn online?
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.800]   This is a very graphic illustration.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:38.680]   So to meet as a solo artist to earn a minimum wage of $1,160 a month, if you make your own
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:43.160]   CD, you have to sell 143 of them.
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.160]   That's doable.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.480]   So that's that dot on CD Baby 155.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:51.080]   That's that dot retail 161 album download and iTunes.
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.080]   It gets bigger.
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.720]   It gets more.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:57.880]   If you sell it at retail 3,871 of them, that's that dot.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.560]   If you sell it on Amazon or iTunes, you need to sell 12,000.
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:02.560]   It's starting to get pretty big.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.560]   This is to make minimum wage.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.560]   Make how much minimum wage?
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.560]   $1,160 a month.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.920]   Is because Amazon takes so much more?
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.920]   On Rhapsody.
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:14.800]   849,000 plays a month, but that's not the biggest thought.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:19.680]   On last FM, 1.5 million plays, but that's not the biggest thought.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:26.480]   Spotify, 4 million plays to make minimum wage for that independent artist.
[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.600]   That's the size of that thought.
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.400]   So there you go right there in a nutshell.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.400]   That's the problem.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.560]   You should look at the infographic that Demand Media made about how much you get paid if
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:35.560]   you're a writer for Demand Media.
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:40.160]   If you have in Demand Media and Infographic, it'll show how much a New York Times average
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:44.040]   New York Times reporter makes, how much a Demand Media reporter makes, not talking about
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.040]   video.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.600]   And then the in-betweens, it's really fascinating.
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:50.600]   So people complain about Demand Media because that's we've talked about that before also.
[00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:55.040]   That's the idea that you create articles in response to search terms so that you get
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.040]   more money.
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.600]   And frankly, the quality of the article doesn't matter.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:02.760]   And that's why you could pay five bucks to the artist.
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.200]   So this is from Silicon Valley Watcher.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.200]   Is it that?
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.200]   Okay.
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.000]   Demand Media, Breaking the Bank.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.560]   Okay.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.960]   So you've got your Demand Media writer, your journalist.
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:16.960]   This is a Demand Media writer.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.040]   The journalist to a mid-sized newspaper.
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:20.040]   And the New York Times reporter.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:26.960]   You've got 90,000 a year average for New York Times, about 19,500 for Demand Media writer.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.560]   He's probably writing five articles a day based on whatever he gets.
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.360]   Because they get 15 bucks an article, although I think it's even less than that.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.360]   And so this is good.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:36.360]   This is a nice infographic.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.040]   There's a wired article about demand that I read about a year ago.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.680]   And it was probably like eight or nine pages long.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.040]   And I feel like this infographic basically summarizes that so you don't have to read
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.040]   the article.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:53.560]   Much as people love Spotify, I guess your point is it's not going to last because it
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.400]   just doesn't, the economics don't work.
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.280]   It'll last if people pay, if people pay for it.
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.280]   You've got to pay.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.320]   And that's why I don't mind paying ten bucks a month.
[00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.320]   I think that's a fair price for unlimited music.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:05.480]   I get nine million tracks.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.840]   I normally buy about an album month anyway.
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:10.120]   So by an album month, just why not have everything?
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.600]   Do you prefer to own it or you care?
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:12.600]   I'm still weird.
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.760]   And then it feels, I like to have it.
[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.200]   I like to actually physically own it in a weird way.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.520]   I don't know why that is.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.160]   I like buying CDs just because I can rip it to a lossless format.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.160]   You just buy a CD.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.760]   Because I just want it in lossless.
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:30.160]   And there are certain albums that I'm finding that I can't get lossless anymore and unedited.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.160]   That's the big problem I read.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.840]   Like I hate to say it, but I wanted the new Rihanna album.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:38.320]   And it turned out that the only way I could get it unedited was to import it.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.320]   What do you mean unedited?
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.320]   They're not just leaving the expletives?
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.600]   Yeah, there's only a couple songs that even needed.
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:46.480]   But it turned out they didn't even sell that version in the United States.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.200]   And I was like, so then I go, okay, work on it.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.920]   You're the kind of guy that bought imports.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.920]   Where can I get it lossless?
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.560]   You guys are all too young to remember it.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.560]   And I couldn't.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.560]   And I even went to Apple.
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.600]   I was willing to pay Apple if they could just sell me a lossless track.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.360]   You're talking about the expensive versions?
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.960]   Remember that you used to buy, but you'd have a record store.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.000]   Yeah, you go to the record store and they'd be specially wrapped German versions of the
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   album.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   They still have those in.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   It plays as like Amoeba.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Amoeba.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   I bring up music to this.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   And I'm quickly being able to.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.080]   But are you a I have to own it kind of guy too?
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.080]   Yeah, I am.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:19.160]   I find lately a lot of the music I buy is I'll hear something either on Pandora or like in
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.400]   a friend's car while they're listening to the satellite radio or something.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:25.600]   And I'll use like, I'll use the likes of Shazam or more importantly, I'll use.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:26.600]   You like Shazam?
[00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.840]   No, I like it used to be called Madomi.
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:29.840]   Now it's called Soundhound.
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:30.840]   Soundhound, yeah.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:31.840]   I'll sample it through that.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.240]   And then I'll actually click on a link to buy it through either iTunes or Amazon from
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.240]   that.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.240]   Interesting.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:41.680]   You know, I have to say that radio or audio and MOG have changed my habits a little bit.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.280]   And I don't feel like I need to buy it.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:45.120]   I'm going to pay 10 bucks a month for you have to pay.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.120]   Do they have everything though?
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.120]   That's why.
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.120]   Yeah, nine million tracks.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.120]   Is that the same?
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.120]   So what is like a fair iTunes?
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:51.120]   I think it's the same.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:52.120]   Same set as iTunes?
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:53.120]   I don't know.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.200]   So like I can get every new album that comes out on.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:56.200]   I love it.
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.200]   I love it if you check.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.400]   See, that's the problem I've had in the past because I've signed up a rap city.
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.440]   I've signed up for a bunch of these different services in the past.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.640]   I'm always saying they're like, oh, it's missing these two albums.
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.400]   Well, it's not going to have the Beatles, right?
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.400]   Right.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.400]   Only iTunes has the Beatles.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.400]   Right.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.400]   And then there's stuff that's only on Amazon.
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.920]   If I'm going to buy an mp3, I buy it from Amazon, especially because of the cloud player
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.680]   I get that's stored for free forever.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:17.680]   I like that.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:19.680]   And you have to upgrade to 20 gigs of time.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:20.680]   That's a great thing.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:21.680]   That's a great thing.
[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:22.680]   Okay.
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:23.680]   That's better.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:24.680]   That's better.
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:25.800]   A lot of the subscription services allow them to be able to play music that they wouldn't
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:26.800]   normally be able to forward.
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:27.800]   It's good for discovery too.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:31.760]   But also like if you're, you know, you don't have a lot of money and you want to listen to
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:35.600]   a huge amount of stuff, you're going to be able to do that by paying a subscription version.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:36.600]   Well, I'm an old fart.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.720]   So I've been collecting for years.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:41.400]   So I have hundreds of gigs of music, all the music I ever want.
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.600]   I actually do have on the hard drive now.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.360]   But what I don't have is the new music and I can't make that discovery very easily.
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:50.040]   So these services are great for discovering music.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.120]   Are you able to put these songs onto portable devices?
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:53.120]   Uh huh.
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:54.120]   Okay.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.120]   So that's the other thing that's weird as long as you keep paying the 10 bucks, you can
[00:34:56.120 --> 00:35:01.480]   download all of it, put it on an iPad, an Android phone or an iPhone and listen to it
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.720]   offline.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:03.720]   That's cool.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.240]   But periodically it has to check somehow.
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.320]   It's funny how like even five, 10 years ago, remember when they were talking about like
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.480]   holographic storage and things like that and they're saying like, in the future, you'll
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.320]   have the entire music collection on a small little cube.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.440]   I was thinking like, oh, that's going to be really cool.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.000]   But it turns out we don't need that.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.640]   It's all like throwing the cloud.
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:20.840]   That's what I'm coming to.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:25.240]   That's where I'm coming to with both Amazon and with these services is why am I, why am
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:27.560]   I sinking and filling up my space?
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:28.560]   Yeah.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.560]   I don't need to.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:30.560]   It's funny when I bought this air.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:34.400]   They had a larger hard drive option and I didn't even, I was like, I don't even need
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.400]   the bigger hard drive.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.400]   It's plenty.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:40.320]   Because all my music, I did that upload to Amazon and it's all on Amazon.
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.320]   And Dropbox, right?
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.320]   Right.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.320]   Dropbox.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.320]   Dropbox, then you keep your data on Dropbox.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.320]   Evernote.
[00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.320]   Evernote.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.320]   All these services.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.320]   You got everything.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.320]   That's what's made it possible for me to use the air too.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.320]   It's plenty of storage space.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.320]   All my Google Docs are.
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.320]   Right.
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.320]   Google Docs.
[00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.320]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.320]   We're living in the future, man.
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.320]   The future is now.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.320]   Are you worried?
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:02.040]   There was that one take on the future where the hard drive manufacturer is just a, just
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.760]   a, upsell their components.
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:08.600]   We're going to just start putting every song ever encoded and produced onto the hard drive.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.360]   And you know, you can erase it if you know, you don't want your storage, but there would
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.640]   at least be content already on the drive when you bought it.
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:14.640]   Who is it?
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.240]   Seagate selling three terabyte hard drives now?
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.240]   Three terabytes.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.240]   I need them.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.240]   I need bigger.
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.240]   Could you fit?
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.240]   And ass is full.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.240]   I need more storage.
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.240]   How much is my ass is full?
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.240]   I need more storage.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.240]   I need more storage.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.240]   I need more storage.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.240]   I need more storage.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:29.240]   And the cash network attached.
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.440]   It's all those Blu-ray movies I encode.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:36.080]   Or a rip now, of course, in the chat rooms right on this one, Tex and saying, yeah, and
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:42.360]   of course now AT&T saying 150 gigabyte cap, Comcast saying 250 gigabyte a month cap on
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.000]   wireless is three or five.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:50.560]   I ran out of, I ran out of wife or three G to the income of my story though for Comcast
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:52.560]   is announcing that new hundred megabit service.
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.600]   And then they calculated how long you'd burn through.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.720]   It was like five within five days, basically.
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:03.400]   If you watch all 250 gigabytes every day, a few days later, you're done.
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.400]   That's crazy.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.400]   And that's why.
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.400]   It's ridiculous.
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.400]   Comcast says, oh, you don't have to worry about this.
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.560]   Nobody uses that much.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:09.800]   It's 1%.
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.320]   It's the bandwidth hogs.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.320]   But what they're doing is they're being very proactive.
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:18.880]   They're planning for a day when everybody's watching Netflix and downloading radio from
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.320]   RDO and all that.
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.160]   And they're saying, we got to watch out guys.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.160]   We're going to be out of business.
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.120]   See if people do that.
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:29.480]   So I really have a feeling that more internet providers, service providers.
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:30.480]   That's what we need.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.480]   Okay, let's talk about that.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.800]   Yeah, but they own the pipes.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:33.800]   So how are you going to even get on?
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:34.800]   You can't.
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:35.800]   You can't.
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.440]   And this is, I finally came to, because I understand the argument, you don't want the
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:40.000]   government regulating the internet.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.840]   I completely agree with that because these guys are morons.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.840]   I'm going to play a clip in a little bit that you will just not believe.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.360]   A series of tubes?
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.360]   Worse.
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:52.880]   It's actually worse than a series of tubes and it's bizarre, but I'm going to play for
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:56.160]   you a second.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:02.480]   But I finally realized why we do want to let the FCC protect net neutrality because they
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.680]   made the mess in the first place.
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:09.440]   We wouldn't have a problem if the FCC hadn't granted a duopoly to cable and phone companies
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:13.520]   saying, no, you could put in the copper and as a result, you get a monopoly on internet
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:14.520]   access.
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:17.880]   So most people only have a couple of choices, right?
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.720]   And that's the reason net neutrality is an issue.
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:24.040]   If you had 10 internet service providers, you could go to the one that gave, you know,
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:28.000]   one's going to give you a, you know, ban with equal bandwidth for everybody.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.840]   You go to that one, one's not going to have caps.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.680]   You go to that one, they're going to get all the business.
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:32.680]   But there isn't that choice.
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:33.680]   They're effectively a monopoly.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:34.680]   That's quite a looting.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:38.080]   That's why it seems that the only additional choices appearing recently have been wireless
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.080]   solutions.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.080]   Yes.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.480]   Municipal wireless being deployed in certain places.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:42.480]   I'm excited.
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:47.400]   You know, we had the guy who wrote Visicap in here.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:52.200]   Oh, I forgot his name, but his new campaign, he worked at Microsoft.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:56.160]   He was a guy putting that routing into a, into, into routers.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.880]   He said, I knew that the, I knew that the internet service providers would end up wanting
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.960]   to charge everybody online.
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:07.040]   So I, nobody thought about this, but before, before anybody was on anybody's radar, I told
[00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:10.320]   Microsoft we should build these routers with nat in them.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:13.840]   And as a result, no internet service provider can say how many people are using that single
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:14.840]   check that person's hand.
[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.560]   Oh, what's his name?
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:17.560]   I'm not room.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.000]   You know, we just had him on our triangulation episode.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   It's just Bob Frankston.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   Thank you.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   Thank you.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.160]   Really one of the great, the greats of all time.
[00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:26.600]   Anyway, Frankston is now big on community internet.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.160]   He says that's the solution to internet neutrality.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:34.800]   You buy big pools of internet for your call to sack or your street or your neighborhood.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.520]   I think that's brilliant.
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:41.040]   There are buildings in the Bay Area apartment complex in particular that have a hundred megabit
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:45.440]   going in and everyone gets that into their, and you just, you pay into like the collective
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.640]   to have that service right in your apartment.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:51.440]   But it's harder to do that with individual households, unfortunately.
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.960]   We got to do some anyway.
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.320]   This is why I thought it was appropriate for the FCC.
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.520]   At least Google's deploying some of that dark fiber finally.
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.040]   They chose what was it somewhere?
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.040]   Kansas.
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.040]   Yeah, Kansas City.
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.040]   Not Topeka.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.040]   Nope.
[00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:06.000]   Topeka's the one that renamed itself Google Kansas.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.160]   So it's getting at that last, that last hundred feet into somebody's house.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.160]   Right.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:12.960]   That's, that's where it becomes very limited.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:13.960]   Okay.
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.200]   Martin Norton cannot be with us.
[00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:19.960]   He was, of course, one of the people on Twitter one exactly is kind of interesting.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:27.400]   It was April 17th, 2005, exactly six years ago, but he did send us this greetings from
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.400]   the desert of Utah.
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:34.040]   Remember the salt?
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:36.000]   Leo and the whole crew up at Twit.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.400]   Congratulations on your fifth anniversary.
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:42.360]   I am so sorry I could not be up there live for the taping today, but I am on vacation with
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.360]   my family.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.160]   We're bombing through national parks in Utah.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:48.360]   I said, I go right now, I think we're in Arizona or Pikes Springs National Monument.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:51.000]   I get confused where the state lines are out here.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   It is amazing.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.400]   If you have been to national parks, you should go Bryce Canyon Zion are incredible.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.560]   And you know what?
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.640]   I'm wondering five years, man.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:40:59.640]   What incredible accomplished?
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:00.640]   Six.
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.120]   Congratulations from all your friends in Division three.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:05.240]   All your friends that have worked with you over the years and for me and my family.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.240]   Leo the poor Twits.
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.240]   Wow.
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.240]   Five years, man.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.240]   Way to go.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.240]   So who's holding the camera?
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.240]   You think it's Sarah or Malachi on the camera?
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.240]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:14.360]   It's probably Sarah or or.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.360]   Sheamus.
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.520]   Sheamus, not Malachi.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:18.600]   Sheamus Malachi is Alex Lindsey's kid.
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:19.600]   I got him all good.
[00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.600]   All these Irish names confused.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.240]   We're going to take a break.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.040]   Come back with more our sixth anniversary.
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.040]   Let's open another bottle of the bubbly.
[00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.040]   Still got some of this left.
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.040]   Give me your hand.
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.040]   All right.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.040]   Yeah.
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:33.040]   I'll take some more.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.040]   Robert Herron is here from heronfidelity.com.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.040]   It's a new.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.040]   So you're doing like a.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.040]   Investment banking.
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:38.040]   Investment banking.
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.040]   I think so.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:42.880]   I'm using this for home theater and I get to interact with folks.
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:45.920]   And to provide when I say, hey, I got a place to put content too.
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:47.920]   Which is something like that.
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:48.920]   And HD Nation is part of Tixilla now.
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.280]   So you're still doing that, right?
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.280]   Totally.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.280]   Yeah.
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.280]   Awesome.
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.280]   A bunch of new TVs for 2011 coming up.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.280]   They've got some pretty cool stuff.
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.280]   That's a hell of a cool.
[00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:00.160]   Robert's always in our studio and he's like calibrating TVs and the lights are off.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:01.160]   So you can calibrate.
[00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:03.600]   And then someone comes in like, that's so dark in here in terms of lights on.
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:04.600]   Ah!
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.160]   It's okay.
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.160]   Thank you for the nice.
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:08.160]   But we got more bubbly.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.760]   David Prager also still at revision three.
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:11.760]   Indeed.
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.680]   You're the heart and soul of that damn operation.
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:14.680]   I try.
[00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:15.680]   It's fun.
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.680]   It's amazing.
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:19.160]   I mean, for all of us in the media business and the television business, I mean, things
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.160]   are changing so fast.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:24.440]   It's so exciting to see everything shift and the abilities for people to, you know, watch
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:27.520]   things like Twitch and watch things like revision three through every device that is
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:31.000]   being manufactured now for their, you know, their home living rooms to their personal
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   competing experiences.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.400]   I'm really proud of what we tech TV refugees.
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.360]   Because that's what we all are.
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.360]   Yum.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:40.360]   Have done.
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.360]   I'm incredibly proud of you guys.
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.360]   To keep that alive.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.120]   Well, you too, Robert, you're part of it.
[00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:45.120]   To keep it alive.
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:46.920]   And then, you know, it's not been easy.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:51.120]   I know, David, you had a pound of payment for quite a bit to get sponsors and to build
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:52.120]   that thing up.
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:53.120]   But you guys have a great job.
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:54.120]   It was fun.
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.120]   I mean, just to see things evolve and come together.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.240]   I mean, yeah, there's a lot of hard work that got done by a lot of people.
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.680]   Can we bring your site down again, Robert?
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:00.680]   You know?
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:04.720]   I was just about to try to log in and fully lock it down.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.720]   So it's fully cash.
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:06.720]   So sorry.
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:07.720]   I'm trying.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:11.160]   One day, you know, that's the screensaver's effect.
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:12.160]   I love it.
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.160]   You know what?
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.160]   This is so rarely half a half.
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:15.160]   I finally got in.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.160]   Maybe I can lock it down.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.160]   So it's 100% cash.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.400]   Would everybody please leave Robert?
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.400]   No, no.
[00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:21.480]   Just leave Robert's site alone.
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.760]   This is revealing weakness.
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:25.400]   And I need to address it immediately.
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:31.640]   And of course, Kevin, who's now a serial entrepreneur, I think that's great.
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:33.040]   Revision 3.
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.040]   Still doing Ignatian?
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:35.040]   Still doing Ignatian?
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.920]   Dick.com is just in the rear view mirror now, though, right?
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:38.920]   I'm still on the board.
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.560]   I'm still helping out.
[00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.640]   I'd say I meet with the CEO a couple times a month.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:43.640]   Oh, that's quite a bit.
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:44.640]   Yeah, it's good.
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:45.640]   That's a nice guy.
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:46.640]   I like that.
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:47.640]   I think you left it in very good hands, to be honest.
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.640]   I think he really gets it.
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:49.640]   Yeah, he's good.
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:51.160]   They just had a big month last month.
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:52.560]   Traffic was up 20%.
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:53.560]   Awesome.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.560]   I'm so glad to hear that.
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:58.680]   Well, they've been going back and fixing a bunch of the problems and bugs and getting some
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:43:59.680]   features that you just want to back on the line.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.160]   I'm so glad to hear that.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.160]   It's been good.
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.160]   Wow, that's a big jump.
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:04.160]   It's a big jump.
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:07.480]   You're building a media empire in the middle of nowhere here in Northern California.
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:08.480]   It's awesome.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.680]   I'm mighty proud of that.
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.720]   You used to have to commute every day.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.280]   You'd use text America to take a picture of the Golden Gate Bridge every day.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.280]   And now you don't even have the opportunity to do it.
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:20.160]   You can't even Instagram the Golden Gate Bridge because you never have to go that way anymore.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:21.160]   Whatever happened to Mo-blogging?
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.160]   I don't know.
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.160]   Mo-blogging, that's right.
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:24.160]   Mo-blogging.
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:27.800]   Don't you think those poor text America guys just got to go, "What happened?"
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.600]   We were right there.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:32.000]   And now it's Instagram and everybody's doing it.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.560]   I mean, people iterate on original ideas and do them differently better or based on the
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.720]   technology of the day.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:39.720]   It's Damien, right?
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:40.720]   It was Damien that did that.
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:41.720]   What was his name?
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:42.720]   It was Damien, I think.
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:46.120]   No, there was Chris and also-- Chris and Brian.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.120]   And also-- Oh, God.
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:49.120]   I'm going to kill me.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.120]   It's probably watching the show.
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:52.120]   You know, I'm talking about it.
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:55.080]   I know what he's sitting in his box who's short-seaten Lucky charms and drinking beer
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:45:00.080]   and wishing that he were making mobile apps.
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:01.080]   Probably is.
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.080]   So much, you know, I mean-- I'm surprised I haven't seen it in the show.
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.400]   I'm talking to creators of text America.
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:06.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:13.280]   If you think about even what we've done here and at Revision 3, you know, I mean, what's
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:18.440]   his-- Josh Harris did that pseudo TV in 1998 or '99.
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:24.320]   I mean, I was just talking to Kiki Stockhammer, play TV, did this kind of thing.
[00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:28.280]   The problem was with text America and those efforts, they were just too early.
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:31.280]   I mean, we could be too early for all we know.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.080]   In a few years, people will say, whatever happened to that.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.760]   What was his name, Leon?
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:40.840]   He's probably sitting in his underwear eating Lucky charms, drinking--
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.600]   Walt Licker right now, watching the show.
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:44.360]   Good life, Leo.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:47.080]   Don't knock that out.
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.640]   Mickey White, mouth baby.
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:49.560]   I enabled lockdown.
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:51.640]   Let's see if I can enable some other caching here.
[00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:52.960]   Robert's still fixing his website.
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:53.460]   Trying.
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:54.200]   And he's not--
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:55.200]   He's able to get in.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.040]   I'm not switched to a different host.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.280]   Freshbase.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:00.880]   Well, Robert fixes his website.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:03.760]   I'd like to mention freshbooks.com.
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:08.160]   I have to say, when we were starting out, of course, we had to send out invoices, our
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.480]   own invoices.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:13.080]   And if you're a contractor or independent, you're sending out invoices still.
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:14.720]   I remember that was the thing I hated the most.
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:15.840]   I loved the work.
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.560]   I hated the billing.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:19.960]   And that's where fresh books really changed my life.
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:25.080]   Amber told me about fresh books in 2004 because they were a Toronto company.
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:27.960]   She knew the guys and changed my life.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:31.520]   Fresh books made it so easy to do my billing.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.520]   My invoices.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:33.520]   Finally, I'd actually get paid.
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:36.440]   I remember one time I left an invoice for nine months.
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:37.440]   Try and get paid after not billing.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.440]   So it'd be for nine months.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:39.440]   Nine months later.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:40.440]   Hey, can I have my money?
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:41.440]   Like they'll actually like--
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.440]   No, no, no.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:44.440]   They do follow up on it though.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:45.440]   They do.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:48.400]   The invoice has been-- you've even marked it as paid or something like that.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.800]   This is so cool.
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.280]   First of all, you can do by mail.
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:54.680]   So you upload the logo and everything and it does it automatically.
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:59.600]   There's a button on the email that says, "Pay it now with credit card or one of 11 services
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.120]   like PayPal."
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:03.560]   So that really, you get paid faster just because of that.
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:04.560]   There's a lot of people who pay.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:05.720]   So wait, it's easier for your clients to pay you.
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:06.720]   I could pay it.
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:07.720]   I'm going to pay it.
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.800]   I don't-- no, the clients-- most of the time it's not that they don't want to pay it.
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:11.960]   It's just that, you know, they put it off and--
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:12.960]   One click process.
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.600]   You can also have-- this is really cool.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:21.440]   Automated invoices and auto billing and auto payment if you can set up.
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:22.800]   So you don't even have to think about it.
[00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.360]   And then, yeah, there are people who don't pay.
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.600]   So they've got late payment reminders.
[00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:26.600]   You're right.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:28.320]   They kind of automate this whole process.
[00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:30.800]   There are old-fashioned folks who still want printed invoices.
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.040]   They'll do that for an additional fee.
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.600]   They stamp, print, and mail it.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.600]   I used to do that for Rogers in Canada.
[00:47:36.600 --> 00:47:40.200]   Well, when they handle multiple currencies, which is really great if you do business around
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:44.160]   the world, they've got an iPhone app that will track hours and then automatically put
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:45.160]   it in the invoice.
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.840]   Yeah, this is-- you know what?
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:48.800]   This was one of the first Web 2.0 companies.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:52.480]   It's funny, I actually met this guy, the founder and CEO.
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:55.600]   He was speaking at Ryan Carson's event.
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:56.600]   What's the--
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:57.600]   Yeah, follow up.
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:58.600]   Future web apps.
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:02.240]   And he talked about how he built his business and just like how he really cares about customers
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:05.440]   and the pricing model that he used and he was really successful and profitable business.
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:06.440]   And it's awesome.
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:07.440]   It's a great story.
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:12.440]   It is-- really, I mean, this was literally one of the first Web 2.0 apps out there, online
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:13.440]   invoicing.
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:14.440]   I love it.
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:15.440]   FreshBooks.com.
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:16.440]   Free for your first three clients.
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:18.160]   That's the pricing model I like.
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:21.560]   And then very affordable, as you grow, of course, you're making money so you can buy
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:22.560]   more services.
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:23.560]   It's really fantastic.
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:27.240]   But look at all the stuff you get for free.
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:30.480]   FreshBooks.com, once a week, they're going to have a drawing for a free birthday cake
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:31.480]   if you sign up.
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:32.480]   You could be one of the winners.
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:33.480]   There really is a birthday cake.
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:34.480]   I'm talking--
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.480]   Need to send you a birthday cake even if it's not your birthday.
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.480]   Doesn't have to be your birthday.
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:38.480]   That's amazing.
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:39.480]   Isn't that funny?
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:40.480]   I think it's funny.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:41.480]   I think it's funny to do promotions like that.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:42.480]   Yeah, I mean, it doesn't cost him anything.
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.480]   It's just fun.
[00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:44.480]   It's just a good idea.
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.480]   But there's only those candles that you can't blow out, I hope.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:47.640]   FreshBooks.com.
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.920]   If you're still sending invoices, that's the way to do it.
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:52.680]   Someday you'll be big enough.
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:56.160]   You'll have people to do that for you.
[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.720]   The cake is not a lie.
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:48:59.720]   There's a portal reference.
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:00.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:01.960]   Will there be cake and portal too?
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:03.560]   Of course, there's going to be cake.
[00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:04.560]   Glados.
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:05.560]   So they're doing a whole promotion.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:12.040]   I think it's very clever, the Steam promotion, where they say you have to play this bunch
[00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:16.160]   of games to power up Glados.
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:21.360]   And if enough people play and they're enough hours, Glados will be powered up sooner.
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:24.320]   We were hoping they would launch it Friday, but they didn't know about.
[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:25.320]   No, it didn't happen.
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:38.760]   So you also have to be
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:45.360]   or the Xbox 360, you then, at least on the PS3, you actually get a Steam login that gives
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:49.840]   you the game on Steam for the PC console, and you do co-op between the PC and the game
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:50.840]   of the game of the game.
[00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:51.840]   Oh, I love that.
[00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:54.640]   And I'm like, it's been a long time since I've actually did any kind of co-op with anybody.
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:55.640]   That's clever.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:56.640]   I usually only play on PCs, but...
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:57.640]   Well, you're a troubled loner.
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:03.080]   But I have a game console too that sits there relatively I'd use, so it'd be fun to
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.080]   make it up.
[00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:06.200]   And with that game in particular, it should be a...
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.400]   I'm looking forward to co-op.
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:10.000]   So tell me how it's different from Portal 1.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   That's going to be a good question.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   You know what?
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   I've purposely not...
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.600]   Except for the commercials on TV, I really haven't looked at it or investigated it, but
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:20.600]   my friend who works for a Sony has played through quite a bit of it, and at least the
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:21.600]   first three hours of it.
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:22.600]   And he was...
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:23.600]   Is it the same team that's doing it?
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:24.600]   Yes.
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:29.400]   As far as I know, the story should be a little different though this time in that it's going
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:32.720]   to be apparently a couple of the robots from before.
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.600]   At least I'm just basing this off of what I've seen on the commercials so far.
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:40.600]   I have to say, Owen G. Chad, who is our newest employee, and is here today even though he
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:45.320]   doesn't start to like July, but he decided to come give us all cupcakes, which I thought
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:46.320]   was very sweet.
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:50.480]   You had Robert, you ate the top off your cupcake.
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:51.480]   The frosting fell off.
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.320]   It fell off, but I did...
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:56.400]   And then I was like, "Wait a minute, these are defective cupcakes?"
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:57.400]   It slid right off.
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:00.440]   Some might call that an effective means of consuming it.
[00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:03.240]   I'd probably cut the calorie count in about a quarter of a week.
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:05.080]   Yeah, sugar content for sure.
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:12.080]   This is the best experience I've ever had.
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:15.080]   This is the best experience I've ever had.
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:16.080]   I hate it the pre-roll.
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:19.160]   You know, we're going to be doing pre-rolls I think at some point, so I hate...
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.480]   I shouldn't say anything bad about pre-rolls, but...
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:22.680]   15 seconds no more, right?
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.240]   Yeah, oh God, you can't do more.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:26.480]   This is our 30 second pre-roll.
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:30.200]   Okay, I tried to lock down my website, even updated...
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:31.200]   Is it working?
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.200]   WordPress.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:35.400]   Alright, let's see if it can take you down.
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.000]   It's history.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   Is it down again?
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   Probably.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.400]   Generally when does the episode become available?
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:41.400]   This encourages me to...
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:43.760]   It'll come out in a few hours.
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:46.080]   Okay, I'm just robbing these and be ready for round two.
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:49.880]   Yeah, because this is the livestreamers and the real onslaught is when we release it.
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:50.880]   The original had created...
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:51.880]   Looks like a sub.
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:52.880]   Yeah, kind of there.
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:53.880]   This is from IGN.
[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:54.880]   This is from IGN.
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:55.880]   This is from IGN.
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:56.880]   This is from IGN.
[00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:00.000]   This looks really good, a lot more detail.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.080]   You know, I was saying on the chat because when we were at E3 last year, last June, we
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:08.760]   were, thanks to him, he bulldozed his way into the Steam presentation and got exclusive
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:10.960]   video of Portal 2.
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:13.880]   So look how long it takes, almost a year later.
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:16.840]   The co-op side of this too is going to be pretty crazy in the sense that in the first
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:21.800]   game you had to do moves that maintained your motion or momentum in order to get chop
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:22.800]   and stuff.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:23.800]   Yeah, so you'd maintain speed.
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:27.040]   In this case, you'll be able to pair up with your partner where they'll have to fire
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:29.000]   a portal you'll go through.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.320]   Oh, so their timing will have to be concerted with...
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:34.520]   It's going to add a whole new take to it.
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:36.840]   There's just not enough co-op games out there anyway.
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:38.520]   This is a good way to get sick this game.
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:40.880]   Oh, look at the cubes flying around.
[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:44.400]   I find it harder to watch it being played than to actually play it.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.400]   Very nauseating.
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:48.000]   I mean, kind of like driving the car and then sitting in the back seat.
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   Totally.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:53.440]   It's one of the last games I played that actually made me, I mean, physically ill.
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:53:02.600]   It's so compelling you get drawn into it and you feel like you're there jumping through
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:04.280]   the holes and stuff.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:05.280]   This looks good.
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:07.400]   I can't wait to play it.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:09.160]   That's on one of the consoles too.
[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:11.400]   Yeah, that's pretty, this looks pretty high quality.
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:15.280]   In the comments it's, "Hey, Leo needs a video game show once he moves in the new studio
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:16.280]   in the response."
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:18.680]   But Leo doesn't know enough about video games to do a video game show.
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:19.680]   I'm ignorant.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.080]   I admit it.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:22.840]   I'm just a player.
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:23.840]   Did you see Gary?
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.880]   What Gary of Gary's mod did?
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:26.880]   That was clever.
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:27.880]   This is brilliant.
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:28.880]   I don't know what Gary's mod is.
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:29.880]   It's a Steam.
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:35.160]   It's a sandbox mode for the Half-Life engine to where you can basically go in and create
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:41.160]   any scenario, any, you know, you can hook jets onto a trash can and have it zip around.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:42.160]   That's cool.
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:45.160]   Experiment with anything you want and to play around with the game itself.
[00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:46.360]   So, he gave the engine.
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:51.480]   He wrote a bug into it that only happens if you didn't pay for it.
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:54.200]   If you're using a stolen copy.
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:56.760]   And it's 10 bucks, I think.
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:57.760]   You're using a sandbox.
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:58.760]   I know.
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:53:59.760]   It's crazy.
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:01.440]   You get the error, "Unable to shade polygon normals."
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:05.920]   And so what he does is he says, "Just do a Google search for "Unable to shade polygon
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:06.920]   normals."
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:11.520]   The error code that you get is your Steam ID.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:16.320]   So, people are going online saying, "Is there something wrong with Gary's mod?"
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:21.320]   I get this error message when I try to shade polygon normals.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:27.800]   And then this solution says, "Oh, the solution is buying a copy of Gary's mod."
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:30.080]   They're pasting their ID, right?
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.080]   All of the sudden.
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:33.280]   Or they put it into Valve's forums.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.080]   And Valve says, "Okay, we'll take that.
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:37.080]   We'll see if that person actually purchased the game."
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:38.080]   "Okay, ban."
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:40.400]   I'm like, "Come on, man.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:41.400]   I'm getting nauseous.
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:42.400]   Look at this.
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:43.400]   Look at this.
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:45.840]   It's basically the same game, though, but they've just got a lot of...
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:46.840]   Oh, look at that.
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:48.720]   He put a hole in the whole thing fell apart."
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:51.120]   Oh, it's awesome.
[00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:52.120]   Oh, drool.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:55.120]   So, what do you think of the Nintendo rumors?
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:56.120]   I hope they're true.
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:57.120]   We're going to be at E3.
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:58.720]   We're going to be covering it again this year.
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:00.680]   Brian Brushwood and I are going to go down.
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:04.320]   The trick on E3 I learned last year is you go down the day before it starts because the
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:06.360]   press conferences are on Monday.
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:09.920]   So, you go Monday to hit the press conferences.
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:12.640]   That's when Nintendo will announce if they announce.
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:16.200]   So, if we can't get into the press conferences, I have a bad record lately.
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:17.200]   Really?
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:18.200]   I would think you get in.
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.360]   Traditionally, E3, as press, you go there.
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:21.360]   You go there before it.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:23.960]   No, no, but see, I go with a camera.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:26.000]   They know now that even if they don't have a camera visible.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.520]   Well, that's why you send Brian with his undercover camera game.
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:29.520]   Yes.
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:30.520]   And he'll come out and tell you what to cover afterwards.
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:31.520]   Exactly.
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:32.520]   Exactly.
[00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:33.520]   So, we will definitely be out.
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:37.280]   At least we'll be out in front of the Nintendo announcement if we can't actually get in.
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:39.120]   He scammed his way into it last year.
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:40.280]   So, what do you think that means?
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:42.280]   For the other two big consoles?
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:44.480]   Because traditionally, they all come out in threes.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:46.200]   Or at least for the past three times.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:48.480]   I don't think Microsoft's even closer to Xbox 360.
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:49.480]   I haven't heard a peep out of it.
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:51.280]   I was already here about to do anything right now.
[00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:52.640]   No, they're doing fine, right?
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:53.640]   Yeah.
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:54.640]   Same thing with Sony, right?
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:55.640]   The same thing with Sony, right?
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:58.800]   The Nintendo is the one that had to update.
[00:55:58.800 --> 00:55:59.800]   They weren't even HD.
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:05.040]   They've always had that track record though of producing hardware that from the point it's
[00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:07.440]   shipped, they were never losing money on anything.
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:10.320]   It was always making money from day one.
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:11.320]   That's true.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:15.040]   They were always able to, I mean, their expenses were covered almost instantly.
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:16.040]   So what do you do?
[00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:19.160]   What do you put in a new generation, second generation Nintendo?
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:20.160]   I don't know what the hardware was.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.160]   HDMI port.
[00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:22.160]   Yeah, but I don't know what the hardware was.
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:30.000]   I'm thinking if they get to release a console and have a dormant year from Sony and Microsoft,
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.400]   try as hard as you can to make that thing more powerful than those two.
[00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.720]   Then you've got the most powerful console out there.
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.920]   Even though it's not necessarily Nintendo's.
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:40.000]   Yeah, but I don't normally do that though.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   But can they do it?
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.320]   It's been long enough that the cost to build a brand new console in the next.
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:47.800]   They're still using the original Nintendo graphics chip in the Wii's, it feels like.
[00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:48.800]   Oh, they are.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:51.360]   It's very, they're like super polygon-y.
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:53.040]   But they embrace that and it makes it cool.
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:55.280]   The AMD chip still that they're using?
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:57:00.040]   Look at people who are buying and really getting into 8-bit again, right?
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.640]   You know, it's hot right now.
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:02.880]   Well, that can run on everything.
[00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:03.880]   That's the other thing too.
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:06.680]   The games will run perfect on even older cell phones.
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:15.760]   So there's a, there's a hot, one of the hottest games on the iPad is an Atari 2600 emulator.
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:19.040]   And you could play Star Raiders and Asteroids, but it's really crappy.
[00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.200]   Okay, that's what I heard.
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:23.800]   It's the, well, I mean, it's exactly like the 2600 crappy.
[00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:26.280]   I mean, it's that good.
[00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:28.200]   It's got the 8-bit sound here.
[00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:29.680]   I'll turn it on and you can hear the sound.
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:34.240]   I mean, we forget how bad this crap was.
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:36.240]   It's rocking.
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:37.240]   You hear the sound?
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:38.560]   It doesn't, it doesn't remind you.
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:42.720]   I mean, of your Yoot and it's got a little button here.
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:46.920]   And the joystick's there.
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:47.920]   That's amazing.
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:49.640]   Those are like great, like ring tones or like.
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:51.680]   You just, you're really crappy and at the same time, it's really awesome.
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:52.680]   Well, there's this, right.
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:54.440]   That's what makes it awesome is how crappy it is.
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:55.440]   Right.
[00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:56.440]   It's just the fact that you can.
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:57.440]   Is it fun to play?
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:02.400]   I mean, if you look at the, you know, the amount of what's the chemical reaction in the head
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.400]   for pleasure?
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:04.400]   Endorphins.
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:07.680]   The same number of that is released in your head.
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:08.680]   Serotonin.
[00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:12.240]   Now with the most badass game console as it was when you were 8 years old.
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:14.560]   Well, that's why it's total nostalgia.
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:18.120]   You're playing, dude, that's great music.
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.480]   Amazing.
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:27.360]   Somebody please loop this and make it to an animated GIF site and have it.
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:28.360]   You know they will.
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:29.360]   Ten more seconds.
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:32.560]   What game is that?
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:35.480]   That sounds like very advanced music for the Atari.
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:36.480]   It's battles.
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:37.480]   Doesn't it?
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:38.480]   That's pretty sweet.
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:41.880]   It sounds like like chemical or death punk like remakes that.
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:46.840]   Dude, the death punk soundtrack on Toronto is amazing.
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:49.320]   I just got the box, the five disc set.
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:51.040]   I just watched it for the first time last night.
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:52.040]   The 3D Blu-ray.
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:53.240]   So good.
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:54.480]   The original Blu-ray.
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:56.280]   I never saw the original.
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.280]   What is it?
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:58.280]   I'm the chowder.
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:03.120]   Listening to that music makes them feel like bumming quarters from their model.
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:04.120]   That's awesome.
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:06.120]   Do you think that's a remix or that's the actual original?
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:07.120]   I think it's a remix.
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:08.800]   I think it's too good.
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:11.680]   It was worse than that when those were...
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:12.680]   Where's that?
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:13.680]   That's pretty funny.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:14.880]   That was a quarter junkie.
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:16.360]   Were you guys into Tron, the new movie?
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:17.360]   Tron?
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:18.360]   Did you even watch the...
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:19.360]   You haven't seen the new Tron?
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:20.360]   No, I have it on Blu-ray.
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:21.360]   It's sitting there.
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:22.360]   Oh my God.
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:23.360]   I finally watched Inception the other day.
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:24.360]   Oh, really?
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:25.360]   How far will be higher?
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:26.360]   What do you think of Inception?
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:27.200]   Eh.
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:28.960]   I was like, I got it.
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:31.440]   Everyone was like, "It's just gonna blow your freaking mind."
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:33.640]   I watched it and I'm like, "Okay, I got it."
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:34.640]   It was good.
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:35.640]   I'm gonna watch it again.
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:37.840]   Maybe, maybe I really miss out on Blu-ray yet.
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:38.840]   Yeah.
[00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:39.840]   That's how I picked that up.
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:40.840]   So...
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:41.840]   You know what you should do?
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:45.000]   Do you do this on HD Nation as reviews of the content of the Blu-ray movies and stuff?
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   That'd be kind of cool.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   Like, is this a good...
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.240]   Not only is this a good master, but is it a good movie?
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:50.240]   Totally.
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:54.480]   We go over image quality on some of the films based on some of the guys that do this all
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:55.480]   the time.
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:56.480]   Right.
[00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.120]   I'm gonna stare at it for every little...
[00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:01.600]   I have reference content that I pay attention to very well, but I don't go through every
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:06.520]   movie I look at and be very critical of how it was encoded, how it sounds.
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:11.560]   But for Tron in particular, everyone is giving it 5 out of 5 for audio and visual quality
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:12.560]   and I'm almost like, "Okay."
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:14.320]   How's the movie?
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:15.320]   I have no idea.
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:16.320]   You've not seen it?
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:17.320]   No.
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:18.320]   Oh my God.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.320]   It was great.
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:20.320]   Really?
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:22.720]   I didn't see the original and I know I lose geek cred by saying that.
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:23.720]   No, that's no.
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:24.720]   But I did not see the original.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:25.720]   The original was terrible.
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:26.720]   This is just...
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:27.720]   You love the original.
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:28.720]   I do.
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:29.720]   And you didn't see the new one?
[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:30.720]   No, not yet.
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:31.720]   So it was so good.
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:32.720]   I mean, it's just...
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.720]   It's beautiful.
[01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:34.720]   There's hot chicks.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:35.720]   There's...
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:36.720]   It's actually the disc.
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:37.720]   There's action.
[01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:38.720]   There's people's arms getting cut off.
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:39.720]   You haven't new trunk?
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:40.720]   Yeah.
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:41.720]   We'll watch it.
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.720]   Dude, it is amazing.
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:43.720]   You should seriously watch it.
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:44.720]   You gotta watch it.
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:45.720]   I think it's on Netflix.
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:50.320]   We were using it to take a look at a TV's ability to put out active 3D.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:53.960]   It looked amazing with some of these newer TVs with a 3D glasses.
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:54.960]   You have a 3D TV?
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:57.960]   We have some in to review over a review.
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.160]   Do you like them?
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.160]   I don't know.
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:05.200]   I think that if you're sitting in a dark room by yourself, it might be worth it for the
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.200]   high end movies.
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:08.640]   And that's the only time I think I'd really want to wear a dark.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.640]   The 3D TV?
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:13.240]   If you have the active 3D glasses and you turn them on, you'll start to feel the flickering.
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.920]   If you're not looking at just the TV, which can give you a headache.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:16.920]   So...
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:17.920]   That sucks.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:18.920]   I'm waiting.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:19.920]   It's too early.
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:20.920]   I don't think it's ever gonna be there.
[01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.600]   It helps to be in a dark room if you do have a 3D TV.
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:27.320]   And now all the lights sit right in the front and center of the screen.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:29.280]   When are the straight up glasses?
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.080]   The ones that you get at the movie theater without the...
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:32.080]   Now.
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.080]   LG's doing that.
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.240]   LG and Vizio are both using the passive techno-
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.360]   Is that better or is the active-
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.360]   It's different.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:39.360]   It's different.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:41.040]   The glasses are cheaper, which is nice.
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.080]   Glasses are dirt cheap.
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:45.280]   So like this yellow includes like four pairs right in the box.
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:46.280]   But it's not as good?
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:48.000]   Well, it's currently half resolution.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.200]   Yeah, lower resolution.
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.920]   So you're losing half the resolution on the screen.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.840]   However, a lot of people claim that they don't suffer from any of the flicker issues or other
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:59.720]   issues where some people get headaches watching the watch in 3D content with liquid crystal
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:00.720]   shutter glasses.
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.640]   You just take a little advil before you start the movie.
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:03.640]   Maybe.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:04.640]   Yeah.
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.640]   And that barf bag right here.
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.480]   It seems to alleviate some of the issues that go into passive.
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:13.120]   However, passive I believe also does wide viewing angles a little bit better.
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:17.120]   You could sit further off to the side, but up and down is where it gets screwed up too.
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:18.120]   So...
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:19.120]   Yeah.
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:21.880]   You're being a guinea pig for a lot of this stuff.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:22.880]   Or a nice deal.
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:28.120]   Or unlike basically the second gen for active shutter glasses and the second gen I imagine
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:32.000]   for passive shutter will double require a double resolution TV.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.160]   So they're going to have quad resolution.
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:36.560]   I'll tell you, that's what I was excited about.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:39.760]   NAB, of course there were all the 3D cameras and everything.
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:42.840]   But there were a lot of 4K displays, 4K cameras.
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:46.880]   There was Sony showed an 8K camera, red showed a 5K camera.
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:52.000]   And James Cameron at the keynote talked about the idea of shooting 48 frames a second for
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.560]   film and 60 frames a second for video.
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:58.480]   And then what you're getting is this super hyper real image that to me is better than
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:01.400]   3D because it looks like real life.
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.240]   Less blurring for frames.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.240]   Beautiful.
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.240]   It's bright.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:08.200]   You know what, it's also a multiple of 24.
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.640]   So I think it'll still retain some of that film look.
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:11.640]   That film quality.
[01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:12.640]   Yes.
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:14.200]   A video that I personally like.
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:15.200]   Nice.
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.200]   Yeah.
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:17.200]   I wouldn't mind.
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:19.840]   And in particular, Jackson for the Hobbit.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.680]   That's where he posted that great post in Facebook.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.440]   They're shooting those all on the epics.
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:26.040]   Doing everything on 48 frames per second.
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:30.680]   He claims, well, as part of it's also that it'll make a better 3D presentation by improving
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:31.840]   the detail of each frame.
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:32.840]   When does that come out?
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:35.360]   I hate hobbits.
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:36.360]   You hate hobbits?
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.040]   What is wrong with you?
[01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:40.320]   Very footed little.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.320]   It's just that whole movie.
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:43.320]   It didn't.
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:44.320]   It's a story.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.320]   Yes, I know it's a story.
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:48.920]   They could have just flew that eagle right to the mortar and dumped the damn ring.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:49.920]   Yeah, you know, that's a good point.
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:50.920]   And about 20 minutes.
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:51.920]   Just try the eagle right there.
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.800]   I used to always think that, but I'm afraid to ask it because I figured maybe I didn't
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.280]   quite realize why they couldn't do that.
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:57.280]   Give up.
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:00.560]   Because it would have been a short movie.
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:01.800]   I do like Gandalf.
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.360]   Well, it doesn't like Gandalf.
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:04.360]   I know.
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:05.360]   Which version?
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:06.360]   Which version?
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:07.360]   Smoking wizards are awesome.
[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:08.360]   The white?
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:09.360]   Again off the gray.
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.360]   Oh, this does look cool.
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:11.360]   No, actually.
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:12.360]   See, I want to watch this for the audio.
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.360]   There's the chicks.
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:15.360]   And I like this.
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:19.600]   You know, you can put almost anybody in latex and they're, well, maybe not.
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:25.400]   But I like how they did the young version of, uh, of, uh, of what's his face.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:26.400]   The bridges.
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.400]   Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:28.720]   That was the reverse Benjamin button.
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:32.560]   They had those dots on over the face to track every portion of the face.
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:33.560]   It's really cool.
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:35.720]   And the two cameras and all the infrared lights right there.
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:37.800]   And it's just a, yeah, we did a special on it.
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:38.800]   It's pretty amazing technology.
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:39.800]   Ooh, stuff.
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:40.800]   They used to.
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:41.800]   Look at that.
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:42.800]   All right, this looks pretty good.
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:43.800]   All the visual effects, right?
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:47.320]   But it's actually a decent plot to respond to it.
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.320]   No, is he still alive?
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.320]   Of course he is.
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.320]   It's my hero.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.320]   Extra five boys.
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:58.200]   He's the, they have the guy who goes, he's not any kind of user sock.
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.840]   He's not any kind of program sock.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.240]   He's a user.
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:03.240]   That was, that was a, you don't know.
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:04.240]   You didn't see the model.
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:05.240]   They did this.
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.240]   The same thing.
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:07.240]   It was the long and same lines.
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:08.240]   People go, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:09.400]   We're going to take a break.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:10.400]   Kevin Rose is here.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.400]   David Prager.
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:12.400]   Robert Herron.
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.920]   It's been too long.
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:19.440]   The original cast of what was called originally the Revenge of the Screen Savers.
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:20.440]   That you blew it out.
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:21.440]   The first twin.
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:22.440]   The tack of the...
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:23.440]   I didn't whip it.
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.760]   I got a cease and desist from G4.
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.240]   They do technically own that name.
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:28.240]   Did you get a letter?
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:29.240]   Yeah.
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.240]   The really interesting.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.240]   Oh, I should have framed it.
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:32.240]   Oh.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.240]   That would have been awesome.
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.120]   You know what, G4 has actually been really nice to me.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:36.120]   I'm bet.
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:37.120]   Yeah.
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.120]   They've been very kind.
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:41.920]   They, they say they have all the old tech TV shows in a vault somewhere.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:42.920]   It was tough.
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:46.360]   I remember I wanted to find something that they did and I emailed a few people over there
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:49.320]   who were more than willing to help, but it's just so hard to...
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.960]   They didn't organize the stuff in the vault, so they can't...
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.960]   It's not easy to find out what tape number certain thing is.
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:55.960]   Right.
[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:56.960]   Yeah, finding this stuff.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:01.600]   But I can find like, I can find the web page associated with a piece of video content,
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:04.720]   but they can't link that piece of content to a tape in their vault.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:08.600]   Yeah, but what kills me is they're still taking down some of the videos on YouTube.
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:12.720]   Like I tweeted out something that was an old tech TV clip.
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:13.880]   It was like a segment.
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:14.880]   Why?
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.960]   It was, it said this has been removed by G4, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:17.960]   And that was like six months ago.
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:18.960]   Why?
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:19.960]   Come on.
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:20.960]   I know.
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:21.960]   I don't get it.
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:22.960]   You know, it sucks because I didn't have a copy of that anywhere.
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.920]   I was like, oh, look at this crazy, awesome moment.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:26.160]   And then like, it was gone.
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:27.600]   And I'll never see that again.
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:28.600]   It sucks.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:32.960]   So, God, this was at Blog World two years ago, so I'm starting to wonder maybe if I just
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:38.440]   dreamed it, but the, the web guys from G4 came up to me and said, Leo, we have everything
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:39.920]   ever recorded.
[01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:44.520]   We have been quietly digitizing it all this time, you know, putting, converting it for
[01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:46.200]   the web all this time.
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:50.600]   And we want to put up a tech TV history site where everything would be there.
[01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:54.720]   But we don't want to do it if you say, you know, I hate the idea and I said, I love the
[01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:55.720]   idea.
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:57.600]   Well, they own tech TV.com.
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:58.600]   So I said, do it.
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:01.720]   Now I haven't heard from them ever since.
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:03.160]   So I think that's fantastic.
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:04.360]   And I'd love it if they did that.
[01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:06.240]   These, you know, there's some people still within there.
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.680]   I mean, you worked there for another six months or so, Kevin.
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:11.400]   I remember you weren't real happy working there, but you stayed there for a while.
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:12.400]   Yeah.
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:15.800]   There are people in there who are fans who would love to see that old stuff come up,
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:19.880]   be up on the, at least on the web where it wouldn't cost them anything to offer it.
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:20.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:22.640]   I wonder how many of those people are still left though.
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:23.640]   Not many.
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:24.640]   Yeah.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.480]   Well, if they're listening right now, I, what happened?
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:29.160]   I'd love to, whatever I can do.
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:32.840]   And if, if nothing else, could I just get some old shows that we could just put in reruns
[01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:33.840]   here?
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:34.840]   We'd run them late night.
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:38.880]   It'd be fun to run old screen savers late night with heavy awesome.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:39.880]   Nobody would mind that.
[01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:44.960]   They're not going to, does Internet Archive have any of, I have a bunch of old tech TV
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.720]   on videotape on tape.
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:47.720]   On tape.
[01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:48.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:49.720]   VHS tape.
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:50.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:52.720]   I captured a ton of them for, for putting together a reel that I was going to do.
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:54.440]   I was just, I had probably have like 30 or 40s.
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.520]   I mean, people send me DVDs once in a while.
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:00.520]   You know, I have a collection, but I don't dare when I get them, I'll show a couple and
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:01.840]   I'll go, I don't want to get sued.
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:02.840]   So I'll just, I'll chicken out.
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:05.240]   Yeah, but worst case, it is going to send you a season to sis.
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:06.240]   You're right.
[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:07.240]   All right.
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:09.440]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:14.840]   John, John, look in, I think there's some, I think there's some DVDs down here somewhere.
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:18.840]   Let's see if we can find some old sc, I'd love to find it somewhere.
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:21.440]   I have Kevin Rose's first appearance tech TV.
[01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:22.960]   I think that's actually still on YouTube.
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:25.480]   Oh, is that the one where he found the dark tipper?
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:30.200]   And we found a, you have found a hole in a chat capability in an NSN chat of some sort.
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.760]   Is that on YouTube still?
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:32.760]   I don't know.
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:33.760]   I'm going to see.
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:39.000]   You know what, sad is Google videos going away.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   They're killing Google video.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.960]   Why is it so sad?
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:45.120]   Well, I mean, there's some, there's some stuff on Google video that's not on YouTube.
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.960]   Can't they see that's what confuses me.
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:48.200]   Maybe the transition is bad.
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:52.240]   At one point, I thought that everything that was on Google video, they somehow magically
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:57.320]   transcoded it into a YouTube account of sort of figure they do, but maybe not.
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:01.560]   They need a button that says move it over and they apparently they don't do it.
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:02.960]   The first is just download it.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:06.160]   I was a Kevin Rose first appearance on the screen savers.
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:08.360]   Is the day are YouTube videos kept forever?
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:09.520]   Oh, this is it.
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:12.200]   It's the last episode of the attack of the show.
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:19.320]   Theoretically, yeah, that you were on and they showed a video of you from your first appearance.
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:20.800]   So is that it?
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:22.360]   Kevin, is that what you're thinking of?
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:24.000]   Hey, it could have been.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.320]   It says goodbye, Kevin Rose.
[01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:27.320]   I'll see if we'll play.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:30.200]   We'll, we'll, we'll, we'll massive copyright violations ahead.
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.200]   Stay tuned.
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.880]   Hey, you know, we're all friends.
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:37.560]   Hey, is go to assist express.
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.360]   How is that related to go to my PC?
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:40.360]   Same company.
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:41.360]   Okay.
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:44.240]   Same back end with additional features designed for remote access.
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.880]   So like eight sessions at once.
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:46.880]   Oh, all right.
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:47.880]   So like you start and install, you move to the next one.
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:52.360]   So I put go to my PC and my mom's computer and I manage her stuff.
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:54.040]   You can basically do the same thing.
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:55.040]   Florida.
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:56.040]   And I'm like, I'll get you an account.
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:58.560]   You could do the, it's the same thing except it has more features like unattended.
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:09:59.560]   So she's not there.
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:01.560]   And you can share it with your mom.
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:03.320]   And it's like, oh, and you can chat while she's doing it.
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:05.320]   But this, this would let you do it on a 10.
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.800]   It saves me a heart attack.
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:07.800]   It's huge.
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:12.500]   So someone named fee in the chat room, he tweeted out a link to the ultimate gaming
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.500]   machine from 1990.
[01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:14.500]   Yeah, we've shown that.
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:15.500]   In fact, we did.
[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:17.000]   When I first started, I don't even know what the specs are.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.540]   When Colleen was here, we, we did the, we first started to live our live streaming video.
[01:10:22.540 --> 01:10:29.760]   We in, in an homage 10 years later, 2008 did the ultimate, the 10 years later, ultimate
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:30.760]   gaming machine, she actually 20.
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:31.760]   Is it 10?
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.200]   10 years later, ultimate gaming machine.
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:38.120]   And it was a massive monster machine, but we would show that video too.
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:41.840]   So yeah, that, that's kind of fun to see because it was a Pentium two.
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:43.400]   It was pretty funky.
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:47.720]   I remember I was privileged enough down in our products room.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:53.120]   We had a, I think it was AMD who had the first commercially shipping gigahertz processor.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.120]   Wow.
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:56.000]   And they sent us a computer reference box with it.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.760]   And I remember how Gideon was with excitement just to be carrying it.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:00.240]   And I was a little afraid elevator I had.
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:02.000]   I'm like, Oh my God, there's a gig of her computer.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   Holy crap.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.920]   And now you've now I won't buy a phone unless it's got two gigahertz processor.
[01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:09.160]   I'm holding out for the bionic because I want the two.
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:14.320]   I just remember the plasma TVs we had at tech TV, how are they were all like 15 to $17,000
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.320]   for a minute, too much.
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:17.360]   And by the way, all burnt in badly.
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:20.040]   So badly, I guess that's not a problem anymore.
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.760]   But boy, no, they were badly.
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:23.160]   You can do it if you really, really try.
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:26.920]   You really have to pretty much have to go unconscious for about five days.
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:27.920]   Right.
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:28.920]   I think they all have like this.
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:29.920]   Crens a result, Mike.
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:30.920]   Mike.
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:31.920]   Yeah.
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:34.920]   You do a little pixel orbiting or they slowly move the picture around and among other stuff.
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:39.440]   Hey, this portion of this week in tech, our sixth anniversary episode brought to you by
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:42.800]   one of our newer sponsors, but we sure love them.
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:47.280]   The great guys, Anthony Castellain and his crew at squarespace.com, squarespace.com/twit.
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:51.320]   If you'd like to sign up for a free trial, I know they advertise on a revision three as
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:52.320]   well.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.040]   They're just great, great little company.
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:55.280]   Should not little anymore.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.040]   They got, what do they get, $48 million.
[01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.040]   Is that your capital?
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:59.040]   Something Mike.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.040]   Remember, they're doing all right.
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.040]   Thank goodness.
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:06.160]   Because they offer a service that is unique.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:08.760]   It's hosting and content management together.
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:10.200]   And this is the best hosting.
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:14.160]   Robert, if you were on this, there are no way they'd be able to bring you down.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:18.640]   Can I get you an account for herinfidelity.com?
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:20.160]   I think it might be time.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:24.480]   Let's move off of that WordPress piece and come to squarespace.
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:25.480]   Come to us.
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:26.480]   I'll take your code down to us.
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:28.320]   You could actually take the code that you have for your existing site.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:31.800]   But more importantly, I think you can take drop down menus of all the features that you
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:34.920]   want, pick and choose the ones that you want, and then scale them to the, you know, how
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:38.320]   you want them to look, what you want the functionality to be for the most part.
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.320]   It's pretty neat.
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:41.600]   I'm being convinced without the doubt.
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:42.600]   Take the tour.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:45.040]   I tell you a couple of things about squarespace that you'll like.
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:49.600]   First of all, they start with some great templates, but they're very easy to customize
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:50.600]   so they're unique.
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:53.000]   You don't want herinfidelity to look like everybody else, right?
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.000]   Not at all.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.240]   They're beginning of these templates.
[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:57.800]   But then I don't know if you use CSS on your site.
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:01.280]   If you do, you can paste the CSS in from your site and make it look exactly like your
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:02.280]   site.
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:03.280]   Very cool.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.000]   So the design, all the designs, you paid for a nice design.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.440]   They can be moved over.
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:11.360]   Drag and drop, so it makes it very easy like the sliders and everything to customize.
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:12.360]   Oh, like a worm tools.
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:13.360]   Do they have like a forum?
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.360]   Yeah, they got a forum.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.360]   Nice.
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:16.360]   Great forum.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:17.360]   It's one thing I'm kind of missing that I should add.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:18.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:21.200]   Well, they're, you know, like any good website now, they realize interactivity is the key.
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:24.240]   So they've got a forum building and data collection.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.480]   They've got photo galleries and yes, they have forums.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:29.880]   I do a lot of stuff by email, but it'd be nice to have that in a forum environment where
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:31.120]   everyone can look at it.
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:32.480]   You have an iPad or an iPhone?
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:33.480]   I have an iPhone.
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:39.280]   Yeah, they have a great iPhone app that lets you not only post, but also moderate comments,
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.640]   DSPAM, look at stats.
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:41.640]   I love doing that.
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:42.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:45.000]   You need, you need to have mobile access to this.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.120]   It is the stats package is fantastic.
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.240]   I just go on and on.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:51.080]   This is hosting that will never go down on you.
[01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:52.800]   This is a great content management system.
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.320]   You could try it free for two weeks.
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:57.400]   Squarespace.com/twit click the ring button.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.920]   You don't need a credit card.
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:00.680]   Just need the site name.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:04.160]   Heron Fidelity, the password and email address.
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:07.040]   And they don't, by the way, the email is just to let you know that your subscription is
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:08.880]   about to, you know, your trial is about to run out.
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:11.720]   And if you forget your password, they won't use it for anything else.
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:13.680]   And then a little capture and you're done.
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:18.240]   And they will import from your WordPress blog WordPress type pad blogger or movable type.
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:22.440]   So that means everything comments, links, everything.
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:27.360]   Yeah, images, they all come over so that you're, you basically you're up and running within,
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:32.960]   I would say if you started, you know, like the show ends up by 5.30, you're done.
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:35.600]   And you've got a site free for two weeks and then just play with it.
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.880]   That way you don't have a, but, but Robert.
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:40.360]   Robert, you know somebody in the business.
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:43.960]   If you decide you want a Squarespace blog, I will get you a Squarespace blog and no cost
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:44.960]   to you.
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:45.960]   Wow.
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:46.960]   I just happened.
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.600]   I'm going to say for everybody.
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:51.600]   You have to pay so that Robert can get it for free.
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:52.600]   Squarespace.com/twit.
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:54.400]   No, they do.
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.800]   I think Kevin, you're on Squarespace.
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:56.800]   I am.
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:59.080]   They'll give, they'll give prominent bloggers.
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:00.840]   It's a good promotional vehicle.
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:05.200]   They'll give prominent bloggers a page, you know, because, you know, when you do the ads,
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.920]   you probably do some ads on HD Nation.
[01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:07.920]   I do.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.960]   So you could have gotten this before.
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:11.960]   I'm not doing anything for you.
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:13.640]   Senior Norton has been pressuring me.
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:14.640]   He's like, uh, we need to.
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.520]   Oh, Mr. Norton, who never had a webpage.
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:18.520]   He set up so many web pages for Patrick.
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:20.160]   I love his Facebook page.
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:21.400]   It's just a blank picture.
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:22.400]   He posted that silhouette.
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:23.400]   Really?
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:24.560]   He's so funny.
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:26.400]   It's like he's almost like an aversion to me.
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:29.160]   It would be amazing if he came out one time and was like, I've never used a computer.
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.400]   And we're like, you're faking the entire time.
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:32.400]   No!
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.640]   He's much more comfortable with a sledgehammer than he is with a computer.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:36.800]   That's for sure.
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.280]   This is violating the copyright attack of the show.
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.800]   Oh, this is such a bad copy.
[01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:42.800]   There's no one could complain.
[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:43.800]   So that's Kevin.
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:44.800]   Who is that?
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:45.800]   Is that Sarah?
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:47.400]   I can't even tell it's so blurry.
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:48.840]   I think that's Sarah.
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:50.880]   And that's you, Kevin, in your last episode.
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.760]   They made Kevin Pereira on Twitter.
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:54.760]   You should know.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.760]   No, no, I don't have any man, G4 on Twitter.
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:57.760]   I don't know.
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:58.760]   He's an amazing guy, right?
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:15:59.760]   Yeah, he is.
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:02.080]   He seems like a nice guy, but I just don't want to have any G4 people on.
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.120]   You look like you're 12, Kevin.
[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:05.120]   Yes.
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:06.600]   Look how young you look.
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.600]   But we have a little surprise for you.
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:09.600]   Those are the days.
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:13.720]   This is, uh, this is right about when you, when we were actually doing, uh, maybe episode
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:16.320]   10 or 15 have twitted you announced you were leaving G4.
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.320]   Mm-hmm.
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.120]   They made Sarah be blonde.
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:20.120]   That's right.
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:22.120]   They four-started a day or a day or a day.
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:23.120]   Oh, jeez.
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:24.120]   Yes, I remember that.
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:25.120]   It's a nice set, though.
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:26.120]   I like the set.
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:27.120]   Yeah, that was a weird set.
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:29.200]   I was, I only spent in a couple days on that set.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.280]   No, it was just when they...
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:32.280]   So this is when they...
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:34.040]   Was it a tack of the show or was it a spring set?
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:35.040]   Yeah, it was a tack of the show.
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.040]   Okay.
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.440]   Here's the first, here's...
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.440]   So they're going to roll the first appearance.
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:42.600]   We have found out there's a service running that lets spammers or could lets spammers bombard
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:44.680]   you with messages.
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:45.680]   You look the same.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:47.880]   Actually, over there in the neck camp, Santa Claus.
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:48.880]   I look younger now.
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:49.880]   I can do, actually.
[01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:50.880]   You're thinner.
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:51.880]   Let's have her.
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:52.880]   Let's go out of here.
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:53.880]   You're in better shape.
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:54.880]   Shh.
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:55.880]   I have a secret plan.
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:56.880]   And how did you find this whole...
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:58.960]   Well, just playing around with a couple of friends, you know, we like to talk about it.
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:02.680]   By the way, that screen behind us, that's the ultimate gaming machine right there.
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:03.680]   Oh, wow.
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:04.680]   Oh, wow.
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:05.680]   A friend of mine and just, uh...
[01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:06.680]   Antech case.
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:08.680]   Started playing around and actually started spamming some machines.
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:09.680]   Well, the first...
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.080]   You don't look nervous at all, Kevin.
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:12.080]   You're very calm.
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:14.160]   Uh, I was very nervous.
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:15.320]   You really did a nice job.
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:17.920]   I did a shot before, uh, I think I went on there.
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:18.920]   You did a shot before...
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:19.920]   I think so.
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:20.920]   I was really...
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:21.920]   No, that was the first time I hosted the screen-
[01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:22.920]   Hosting shot.
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:23.920]   A little more scary.
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:25.240]   I'm graphic usually consistent with drawing pictures on the blackboard.
[01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.240]   We did a lot of blackboard.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.240]   We did a lot of blackboard.
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:28.240]   I did that on purpose.
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:30.160]   I really wanted us to be approachable.
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:32.160]   I wish I had that cut out.
[01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:34.800]   I used to have to draw up those blackboards before the segments.
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.360]   By the way, I have to leave them on the laminac.
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.720]   You know what's to make me draw those blackboards up, by the way?
[01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.320]   There'd be segments of like, "Explain how this works."
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.320]   And where I'd go, "Pryger, you'd be like, 'Kevin, you do a really good job.'
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:44.360]   And I'd go and draw a little blackboard diagram."
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.360]   I loved that.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.360]   I did that on purpose.
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:48.800]   You know, we could have had higher quality, fancy screens.
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:50.800]   It was a lot of different things.
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:53.000]   I remember I used to be a professor class.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:54.000]   These little things.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.760]   Like, I want to show how a laser reads a screen.
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:56.760]   Oh, forget it.
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:57.760]   Next week.
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:58.760]   Yeah.
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:17:59.760]   Two weeks.
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:00.760]   I'd give them a picture and they'd give me a diagram.
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:02.400]   And then I'd tell them, like, 'I want to animate it like this.'
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:03.400]   No.
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:04.400]   Forget it.
[01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:05.400]   Whereas...
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:06.400]   Yeah, I remember that.
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:07.480]   The other thing is, this is very approachable and accessible.
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:09.040]   And I just didn't want to look too high gloss.
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:11.080]   I really wanted it to feel...
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.760]   How are you younger now?
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:15.320]   Is that oil of a lay?
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:16.320]   Yeah.
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:17.320]   Stem cells.
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:18.320]   Shots.
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:19.320]   Stem cell.
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:20.320]   Sugar bloods.
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:21.320]   Me and Kate.
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:22.320]   Tiger blood.
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.320]   Tiger blood.
[01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:24.320]   Winning.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.400]   So, yeah, that was Kevin's first appearance.
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:30.600]   And Paul Block, who was our executive producer at the time, liked it so much he decided to
[01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:32.720]   call you the dark tipper.
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:35.600]   And you would come on and do scary hackers.
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:36.600]   Hacker segments.
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:37.600]   Yeah.
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:41.320]   And from that, you started doing system, which was supposed to be kind of originally hacker.
[01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:42.320]   Right.
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:43.320]   Hacker-y.
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:44.320]   Yeah, started system.
[01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:46.600]   Only did a couple of episodes, like three or four episodes of system.
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:49.360]   And then Digg was starting to take off at the same time, so I was like, 'I got to focus
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:50.360]   on this.'
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:54.120]   The last one you did, we got that guy who's an expert on asterisk.
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:55.120]   Should I have to make your own PBX?
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:56.680]   Which is actually kind of fun.
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:57.680]   That was hard for us.
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:58.680]   I learned a lot about it, but it was really...
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:00.120]   That's really hard for us.
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:01.120]   Yeah.
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:02.120]   Yeah.
[01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:03.120]   That's the kind of show I want to keep doing.
[01:19:03.120 --> 01:19:04.120]   I love those kinds of tricks.
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:05.120]   Oh, those are fun, yeah.
[01:19:05.120 --> 01:19:07.520]   System was a great brand.
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:08.520]   And I don't see any...
[01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:09.520]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:13.240]   I know that there's a bunch of economical things going on, but it'd be great to be able...
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:17.080]   We've got a lot of like these little DIY life hacker type shows now.
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.000]   We've got three of those now.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.000]   System...
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.360]   Because it was system.org is the domain that I could only find.
[01:19:22.360 --> 01:19:23.760]   I bought for like 500 bucks.
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:26.960]   It's got great SEO because it doesn't have the E in it.
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:29.800]   DudeSystem.com, S-Y-S-T-M.com became available.
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:31.360]   I didn't tell you this, like a month ago.
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:32.360]   Get it.
[01:19:32.360 --> 01:19:33.360]   I bought it.
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:34.360]   Yes.
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:35.360]   I didn't know it was going to be a good one.
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:36.360]   I know it.
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:37.360]   I could tell exactly what you're going to do.
[01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:38.360]   Well, I use it...
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.360]   I use it...
[01:19:39.360 --> 01:19:40.360]   No, not.
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:41.360]   But where does it go right now?
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:42.360]   You should at least forward it to System.org.
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:43.360]   Well, I thought System's down.
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:44.360]   System.org.
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:45.360]   System.org.
[01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:46.680]   Yeah, I thought you guys were stopped in the show.
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:48.640]   So we're talking...
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:52.440]   We're going to make a makerspace, a hacker space in the new studio.
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:53.920]   We have a special area of the studio.
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:54.920]   I'll show you.
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:55.920]   We're going to go over after the show.
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:56.920]   I'll show you.
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:58.360]   I'm telling you, it's...
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:19:59.600]   Make magazine is going to be over there.
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.720]   We're going to be Jerry Ellsworth's going to be building stuff.
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:03.920]   I think maybe a little system.
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:04.920]   Nice.
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:05.920]   Little area.
[01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:06.920]   A little nook.
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:08.480]   A little system nook.
[01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:09.480]   I definitely come out and do some stuff.
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:11.320]   Actually, was the broken first or was it late?
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:12.320]   Broken was first.
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:13.320]   The broken was first.
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:14.320]   Yeah.
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:16.120]   That was my real start because you started plugging the broken.
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:20.520]   You mentioned it a couple of times on Tech TV and I got a lot of traffic to that little
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:22.000]   podcast.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:23.000]   People love the broken.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:24.000]   I like those videos.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   It was a podcast.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000]   There was no podcast.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000]   I think RSS barely existed.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000]   Yeah, it was just...
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.680]   I remember when Chris Perulo discovered RSS and he almost is...
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:32.680]   His head almost exploded.
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:35.640]   He came running into the conference room at Tech TV.
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:37.640]   This is the same day I must be.
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:40.760]   And he was almost literally bouncing off the walls.
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:41.760]   Like, " RSS!
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:42.760]   It's amazing.
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:43.760]   It's unbelievable."
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:47.080]   And I was like, "Come down, Chris."
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:48.080]   He was nuts.
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:51.360]   I think he still is nuts.
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:52.360]   In a good way.
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:53.360]   In a good way.
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:54.440]   We love Chris.
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.080]   Good.
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:57.880]   The broken.
[01:20:57.880 --> 01:20:59.800]   By the way, you could still get free pizza apparently.
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:00.800]   It still works.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:01.800]   Amazing.
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:02.800]   Amazing.
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:05.080]   Some things never end.
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:07.040]   Asia has run out of IP addresses.
[01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.520]   About time.
[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:14.320]   I don't know what's going to happen with IPV6, but we're getting close to the end.
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:15.720]   It has to be coming soon.
[01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:16.720]   No?
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:17.720]   Yeah.
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:18.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:25.800]   This is the first big ISP to run out of IPV4.
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:30.360]   Do you think of all the devices in a home in the next decade that will have individually
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:31.360]   addressable devices?
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:32.360]   Sure.
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:33.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:34.360]   You could nad all those things.
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:36.680]   Why has IPV6 not been implemented faster?
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:37.680]   It's ugly.
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:44.520]   No, it's good, but it's ugly because none of the hardware, none of the routers do it.
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:48.080]   So you can right now, you can get IPV6 from Hurricane Electric.
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:52.240]   You can get a, it's basically a tunneling through IPV4 to you.
[01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:59.920]   And you can have, I think, a Class C. You can have 32,000 addresses for free because
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:00.920]   there's so many.
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:01.920]   Go ahead.
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:02.920]   Have as many as you want.
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:09.400]   Meanwhile, APNIC, Asia PacificNIC has released the last block of IPV4 addresses.
[01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:11.560]   They're gone.
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:17.480]   So from this day onwards, according to APNIC Director, General Paul Wilson, if you want
[01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:21.960]   to build new internet networks and services in Asia Pacific, you have to use IPV6.
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:23.720]   That'll speed things along.
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:28.120]   Well, the, the limit of IPV4 addresses is four million.
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:29.120]   Four million.
[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:30.120]   Just four point two billion.
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:31.120]   Four billion.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:36.640]   And with IPV6, it's, I mean, it's more than there are grains of sand in the universe,
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:37.640]   more than the ad it's in the galaxy.
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:43.720]   I'm surprised that with 4.2 billion, I don't know what the third world has, but I'm surprised
[01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:49.840]   it took this long to run out because of the fact that half of every device that gets made
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:54.440]   now that has a ability to connect to the internet has to have a designation.
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:55.440]   Right.
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:57.000]   A lot of nat addressing.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:58.000]   Nat addressing.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000]   Exactly.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.360]   What people some, we had to Dane Jasper in here in our triangulation show, which is our
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.360]   interview show.
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:07.480]   He's a sonic net founder and runs it.
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:09.520]   It was great ISK, independent ISB.
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:14.200]   He said you may never see IPV6 because you'll, what you'll see is, um, nagging from, you
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:17.520]   know, ISP level, nagging to handle this.
[01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:21.840]   Well, we can, for anyone who wants to read more, Wikipedia does a great articles for
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:24.520]   IPV4 and IPV6.
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:26.360]   That's just good quality reading right there.
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:27.360]   Late night.
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:28.360]   Late night.
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:31.720]   I'm glad you don't do the broken anymore.
[01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:34.160]   Kevin says, no mobile, mobile.
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:36.120]   So let's talk about the flip.
[01:23:36.120 --> 01:23:39.520]   Cisco, which bought the flip got bought pure digital.
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:47.320]   The creators of the flip, a San Francisco company two years ago for $590 million.
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:51.240]   This week, shuttered to the company and fired 550 people.
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:56.040]   That's a loss of a lot of money.
[01:23:56.040 --> 01:24:01.280]   I don't have like hindsight's always 2020, but I remember when they bought this, wasn't
[01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:02.280]   that long ago and I don't know.
[01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:03.280]   We were all saying what the hell are they thinking?
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:07.980]   I didn't know all the variables, but I thought, huh, maybe Cisco's going to go more, even
[01:24:07.980 --> 01:24:08.980]   more consumer.
[01:24:08.980 --> 01:24:10.640]   I thought, is Cisco going to make a phone?
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:13.160]   I thought that because I knew phones have video cameras.
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:15.320]   I thought, wow, they're a big enough company.
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:18.760]   You know, when Apple created decided we're going to make a phone, people, you know, at
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:20.840]   first like really Apple's going to get in the phone business?
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:21.960]   And of course, you know, they did.
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:23.600]   And Cisco's a big enough company.
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.680]   They could have probably designed a pretty amazing phone.
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:28.280]   Cisco said they wanted to understand the consumer space.
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:29.560]   They didn't have any sense of it.
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:30.840]   They weren't near a networking company.
[01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:33.240]   And so they said, we're going to learn about the consumer space.
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:36.800]   I guess what they learned is they didn't want to be in the consumer space because they
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.360]   just, they could have spun it out.
[01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:39.360]   They could have sold it.
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:44.280]   I had a buddy of mine that knows some folks over in like the M&A department of Cisco.
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:49.400]   One of the things that he told me is that Cisco, what they like to see are, is anything
[01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:52.880]   out there, any technology that's out there that pushes more bandwidth.
[01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:55.080]   They want more and more bandwidth being pushed.
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:57.080]   They'll invest in that technology.
[01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:00.720]   It's like, they just want to, they want people to upgrade their routers.
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:03.960]   They want big service providers to buy more and more expensive routers.
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:04.960]   That's their business.
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:05.960]   And that's their business.
[01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:09.760]   It reminds me of when HP came to us one time, I don't know if I should say this.
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:11.160]   I don't know, get in trouble.
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:12.160]   Well, I'll say it.
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:18.400]   HP came to us one time and said that they wanted to put a icon on a website that I was
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:19.560]   working at at the time.
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:24.960]   I won't say which one that said print this article and they were going to pay us like
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:25.960]   a million dollars.
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.320]   Because they knew they'd make big bucks.
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.280]   Because they know off the ink cartridges and all that stuff.
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:31.040]   And I was like, we're not taking that money.
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:32.440]   Like that's just killing the environment.
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:34.400]   But they wanted to put this like print this with HP.
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:36.800]   But isn't that on every site now, the print this article?
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:38.880]   Well, yeah, there's a lot of them on their butt.
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:41.440]   That just formats the page for a printer.
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:42.440]   But you're buttoned.
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:44.840]   No, it triggers, it triggers the actual print process.
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:45.840]   So where we're like, bring up that thing.
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:47.840]   So they wanted you to actually, we'd like print.
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:49.840]   And actually go and print more articles.
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:51.600]   And you didn't do that?
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:52.960]   It's just a horrible thing.
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:54.240]   One, it looks like it's slightly crappy.
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:57.360]   Why would you have a huge, like the ad was not like this little tiny print.
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:58.360]   Oh, it had to be big.
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:00.120]   It was like a decent size like print this.
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:01.440]   I'm like, really?
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:02.920]   Who's printing out these stories?
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:03.920]   I admire you, Kevin.
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:05.080]   Because I'm sure that was big bucks.
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:06.880]   Did Cisco's like medium bucks?
[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:09.560]   It's flip 100% dead all the people gone.
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:12.080]   Because the article, there's an article on giga.
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:14.480]   Yeah, he suggested they could have sold it, spun it.
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:15.480]   Can he get a bunch?
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:17.440]   Yeah, sell it, spin it off or harvest it for what it's worth.
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:20.960]   I mean, that's better than just killing it and firing people.
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:25.400]   I'm surprised by the acquisition and I'm surprised by the way it was ended.
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:26.840]   It's how arrogant a big company can be.
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:27.880]   But who's going to buy it though?
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:29.920]   I mean, this is my flip right here.
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:30.640]   It's my iPhone.
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:31.840]   It's my Android device.
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:32.520]   That's my flip.
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:34.760]   Like who needs another portable camera?
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:40.080]   Yeah, but you have like a $700 replacement for a cell phone compared to say like a $200 flip camera.
[01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:45.240]   And judging by Christmas sales alone, I know so many people that bought that camera to give us a gift.
[01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:47.440]   Were they losing money on this?
[01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:48.120]   I don't know.
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:53.880]   And I could have seen them maybe moving into more create network cameras, create ad cameras into routers.
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:54.720]   You know, things like that.
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:57.240]   I bet you they did some of the harvesting type of thing.
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:26:58.240]   I mean, a lot of the technology-
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:26:59.280]   Like what do you say harvesting?
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:04.320]   Well, like you take existing processes of making some of the hardware, it's in the flip into doing-
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:05.800]   So they bought it for the IP?
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:06.920]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:09.640]   I mean, they made $400 million last year.
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:10.760]   That's a lot of flips.
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:14.600]   Why would you tell me that the brand name is worth at least $5 million?
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:19.360]   And as recently as a Super Bowl, they had those great ads where they showed people's flip videos.
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:22.120]   I mean, they were spending a lot of money on advertising just a couple of months ago.
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:23.280]   It does feel weird.
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:23.800]   What was-
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:24.280]   It does feel strange.
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:24.760]   What was the deal with that?
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:27.920]   Like, why would they buy Super Bowl ads if they knew they were going to kill it a couple of months later?
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:29.560]   Well, obviously they didn't know.
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:31.120]   Well, no, that's the way a lot of advertising-
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:31.320]   Yeah.
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.520]   They bought it for the agency.
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:35.080]   They had all this money committed to the agency.
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:38.640]   The agency put these ad campaigns and they didn't pull the money back out of the agency.
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:41.240]   Yeah, but they could have changed the ad to like some Cisco routers and Russell.
[01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:44.640]   You could have been going as millions of dollars were being spent on promoting it.
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:45.640]   It's kind of sad.
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:46.640]   That is sad.
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:49.360]   Well, I mean, come on.
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:50.760]   I bought two flips for my kids.
[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:52.080]   I never used it.
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:53.560]   I mean, they never used it.
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:56.600]   Someone says Cisco did have a phone, the iPhone, because remember they owned me.
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:57.600]   Oh, they did.
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:58.600]   That's right.
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:27:59.600]   Okay, get this.
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:00.600]   Jesse Jackson Jr.
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:05.400]   He's a representative, that's a representative, Democrat from Illinois.
[01:28:05.400 --> 01:28:09.560]   Listen to what he has to say about why the nation is an economic turmoil.
[01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.040]   This is from C-SPAN.
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:14.160]   Some American jobs.
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:19.320]   Now borders is closing stores because why do you need to go to borders anymore?
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:20.600]   Why do you need to go to Barnes and Noble?
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:27.280]   Just buy an iPad and download your book, download your newspaper, download your magazine, Chicago
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:29.360]   State University and my congressional district.
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:33.600]   In freshman class, they're not being given textbooks any longer.
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:38.840]   They're all being given iPads as they enter school.
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:46.120]   Wayne Watson hopes to have a text book list campus within four years where at this state
[01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:50.160]   university they no longer have textbooks.
[01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:55.040]   Well what becomes of publishing companies that are publishing company jobs?
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:29:01.440]   What becomes of bookstores and librarians and all of the jobs associated with paper?
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:08.440]   Well, in not too distant future, such jobs simply will not exist.
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:12.640]   If you believe jobs is doing pretty well, it's created the iPad.
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:19.400]   Certainly it's made life more efficient for Americans but the iPad is produced in China.
[01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:21.760]   It's not produced here in the United States.
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:27.920]   So the Chinese get to take advantage of our first American, our first amendment value.
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:31.680]   That is to provide freedom of speech through the iPad to the American people.
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:36.920]   But there is no protection for jobs here in America to ensure that the American people
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:39.040]   are being put to work.
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:42.240]   He says the iPad is killing the American economy.
[01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:46.880]   Well, I mean, wait a minute, it gets worse because one month ago the same guy, Jesse Jackson,
[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:51.440]   Jr., and he got a lot of heat for it said that the federal government should buy an iPad
[01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:55.600]   for every student in America because it was the future of America.
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:29:57.560]   Not intended to be a factual statement.
[01:29:57.560 --> 01:30:00.760]   Apparently he's very confused.
[01:30:00.760 --> 01:30:06.840]   He says the problem in America is that the iPad is eliminating thousands of American
[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:07.840]   jobs.
[01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:08.840]   Now he does have a point.
[01:30:08.840 --> 01:30:11.040]   I mean, it is being made in China, but come on.
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:15.840]   It's like saying, you know, oh, the buggy whip makers, they're all out of work now.
[01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:18.040]   What are we going to do?
[01:30:18.040 --> 01:30:22.040]   That was the only point that he had was about the students who can have books that cost
[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:25.000]   say, yeah, the intent of what the print is cost.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.400]   That's a scam in and of itself.
[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:29.480]   Well, I mean, there's a lot of people that are trying to stifle innovation.
[01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:31.480]   I mean, there's a couple of examples.
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:33.120]   One of them, there's two examples.
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:36.480]   One of them Kevin can speak to more in a second, but one of them was like, there's
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:41.200]   a company called Uber that does a private car dispatching.
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:42.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:45.120]   They had all the, yeah, Eddie Cabs in South by Southwest.
[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:46.120]   Yeah.
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:49.400]   And part of it was part of the season to assist was not only like the way it's legally supposed
[01:30:49.400 --> 01:30:52.600]   to work, but the fact that they might be competing with the jobs that are provided to
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:54.400]   the people that have the balance drive the cabs.
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:57.160]   Now, the example that Kevin's going to give here, if he doesn't know what I'm talking
[01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:58.160]   about.
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:30:59.160]   I have no idea.
[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:02.040]   What I'm going to give is the people that do square.
[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:03.040]   Oh, yes.
[01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:04.040]   Yeah.
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:06.840]   And like that was they were being sued by, was it vera sign?
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:07.840]   Yeah.
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:12.640]   And so with vera phone, what they wanted to do is saying that instead of like, you know,
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:16.200]   square who made this great technology where you can interface with an iPhone and you can
[01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:20.240]   scan the credit card across the top, they're saying that that's going to propagate fraud
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:23.080]   to try and basically what they're doing is they're trying to protect their business number
[01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:27.680]   one and two, they're trying to take away the, they're trying to take away the threat that
[01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:30.480]   this company provided to what their core business was, which is like,
[01:31:30.480 --> 01:31:34.480]   Verifone demanded that square recall their credit card readers.
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:35.480]   Yes.
[01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:38.800]   Well, the sad thing is that you can buy a credit card reader for like $30 on the internet.
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:42.160]   Any blank credit card reader, I can put any sticker I want on the outside and go walk up
[01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:44.600]   to someone and say, Hey, I'm going to sell these flowers to you.
[01:31:44.600 --> 01:31:48.600]   Let me swipe your card and then I have their credit card or I'm a waiter and I can take
[01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:51.600]   in the back room and take a picture of the front and the back and I have the credit card.
[01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:57.520]   What's also interesting is, so your point is that this is an example of people who are
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:01.920]   entrenched businesses currently terrified by the changes that are happening.
[01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:05.720]   Well, I mean, in another way you can put it is that if you're worried that like the,
[01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:09.680]   if we're falling behind to other countries who are in the technology sector who are innovating
[01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:14.760]   on things, if we stop the ability of a Steve Jobs to take his team at Apple on creating
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:18.360]   something like an iPhone on Jeff Bezos on creating the Kindle, you're not, you're going
[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:21.840]   to fall that much further behind to other companies and I mean, other countries that
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:23.240]   are allowed to do those things.
[01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:27.960]   Well, the thing is if there was an option, it's too bad that those things aren't manufactured
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:29.200]   in the United States.
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:32.680]   That's the bigger one is like, it costs a lot more than I know, but if there was an option
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:36.520]   to pay an extra $10 from my iPad, didn't you do that manufactured in the US of A, I would
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:37.520]   do it in a heartbeat.
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:38.520]   Let's do that.
[01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:39.520]   Well, there's another problem.
[01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:40.520]   I agree with you 100%.
[01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:42.000]   We're talking about Paul Allen being on 60 minutes.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:45.560]   There was a story a couple of weeks ago that's talking about the business taxes in the United
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:49.840]   States and the reason that you've got all these fortune 500 companies, Facebook included,
[01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:56.960]   that are putting significant location, no significant presences in other countries,
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:01.040]   a specific couple of countries because they will not get taxed at the rate that the US
[01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:02.640]   corporations will get taxed.
[01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:05.480]   And so it makes sense for them to go over there because they can legally go to their
[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:06.480]   youth.
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.480]   Oh, you're talking about the Irish sandwich and the Google.
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:08.480]   Yeah.
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:09.480]   But I mean, Google paid.
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:12.880]   If Twit was making, you know, more than a couple billion dollars.
[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:15.800]   Well, I actually would like to announce the opening of our Irish brand.
[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:18.160]   So we're going to license all podcasts to them.
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:22.080]   But imagine if your revenue was a billion, you could save 100 million of it and just
[01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:24.440]   opening up a little office in Ireland somewhere.
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:25.440]   You do it.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:26.440]   It's more complicated.
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:29.200]   And everybody I know, but no one would blame you for doing it either.
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:31.120]   Well, I can't blame Google for doing it.
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:32.120]   I mean, it's legal.
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:36.480]   Well, think if you're a publicly traded company and you've got shareholders.
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:37.480]   You have to, don't you?
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:39.480]   The shareholders say you have to.
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:42.560]   So if you could pay, would it be 10 bucks though?
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:44.560]   It would be more like, that's what I would want to know.
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:46.240]   It'd be like a thousand bucks more.
[01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:47.240]   50.
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:48.240]   How much more would it be?
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:49.240]   I don't know.
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:50.240]   How much does the labor go into?
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:51.240]   I would like to know.
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:52.840]   What kind of, the problem is that we don't have the technology, right?
[01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:54.840]   We don't have the fabrication plans like they do out there.
[01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:56.840]   Like I don't think so.
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:58.800]   Is it strictly the labor?
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.640]   Toronto, Toronto is the same.
[01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:03.760]   I can only make production in China saves about 20%.
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:04.960]   I think that sounds about right.
[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:05.960]   So add 20%.
[01:34:05.960 --> 01:34:08.400]   I'd be willing to pay 20% more.
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:09.680]   You should just make two versions.
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:10.680]   Right.
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:11.680]   Absolutely.
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:12.680]   You said, here's the red, white and blue version.
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:16.880]   It's 20% more, but you're supporting American jobs in American industry.
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:17.880]   I would do that.
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:20.400]   I think a lot of people would actually.
[01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:24.080]   I think it'd be a good move for a lot of like it.
[01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:25.760]   Google's doing all right, by the way.
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:30.720]   Their quarterly earnings call was on Friday.
[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:32.560]   Your stock took a dump the other day.
[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:33.560]   You know why?
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:34.560]   I'll get this.
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:35.560]   This is the stock market's crazy.
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:41.480]   So Google made $8.58 billion in three months, almost $3 billion a month.
[01:34:41.480 --> 01:34:45.320]   Profit, $2.3 billion in three months.
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:48.360]   It was lower than the analysts expected.
[01:34:48.360 --> 01:34:51.040]   So it dumped the stock.
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:52.040]   I don't know.
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:59.360]   I think a company that's making $2.3 billion every three months seems like a good company.
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:00.360]   It's scary though.
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:02.440]   A lot of people.
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:03.440]   A lot of people.
[01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:04.440]   Google's.
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:05.440]   Are you scared by Google?
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:06.440]   I'm not.
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:09.480]   You're an internet king.
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:11.160]   You're savvy internet guy.
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:12.680]   You know how this stuff works.
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:17.120]   You had some gut feelings that you expressed about the CEO departing.
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:18.120]   Schmidt departing.
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:19.360]   The Schmidt thing was weird.
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:24.760]   It just felt weird to see like there was pictures of them like hugging the day after.
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:25.760]   And it's just like.
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:27.440]   You've been through a CEO transition.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:29.120]   This is no way this was a nickel.
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:31.160]   There's something going on behind the scenes here.
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:33.080]   And let me look what else happened.
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:34.960]   So Larry comes in last week.
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:37.800]   He names kind of a gang of six that are running Google.
[01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:39.240]   Mursa Myers, not on that list.
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:40.240]   I know.
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:42.200]   That was interesting.
[01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:47.400]   She supposedly got promoted to cover local.
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:49.400]   By Eric.
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:50.400]   Larry gets in there.
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:51.400]   She's got no.
[01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:54.120]   You know, she's still there, but she's not in the five in the top six.
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:55.120]   Hmm.
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:35:56.880]   Yeah, that's the picture.
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:59.160]   That was like the day after like the two guys.
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:02.560]   The two guys are just staying in the car and the like.
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:03.560]   And the same.
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:04.560]   By Eric's.
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:06.920]   Yeah, Eric's in the outside like let me in.
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:08.720]   Have a nice life.
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:10.880]   Lock the doors.
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:16.320]   I have to think that Larry decided he wanted to run the place, right?
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:17.320]   He said.
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:19.320]   And I think that as much as Eric.
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:20.320]   Well, and they've had a few misses.
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:24.240]   They've had a few, you know, they've done a few things like Google Wave and a few other
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:25.240]   products that have come up.
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:28.400]   You have looked at it and said, eh, this isn't the best.
[01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:29.400]   Yeah.
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:30.400]   They have cars that drive.
[01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:31.400]   It happens.
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:33.040]   That if they can get that car that drives itself.
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:34.040]   Give me that car that.
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:35.880]   They've said 10 more years.
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:37.240]   When that happens, that's a life change.
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:38.240]   They could do it now.
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:39.240]   What are you talking about?
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:40.240]   It works really well.
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:41.240]   It does.
[01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:44.200]   They have a million miles, I believe so far on their test vehicles.
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:45.200]   And no accidents.
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:46.200]   Not one.
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:48.160]   No, they had one accident where it got re-rendered.
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:49.160]   Wasn't there fault?
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:50.160]   Oh, yes.
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:51.160]   But that's awesome.
[01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:52.160]   There's a one accident.
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:53.160]   Yeah, we got re-rendered.
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:54.160]   Huh.
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:55.160]   Some idiot human in driving.
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:57.680]   So you figure in 20 years, they'll be pretty commonplace.
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:59.360]   10 years, they'll be the first to die.
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:00.600]   The problem is not technology.
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:03.160]   The problem is human.
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:05.520]   Humans do not want robots driving their car.
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:06.520]   I do.
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:07.520]   I do.
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:08.520]   I want to go in.
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:09.840]   I don't want windows anymore.
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:11.320]   I just want to climb inside of a vehicle.
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:14.280]   I just want to go like get in and have a good old time in there.
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:15.920]   You can take a nap.
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:18.160]   Yeah, take a nap and hang out with your girlfriend.
[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:19.160]   Take me to this house.
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:20.160]   Take the long run.
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:22.320]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:24.760]   You want to join the 30,000 mile club.
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:26.280]   Text away while you're doing it.
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:29.560]   I think I talked to an expert in this subject.
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:30.560]   He said, we're there.
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:31.560]   We could do it.
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:32.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:36.920]   When you get the roads in and different stuff, but it's mostly, it really is mostly human.
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:39.400]   You know, just hesitation.
[01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:40.400]   There's a traffic too.
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:41.400]   I'm not sure.
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:44.160]   The drunk, the drunk, the interesting vision.
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:47.160]   For instance, you don't need to ever own a car.
[01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:48.160]   I need to go home.
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:48.160]   B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:38:13.680]   I'm going to need a car to get home.
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:20.680]   I'm going to get home.
[01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:28.680]   I'm going to get home.
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:44.680]   I'm going to get home.
[01:38:44.680 --> 01:39:04.680]   I'm going to get home.
