[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.920]   But now they can see is it was the real thing David Prager also here good to be here
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.520]   I mean you're sporting the pocket protector. Let's go. I am sporting it looks a little weird on my shirt
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.840]   but you know I like that that's the twit pocket protector and
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.160]   Robert Herron welcome from PC magazine you do a lot of this now
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.160]   I see you all the time on digital life TV
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.280]   Our new studio finished up. I think it's this week of the walls will be I kind of like the half finished wall look
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.560]   Yeah, it's not bad. It's better than that playing gray wall. We were shooting away
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.720]   That was actually the back corner. Yeah, but I but I like it kind of half and it was kind of hip, you know
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.080]   Kind of that and my new lab is on this. Oh, that's great your HD lab more space and we have a special guest today with us
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.800]   And I'm really thrilled to have him. He's really in many ways the true father podcasting Doug K of IT conversations
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.960]   It's here Doug. It's great to have you. It was great to be here. You know, I live only a mile away and I heard there was free beer
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.960]   You walk
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.960]   I walk a mile for a free beer
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:08.880]   Doug started IT conversations when in 2001 it's actually two two thousand three three, but you've been podcasting podcasting since almost
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.000]   2003 when we we added that RSS feed in and the enclosure tag and there was no name for it at the time
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.920]   It's been two and a half years. Yeah, when you saw these Johnny come lately's like us. Did you kind of make it man?
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.720]   No, not at all. No, because every time you do something my traffic goes up
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.040]   We're all good for each other IT conversations now does 12 a week
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.320]   We're in 12 shows a week right now ramping up to about 14 because it's conference season and we do a lot of conference audio
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.200]   I like the conference audio because I don't have to go to the conferences
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.100]   I can listen to all the presentations on you know, I it's great a web 2.0. I listen to e-tech
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.400]   It's it web 2 when I was coming up you're gonna do another one web 2.0 is coming up and we got a our best show our most popular show from last
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.120]   I better not say best or all offend all the rest of the costumes
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.560]   But the most popular event we did last year was pop tech which is held in Camden, Maine and
[00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.960]   It's because here's here's the scoop for twit
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.840]   Tomorrow we're going to announce that we will have a live stream of the audio from pop tech this year
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.400]   Which is about four weeks from now and that'll be a free live stream. You can have an interesting business model
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.560]   Because what's a business? Yeah, don't ask me
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.200]   Your business model is the same as mine, but the idea eventually will be I mean these conferences
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.200]   You're kind of scooping them right because they want to sell tapes
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.880]   Well, what we do is
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.000]   In most conferences, we're basically metering out the content one show per week. So if you spread it out
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.240]   Yeah, there's a 25 presentation conference. It's gonna take six months before you get through that
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.920]   So we're not really competing with the conferences. We're actually enhancing that value because you might have 400 people at a conference
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.520]   But we're gonna hit 40 to 80 thousand right so we're really extending the reach of those so they don't mind that you
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.440]   Not at all everybody's renewed this year. It's really great
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.100]   I just I just love it and you know and unlike a twit because I have one volunteer
[00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.920]   Background at Witski you have a massive we have
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.240]   51 at the moment that's where do all the post-production work in their spare time
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.000]   That's really and we have a tip jar that feeds them
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.240]   So please donate to our tip jar the 100 as I say a hundred percent of your donation
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.040]   Goes to our volunteers who produce this content for you in their spare time. You got that memorized
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:23.400]   So I actually modeled a lot of what we do on what what Doug's been doing successfully all along and and it's a good model
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.560]   It works pretty well. Thank you. Let's get to our news stories of the week and I know that Kevin
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.840]   You you this I saw this on your blog and then it was dig dug. Yes
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.080]   Should should David set this up David probably should since he's one that told me about his origin
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.080]   It's his scoop. Yeah, it's his scoop. And is it is it true or what do we know?
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.880]   Okay, what we know well should I give a little bit background story?
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.880]   Yeah, you know Charles her shorn started the network G4 Charles her shorn and you know they purchased Hollywood Wunderboy
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.880]   he carried coffee for
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.120]   17 candles 70 what's your name 16 candles the redhead?
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.880]   What's her name? Molly ring wall. Yeah, Molly ring wall. That's his claim to fame, right? He got coffee from Molly ring
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.960]   Well, let's see how quick we make a long story short
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:13.240]   He convinced some people at Comcast to put in money because because of the fact that video games
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.920]   Pay generate a lot of money bigger than movies
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.720]   We'll let's make a television work out of it then they ended up buying tech TV and of course tech TV had all they had the opposite
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.960]   Idea with tech TV. Let's not make a television network out of yeah, so
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:32.640]   Let's see fast forward a little bit like tech TV bought tech TV killed a lot off a lot of the tech programming
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.840]   got rid of tech TV calm the way it was beforehand and
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.880]   Let's see let this this last Friday
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:46.160]   They were there was a meeting they called a last minute meeting today everyone come at 4 p.m
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.160]   Come to this meeting and they did a little PR thing and when I say PR thing
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.520]   Basically that means that he said I'm not gonna be in charge anymore
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.880]   I'm really excited to tell you we've been looking for someone we found someone from direct TV a guy named Neil something
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:05.160]   I actually didn't know anything Neil something that used to be with direct TV is gonna be running the show
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.320]   And he was excited to tell everyone about that and that he'd still be involved to some extent on the board or something like that
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.480]   But that was what officially went down on fired Friday think I don't know
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.480]   I mean, you know, there's ways of pushing people out or ink
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.760]   You know enticing people to step down you know
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.720]   He who knows if he got a golden parachute or not, but is it gonna spend more time with his family? Yeah, absolutely
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.560]   Yes, but you know, we're suing other interests. I'm Tim Buck - now basically everything I know is through
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.760]   You know, I used to work there so I know people that you know told me exactly what happened and so that meeting's for sure
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.320]   We know that that meeting's for sure that happened so I told Kevin
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.480]   Kevin
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:47.800]   Like this is going on dig story and then like what's interesting to see I think is that the immediate fallout is just the fact that
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.920]   Everyone thinks that it's such a positive thing and part of it is two full
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:56.840]   Well the diggers - because it did remember the diggers many of them are tech TV
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.640]   Yeah, well, I yeah, and I think it's it's several fold
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:05.040]   I mean the biggest thing is the main people that care the people that were upset of what happened right the original
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.560]   Which is a small group and smaller by the day
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.640]   But you know the fact that he was the one in charge of it
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.080]   They think that maybe you know, this is the beginning of a change to well
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.080]   He was the guy who put it together, right?
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:22.640]   So if he's gone, maybe games gear gadgets and gigabytes is history you think I don't know
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.760]   I mean I think that they might turn into a QVC like selling knives or something
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.640]   Well, that's what's gonna happen. That's exactly right
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:33.200]   I mean there a lot of the excitement is the fantasy that tech TV will reemerge. I mean I
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:38.320]   Guess I mean I'm only the like I was only the photoshop guy that shows up every once in a while
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:44.520]   And every time I speak in every public event I get at least four or five people who yeah come up to me and go
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.840]   Oh, I hate what they did to tech TV, but you know, it's it's it's this constant
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.840]   You know, I mean it's a dream of a lot of people I mean, you know
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:56.400]   I mean as much as I hate what they did tech TV and of course I lost my job because of it
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.960]   Although ironically, I'm the only guy here who has a show on G4 still so
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.560]   Weird thing right now
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.920]   I
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.600]   Don't I just don't see it happening. I don't see I think you're right
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.360]   I think much more likely the direct TV guy comes in and says oh, yeah
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:19.280]   Well, I mean clearly Comcast gave her short a year said turn it around
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.320]   Didn't turn it around right. I mean is that I don't know what I don't know exactly what the rate are
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.400]   I mean, there's were they successful were they making money?
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.600]   Do you think well the ratings went up a little bit?
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.800]   But they're not making money
[00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:35.720]   I just talked to a friend of mine that works there today and he was telling me that they all believe like the rumor
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.480]   Inside of G4 right now is that it's going to go the way of kind of like a spike TV. Yeah, well
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:45.280]   That's what they were doing. Right. But less gaming right so now. I think more yet
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:51.120]   I think that's actually much more likely. It's not a return to tech. It's going the other way even more, right?
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.520]   Which just means they'll be just another you know
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.480]   Channel, I don't think that I don't think it's gonna matter. I mean I think what what
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.160]   By tech TV non-existing anymore
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:06.880]   I think it's come I think it's really moved forward like the revolution to the fact that the people that were involved with that
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.080]   With that are doing stuff like what we're doing right now
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:14.040]   What Kevin's doing with system with dignity and and like there's so many other people exactly like like what you're doing
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:18.560]   I mean, you guys are starting to show. I mean, we're all working in Alex and I know Mac show
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:23.840]   Robert is doing with Patrick is doing live TV. Look at this. I mean this is it's in a way
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:30.960]   All the energy that the the audience put into bring back tech TV has really been come to fruition
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.560]   But not as a return to tech TV, but IP TV and especially for something like tech TV. There's no real reason
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.760]   I mean everybody I mean not everybody but most people who are on tech TV are gonna have a
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.640]   relatively high-speed connection they can download, you know the bit towards
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.360]   They don't need cable. They don't need cable and most of us would prefer not to have it
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.760]   Now, let's not give an argument to the direct TV guy for why you shouldn't go back to tech by the way
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.960]   I'd like to keep call for help on G4 for a little while. Okay, but you don't mind
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:03.800]   Do you think that cable companies? I mean television folks are just saying tech TV tech on TV failure?
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.440]   forget it
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.320]   Well, it all depends on I mean we know from working there that
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:17.800]   It's a very niche crowd, you know, it doesn't really hit the masses the way that you know traditional television does
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.220]   I love the niche though. What's wrong with nothing or at the niche and if you can bring the niche
[00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:26.340]   Advertisers to go along with that that pay the high dollar rates for that niche audience then you turn a profitable company
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.160]   Can you do that you think you can do that on I
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:28.840]   We're doing it right now
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:33.360]   We're starting to we have advertisers going in next month and some of our system episodes and things that we're doing
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.520]   That actually this we're releasing a new system on Monday that has an advertiser
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.960]   From Adobe that is gonna be really cool, but yeah, I think I think that the whole thing behind that is that you have a very small
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:51.440]   You really don't have a whole lot of people working for you, you know when you have a team of like five people working at system costs are low
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:56.380]   It's really easy to turn a profit. So that's that's the nice thing about doing it on your own
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.160]   I think that the dollars are gonna follow the passion
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:05.360]   You know if you get a network that that that goes after technology in a way that treats it like
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.840]   like everything else, you know like selling jewelry, it's not gonna be interesting and
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:15.600]   You know you've proven that you can do this kind of production and have it audio. What's the audience now?
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.800]   How many people are listening to we don't know it's a couple hundred thousand a lot a lot of people now
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:25.400]   That's not big big numbers by network television. It doesn't matter. It's enough. It's enough for us
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.960]   You know yeah, and it works and and you know as long as you've got
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:34.200]   The talent and you're disintermediating that distribution mechanism. I liked it that you know
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:41.120]   This is all you need right this works. Yeah, well and I think that I think that I mean I personally think the future is the niche
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:47.320]   You know I mean is that you know as you as we see more and more this as the cost of distribution becomes something that isn't that is free
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.160]   Or close to it. I mean relatively to what it was
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:56.760]   What you end up with is a whole slew of of these kind of programs and people start for every topic
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:01.560]   You can think exactly and people are interests and as long as we can find them and you know finding them will be the big thing
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.800]   But as long as we can find them as as consumers, you know, we're gonna get more of what we want
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.440]   We're gonna get the things people talking about what we really want
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.800]   They really want just want to show on Photoshop or we just want to one on our Mac
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:19.520]   So it's great for consumers because it's super niched if you can't afford to produce it and that's kind of the I mean
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:27.080]   Is there enough money in this in this highly focused programming? Well once you take out district once you take out the cost of distribution
[00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:32.200]   It's also you can have a whole lot of players that aren't looking for advertising. So it can it can also be you know
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:37.440]   And we talked about this previously, but it can also be people who want to promote something
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:42.220]   So, you know, if you know, you know, BMW could have a whole thing about how they design their cars or how to
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.800]   Very successful internet ad campaign has done very well
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.640]   You know and so you know, but if they made one just that was geeky about these German engineers going now's the viewer going
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:53.600]   So look at these, you know, it would be if you one of those things that they do very well for them
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.240]   I think it would reach out right to that core BMW drive
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:03.840]   People that want to know how how a certain automobile is made if they could do a special about exactly how they make their cars and people
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:08.480]   We watch it. It's really liberation. It's liberation from the notion of you have to produce
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.240]   Programming that has such a mass audience because it's so expensive
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.680]   It liberates you and you say well you don't have to have such a big audience
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:20.200]   You can do a lot more stuff well and also as these shows begin to diffuse the market
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.840]   That's the thing that that really causes problems for the advertisers because if as if you know
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.080]   It's fine if this one only has 200,000
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:35.040]   But if a thousand shows each are getting 200,000 viewers that choose up the entire TV market and then and then the and if that's scary
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.600]   For TV then the advertisers have a hard time figuring out where to advertise so they start producing their own shows
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.200]   So it becomes the vicious cycle where they use that system because they can't find another way
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:49.280]   You know that because the system that they had isn't working anymore and and it further taught, you know
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.800]   Tares the system we're seeing that we're right in the middle of that
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.960]   Yeah, I feel like we're right back in the heyday of the internet bubble
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.800]   I mean and just look at eBay buying Skype for
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.480]   2.6 billion dollars with a
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:07.760]   Guarantee of another one and a half billion if if things go well in a couple of years
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:11.160]   I think it's a bargain what yeah, I want it why wow yeah
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:16.240]   Dike says 2.6 billion is a deal there there there pay they're paying the money
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.640]   I think for the user base because the technology obviously
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:27.400]   Skype's revenues were 60 million dollars for 2005 critical mass how are you guys is a verb come on
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:34.120]   How would you like your product to be a verb? I'm gonna Skype you I mean that's so what does eBay do with it to justify?
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:43.140]   Hopefully hopefully not screw it up a free product only made 60 million dollars last year worth
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:50.780]   2.6 billion dollars, but but aren't they the name here they are but they're not necessarily the best
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:57.560]   Yeah, doesn't matter you know, but do you really I mean my parents don't know what Skype is they've never used it before
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:02.120]   I mean we as geeks we love sky buy you skype. Yeah, but when mom and dad come to you and say
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:07.160]   What should I use you're gonna say you would say I'll say Vonage
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.320]   You just say let's say what's that yeah, you just got Vonage didn't you yeah?
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.640]   How do you like it? It's great as long as Keith isn't playing Star Wars galaxy at the same time my house
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:24.840]   Because otherwise it just all starts to corrupt on it does it's it's not bad it works great
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:29.060]   It's unbelievable. I was talking to my dad about it and talking into actually setting up at his home
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.960]   But he should use
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.720]   Sky might then be coming here though to eBay for that very reason it's like well
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:39.840]   Okay, it's gonna fall under that and grow a company base says eBay says what they're gonna do is a call center you're gonna have a button
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:45.720]   Or buyers and sellers can talk to each other anonymously where you just want to do it over the phone rather than you can actually
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:50.880]   Move your mic in a little bit so we can hear you can hear the person's voice that you're actually gonna buy something from
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:54.920]   In in that case, you know, I mean I understand why eBay would want the service
[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.600]   I just don't understand why they wouldn't spend their own money to build it right?
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:03.120]   I mean that's why I think it's the obviously they're buying the users the 54 million Skype subscribers and
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.720]   Someone here in an article I'm to a math and said that that's
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.800]   $50 almost $50 a subscriber. That's a lot of money
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:18.440]   You met the very important they could have built their own Google didn't build their own they went to global IP and licensed
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.120]   Technology that I think it sounds better than Skype
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:26.820]   Well the idea that they would use it for their existing base of buyers and sellers makes no sense at all
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:30.840]   That they gain nothing by that economics don't fly. Okay, so it's like they could have yeah
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:36.620]   It's and it's not the current user base about a brand name. It's a future version the future user base
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:41.360]   I think that they're paying for I think it's the broadcast comma and I really think that that's exactly what I mean
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.820]   When I say we're back in the bubble guys, there's a lot of
[00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:48.360]   Fantasy thinking going on and you're seeing it with all these new dot-com startups
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.440]   This looks like 2000 all over again
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:54.640]   I mean to me it just looks like there were a whole bunch of people looking at Skype and eBay had an idea that
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.240]   That's what they want to do and they just needed to jump on it and and quick get it
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:01.340]   And I think they were in a rush and I just think it's a taboo nuggle
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:03.920]   Amazing what you could do with a lot of cash
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.920]   speaking of which Microsoft a o l
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:13.520]   Will Microsoft they say they're gonna I mean there's different stories. This was broken by newsday. I think it was news day in New York City
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:20.600]   One story says they take a stake in a o l so they kind of merge a o l m s and another says they buy them out, right?
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.100]   then
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:27.420]   Another story says Google and yahoo are next in line bidding for a o l is a o l on the block?
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:32.340]   I've heard that that time Warner is is looking at getting rid of I mean
[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:37.980]   Wouldn't you know if you were time long enough to to split those back out practically put time Warner out of business that a o l purchase
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:43.620]   How to know a o l seems like a bad buy to me. I mean 15 million subscribers though
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:48.180]   I mean look what how many what did you say that this guy Skype has 54 million but they're not paying 50
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:53.500]   They're not paying 30 bucks a month skype makes money when you decide that you want to place calls to
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:58.100]   Regular phones, right? That's and that made 60 million dollars
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:02.180]   Well, I think that but a o l I think has if I'm correct like 30% more
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.620]   users for the
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:12.100]   For the chat stuff then msn so it would be equal amn San was a is a flop right so Microsoft says look at Google
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.100]   Yahoo, they're about to eat our lunch of portals
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.740]   What can we do?
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:22.620]   Take a stake in a o l. They're basically saying forget amn San a o l be the new s m s n right?
[00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:29.120]   So you're thinking just like they're they're going to change there. I mean every obviously if they buy a well every single
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:33.580]   A well homepage is now going to be the MSN right you combine a well and MSN you're the number one side of the net
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:36.760]   I don't know it just seems to dial up users. Yeah
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:40.380]   And for forcing people to go to a site
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:45.020]   You know it's like the thing with Google and these other you know is that Google you have to make a decision on your own
[00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:50.740]   To launch and actually set that as your home page and go to that side and when you're going with MSN and I don't know
[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.740]   I just it doesn't seem right to me
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:59.660]   A well doesn't seem like a goodbye. It's just two vanilla's a well and MSN would be the number one web site
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:05.780]   Beating in unique in terms of uniques and page views beating everybody including yahoo
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.620]   And that's probably because it's a default page for people who don't well
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:12.860]   I think that's why you get MSN right yeah, cuz if this what comes up when you open it and explore and you know
[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:16.820]   So it makes I mean I don't think it's a bad deal for MSN. Oh
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:22.500]   If they can unload it come on. It's great for time Warner if they get that thing off their monkey off their back
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.020]   But wait a minute didn't AOL buy time Warner. So it's kind of
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:33.140]   It did but it turning it around according to one of these articles that you referenced a time Warner pulled in
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:41.220]   42 billion in revenue last year and 8.7 of it was from AOL so time Warner is obviously the big one now
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.100]   Yeah, I just know I'll never forget that ugly hug
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:49.700]   Between Gerald Levin and Steve case remember that at the main as the partnership
[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:54.420]   I get chills still thinking about it. What else you get what you got the stories in front of you David?
[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.980]   What else is hot?
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.900]   Well, let's see here
[00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:01.540]   Well, I mean part of the in part of the reason this whole thing went down between
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:07.260]   It might be going down between AOL and the others is because of the competition from the likes of Yahoo and Google and
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.300]   You put ahead
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:13.300]   Google is always launching new services one of their new ones. Here's their blog search and
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:18.660]   I don't know. I think it's kind of it. It doesn't work quite so
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.300]   Yeah, you know what when we were talking about that Charles Hershorne thing
[00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.940]   So I thought I'd go to the Google blog service and see what's your blog about it
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:29.100]   But I couldn't find it even though people had but it's not up today
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.540]   But what I do think is neat about it is the fact that you can create
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:40.260]   RSS feeds of searches so if the service actually does do pretty real-time like Google News
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:47.300]   You could theoretically I guess like Google alerts you could look for when people are blogging about specific things
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.900]   Google's kind of late to the table. They just just put RSS in Google News
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:56.140]   It's like they're discovering RSS. Yeah, that's the real value though of something like this is I
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:02.460]   Mean that would be cool if you could just subscribe to a RSS feed and then have a certain term that you're looking for and have that
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:07.500]   Content automatically updated, but this is I mean Technorati is doing a better job at this than Google is and
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:11.820]   I was when I was reading a post by Dave Weiner on this and he was just like
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:17.740]   Why do I want to go to a separate Google site like make it all inclusive and like one single unified Google tool?
[00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:21.420]   Why should I have to go to a separate blog search and it I agree?
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:27.180]   I mean well that may be what this is all about because one of the things that people have always complained about is blogs polluted Google right?
[00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:33.140]   Would it be nice if if Google now what I think what Google this is what I think Google really just wants to get rid of blogs out of the search
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.920]   Because blogs do polluted look what's happened, you know, you search for failure the number one
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:42.220]   School result on failure is the is White House dot gov. That's because
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.300]   No, it's Google bombing
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.660]   It's because blogs all got together and they all linked to you know
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:51.180]   Bush's White House under the word failure and that's
[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:58.020]   Cry drives Google crazy that pollutes Google. So do you think Google's making some money off of blogs when it comes to advertise?
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:22:59.460]   Well, they own blogger.com
[00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.260]   I mean clearly they thought that that was a good place to be but I think they get yes
[00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.660]   But they get two benefits and this is why you won't see a single search
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:10.580]   That the day with Dave Weiner wants yeah sure Dave Weiner wants that because he wants to promote blogging
[00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.100]   But from the point of view to Google this stuff pollutes Google
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:18.260]   Let's move it off into a separate server. It has and then we can and then Google can say oh, yeah
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:23.340]   We're not gonna index blogs anymore. They've got their own search over there. They ghettoized blogs
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:27.460]   It's actually bad for blogging. Do you think that this is the right way that they're going about it because right now
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:33.380]   They're well, they're crawling the RSS feeds though versus like I kind of like how technorati goes about it where they have the
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:36.300]   Ping and yeah, the tags are also really cool
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:40.180]   But it's it seems to me like like David was saying if the content's behind
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.740]   I mean blogs is all about being able to search his content in real time and find the results
[00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:44.940]   Well, I have to fix that. I mean
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:48.660]   I should pull the content and blog contents make it separate from the rest of the search engine
[00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:55.260]   It's so many people with their own blog sites are just reposting information that other bloggers have posted that it just becomes
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.620]   99% of blogs are wasted time
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:01.580]   Don't you think blogs are I mean that come on blogs are wasting I see that on dig occasionally to where it's like
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:05.380]   I want to read who originally wrote this story and no, but it's gonna go to somebody click click
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.420]   Oh, I know that's why we direct me again
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:13.260]   We get stories every single day that are reported because they're just simply people repurposing other content and cutting and pasting it
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:16.500]   And that's what we have to I just read this let me post it on my blog
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.900]   Yeah, sometimes you have to click three or four times to find the original source story
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.740]   Which is what you really want to read well, it's funny
[00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:27.260]   I mean you see that all over the place everywhere from like gizmodos doing gadgets like all over the place are the repurposing news
[00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:32.080]   It's the self-referential internet. It's just it. There's really only seven people the echo
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:37.380]   That's what happened. I mean bloggers really thought they were and I suppose it's true podcasting
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:43.880]   We're really important because they were all stroking each other and it was just this small group of people going
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.820]   Yeah, isn't it's great isn't this great in a way that you see in that with podcasting - I think you know
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:51.900]   We'll see that a podcast Expo. Yeah, but you may be the first podcast that has three cameras
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:58.980]   Three camera podcast is that wild or what? Yeah, I don't know what this is gonna and met amorphos into
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:03.860]   I think some of the demand for video was people thought we would do the screen savers again. I get my mother to look I think
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.540]   Mom look he's center stage
[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:13.660]   Any other stories you've got there we can actually ask the audience for there do you think that this 17 year old who?
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:20.620]   The whole Paris Hilton thing but I actually think he they're throwing him in jail for 11 months
[00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:24.780]   But what I think is ten times worse is the fact that two years after that whole period
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:27.300]   He's not supposed to be able to use a net connected device
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:31.780]   Can you imagine every frickin device that you're gonna touch from now?
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:36.900]   Until two years from now he gets developed is gonna be a net connected device. This guy's gonna be a pariah
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:40.220]   He's not gonna be able to date. He's like no help home
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:46.180]   He's 20 years old. I'm sorry and now I need the internet by the time he gets out. He's not gonna be able to use an iPod
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.180]   Oh, yeah, because it's good
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:54.980]   Social engineering skills. Yeah, that is that is a harsh punishment. Yeah, but they really keep tabs on that stuff
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:59.340]   I mean did Kevin Mitnick really not go online at late at night when he's kind of
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:05.100]   We had Mitnick on the screen savers his supposedly his first day right on the internet
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:09.220]   I never bought it that he'd never been on the internet, but you have to say that well, I mean
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:13.900]   Well, I'm not gonna. Yeah, I'm not gonna. Yeah, I don't want him to go back to jail
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.180]   I'm gonna accuse him of anything, but but really come on. Yeah
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:22.380]   Now maybe we could is there a statute of limitations? Maybe what that's what we should have a small have a special twit
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:28.040]   Kevin Mitnick's statue of limitations expires and we can ask him so you're on the net weren't you come on?
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:34.820]   Well, I wasn't he I gave him this this tells you how long ago it was was he gave him a power book really nice
[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:39.460]   We were all excited giga giga Hertz power. Oh giga Hertz power book. That was the fastest thing out there
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.820]   Remember he was selling his old
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:46.500]   Laptops on eBay the ones that he got caught with oh was he the answer wait he gave you something. What do you have?
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.500]   I have wallet that he got caught with
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:53.300]   They gave you his wallet. Yeah, he gave me nothing
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:57.320]   He gave you his wallet really yeah, I got it signed in early
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:02.780]   Yeah, pick the pocket
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:07.300]   Are you should invite Kevin Mitnick to be on well, I will yeah, I'd love to he's he's still dating
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:13.100]   Darcy in Kevin. I don't know I haven't talked to Darcy in so long. She's listening right now. You want to say anything to her?
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:15.100]   I
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:22.460]   Email it to she was a character see is Darcy worked on the screen savers. She was quite a character with a little bunny years
[00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:27.220]   She used to wear bunny years. You know that asteroids machine. That's right. She owned that was really nice of her

[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:51.300]   Take it back with me, but you can check it out. You should put it in plastic or something
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:57.100]   It is it's in a FBI envelope. Oh, even better. Yeah, I label across. Oh, you got some fish on that and put it on the wall
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.540]   Yeah, it's in a closet. Hey, hey, babe
[00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:06.420]   If you need money if you ever need money for system thing doesn't work. Hey, tell us about the episode that's coming out on Monday
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:11.820]   Yes, we have a brand new episode coming out. It's going to be all about how to podcast and
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:15.060]   You're in it Leo. I heard that. Yes. We actually
[00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:20.820]   We start with the basic hardware and then we show an advanced setup, which is of course your
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:25.740]   Your setup. It's more advanced now. Look at this. I know it's gotten pretty crazy and crazy
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.740]   But yeah, so if you ever wanted to create your own podcast
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:33.660]   It's pretty much anything and everything you'll need to know to be able to post it online and create it from the hardware that you need to buy to
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.900]   compressing and uploading and
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:40.140]   So yeah, so really we should have interviewed Doug for the for this that pioneer
[00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:47.580]   What do you think of podcasting Doug? You think it's going places? You think this is a flash the pants and other I never really know what it's already
[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:53.180]   Gone past that I think it's already established. Yeah, I think so. I mean who knows what it actually becomes total
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:56.660]   What are your total downloads look like for all of the well?
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.780]   We did 11 terabytes of audio in July
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:05.340]   So I've been a lot. I'm not sure what the numbers work out to be I didn't bring this. I think we're we're around that
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:10.340]   We did 27 terabytes. Well, we do it with more shows on fewer listens, right?
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:13.500]   Right, but yeah, it gets up there. I think
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:20.340]   You know, I mean the most telling sign about podcasting is probably the recent investments in Adam Curry's company
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:25.700]   Podshow where you've got Kleiner Perkins. Yeah, and who's the other one was it? Sequoia?
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:31.460]   Sequoia, yeah, give the big one that it yeah, I mean they invested 8.55 million
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:35.180]   Dollars doesn't matter the real key here is that
[00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:42.620]   John door and Ray Lane are personally on their board of directors Wow and those guys, you know, they don't give up their time easily
[00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:46.500]   So I think the key is that this is and this is not podcasting
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:51.860]   I don't think they call it podcasting, but I think there's something much much bigger of foot. What is pod show?
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:54.180]   What is it? What is he trying to do pod show is I?
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:56.340]   would say it's a
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:58.340]   company that's trying to
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:02.620]   Up front is trying to take advantage of every opportunity in podcasting which is
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:08.820]   advertising content distribution all the pieces of it, but I think in fact that
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:15.780]   That's something much bigger going on and I look at it this way. I say well, what's the next NBC?
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:22.540]   You know, what's gonna be the NBC that incorporates the buying habits and the lot of the watching and listening habits
[00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:25.060]   That's what he wants today. Yeah, I think so
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:32.140]   I mean, I think you know if you look at iTunes and imagine where that's going if you look at what's happening in the in the music industry today
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.740]   The distribution is changing dramatically
[00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:37.260]   recognizing that that in
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:41.940]   Film and television and to some extent radio distribution is gonna change also
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:43.260]   I think it's gonna be quite different
[00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:48.660]   I had to say that that's one of the things that kind of bugs me about pod show is it looks like it's an attempt to build a big
[00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:50.660]   business out of
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:56.660]   What is I like which is grassroots? There's room for all of us. Yeah, you know, I'm doing it nonprofit
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:32:00.460]   Yeah, I'm going really the other extreme. I'm doing nonprofit, but not on purpose
[00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.220]   I
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:06.780]   You know, I think from our perspective, you know if we can get everybody able to listen
[00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:13.660]   On a much larger scale that's gonna be good for all of us right? So I think it's a I mean fascinated to watch it
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:18.100]   You'd like to do that Kevin with revision three. You'd like to build a network, right? Yeah, I mean, it's it's
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.980]   I really like the fact that we're putting together
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:25.220]   I mean Martin Sargent just agreed to do are you kidding a podcast with us? Oh, that's great
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.420]   So he's gonna be putting out a podcast here. What's it gonna do?
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:28.140]   I
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:35.300]   I think it's kind of a hybrid of what unscrewed was and changed the video or audio. It's gonna be it's gonna be audio
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:39.940]   Initially, it's called infected is it's gonna be great. So it's just another
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:45.180]   It's pretty much gonna be the the pod the podcast very podcast a podcast
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:51.140]   But you know you probably can get a little bit of a hint of what kind of stuff it'll be just by visiting his website
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:55.660]   Yeah, I think what is the URL? I think it's what is it Sarge world?
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:59.420]   Yeah, Sarge world there was a fake one, but this is the real one
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:05.020]   That's the real one and really it's it's Martin Sargent the character. Yeah, definitely
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.820]   Well, I always thought Marty could do a great podcast
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:14.260]   In fact, I wanted to get him on here, but he's in LA so yeah Marty if you're listening come up be part of the show
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.260]   Is he gonna be doing it down there? He'll be doing it down there
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.380]   him
[00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:23.540]   Joey Joey Joey Joey Joey intern. That's a that's an unholy alliance
[00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:27.980]   He's a Joey is extremely capable and so he's gonna be the technical
[00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:33.220]   Technical driving force of getting this thing because what they're gonna do is they're gonna record that give it to us
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:38.840]   He's gonna do the smarts really to add it to do anything like that. I mean, I don't know is he I mean
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.140]   Joey also built Sarge world calm. So yeah, well, that's the thing
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.740]   I mean everybody like Martin needs somebody like Joey to kind of
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:48.300]   prop them up. Yeah, yeah, I
[00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:52.580]   Don't mean that in a negative way. I just mean that Martin wants to focus on the artistic and
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:55.660]   Joey somebody needs somebody to put a microphone in front of him
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:58.900]   Okay, not saying a thing
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:03.140]   One of the things that you posted also was the you know
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:07.420]   Microsoft putting out, you know more. Oh, yeah head to head with Adobe
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:08.740]   I think this is actually very interesting
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:12.540]   I'd like to hear what you think of this Alex Microsoft does want to eat Adobe's lunch
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.740]   They want to get in that Photoshop space. They have this new well
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:18.820]   I think they want to get into the element. I think they want to get into the elements below in I don't think that there people have
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:21.540]   Been saying they've been writing in Adobe Photoshop killer for a while though. Yeah
[00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:25.860]   Well, I think that the problem is is that I mean the people who are really paying for Photoshop
[00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:29.220]   I mean there's a lot of who who aren't paying for Photoshop, but for the people who are paying for Photoshop
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:35.300]   You know the designers the you know all those other things they're not I don't think they're gonna be using a mic
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.900]   You know buying a Microsoft product anytime soon, you know away from what they're doing
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:43.940]   I think that the real market there what what Adobe has left open for a long time is this
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:48.980]   They have elements which is very crippled compared to you know the full Photoshop, right?
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:54.740]   And then they have no space in between I mean there's you know, there's a six hundred and fifty dollar Photoshop middle where the middle
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:35:00.220]   Exactly, there's rumors that the next version of Photoshop will split so you'll have a photo like the base
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:03.140]   You have Photoshop that is less expensive that has some of like
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:05.620]   There's a version or a yeah
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:09.700]   I mean there's there's some things that are in in Photoshop that are pretty esoteric
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:15.700]   I mean guys like me use it but a lot of people like HDR how many most people who use Photoshop don't even know what HDR's are and
[00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:19.220]   There's a feature in there that'll build your own HDR's from a series of photos
[00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:23.380]   I don't know what HDR kind of dynamic range it takes a whole bunch of exposures and sticks them all in
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:25.300]   So you're saying Microsoft can't get into that space?
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.900]   No, I'm saying that Microsoft is gonna
[00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:33.060]   I think they're gonna put more pressure on Adobe to put more features into either Photoshop elements or bring a version of Photoshop into the two or three
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.060]   Hundred dollar range that people can really afford
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:41.300]   There's so much standardization Photoshop is so mature and so much, you know owns so much of the market
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:44.780]   I mean it's basically the Microsoft of image editing in a lot of ways
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:47.300]   I think the problem with Microsoft is they're gonna do what they you know
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.860]   They're gonna do what they always do which is they're gonna build a lukewarm
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:53.780]   It's the new kind of half done version of something that is already pretty good
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:59.900]   What I what is good is that somebody's gonna get push Adobe a little bit because Adobe is you know the development
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.180]   They have to keep it stable so it's it's a very slow development
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:06.180]   But it would be really nice to get them pushed to a little competition wouldn't hurt
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.220]   It would be really great to have to get cheaper versions of Photoshop
[00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:12.820]   Right, you know which I think is I think that Adobe couldn't get make a lot more money
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:17.060]   If they had a version of Photoshop that was $2.99 or what do you know?
[00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:20.580]   What do you think of the whole open source GIMP project?
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.500]   GIMP is I think it's really cool
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:27.540]   I know that there's some production companies that use it because for a long time it had features that Photoshop didn't have
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:32.140]   You know some of those 16 bit editing and high, you know and some really specific things
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:36.060]   But the problem that it really needs what it really needs is an over an overhaul
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:40.860]   You know of the interface of the of the user experience speaking of which my buddy Scott Michelle
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:45.700]   It just created a version of GIMP called GIMP Shop. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's wild that GIMP shop's been out for a while
[00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:48.940]   But it's getting a lot of attention now. He's a producer at AOTS
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:53.140]   Yeah, he's my old roommate back in in LA. Now. He said he's not a programmer
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:55.780]   But how did he do this? Well, basically, I mean, there's just a bunch of
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:59.400]   Files that you can edit before you read the resources. So he's just editing the research
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:04.000]   Yeah, he's just rearranging the menus renaming a lot of the menu things to be you know all Photoshop menus
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.640]   So if you go into GIMP shop launch it looks just like Photoshop just like Photoshop all the menu options are exactly the same
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.380]   I was thrilled that he did that cross-platform. Yeah, it's
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:18.800]   He made it for us 10 and it was popular enough that other people made it so a version that would work in Linux a version that
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:23.000]   Would work in Windows, but didn't yeah the GIMP you know purists getting mad at it. Oh, yeah, they were pissed
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.160]   It was so funny because when he originally he's like, oh, I need some help
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:30.440]   And I was I was watching through this entire process and he he posted to some of the the GIMP
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:35.520]   Like official websites and asking they're like don't even go there. We're not gonna help you so he had to do it all on his own
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:39.680]   Well, he did it and that's what's held but I would argue that's what's held GIMP back for so long
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:44.200]   Are the people who create it, you know, and this is always you know the revolutionaries who created it, you know
[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.440]   Didn't want it. They don't want to be just another Photoshop
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.520]   But that's what they need to be you know
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.120]   It like when I was working it when I was working at Lucasfilm
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:53.520]   We had this meeting with at the time Metacrations who had painter and they were
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:58.480]   And they asked they were like how can you how can we get you to use painter instead of Photoshop?
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:00.480]   And we were like we'll make it look more like Photoshop
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:05.720]   I know all the menus. I don't want to I don't want to learn something he didn't add any functionality
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:08.080]   He's not a programmer all he did is make the menu
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:11.400]   He was just interviewed by some of the guys that do the
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.520]   open source
[00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:15.520]   O'Reilly's open source
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:20.800]   publication and there the beginning of that article said that he's he's straddling the line between
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:26.040]   Upsetting the people at Adobe and upsetting all the all the developers of the original developers
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.640]   He made a lot of end users happy
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:31.240]   I think it was a great thing a great idea to do and what I really like is he's not a programmer
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.880]   He just said you know, it's easy. He'll just change the menus a little bit
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:37.480]   Yeah, I think for people who want to play with photos. I think it's a really great option
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:42.920]   I think for pros the prop what a Photoshop brings is this incredible stability, you know, interactive
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:48.440]   You know there for the pros and I mean but for people getting into it $650 is a lot of money to buy for our image
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:52.080]   I did the pros have the money. Yeah, they can afford to work. Well, we're said if that's what you do
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.080]   It's well
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:59.560]   And once again, hopefully this pushes Adobe to give us more more features in elements or a more affordable version
[00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.840]   I don't think it has to be 50 bucks
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.960]   I think it can be a hundred ninety nine bucks or two hundred forty nine bucks
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:07.960]   But they need a version that's much closer to the ground than one ninety nine. That sounds nice
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:12.360]   One ninety nine would be first something rice point if it didn't do everything right fine
[00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:17.400]   I mean if it didn't do 16 bit like most people don't don't even know why they would use 16 bit pros all know why
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:21.320]   They use 16 bit or 32 bit to to not have you know
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.200]   Maybe not even have access to CMYK space
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:27.360]   I mean, you know that kind of thing for the 199 version that starts to make a lot more sense
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:32.400]   Well, I thought that was kind of the idea of elements was it was pretty close to that it was and then of course the problem term from
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:37.960]   Like he is that they take out stuff like I mean they take out things that are they cripple things that that I don't think are are
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.560]   appropriate like they
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:45.800]   You know, they take out channels, you know, which just takes out that's 99% of the function
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:50.080]   I mean for like little retouching and everything else it is what it is
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:54.880]   But for big stuff it becomes a real issue when you you can't do anything really cool
[00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.480]   If you can't get ahold of the channels so Tivo
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:05.520]   Is I think we want Robert to talk about this so in gadget publish the picture and it's pretty clear that in the seven version seven of Tivo
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:10.920]   Which is a beta actually well a broadcaster is going to be allowed to set a flag
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:17.880]   They call it the red flag that deletes the show it says you can only keep the show for X number of days and then
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:22.120]   We're gonna erase it from your hard drive. There are three modes. It's macro vision
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.080]   That's all it is
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:28.560]   They've added macro vision support fully and two reasons Tivo did that was one so that they could offer
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:33.840]   The ability to burn stuff to a DVD and still retain some kind of copy protection on that
[00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:38.360]   That's really the number one so when you burn it to a DVD from the Tivo it will put macro vision on there
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:43.360]   So you actually have the immediate access key that you know that is that Tivo to go or is it something separate?
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:48.280]   No, that is it is Tivo to go it is the function that allows you to drag that content into your PC
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.120]   Right use a special burning out with the key
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:56.120]   Why do you what was the story with his screen because I'm looking at engage and it says you know
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.920]   Thanks for recording this program. You have seven days to watch up to this point
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.760]   They've said it's only going to apply to premium content like pay per view events
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:08.880]   This is like a PBS show but it was revealed that they can actually any broadcast the broadcast could flip it any broadcast
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:13.040]   Or good and that's where I really think this probably happened was that they probably have so much equipment sitting around this
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:19.240]   It was probably defaulted to say you know what enable macro vision nobody else is using it who cares and then also
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:23.120]   But the macro vision I thought was just copy protection this actually deletes the file
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:27.120]   There's just they can flag it to say you can never copy it or for the next seven days
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:31.120]   It can be unlimited you can do whatever you want with it for the next oh so this was that you can't copy it
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.920]   Not that you not that it will delete it
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:37.780]   It the copying part also relates to that you can have networked Tivo's and you can actually set content for one
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:43.680]   Tivo to another and then doing that and then being able to re burn it off say with some of the set top DVD recorder
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:47.920]   But they had it's just a way for them to limit it and it's standard
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:52.160]   I don't imagine very many broadcasters are going to enable that just to keep it easy
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:57.120]   You know real audio has something similar you just flip this bit and people can't record it and everybody flips it
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:42:00.960]   If every broadcaster does start using this why is Tivo doing this though?
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.220]   It seems like such a stupid
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:05.920]   They're going to shoot themselves in the foot because nobody wants a machine that restricts hella
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:08.640]   I don't want to suddenly all this create a big hack community
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:11.320]   I stayed away from my Tivo for ten days and suddenly half of my content
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:14.040]   You know can keep it for only a week is gone. Yeah
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:17.600]   Well and it's gonna until I say delete no longer work
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.200]   What's the point of having a Tivo if you deletes itself?
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.360]   Well, it's great business for the the PC DVRs
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:26.200]   I mean we haven't we have both the digital and the analog
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:30.880]   Elgato for the Mac that we we have at the office and and those things there's nothing
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:34.000]   I mean, you know it you know we can get digital broadcasts
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.920]   You know or we can get the analog stuff off the cable and it's not maybe quite as refined as Tivo
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:42.920]   But it records to MPEG to straight to the drive as it's capturing
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:47.080]   You know I can schedule it I can do all those things and I don't have to deal with you know
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.320]   I always look at it like I don't have to deal with any of the Tivo stuff
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:53.640]   You know what about the recorders that you get from the cable companies and the satellite companies that are not Tivo
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.640]   Do they have that same?
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.080]   feature they could very well enable it as well and
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:02.400]   I imagine from their end they have they have more incentive to do it than Tivo does
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:08.200]   I would think so. Yeah, why is Tivo doing this like willingly like why I think there's a lot of pressure on Tivo
[00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:13.720]   Don't you I mean legal pressure is they just turn they just have their first I mean they're in the world of hurt right now
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:15.520]   Well, they're looking at replay
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:21.440]   They're saying there we do not want to go. Yeah, and I'm sure that there's a who knows what's going on behind the scenes
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:27.080]   But I mean for instance as soon as people started hacking the Tivo enough so they could extract video from it
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:30.720]   They started scrambling the video so that you couldn't do it all along. They've been doing this
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:33.160]   You think Tivo's dead?
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:37.000]   Yeah, you're from now. Yeah, I don't know about a year from now, but I think it's a shame
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:44.160]   The broadcasters start enabling this flag on all the and they're gonna standard. It's a shame because yeah, I really
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:49.840]   Yeah, absolutely if they can they'll flip it which means you can't go on a vacation longer than seven days that will kill Tivo
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.320]   Yeah, I think I think they did
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:56.640]   I mean here's a great product to go world's greatest word of mouth
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:59.280]   What happened?
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:06.880]   Well, what happened is that you have all sudden, you know, HD content and digital content and there was no clean way to interface
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:10.880]   You had to do that stupid little serial cable that stupid IR switcher
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:18.920]   Everybody wants one single unified box and when Comcast started launching their their HD boxes with the DVR built in and they had all these
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:23.720]   Cable providers that are launching DVRs. I mean as ten bucks a month. Yeah, it's cool
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:29.560]   How Tivo can kind of suggest things for you, but not that cool to where you'd want to go through all the pains of having that conversion
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:32.440]   Tivo is the season pass that's something very few other software
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:36.920]   Tivo does it better than anyone else everybody hates their cable company PVR
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:41.320]   But they still do it because it's all in and I mean we'll think about right now
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:44.120]   I want to record an HD show on my Tivo
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:48.760]   I can't do it unless I have that HD one from direct TV and that sucks
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:49.200]   I don't know
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.640]   I mean they've been promising one with a cable card slot and you know obviously cable cards
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:55.360]   We're not seeing them quite yet when it when a cable car is coming out Robert
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:45:02.160]   So you can buy one from you can get one from Comcast right now. Yes, really so that they're making that mandatory market
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:05.680]   No, it's a TV's will that be mandatory? I don't know. What's the cable?
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:11.160]   It's it gets rid of the box all together I slot on the back of your TV and it'll instead of having a separate set top
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.400]   I'm your cable tuner
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:17.280]   But that's cool because then you can have a HD Tivo and then just plug in that cable card right in the back
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.600]   And then you don't have to have that extra box in theory, right?
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.480]   Yeah, it just eliminates that hardware
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:26.480]   But the problem is right now the current devices are only one way where so you couldn't see information
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:29.480]   But you couldn't do like a pay-per-view event and yes, I want to see that
[00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:34.680]   Second generation will but that's not out. Yeah, it's just a bad time to
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:39.840]   requires the TV to also have an integrated electronic programming guy because that wouldn't be part right
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:42.280]   There's some issues to it
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:49.240]   But a lot of people like it simply because the visual quality is better than an external box having that tuner actually stuck into the TV with that kind of
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.320]   direction
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.640]   Just makes the picture quality itself better, but
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:58.440]   It's really not until direct TVs launched in their MPEG-4 stuff now and so is dish network
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:04.640]   They're actually starting the transition as well when that's really good when that really gets going you're gonna see the set top record
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:07.960]   That are MPEG-4 capable that is where I think it really
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:13.280]   No serious challenges to see that anybody else doing direct TV dump TV all right. Yeah
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:19.240]   Yeah, they they were gonna so if I have a direct TV box, it still says Tiva you can still buy it. Yeah, they're still out there
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:22.080]   But going forward lifetime service will never go away
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:29.720]   Well, so that box dies and then you have to buy a new box. Yeah, so our our partners at AOL
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:33.160]   Finally launched their podcasting page. We're right there up on front
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.080]   So they've been providing us bandwidth for two months
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:37.120]   For this day
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:40.360]   Now they can now we're on the so they have a number of different podcasts
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:44.000]   Do you have today some of your podcasts a dog on the I have a one podcast channel?
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.520]   Well, they have to actually I should go little though. No, they have to ask you it's not like Adam Curry where they could just take it
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:57.760]   Just replay you without permission you got replayed right I keep the dial up users who can download these huge shows
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:00.200]   Yeah, right exactly you got replayed he played you on
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:05.400]   Apparently and I sent him a note saying Adam. I heard that Twitter was on serious. You know, we have a non commercial right
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:08.120]   You can't use it for commercial purposes and he says oh
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:11.440]   sent me a note back saying
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:16.480]   Didn't anybody ask you I'm pretty sure we asked you really and I said what he said
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:19.960]   We said a note to somebody I said well, I'm the only person you would ask and I didn't get any note. Yeah
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:25.200]   Same thing with dignity. He did he just did it and we had no note or anything. So what happened?
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:27.200]   So apparently that's what he's doing. He's just running stuff
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:30.680]   I didn't I didn't say anything. I was like I don't care the only reason I care it
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.040]   I don't really care because it's good promotion
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:35.560]   I think that's what he's assuming is everybody's gonna want the promotion except that AOL specifically said
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:38.800]   Because I asked him I said well where else would play it and they said anywhere, but serious
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:43.280]   And the reason is they have a deal with XM, right? So
[00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:50.880]   You know, I just said yes, stop and he stopped. They said by the way, you want to be part of spot show and I didn't answer
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:54.680]   So maybe now that he's got eight and a half million. I'll I'll be part of pot show
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:58.000]   I don't want to be part of it. You know, I don't want us to be a part of a big network
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.520]   I like yeah, we just do what we want to do. Yeah, if you're part of big network
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:08.080]   We like it's fun to be independent for that. Yeah, it's got the most popular podcast probably of all so we don't have to worry about anybody
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:13.520]   They did also and I'm really pleased you you were the one Doug who told me about
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:19.000]   Potscope they incorporated pot scope which is incredible podcast search of you play with me. I don't have it
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   Potscope is wonderful. They're apparently they're oh
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.520]   They're they're doing
[00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:27.120]   Turning the they're they're listening to the what do you call that?
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:31.840]   Did character recognition what the voice right? Yeah, that would be the other side of that
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:39.080]   So that they can index the audio and the main company is called TV eyes and their business has been doing
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:41.320]   voice recognition on
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:44.520]   Broadcast channels for a fee for their customer
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:50.760]   So if you're a Microsoft and you want to know every time your company's mentioned or IBM every time your company's mentioned you pay them
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.920]   To to let you know and to listen to all the streams that makes sense because they came out of nowhere so quickly
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:49:00.440]   They've been doing it for a long time. All the technology turns out it comes from just one or two places
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:04.360]   So you've got pod scope. You've got a company called blinks
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:07.000]   and a couple of others
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.200]   the old companies were Vooraj and autonomy and
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:15.320]   There was all that all that old technology which is now just being reused, you know
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:20.720]   They've been doing it works well do us do a search for Kevin Rose on that and what's neat about it is that
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:25.200]   It will not only pull up the references, but you can play it from that point
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:28.960]   You can do the audio from that really so if you want to just hear who's talking about
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:31.760]   Kevin Rose you just press play and you can hear it
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:36.480]   I've got a nice new feature too, which you'll be able to add to the Twitter podcast which is
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:43.440]   Not just is it their site where you look at all podcasts, but you'll be able to have a private search for a twit
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:48.640]   So you can just put it on the site that says search twit for that's right. That's right. That's gonna be very zestar
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:52.960]   I don't I've seen it on a couple of sites. I think it's in beta whatever that means. I'd love to try that
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:55.600]   It's gonna be out in beta. That's the real problem
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:59.280]   Then people have said that right from the beginning with podcasts is I'm like a written word
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:04.640]   They're not random access you're right that excerpt features marvelous now the key about it is it's dictionary based
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:08.400]   So they can only find words that they know ahead about ahead of time, right?
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:12.320]   So if they search for some proper names that aren't in the dictionary does work
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:16.560]   But the interesting thing is they have been adding stuff because I can search for my name and it finds it
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:19.280]   So and I'm not in the dictionary so but you're a very important person
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:23.440]   I guess so they are adding words to the searches. Oh, that's really interesting
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:28.560]   Well, I I think that was smart of AOL to to incorporate that because that'll make it much more usable
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:34.720]   For AOL subscribers. That was their big announcement. They've been they put things together very very quickly
[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:36.480]   I think the podcast thing
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:43.600]   Was done in about four weeks. That's all I took them put that together the AOL thing or the Podskope from the time they said let's do it
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:48.880]   It just boom. Yeah, and you showed it to me and I it was that was a month or two ago and
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:54.160]   I just it's gotten better every every day to by the way. I'm noticed. Have you ever you're playing with it?
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:58.880]   Yeah, I just did some searches. Did I find it? Yeah find stuff from the report boom. Do you find stuff from dignity?
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:02.720]   I didn't do a search for the nation because I don't know that if they do every podcast yet
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:05.920]   I mean, I'm sure that they do the top ones you're and you're certainly on the top there
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:11.760]   You flew to LA to do dignity this yeah, we're flying back and forth every because Alex is down there
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:18.800]   Yeah, Alex is coming up actually he must have frequent flyer miles like crazy. I do the southwest like 99 bucks done deal man
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:23.440]   It is pretty easy. It's 45 minutes in the air. It's like you're there, but uh, it's a lot of fun
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:26.160]   We go back and forth. He's coming up here for the next three weeks. That'll be good
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:31.920]   You excited about nasa going to the moon, david? Oh, that's a big. I mean, there's just too much
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:35.680]   It's too much. Yeah, they gotta they got a deal between now and 2011
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:40.720]   They're retiring the shuttle in 2010. They want to have their next vehicle up by 2011
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:44.960]   But they're gonna have several vehicles because they're gonna go on crew exploration vehicle
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:49.600]   And then they're gonna have a separate vehicle for taking cargo up and they're gonna spend 11 billion dollars on this and
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.800]   Six billion dollars on that they will not launch that ever again
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.200]   The reason they're going to the moon is because they want to prove
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:58.480]   Because they want to prove that they can go there and be resource efficient
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:01.440]   They want to prove that they can go there and live off the land
[00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:04.320]   Land it's rocks
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:07.680]   There's there's in the southern pole of the moon. There is more hydrogen
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:10.960]   There's possibly some water ice, you know, that's that's there
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:15.280]   Is this part of the Mars program or is this just its own thing?
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:17.600]   It's a precursor to it. It's all part of Mars
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:24.160]   Yeah, I think it's funny that it's gonna take us longer after 35 years. It's gonna take us longer to get there again
[00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.400]   Yeah, that's okay
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:31.280]   I honestly think it adds fuel in the fire. There's a huge community says we didn't go to the moon
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:35.040]   We didn't go to the moon and sometimes you think I mean you got to do this development spend these
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:39.840]   You know a decade of development spend billions and billions of dollars here. We are in 2005
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:43.440]   There in 19. Oh, yeah, there's lots of people. I think there's a tv studio
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:44.960]   Yeah, you gave me a hundred billion dollars
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:49.280]   And i'm i'm making a very convincing film that makes everyone think that we went back and we'll just call it a bit
[00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:51.360]   Put the money into Lucas film
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:53.120]   Yeah, exactly. You know, we'll make it work
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.600]   The stories did point out though that they're looking at using
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:53:00.000]   Repurposing like the main shuttle engine as well as the song. Yeah, I think five of them
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:05.200]   I think they were using it to take that they want to use that to do devices to reduce the development time
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:10.640]   You know if they're using the the the same srb's and they're using the same external fuel tank design
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:14.640]   They're using the same shuttle main engines. I think it's great. I mean this is inspiring
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:17.680]   It made it a point. I mean you don't really need to do manned exploration
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:22.880]   You don't learn anything more in manned exploration, but boy, it's sure it's it's great. It's cool. It's just cool. It's sexy
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:25.280]   Yeah, it's sexy. That's why you do it, right?
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:27.280]   Well, they they've
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:30.560]   Where were you in july of 19. I don't know exactly where I was
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:34.240]   Were you watching it? Doug and I are the only guys in this from old enough to remember you bet I was
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:38.640]   You're watching a you can't stop. I was I was 12 years old watching these guys in the moon and you walk out
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:41.360]   It was a full moon never forget it you walk out and you look up you say
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:48.320]   Wow, you didn't believe it. No, I believe that's amazing. It's so overwhelming mind-blowing to see that
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:53.840]   Florida to view the Saturn 5 in the museum and I've seen a landing at the Edwards
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:58.560]   I mean I have the restored Saturn 5 so it's so cool. Quality hanging above your those things are huge
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:03.600]   Massive three stage, but then it's like they have they let you relive that entire day of
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:06.080]   The moon landing with the news clips and everything
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:08.960]   For those of you who are too young to remember it
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:12.720]   I mean really that's all another argument for both
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:20.320]   You know when you're dealing with launching from either the space station or the moon is that getting it to somewhere else takes a lot less fuel
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:22.640]   When you do it from space
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:23.680]   You know gravity
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:27.280]   I mean almost all the fuel we use is to get us out of the earth's atmosphere
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:32.800]   So so the thing is is if we can get if we can build something that's much larger on the moon or on a space station or whatever
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:36.560]   There's a lot more stability as far as being able to it's much easier to get
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:40.160]   I just think we need somewhere to go with a hurricane start to get really bad space elevator
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:44.000]   Well, you know they've said I think there was an announcement that that were passed the point in no return on global warning
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:49.120]   Oh, it's someone said that it was like that was the story. The momentum is here. That was the story in USA today
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:54.560]   It's uh that that's why we're having all these big hurricanes is it's too late. It's the what was that movie?
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.560]   It's the it's the day after tomorrow
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:01.680]   Why were we able to take off on that is it that that's what's left?
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:05.680]   That was what was supposed to have happened there all the polar ice caps melted and you know, there's no land
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:08.320]   We would be underwater here
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:10.480]   We have some great lake front property. Yeah, exactly
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:15.040]   Just start what you have to do is make calculations and then start building your just start buying up lots of land
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:20.080]   You know right along the right along the new shore. So well luckily here. There's still a low sea level
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:26.560]   Let's get some questions from the audience if you have a question for the twits you could run up to the red microphone there and
[00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:32.240]   Ask and they're all looking like I didn't mean to wake you up. You probably didn't hear anything. We said did you?
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:35.200]   Okay, well, let's put a
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:38.640]   Next week to speaker
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:45.120]   Before someone runs up there. I want to I'm want to ask quite what does everyone think of the new and nintendo revolution controller?
[00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:52.240]   Robert Harris cousin Ted rigglesky is a big big big fan of it. It's a they just released it looks like a tv remote
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:55.120]   It's a remote control. I don't get it sideways and it's got a motion sensor
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:59.520]   It sounds like it's a gyro you know the gyration mice that allow you to just use it in the air and it has a very good
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:04.320]   Very good. Uh, how was that thing? You thought nintendo thumb was bad now
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:07.040]   You're gonna have nintendo wrist by holding your hand out the whole time
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:10.000]   It's got a horde separate from that so you have the analog stick and one hand and the base
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:14.480]   Is nintendo a player in this market at all for the kids
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:17.840]   You know they're going after this they have mario. Well, they gotta do something
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:22.160]   They gotta do something different because they gotta distinguish some some you got playstation 3
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:27.920]   And xbox 360 what I mean, but if they price it low enough everyone's gonna buy I bought it just resilda the old gamecube
[00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:35.120]   I think they sell the family way back way 500 bucks for the latest generation console. Oh the xbox comes out what next month next month
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:41.200]   Yeah, yeah, no vamper in time for christmas. Are you gonna give them for your kids? Oh, yeah, but I have to hack it
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:45.600]   Yeah, right because I already I mean, I you know my xbox is the thing of beauty
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:51.280]   Thanks to thanks to somebody. I won't name in this room. That's it. But uh, I mean that's a media center
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:55.040]   Uh, no, I just use it for games, but it's loaded with games. I mean, it's it's full of games
[00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.640]   I probably have a hundred games on that. All right
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:00.880]   Well nintendo said I think that they said that they were going to include you're gonna be able to download and play
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:03.440]   all the previous
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:08.800]   Games that they made but that's that's that's one thing that nobody's done. Well, we just backward compatibility
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:11.840]   Nintendo Nintendo
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:18.000]   I'm not sure if it's that's that is very nice and then yeah, that's what it looks like five seconds
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:21.040]   Yes, a small it's 37k my job
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:24.880]   Every every down little uh
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:31.840]   Roms with no just like a visit calc is online. You can download visit kek the first spreadsheet program. It's it's 37k
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:35.760]   It's like they embed them in web pages. Yeah, yeah

[00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:57.760]   I love my tech toys and I love my wife. I want to keep both
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:01.840]   How are you guys doing? How do you guys get from here? Let me give you a twit pocket protector
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:09.440]   This every woman wants one of these. I'll tell you right now. I'll give you two. That's my arms. So, uh, how long you been married
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:12.880]   Well, I know Doug K solution is
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:20.000]   Is what you moved everything into the into the, uh, you work out of the house studio to my wife and I share studio too
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.720]   Two desks facing one another so you and we're working the same room

[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:31.440]   But the best thing was when she went away for a week. I covered my side of the office with acoustic foam
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:35.360]   So your marriage isn't too good either
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:40.800]   It's only been 34 years. She's doing all right. You know, my wife is not a geek at all. She's not as no interesting this
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:45.440]   She's never heard twit. She's never she's seen very little of any of my tv shows
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:48.480]   Uh same with my kids. It's just a different life
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:51.440]   You know and I just try to you know pretend I'm going to work
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:57.520]   And then that you when you buy the new laptops and then you scream and say oh, it's work for work. It's all for work. It's all for work

[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   Oh

[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.440]   Yeah, the uh
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:27.680]   My head took the ferry anybody who took the ferry here. You should probably get going because the ferry leaves at at 5 30
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:30.720]   So uh, please please leave that's a good question though
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:33.280]   How do you keep your how do you keep your spouses from you?
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:35.520]   You've got to make sure that your spouse has
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:40.720]   the same kind of passion that you don't share and let their spouse go and do their thing too
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:42.240]   And that's it now it is your wife
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:44.160]   It's a tech and my wife is in the martial arts
[00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:49.840]   Right, so she'll also go off and do her martial art stuff and I'll do my tech stuff and uh, well same thing with my wife
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:54.240]   No interesting tech, but she has her own passion. Yeah, and uh, and then we meet for dinner. Yeah
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:57.120]   Mike fiance works at the
[00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:00.640]   He works. Yeah, she's a CFO. Yeah, she tells me what I'm allowed to spend and what I'm not
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:05.840]   Her have some sense of uh some sense of control what she does and I have to ask permission for everything
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.400]   And roberge estate strippers and they don't
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:12.720]   We're really wrong. I have good looking neighbors
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:16.480]   You go ahead
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.960]   My name is hirston. I'm here from san francisco. Hi hirston
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:25.680]   Hello, uh, my question is do you guys listen to podcasts other than ones you're involved in and if so, what are some of your favorites?
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:29.680]   Great question. My favorite podcast is uh, I reflect on science friday actually
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:34.960]   That's really I hear a lot of people listen to that and they put out a lot of them and they and they separate like sometimes
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:38.960]   They'll have three or four topics on the radio, but they'll separate them into individual subjects
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:43.200]   So you can download the ones that you're almost all the input here shows now are starting to be a podcast
[01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.520]   I think it's very smart except for all things considered
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:49.840]   Which is yeah, I'm the one that I want they do their music and they do like headlines
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.920]   I know I wish they do all things be crazy
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:54.320]   Uh fresh air needs to be a podcast so I'm
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:59.520]   Morning edition and all things because those are the only two that I really you know like if they just handled that
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:03.440]   I would I would have no need for a radio wouldn't you if you're public radio? What do you got to lose right?
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:08.640]   It's not like you're gonna undercut your I don't know what maybe they don't want a big fight going on in public radio between
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.360]   The people who produce the content and npr
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:17.360]   Uh, you know npr is sort of the evil empire. I see and so they don't like it that they're well
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:22.320]   You know the npr just launched their official podcast what about two weeks ago was that I think npr.org
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:25.760]   And I think most of the stations who contribute content
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:31.280]   contributed their second tier content to that and put their best of that's right and things like fresh air
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:36.000]   Uh are privately produced. I mean they're not produced by a station right that's uh
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:39.760]   That's terry grocery. What do you listen to you probably don't have a whole lot of time?
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.760]   Douglas I don't even listen to everything we produce
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:46.720]   12 12 a now on 12 hours a week. Couldn't do it when I want to take a break. I've got two music podcasts
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:53.120]   I like one is um roadhouse which is blues and uh coverville is still pretty good with a lot of actual covers
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.960]   I love coverville
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.960]   I've yet just too much for me
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:59.360]   That's probably the biggest problem with podcasting right now
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:02.400]   There are too many of them and it's almost overwhelming
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:05.760]   You feel like I can't keep up and you kind of give up because there's just too much
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:08.000]   I think that there really there is a big market
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.520]   I think people are working on it being able to sort through like what people really like
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:16.080]   I mean obviously the top the top 20 at an iTunes helps because you get to see with stuff
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.640]   But but like I dig like one of my favorite, you know, I uh, you know
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:22.160]   I listen to like dignity and watch command then and and then uh
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.360]   uh
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:26.240]   But then also I uh, I watch you know, I'm from pittsburgh
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:30.240]   So there's a stealer podcast that I you know I listen to every week religiously
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:33.440]   Get ready. There's a philadelphia eagles one. I do a green bay one. That's funny
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:37.760]   We all have our food podcast. That's great because I'm out of pittsburgh and I don't I can't keep up with all the news
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:40.880]   You know all I know is that you know the stealers won today 27 to 7
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.960]   Everybody knows but uh
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.720]   But um, uh, you know
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:47.920]   It's something that I feel totally disconnected from and it's really really great
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:52.560]   So that I think is and all of us obviously have different ones that well you're starting to see a few services
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:58.640]   Lumiya l o o mia is an interesting one because they're starting to do recommendation engines for podcasts
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:04.400]   Uh, you know, we're all essentially competing for drive time. It's drive time. It's exercise time and what else is it?
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.160]   There's no people don't have enough time, right?
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:10.000]   You'll see recommendations sites coming out odeo. I think is going to be doing
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.640]   What do you know, so I I think that's uh, that's a good way for people to find stuff
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:19.920]   I hope somebody perfects that service or a ranking or something just to let you browse what's out there a little easier because
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:26.320]   That's one of the curses and benefits of ip media in general is just that too much so many people anybody can do it
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.400]   Right, it'd be great if people rated it also by i'd love to hear but either I never had to find it
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:35.360]   Yeah, it'd be great. It'd be great to also know the the quality of the content and also the quality of the the podcast
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:41.040]   I mean does it sound like it was in somebody's closet or does it sound like it is you know rate that rating system using?
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:45.120]   Yeah, we have a new on the news thing. We're building. We have three ratings for the podcast
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:49.200]   It's the audio quality the content quality and the geekiness
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:53.920]   Which is no matter what the topic is how deep is it is it for uh, you know average people or
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:56.400]   I like that for people who are way deep in the tech
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.640]   Yeah, because some of your some of your talks are marketing folks
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:04.000]   And I'm less interested in that than if somebody's going to talk about something really deep, but if it goes deep biotech you might say
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:09.600]   No, I love that. Do you? Yeah, that's great. You know, I have to steer clear. I'm listening to more and more of that. Yeah
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.240]   Well, what else do you listen to it? Okay
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:17.360]   Uh, there's one. I like that just they only have one episode out right now. It's called the web 2o show
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:21.680]   Over over I've listened to it 20 times my favorite podcast
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:27.200]   No, it's actually it's quite good these guys just talk about next generation website technologies and know the ajax and like the
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:33.520]   By that. Yeah, I've been a little disappointed. There's a there's a pro podcast is a python podcast is a ruby
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:37.440]   On rails podcast none of them. It's hard. I guess to do programming
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:41.280]   As a podcast man. What do you get to talk about? Yeah, do you listen to the rubies on real?
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:44.480]   I haven't heard that one yet. Yeah, it's kind of produced in a tunnel way
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:49.280]   You know, it's hard to it's hard to listen when you can't really hear it very well, but uh, yeah
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.440]   I've been trying and I keep subscribing to it
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:56.800]   Because I'm fascinated by this stuff. Yeah, same here the python podcast is is pretty good. There's a cocoa podcast
[01:04:56.800 --> 01:05:00.480]   Uh, where the guy and I think this is one way to do it talks to developers
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:04.960]   So interview developers about what they do how they would have what's their you know, what's their workflow and stuff?
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:06.960]   It's hard. You can't really say well, you know, okay
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:12.240]   Here's a problem when you've got a hook that you're in the you know, and you can't wait you're not gonna talk about that
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:14.720]   What do you listen to David? Do you listen to podcast?
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:20.080]   Well, I just mentioned like that science Friday one another one that I think I suppose this is credit
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:21.600]   This is pretty uh
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:26.240]   From from a from a liberal point of view I suppose there's one that's called weekly radio address
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:31.520]   I think it's some comedian who decides to do a two-minute a week podcast about two minutes per week
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:36.400]   Where he does a mock. I'm George Bush giving the video address. I like that
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:40.000]   He's really funny, but uh, I mean again like he's very
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.400]   A certain type of what's the name of that? You know, I think it's called weekly radio address
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:49.120]   I mean if you type in weekly read address podcast bush something like that. Um, I want to hear more comics doing those
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.760]   There's a few comics doing podcasts that are Dan class does one
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:55.840]   Um, but I'd like to hear more. I think that's that's a good me comedy comedy or like
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:06:01.280]   Talking and being funny, you know, you know, I want to hear more radio drama
[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:03.360]   That's what I'd like to do is uh more more
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:07.600]   More theater. We're very curious to see how this martin sergeant podcast goes
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:12.720]   You know, he's very funny guy and if it's well produced it could be his it could be a hoot
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:15.280]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, do you listen to anything at all?
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:20.480]   Robert not enough. Yeah, I mean, I listen to the stuff we do just to you know, check it out
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:23.440]   You know, it's funny is the catholic insider you ever listened to that
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:28.960]   Because I think he you know, he's a priest and I think he always wanted to be a radio guy because it's really produced
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:33.200]   You know, he's got music and he's talking like this and it's really it's fun though. It's quite well done
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:37.520]   I think it's it's quite entertaining. The only time I've ever heard a sound scene to her that was actually
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:42.400]   entertainee he did one of um, he got some special scoop in the Vatican didn't yeah
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:45.280]   He was there during the the the election of the pope and stuff
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:50.960]   So, you know, it's that's kind of interesting and it's an example of a niche a real nichey podcast
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:54.800]   It actually could be quite well a lot of the catholic church is a really large niche. I mean, it's well
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:59.920]   I'm not that interested in the catholic church, but if it's well if it's well done and the guy's kind of interesting
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:03.600]   Um, you can make almost anything interesting. I guess that's what you're talking about with a passion
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:07.280]   If you have that passion, uh, that comes through and you listen to it
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:09.840]   And I'm hoping that you know, we've been talking I mean have your
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:13.280]   Kevin's doing one on on, uh, you know, how to do podcasting
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:15.840]   We're talking about doing stuff that talks about the technology of it
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:20.800]   But also how to fix before yeah in the pixel core of how to use your voice how to do the you know
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:26.960]   Do all those pieces because it's something that is really missing. I mean some I mean a lot of podcasts. Hello. This is oh, there's thousands of people
[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:32.560]   And the funny thing is they're not that bad. They just need a tiny little bit of tweaking
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.640]   That's all right. Yeah, and I think that yeah
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:39.120]   Figure you can run around to be 10 times more excited a little more energy a half an hour before they start the show and then they
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:44.560]   That'd be sad. I think if they all talk like this it'll be a lot. They'll make it sound easy. Yeah, everybody should talk like that
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:49.680]   That's the key yomping in the morning. I could teach anybody that talk like that
[01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:56.480]   Yeah, how you doing? I'm Alex. I came down from uh, Medford, Oregon. I like your shirt. Thank you. I'm popular in south dakota
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:58.480]   I
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:04.000]   Was wondering what you guys thought of this I saw this on dig actually the new microsoft max
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:07.920]   It's direct. It looks like it's a direct competitor with google spicasa
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:14.560]   You heard of that. It must be part of that. Oh, it's microsoft new application. Yeah, it's a video. Are there
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:17.520]   When effects and yeah, I did see that
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:22.400]   Even looked at the app yet. I have I heard about that. Is it part of the expression package or is something else?
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:26.720]   It's a new application that microsoft just launched last it's just it's the pain application, right?
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:31.200]   Is that no, it's it's like a photo organization. Yeah, it's like Picasa. You just pulling on your multi-media
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:35.120]   I think I dig it for that. I mean if you have a computer just full of
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:39.760]   Every image you've taken for the last five years in no particular order. That's what you need
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:45.360]   It's a great way to look at a straightening it out and then backing it up. Right. It'll offer to Picasa
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:49.760]   You're talking about Picasa. Yeah, look for duplicates eliminate them for you and then let you burn it off to a media
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:52.720]   It's beautiful. That's a beautiful thing. Yeah, actually to add to that
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:58.160]   I was just wondering what you guys thought about this sort of battle that's going on between google and microsoft and is it gonna come to a head soon?
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:03.360]   Doug says google's about to buy yahoo or was it yahoo's about to buy google? No, firstly
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:08.080]   Not about it. I don't know as soon as it is. Just remember you heard it on twitter first the google
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.720]   Yahoo
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:15.440]   That would make a giant that's almost that's yeah, that's that's almost an SEC
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:19.200]   You know, I mean that's almost like a you know as long as there's microsoft around they'll get away with it
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:24.240]   Yeah, exactly. Well, that would be very interesting. I mean really is it's coming down to the big players now
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:30.080]   Uh and they're and they're all looking for that kind of domination and it's google. It's yahoo
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:35.840]   It's microsoft. There's a microsoft max. Oh, I did I looked at that website. Yeah, I didn't download it though
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:38.400]   I'll have to download it. Yeah, I've downloaded it either. What's the what's the ure?
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:43.360]   Microsoft dot com slash max. I'm really interested to try I loved Picasa
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:49.200]   I can see improvements that could be made and if Microsoft makes a better one like I'll use it
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:52.240]   No, they probably had that in the lab
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:58.080]   Just sitting on a shelf because they didn't acquire somebody for this no somebody written it and uh and you know
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:02.960]   They probably have stuff like that all over the place, right? They bought it for 2.6 billion dollars from no
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:06.640]   It was a Skype product
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:12.000]   What's your name? I am jesse. I'm here from uh, New York. Hi, Jesse. What brings you out here from New York?
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:18.720]   I came for you guys. No, I'm here with my wife on a small vacation. How do you keep your wife from hating geeks? I see you brought her
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:25.360]   Yeah, she's back there. She doesn't mind that you geek out, huh? No, I just I just it's a give-and-take situation
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:28.320]   You know I let her go shopping for a while and she lets me go shopping for a while
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:32.000]   She spent a while in union square. I spent a while in the apple store to work there
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.840]   That's a good relationship
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:40.240]   But I'm wondering what you guys think of mobile computing in the future with Verizon launching their wireless broadband and all these other companies
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:46.000]   Trying to push data on you, but it doesn't really seem to be catching nobody's really catching on saying hey, I could buy
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.200]   A nice cell phone and use the internet anywhere. Where do you guys see it going in the future? Well, I I uh
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:56.640]   The big I think that one of the big players is going to be coming out as amped mobile and they're going to be and I talked
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:00.400]   I mentioned it I think in the last show and it's not anything like what Verizon has right now
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:07.920]   So they took in 67 million dollars in their first round and they they start rolling stuff out in I think October, November
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:16.080]   Limited and then the EVDO or it's EVDO. It's what we mentioned is 2.4 megabits per second to the to the phone, but it's going to point four megabits
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:22.240]   So that means 30 frames a second to the phone, you know, and you know a really hot interface. It's going to be you know, it's not vcast
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.000]   It's not what they're doing. It's not what they're doing now
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.440]   It's it's going to be a completely new, you know process and it's going to I think it's going to really change the way we I mean
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:34.480]   I don't like surfing with a phone see I don't know if it's a if that's a good device for surfing
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:40.400]   But for watching a little video and the thing is at that rate, I mean they're making deals with you know ESPN with
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:45.600]   I could see watching the Steelers game on your phone, right? I totally do it, you know, especially when you're
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:48.960]   That I have a modem with my PC though. What can I use that as a modem for my notebook?
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:51.360]   I don't think so. I think that that's always the yes
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:54.960]   I get 2.4 megabits my phone, but I mean there's a lot of times like when I'm sitting there
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:59.040]   I want 2.4 megabits to hear right. Yeah, I mean this is a great device
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:02.160]   I mean if you get Wi-Fi if you get enough bandwidth in your cell network
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:06.480]   I can receive 2.4 megabits my notebook with a USB cable or then on behalf of more folks
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:10.800]   They're doing that and they're doing that right now if you in the EVDO markets
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:12.880]   You can buy a PC card with an antenna, right?
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:19.120]   And you have access you have full access to the EVDO network it. I don't know if it's that fast, but do you know it's good
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:25.360]   It's ISDN or better. I'll try to find out from them. I think that's a Verizon selling right now in LA
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:28.160]   You could buy that car. Yeah, but I think soon here by the way
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:34.560]   When you look at companies like ESPN is probably right on the front edge of a lot of how do we use our media in every possible way known to man
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:38.080]   You know and I think that yeah, they're good at that. They even got stores
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.560]   I always thought we should have a tech TV store
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:45.200]   They have stores that have restaurants. No, they have they're not even stores or restaurants
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:50.320]   They're amusement centers. They've got games. They've got TVs. They've got
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:56.640]   Full HD bar. It's the yes, it's a sports zone. They call it credible. There's one in Disneyland
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:01.920]   There's one in school. It's one of Vegas. Yeah, but I mean that's a perfect example of if I could see highlights
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:06.560]   For me of the Steelers on myself. That's a great mark. I'd be I'd be all over that
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:08.560]   And there's a lot of times
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:10.960]   I mean I do want to be able to connect it to my to my computer
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:15.120]   But I also there's sometimes like when I when I want to watch like I end up watching movies on
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:20.320]   I just got my finally got a PSP, you know the Sony PSP and uh
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:25.120]   And I watch movies while I'm standing in line for like when I'm on flights when I'm standing in the
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:30.160]   The really really long line at SFO to get on my flight. Uh, I sit there and I'm just watching my
[01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:32.720]   How long I take you get them on the umd format
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:40.000]   Okay, you use it. You get as a web browser and you you download it get content to the internet. Oh, there's a lot of
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.240]   Yeah, something like that. Yes, so
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:46.080]   Has anybody yet cracked the PSP in terms of being able to use the full resolution for your own
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.880]   The HD H264 there's a lot of people working on it
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:52.080]   But I don't think it's there's some it's some wanky version of H264
[01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:54.560]   So right now you have to use the mpeg
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:59.040]   Uh mpeg 4 you can you can get you can put it on the memory state, but you don't get the full resolution
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:00.720]   Yeah, you don't get the full resolution, but they're
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:05.280]   Someone's gonna figure it out. I mean all it is is a retool h2. They've hacked the umd
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:08.080]   It can't be much longer before they figure out how to get full res out
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:13.200]   I mean generally the one thing to be careful of with your PSP is almost every update to the operating system. It's security
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:17.600]   Yes, all it is. They're not improving one five anything on it. All they're doing is making it
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.760]   Well, they have a browser and all that's better stuff. Yeah, that's it's a way to
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:26.000]   Oh, though all the point all the one point which is a little fix. It's just break
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.960]   Right break all the things you act all the cool things that we did. Yeah, you know next week
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:35.120]   Jen cutter will be on the show a little bit talking about that she hacked my uh
[01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:40.160]   Sony PSP and uh, we'll talk a little bit about that amber McCarthy's coming down to from toronto
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:44.480]   To visit us she'll be on the show and I trust you all will be back. Don't come back anytime
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:49.280]   We'd love to have you back. I need the exercise. It's only a mile and the beer is free in the peanuts
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:53.600]   Well, we'll charge you for those, but that's all right. Uh, all the pocket protectors. You can carry home
