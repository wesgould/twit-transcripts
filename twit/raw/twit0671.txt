[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340]   It's time for Twit This Week in Tech.
[00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.840]   I called the panelist week a motley crew, but it really is a good one.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.440]   Jeff Kanada is back to talk about E3.
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.600]   Brianna Wu, she's running for Congress in Massachusetts and is a game developer.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.080]   And Dan Patterson from Tech Republic, we will talk about E3 and why Brianna says it was the
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.520]   best E3 in years.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.480]   Some really interesting stories across AT&T's Time Warner.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.040]   Merger is official.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.800]   But that means for the internet and why security on cell phones in DC is so bad, it's all coming
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.040]   up next on Twit.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.040]   [MUSIC]

[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.760]   It's time for Twit this Week in Tech.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.960]   For sure, will we talk about the weeks?
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.960]   Tech News.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.520]   And we have a motley crew this week because there was news in a lot of different arenas.
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.440]   But I'm really thrilled to bring them all together.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.000]   Jeff Kanata, formerly President Kanata.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.560]   We'll explain that in a moment.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.560]   He's from DLC at 5x5TV.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.800]   And of course, he's on slash film with Devindra.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.400]   Hey, Jeff, great to see you.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.560]   Good to see you.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.800]   I'm proud to be part of the motley crew.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.800]   You're motley crew.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.080]   Today, you're an advanced Neil.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.120]   And because E3 was this week and we thought we better get somebody who knows something
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.120]   about games in.
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.680]   Of course, I think Brianna will know a little bit about games.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.440]   She's a game designer, but more lately, a candidate for Congress in the 8th District
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.520]   of Massachusetts, Brianna Wu, 2018.com.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.520]   Welcome back, Brianna.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.520]   Great to see you.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.520]   Thank you for having me.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.080]   It's always so good to talk about tech, like instead of depressing political situations.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.160]   So happy to be here today.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.280]   Also here, Dan Patterson from CBS Interactive.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.480]   He's senior writer at Tech Republic.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.040]   And there's a lot of other stuff we couldn't fit it in the lower third.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.440]   So just there you have it right there.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.320]   Dan, great to have you also.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.480]   Dan is great to be with you.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.920]   A leader in modern news gathering, I think is the best way to.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.920]   That is too kind.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.520]   Yeah, well, you've done some really interesting and I think important innovative stuff in
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:35.040]   the news gathering going back to your coverage of Occupy Wall Street and so forth.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.800]   Although interestingly, you did that on Twitter, right?
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.160]   And storeify, was it storeify used?
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.160]   Yeah, probably.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.800]   Doesn't even remember.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.760]   Occupy was 2011, so.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.360]   God, seven years ago.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.360]   Wow.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.360]   And we were just talking.
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.360]   You're kind of not a fan of the social media anymore.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.240]   I've always been a skeptic of social media.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.760]   I mean, it was in the Twitter beta because it was a part of ODO and kind of saw it become
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:13.760]   our little open platform that Noah Glass promoted and watched and been a part of the
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.640]   rise of social media in many ways benefited from it.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.800]   But I got to tell you, long before the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke with Facebook, although
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:28.480]   I knew Alexander, he used to call me at weird times at the night and talk really old.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.960]   Yeah, I covered Cambridge in 2016.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.640]   And Alex would, I assume, be inebriated and call me at weird times of the night and rant
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.000]   about stuff.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.320]   But I left Facebook a little under a year ago in Instagram because I just didn't like
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.000]   not only how it made me feel, and I don't want to get all the email on you, but it made
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.120]   me feel as kind of bad every time I logged in.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.160]   And I didn't like my behavior on the platform.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.440]   I mean, I mostly just spam work links on all social media.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.560]   I just am, here's a link that we're working on at Tech Republic or CBS News.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.280]   And with Facebook, I felt like I was bragging a whole lot.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.040]   And you know, at least on Twitter, it's contextualized, like you really don't have to follow me and
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.560]   I don't care if you don't want to follow me.
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.800]   And on Facebook, because it's a linear connection with people, I felt like maybe I was kind
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.680]   of being a dick to people who, you know, I don't want to show off or be abrasive in
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.240]   any way, I don't think I was, but I don't like any of the behavior.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.600]   And I know Brianna experienced a lot of this.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.720]   Jeff, I'm sure you've experienced a lot of this.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:42.440]   Every time I'm on, I get, you know, 10 to one hate to anything positive.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.240]   And I just think that it does seem to bring out the worst in people, doesn't it?
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.080]   Yeah, Facebook has isolated us.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.120]   It is they've behaved in a way that maybe isn't intentionally malicious, but that has
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.480]   worked to alienate us.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:06:00.040]   And I think that the what they've done with gathering data on mobile phones has been
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.240]   insincere at best and and malevolent at worst.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.680]   And so I just felt creepy by the platform and left.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.680]   But you see what's happened?
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.200]   You have all this pent up stuff that you haven't been able to express.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.200]   Right.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.200]   Right.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.200]   I have no place.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.960]   That stuff should have been a tweet storm, man.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.960]   I don't know.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.600]   Wait a minute.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.240]   I got to dig deeper though.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.520]   When you say Alexander used to call you drunk in the middle night, are you talking about
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.720]   Alexander Coke, Coke and the Cambridge Analytus?
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.040]   Nick, the former CEO of Cambridge.
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.040]   Nick's the CEO of Cambridge.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.400]   I'm not saying he was drunk, but his behavior implied that perhaps he was inebriated sometimes,
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.400]   not all the time sometimes.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.400]   Sounds like you're you might be.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.160]   But I'm not saying that he was because I don't know that he was.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.560]   But yeah, I covered Cambridge and had a mixed relationship with them in 2016.
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.560]   There weren't.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.880]   So I covered politics and there just weren't a lot of people covering big data in politics.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.520]   There certainly was Sasha Eisenberg in 2012.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.160]   But in 2016, if you covered data and how data was driving the election, there weren't.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.640]   There wasn't a lot of competition.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.520]   So sometimes I would write a story that Alex liked.
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.400]   Sometimes I'd write a story that he didn't like and I would get an earful from him and
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.080]   other executives at the company.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.080]   Wow.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.040]   Sounds like somebody is going to be a witness.
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.400]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.080]   Miss, you know what?
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:20.280]   I found down, you know, running for office, I was out the other day and I was like, I
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:26.360]   was just thinking to myself, how happy I felt, just like deep joy inside.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:31.400]   And I think a lot of that is the process of this makes you get off the computer, off
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.680]   Twitter, off Facebook.
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:38.040]   You spend so much of your day smiling at strangers, waving at everyone, even if you
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.000]   don't know them, trying to make friends everywhere you go.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.360]   Yeah, I really feel like it makes you become a better person.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.400]   It gets you away from that.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.240]   Like, do you know the behavior on Twitter where it's like, you get someone's Twitter
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.880]   tweet and you snark tweet it with the most cutting, sarcastic thing you could possibly
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.880]   say there?
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.040]   And I'm certainly guilty about that.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.880]   I don't, but I see it.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:00.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.080]   I just think like it makes you feel better, at least I feel better since-
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.080]   So my question is-
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:12.000]   Yeah, my question about this is, is it a function of human beings being connected to one another
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.840]   one another that does this or is it a function of these platforms?
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.840]   Because I think it's-
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:24.360]   Being capable of as a species of being able to communicate globally all the time to everybody,
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:29.320]   or is there something specific to the way these platforms handle that process that elicits
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.680]   this kind of behavior?
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.600]   That's a great question, Jeff.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:38.160]   I think that it is these platforms in particular, especially with algorithms that incentivize
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.400]   fast behavior and fast reactions and the platforms that design.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:48.320]   So if you remember, Facebook, you used to have to enter before responding to a comment,
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.480]   and I'm sure all of us with email are never like that.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.600]   And email is certainly an example of a platform that connects everyone.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.680]   MX records are something that is interpreted by every mail server in the world.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.120]   And so we can connect with everyone.
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:08.240]   I believe that Facebook is engineered in such a way so that we get those dopamine pings
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.920]   with every notification.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.640]   And we are incentivized to leave a very quick, fast response.
[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:18.480]   I also think that the algorithm segments people.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.440]   And I think that it plays to our worst nature.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.120]   So there are ways that perhaps we could design platforms.
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.160]   And you guys might be the experts, Jeff and Brianna, especially with your expertise in
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.280]   gaming on how to bring out the best in people.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:40.160]   And I think that Facebook probably has followed their own stock and they've had to do things
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.560]   that set them above and beyond their competition.
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:48.200]   But in doing so, they behaved in a way and they built a platform in a way so that it
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.560]   brought out the worst in people.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:54.200]   As the old timer here though, I am going to point out that I don't know of a single social
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:10:00.200]   network that hasn't done, I mean, going back to the days of the news groups of Usenet,
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:05.440]   where Flamero's eventually destroyed it, then the Well, which I loved, that Flamero's
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:11.360]   eventually made in tolerable almost it seems and look at YouTube comments, look at any
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.640]   place, you get a bunch of people together.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:24.120]   It often starts out very pleasant, wonderful, as a beautiful, warm bath of a human interaction.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.200]   And then somehow for some reason, it just degenerates.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:33.600]   And it seems like that's just part of being a social network after some number of years.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.600]   Even email.
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.760]   I mean, even were there no social networks, we would all still be getting those forwards
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.760]   that we survived.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.600]   Look at the garbage we get in email, right?
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.360]   Yeah, true.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.360]   True.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.520]   So maybe this is, I mean, I think you're right that algorithms exacerbate it and Facebook's
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.360]   algorithm and we were talking before the show.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.760]   I don't think anything, I don't think they're evil.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:59.960]   I think that they're just optimizing, optimizing for engagement, but that has the side effect
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.360]   of creating this kind of cesspool.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.160]   But even then, I think it's just weaponized something that's always been around with social
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.720]   networks.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:12.360]   I would say this, I've had death threats on pretty much every social network that exists.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.800]   Never Pinterest.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.800]   Never Pinterest.
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:15.800]   No, no, no.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.800]   If you did get death threats on Pinterest, they'd be the most beautifully designed.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.800]   They have kitty cats.
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.800]   They'd be cats.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.800]   They would be just exquisite.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.840]   I think it's worth noting that Pinterest was designed with a lot of women on the engineering
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.840]   team.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:30.840]   They did design.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:31.840]   Now, granted.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:32.840]   Were they though?
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.840]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:39.680]   I think a lot of, I mean, I just read Emily Chang's book, a book, Brotopia, which was
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:40.680]   wonderful.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.000]   Everyone in tech should read that book and she talks about the leadership being almost
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.800]   entirely male and they had one of the worst broke cultures there and they cynically marketed
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.600]   to a female demographic.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.040]   But I don't know anything about the engineering team.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.240]   I might be conflating Pinterest and Instagram.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.240]   I admit that.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.400]   Instagram was guys Kevin, sister, mini company.
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.400]   Maybe I'm misremembering.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.080]   Instagram, those pretty good.
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.160]   It has somewhat degenerated, but it's still pretty good, right?
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.440]   Maybe it's pictures that are okay because it's hard to threaten death with pictures.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:18.920]   I mean, you know, we all should joke about people, but we joke about, you know, how Facebook
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.080]   is now where your mom hangs out.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:27.640]   But I think about how my mom engages with Facebook and it's pretty positive.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.280]   It's a pretty positive experience for her.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.280]   Yeah.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:35.320]   You know, I'm sure she sees a lot of political stuff as do everybody on Facebook.
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:40.520]   But the way what my mom gets out of the experience of logging into Facebook is almost entirely
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.680]   positive.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.240]   She's connected with her kids and grandkids.
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.400]   She's connected with her high school friends.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:52.680]   She lives in a world of connection that just wouldn't have been possible for her in any
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.160]   other way, really.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:59.800]   And so there is some positive stuff, obviously, that is enabled by these platforms.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:04.680]   And maybe it's, I don't know, I don't know if it's the platform or if it's human beings
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:09.720]   that are misaligned here.
[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.320]   You're probably right.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.320]   It's us.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:18.280]   So funny because this is probably the fourth Twitter in a row that inadvertently has ended
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.280]   up being this conversation.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.320]   I think it's something that people, it's really on people's minds right now.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.320]   What's going on?
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.320]   Well, there's a reckoning coming.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.480]   There's a reckoning with all this stuff.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.920]   I mean, we're seeing that obviously the beginnings of it with Zuckerberg testifying and stuff
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.920]   like that.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:38.320]   But I think there's going to be a cultural reckoning with it very, very soon.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.560]   And I don't know what that's going to look like or what that will, how it'll play out.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.920]   But I think that everybody is having this conversation, whether it's pundits like us
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:50.480]   on shows or just average people in the street.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.480]   There's a weirdness.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:56.600]   I mean, to the point where I'm sure I'm not the only one that noticed every ad during
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:00.360]   the NBA finals was companies saying, "I'm sorry."
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.360]   I know it's an apology tour.
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.360]   It was Uber.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.360]   Well Fargo.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.360]   It was Wells Fargo.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.360]   Everybody, I'm so sorry, but what we did.
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:09.360]   Except, wait a minute.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.360]   I'm so sorry.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.760]   And this is perhaps Jermaine, but Facebook wasn't apologizing.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.520]   They acted as if it happened to them.
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:19.720]   They said, "Oh, Facebook was this wonderful place."
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.320]   And then something happened as if they had nothing to do with it.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.160]   We're so sorry you got upset.
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.160]   Something happened.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.160]   We got caught.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.480]   We're going to interview on June 29th, Siva Vijayathan, who is a great academic, covers
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:38.880]   all this stuff in his new book is anti-social media of Facebook disconnects us under mind's
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:39.880]   democracy.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:44.040]   It's an example of the drumbeat that you're seeing from so many sources now.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.480]   And it's not just, I have to say, it's not just Facebook.
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.480]   It's social.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.480]   But how about gaming?
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.600]   Let's talk about gaming because that's what we're here for.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.600]   Yes.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.600]   This was a good E3 everybody.
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.600]   Was it?
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.600]   This is really good.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.600]   All right.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.640]   Let's take a break and when we come back, a good E3, has it finally happened?
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:04.320]   This was the first E3 that I know of that regular people could come to, right?
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.080]   Was that made it so good?
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:07.480]   They sold tickets.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.560]   But first, a word from our sponsor.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:15.080]   And actually, this is a great company that I'm a big fan of and I have on my iPad.
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.800]   It's one of the first things I still want to get a new iPad is texture.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.280]   And I was so pleased when I saw Apple bottom, I think that's going to mean very good things
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.280]   for texture.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.880]   Texture is basically Netflix for magazine.
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:33.000]   The magazine app, it offers unlimited access to more than 200 of the best magazines all
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   in one place.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.720]   You get complete issues, every page on the newsstand, plus back issues, plus bonus features you
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:43.280]   don't get on a printed magazine like video.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.960]   Anytime anywhere, it's all in one app.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.040]   You'll stay connected to the biggest and best stories today with texture from the best
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.440]   magazine, which is look at time and people and Esquire, good housekeeping and Forbes
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.080]   and sports illustrated.
[00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:59.040]   You like your gossip, you got your entertainment magazine, your people, your maximum.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.440]   You like travel, travel and leisure.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:07.160]   You like show business, I would never subscribe to variety, but I love reading variety and
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:09.320]   billboard and ad age.
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.320]   That's one of the things that's great.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.440]   It's a lot of these magazines you might not subscribe to, but having an article in one
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:20.280]   of them, if you like tech, they got CNET, they got Macworld, PC Magazine, Popular Science,
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:23.840]   Popular Mechanics, Wired Magazine.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.560]   You like audio sound and vision.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.440]   And the curated sections mean there's always something great to read.
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.960]   I would say that every week, there's something great in the New Yorker, every month, something
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:37.720]   great in Vanity Fair or Rolling Stone.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:42.160]   I want to read those, but I don't want to have all that clutter on my coffee table.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.800]   I don't want to pay an arm and a leg to subscribe to 20 magazines.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:50.000]   So one $10 subscription and I get them all.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Texture is the magazine app with no coffee table clutter.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.880]   Look at all this great stuff.
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.280]   Beautiful two images.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:01.880]   If you're a photographer, you'll love the photography magazines like National Geographic
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.680]   because you can zoom in on the images.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.360]   You can pixel peep to your heart's content and they look like the originals.
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:11.160]   They probably are the originals so much better than anything in a print magazine.

[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:36.600]   Texture.com/twit.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:41.400]   Brianna, you probably didn't have the luxury to go to E3 this year so you followed it.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.400]   I sure wish.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.400]   Wow.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.400]   That would have been great.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.400]   But Jeff, you were there.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.400]   I was.
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.400]   Yes, indeed.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.400]   Great fun.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.400]   Why?
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.400]   Wait, you agree with Brianna?
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.400]   It was the best yet.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.400]   Really good E3.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.400]   I don't know if I would say best yet.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.200]   I think it was a solid year.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:02.600]   It's an interesting, we're in a sort of weird transition state for E3 because many of the
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:08.680]   big publishers are pulling out or having satellite shows that are concurrent with E3,
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.760]   but not actually part of E3.
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:21.040]   And so the big, crazy floor chaos that used to be what defined E3 has subsided a bit.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:25.440]   And the floor itself is still cacophonous and intense and has a lot of companies, but
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.320]   fewer than it used to.
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:32.320]   I mean, EA does its own event now in Hollywood instead of downtown Los Angeles.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:36.520]   Microsoft this year pulled out and had an event that was adjacent at their--
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.520]   Isn't that funny?
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:41.600]   I thought they were at E3 because they had the press conference just like always.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.600]   Yeah.
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.680]   Well, the Microsoft sponsors the theater at LA Live now.
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.880]   So it is adjacent to the convention center, but it wasn't actually part of E3.
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:55.800]   And their floor presence on the show floor of E3 was nonexistent because they have their
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.760]   own location now.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.760]   So it's interesting.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.200]   It's in a really interesting state.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:07.880]   And of course, Nintendo for years has done what they call Nintendo direct, which is not
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.240]   an actual press conference.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:13.160]   There are no human beings in an auditorium listening to someone on stage.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:19.600]   They have a prerecorded, edited, composed presentation that they just livestream whenever
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:20.600]   they feel like it.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.440]   And they do that at E3, but they do it multiple times during the year.
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:30.880]   And I think you're going to see many companies moving away from E3 and moving to that model
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.960]   because they have control over the message.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.960]   They don't have to deal with pesky human beings.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.240]   And they're able to cut out the middlemen.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.200]   And why-- As you keep saying on this show many times, I've heard disintermediate.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:49.640]   That's the-- There's no reason to have press between you and your message anymore.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:55.440]   That's what's killed or not killed, but certainly caused problems for trade shows in general.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.960]   I mean, Microsoft pulled out at CES.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.560]   Comdex has disappeared.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.480]   Well, yeah, I mean, Apple showed the way.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.880]   Apple doesn't go to these events.
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.400]   You just have your own events and you get more attention.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.320]   You're not competing with anybody else.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.600]   Somehow though, it seems like Microsoft's Sony Nintendo still feel like they have to be
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.600]   somewhere around E3.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.600]   That's still the week, right?
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.600]   It's still the week.
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.640]   Well, it's the week that all the news is coming out, right?
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:24.960]   And for a gamer's perspective, you don't really care if Nintendo is announcing Smash
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.280]   as part of E3 or with the Nintendo Direct.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.520]   I just care that a new Smash is coming out.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:36.360]   So I really hear what you're saying, Jeff, but they've struggled with this for years.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.000]   Leo, you were saying this was the first E3 that was open to the press.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.960]   If I'm remembering this correctly, they tried that a few years ago.
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:49.440]   Like letting people in, then they shut it off to journalists again and let people back
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:52.640]   in if I'm remembering that correctly.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:57.200]   I just think ultimately it matters like what games were announced and what games are coming
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.600]   out because they're all kind of competing for that mind share.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:06.160]   Like is Fallout 77 going to be the big game that people care about is Anthem?
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:11.000]   And I think what we saw this year were some fresh new IPs really getting a lot of attention
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   from people.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.720]   I think according to a game spot, E3 opens the public for the first time ever.
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.360]   15,000 tickets.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.320]   Oh, wait a minute, that was last year.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.320]   Okay, there you go.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.880]   So it is the second year in a row.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:24.880]   Okay.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.880]   Second year.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.600]   And this year, the first time they had different hours for the public and the press, which was
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:30.600]   kind of nice.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:34.240]   We got a couple of hours at the beginning to go in and just have press only.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.680]   But I agree with you, Brianna.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.680]   I think you're right.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:41.840]   I think it ultimately comes down to what games were shown, what things were talked about,
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.920]   because it is the biggest week in the gaming calendar.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.800]   And that's really the most important thing.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.440]   It is interesting how the show is changing.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.920]   And I think kind of receding in a certain sense.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:59.080]   But from a gaming standpoint, from just what was announced, it really was a strong year
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.200]   for some exciting stuff.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:03.960]   We did get a lot of sequels, as we always do.
[00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:08.800]   But some exciting new stuff, some interesting trends.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.760]   Go ahead.
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:16.040]   >> And just the, I too am a gamer, although I suck at games.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.040]   It's a huge part.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:21.320]   It is explicitly my hobby, like I'm not working if I'm playing games.
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:26.040]   And it's been fascinating to watch games, both pioneer some of the spaces that we've
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.440]   talked about, specifically social hooks.
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.680]   I mean, in social mechanics, they figured out long before social media, cyber security
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:37.120]   and cyber defense game, the game industry had to pioneer these things.
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:40.480]   And they're now kind of following the SAS model.
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:45.120]   And it's interesting to see the games industry take a page out of the services book and really
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:51.680]   transition almost every major publisher has transitioned from releasing standalone products
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:58.680]   and single player products over the last decade to these always on service models.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:03.880]   And whether you, gamers, I know are very vocal with their opinions, especially on Reddit.
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:08.920]   But whether you love this or hate this, it really has represented this kind of massive
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:13.560]   sea change that's happened in a multi-billion dollar industry that the mainstream media
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.360]   has kind of turned a blind eye to.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.360]   >> It's interesting.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.360]   >> Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.360]   >> Go ahead.
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.840]   >> I was just gonna say, this is very true.
[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.600]   And that's one of the big trends coming out of the show that I noted as well, that this
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:31.440]   sort of destiny-ification of game, Destiny was a game a few years ago that was this always
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:35.640]   on service that Bungie did for Activision and has been a big success for them.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.880]   And it just seems like in the wake of that, we're now seeing the games that fall.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:43.440]   Suit Anthem, Fallout 76 is Fallout, Destiny-ified.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:52.080]   And it really only Sony is the big publisher that's still front and center with single-player
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.560]   playable offline games.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:24:02.240]   I mean, their slate this year was Ghost of Tsushima, Spider-Man, Last of Us 2, Death Stranding.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.920]   Those are the big four that they showed, Days Gone was another one.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:12.600]   Single single player, narrative driven experiences, traditional what we think of as big AAA video
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.600]   games.
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:22.200]   But everybody else, everybody else is focused on much more games of service, perpetual,
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.760]   always updated.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:27.920]   We can sell you one thing, then we can sell you at 100 more times with cosmetics and with
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.240]   DLC content coming down the line.
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:34.520]   And you're seeing that over and over and over again of these looter shooters as they call
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.880]   them where you get a bunch of loot and you're shooting stuff.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:44.280]   Many games dominated E3 big AAA games that are doing that and looking to make that kind
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.280]   of money.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:53.480]   Think about Red Dead as this crazy hybrid of, I mean, Taitu made bank on the social mechanics
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:25:00.520]   of this nickel and diming of Grand Theft Auto 5.
[00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:06.600]   And they also have a linear single person story and they're, took what they learned from that
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.320]   and are applying it to Red Dead Redemption, which is right now at least a PlayStation
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.320]   exclusive.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:17.320]   So Sony exclusive, it is a single player game with all of this massive multiplayer stuff
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.320]   attached to it.
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:19.320]   Red Dead is not an exclusive.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.120]   Oh, if not, Red Dead is multiplayer.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.520]   It's gonna be Xbox as well as PlayStation.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.520]   And is it?
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:27.520]   I stand corrected, interesting.
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:28.520]   Does Xbox still exist?
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:29.520]   Hey!
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:34.160]   That's the only reason I know it's gonna be on Xbox because I have one.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.840]   Here's a war it's gonna be.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.120]   I mean, that's obviously Microsoft exclusive.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.680]   I think this is a really concerning trend for the industry.
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:47.680]   I do understand because being a game developer, I want to tell you, developing games is more
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.400]   expensive than I think people understand.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.840]   It's really, it's really Hollywood movie level at this point.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:53.840]   It really is.
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:57.960]   Everyone's games were talking about, they cost over $100 million to make.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:03.560]   Every time I add a character to one of my games, that's gonna cost me $20,000 to model
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.960]   the character and get a rig and the texture job and all of that.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:11.000]   And by the way, that's where Jeff Kanata shines as president.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.560]   Yes, exactly.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.560]   No.
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.400]   Did you model Jeff Kanata for the president or just use his voice?
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.400]   We didn't.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.040]   He was just over for a bunch of times.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.040]   What game was that?
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.040]   Yes.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.040]   Revolution's next to you.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.040]   It was the last one I shopped.
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:32.280]   But I want to say I was so frustrated to see this trend fall to the, really the king of
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:35.120]   single player experiences, Bioware.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:42.120]   Like no one out there that loves Bioware titles, loves Mass Effect, loves Dragon Age.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:46.800]   None of us buy those games because we like Destiny shooters.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:53.480]   And it was so frustrating to see Bioware's next big IP and thumb just basically be a
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:58.280]   Bioware version of Destiny, which by the way has the worst story of any game that's ever shipped
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.040]   to start industry.
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:05.440]   And it's a really, I understand the finances of it because if you get someone keeping your
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:09.760]   game for a long time and interacting with your game for a long time, they're not gonna
[00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.440]   sell that game back.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.720]   They're gonna keep doing enough purchases.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.080]   I understand it.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:21.920]   But I don't feel like I'm the only person that when I play games at the end of the day,
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.000]   a lot of the time I don't want to be social.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.880]   I just want to kind of go into my own world and recharge.
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.320]   So yeah, but you're a star citizen for a second.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.080]   All right, go ahead.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.400]   I feel so left out here.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.920]   I don't know any of this stuff.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.720]   No, this is good for me.
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:41.200]   This is I mean, this is fascinating and it's fascinating as as I thought it was pretty hip
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:42.840]   because I played Fortnite once.
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:43.840]   So I'm.
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:45.560]   Oh, yeah, that's the hippest you can be Leo.
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:46.560]   I know I'm in it.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.000]   I'm with the cool kids.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   Fortnite actually is funny because it is an MMORPG.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.480]   But I guess I mean, it's not really not a battle royale.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:59.240]   But it's a massively multiplayer game and massively with a hundred people.
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.520]   It's a multiplayer game.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:05.320]   All right, it's online, but I get killed almost instantly, but I still watch the rest
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.320]   of the game.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.720]   It's actually I think it's doing well for esports for that reason.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.280]   It's a fun game to watch, which is an interesting thing.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.280]   Go ahead.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.720]   A million dollar investment from Epic to make it an e-sports.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.720]   That's pretty big too.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:18.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:23.160]   And that's a game that made $270 million in April.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.840]   And they're making a million and a half dollars a day on iOS alone.
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.240]   And it's a free game.
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:29.960]   Yeah, this is what baffles me.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:30.960]   But go ahead.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.080]   Continue on with your thought, Dan.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.080]   No, no.
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.080]   Fortnite fascinating.
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.080]   Yeah, we'll get to Fortnite.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.600]   What game did you want me to show here?
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.880]   Because I'm I'm still showing anthem.
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:44.320]   So what's fascinating, Jeff and Brianna, I'm sure that you're familiar with the story
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.320]   here.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:50.720]   Star Citizen has raised well over $180 million in crowdfunding starting in 2012.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.120]   And I mean, the product, there is no product.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:59.000]   You can download something that's extraordinarily clugey at best.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.880]   And they sell virtual ships for $27,000.
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:02.880]   What?
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.200]   There's not even a game yet.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:07.200]   Yes.
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:11.120]   So what's fascinating is the fallacy of sunk cost.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:15.160]   And this game is a business model where the business model is vaporware.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.600]   Wow, that's really wild.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:23.280]   Although I seem to remember Duke Nukem Forever taking a while to come out.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.280]   That's true.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.840]   Nothing really new in that.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:27.840]   But they but you are.
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.640]   But you are citizen is a is a unique case, though.
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.880]   I don't I don't know if there's anything else quite like it.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:36.960]   There's a lot of failed Kickstarter's and a lot of early access games that are sort
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:37.960]   of meandering.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.880]   But there's nothing on the scale of star citizen.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:47.000]   So I think it's it's an interesting thing to watch because, you know, will it ever be
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.240]   anything is a great question.
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:53.400]   But and certainly there have been lawsuits there are ongoing ongoing litigation.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.720]   So I can for $45.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:58.480]   I can buy the Mustang Alpha spaceship.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:06.120]   Yeah, I think there's a $20,000 pack where you can get almost all of the ships.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.120]   Okay.
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.840]   27, you know, 27.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:09.840]   And then the game is an alpha.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.160]   You shouldn't expect all of the ships.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.680]   It's an alpha version three.
[00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.240]   Is that correct?
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.640]   Can you play a game?
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:17.640]   There are modules.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.080]   So there's different modules available for it.
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:24.160]   Now it's kind of broken up into parts and they say that those modules will all come together
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.160]   to be a cohesive game.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:29.400]   They're sort of a first person shooter, you know, human being on the on, you know, in
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.000]   space shooting things.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.120]   There's a spaceship ship to ship combat situation.
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:38.080]   And then there's sort of a trading intergalactic layer.
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:42.280]   So all those modules are playable now if you if you give them money, but none of them
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.280]   are playable.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:47.160]   Yeah, I mean, I've downloaded it and tried.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.960]   Yeah, no, I haven't.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.800]   But I know several people that are very invested in the game.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.800]   Yeah, I'm waiting for it to be a thing before I, you know, I give it a shot.
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.600]   Well, that's what this is what's interesting to me.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:04.880]   So, Brianna, you're as the developer here, you're saying $100 million to make a game.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:09.840]   But I mean, unless you're EA or you've got somebody like that behind you, this may be
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:15.000]   the only route you could make a A-list game, right, is to crowd fund it.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.720]   And it's going to be slow.
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.600]   How do you address this with your company?
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:26.400]   Well, I mean, you know, for us, we took the Apple approach that we just kept our heads
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.600]   down and didn't release anything until it was perfect.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:35.520]   Like at One Pack ceased, we got a lot of really negative feedback and about combat being
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.520]   too slow.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:41.640]   And we took it, we massively redid all of our scenes and made huge changes to it.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:45.320]   We personally didn't ship games until it was ready.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.640]   That's always been my motto.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:52.520]   There are a lot of people, I personally hate this trend of releasing games like while they're
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.160]   still in development.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:32:01.520]   I think for Nintendo, releasing a game to make sure the network has cohesion, like with Splatoon,
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:05.360]   that makes sense to me because, you know, we all remember, ultimately, online when that
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:08.720]   shipped, it was just impossible to lock on for days.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.560]   You know, avoiding that makes sense to me.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.120]   I personally don't like this.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:18.480]   And I think it really takes away the magic of turning on a game and just having an experience
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.800]   is already ready for you.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.240]   But how do you raise the money then to do this?
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.640]   Where does, how do you fight?
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:27.560]   That's an open question in the game industry, right?
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:32.000]   Like I would have to say for anyone, Jeff, you're a huge VR proponent.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.160]   I love reading your stuff on Twitter about that.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:39.280]   But as far as being a good venture capital bet, you know, venture capital funding, independent
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:44.520]   funding for VR has really, really severely dried up in the last year because it's just
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:46.880]   not possible to make money from it.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.480]   That's pressure that our whole industry is feeling.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:53.560]   That's interesting because you haven't seen a lot of great VR titles that was a burst
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:57.160]   when the Oculus Rift and the Vive came out and it seemed to be kind of more abundant
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.160]   to be frank.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.520]   I don't think a Oculus Go.
[00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:02.960]   We were just playing with it yesterday.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:03.880]   I was very impressed.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:10.360]   I think it's a, I think for 200 bucks as a standalone VR, it's actually not bad.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:14.120]   I have a rift and a Vive and the Go is, you know, not bad.
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:16.480]   This is missing some of the motion components.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.680]   But I think it's going to be a way to introduce people to it.
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.880]   But I wonder if there's a market.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.360]   Jeff, do you think there's a market?
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:26.640]   Do you think people are going to run out and buy VR headsets or have people on the side?
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:30.040]   I feel like they've decided already and they've decided against it.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:34.640]   I think a lot of people have and I think they are going to end up changing their mind,
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.400]   just like people did with smartphones and whatever.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:42.560]   I think, I think my kid who is about to turn two will think it's weird that I played games
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:44.160]   on a 2D flat surface.
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.240]   I think he will think it's weird.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:51.720]   And so we're just in early days and I think once Apple enters this market, which they will,
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.000]   everybody will change their tune.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.240]   I really believe that VR is- Wow.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.920]   I completely disagree with you, but I'm not an expert.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:03.560]   So I'm going to have to listen to what you say, but I feel like VR is dead.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:06.280]   I think it is not dead.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:10.720]   I mean, Sony showed a pretty strong library of new VR stuff.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:11.720]   They're committed to PSVR.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:13.960]   PSVR is selling really well.
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.200]   They announced another price drop.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:19.240]   I thought Sony didn't announce anything in PSVR.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:22.760]   Their press conference didn't feature it, but they had a whole week running up to it
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:26.800]   where they announced Tetris and VR Leo called Tetris Effect.
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:33.840]   The world is waiting for- It's actually really cleverly.
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:35.120]   Is the Switch the future?
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:38.160]   If it's not VR, and is there Switch 2 coming?
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.960]   I mean, is it like low tech high tech?
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:46.480]   Switch is done very well, but I wonder if these new streaming solutions, Sony has Geikai,
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:49.920]   but Microsoft says, "Yeah, we're working on a streaming solution."
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:54.480]   And EA has one that says, "They said anybody who can run Netflix will be able to run our
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:58.720]   high quality gaming on any device that can run Netflix."
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.240]   I wonder if that might not be.
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:05.440]   It's pretty clear that's a big push in where the industry is going as well, and we're still
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.440]   a couple of years away from that, it seems.
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.120]   Everybody's talking about it, but the infrastructure doesn't seem to be in place yet.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.320]   Microsoft is like, "We definitely have this.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.320]   It's coming."
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:17.320]   But nobody's ready to roll it out.
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.120]   What happened to online and Geikai?
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.120]   I mean, there are some-
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:23.040]   Yeah, I think everybody's a little nervous about that precedent.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.040]   And so I think when they do it, they'll want to do it right.
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:30.640]   And I think that will be a big difference instead of having to spend $3, $4, $500 to
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:36.480]   buy your new box that you put in your house that you will pay a monthly fee, and you'll
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.640]   be able to play these big AAA games on any device you have.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:46.160]   I do the Xbox Game Pass, which is basically for the cost of one or two games a year, I
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:50.600]   get- I did it when Sea of Thieves came out on it just because- and I'm glad I did, by
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.760]   the way, because it was a terrible game.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.400]   So now you're paying for it every month?
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.480]   Now I'm paying for it every month, so that's a good thing.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:03.200]   But if they put the debut titles out on a day in date of the release, that's going to
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.960]   be a very good way to go.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:05.960]   And they are.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.640]   Yeah, Microsoft had a big showing for Game Pass.
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:13.440]   And it's their $10 month service where every first party title in Microsoft's stable will
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.000]   be day and day on that.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.240]   And a rotating extra 100 games that you get and you can download and play.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.480]   But again, these aren't streaming, right?
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.480]   These are- you download them to your service.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.480]   Yeah, they're real games.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.480]   Right.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.240]   They announced a new thing called Fast Start, where it actually will- you can download- you
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.800]   can start playing it faster than you would normally because it's using AI.
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.480]   It's kind of like Spotify for gaming.
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.960]   You get the game, but if you stop paying, you don't- you lose it immediately.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:37.960]   Correct.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.960]   So it's clear that what's happening with-
[00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.960]   Okay, hold on a second.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:41.960]   There's no other way to do that.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:45.280]   It's clear, though, that what's really happening is that people are looking at mobile and saying,
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.800]   "Look, all the gaming is going to casual mobile."
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.560]   So we've got to somehow respond to that.
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:53.120]   And that's what these streaming solutions are, obviously.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:59.320]   I think what you're seeing is that just like with films, people want to watch them on everything,
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.320]   want to play them on everything.
[00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.320]   Oh, maybe that's it.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.400]   It's not that it's all going to mobile.
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.560]   It's that we also want it to be on mobile.
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:09.120]   So sometimes you watch a movie at home on your big screen and sometimes you watch it, you
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:12.600]   know, on the train on your- people still take trains, right?
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.600]   On your-
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.600]   Yes.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:15.600]   On your phone?
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:19.920]   So the idea here is that you disconnect the experience with the device that you're watching
[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.280]   it on and it can just be on everything all the time.
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:26.200]   And you're already seeing that with Fortnite, which was just announced and released on Switch
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:29.840]   at E3, but it's also available on mobile and it's also available on all these other platforms.
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.760]   It does very well on mobile, too.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.680]   And those are bespoke titles, right?
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:37.480]   You have to actually get each one and at a certain point that will not be the case.
[00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:42.480]   You'll just buy the game and then whatever device you want to put it on, it'll work.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.920]   Sorry, but that does.
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:47.120]   That also has a very specific art style for it.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.920]   Like I look at Fortnite, it's a beautiful game.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:54.880]   It's well animated by C. Very- there's now subsurface scattering shading on the skin.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:59.520]   It's not a particularly technically complex game, which is why they can throw it on the
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.520]   Switch and-
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.520]   But it beat PUBG?
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.520]   It beat PUBG, right?
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:07.640]   Geez, frame rates were so bad because it was all of that.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:08.640]   Absolutely.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.640]   People chose it.
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:13.560]   The idea here being that with the streaming service like Netflix, all the rendering will
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:19.440]   be done on big beefy computers in the cloud and you'll just get the image sent to your
[00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.440]   phone.
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:24.880]   So your phone really won't have to do all the heavy lifting of rendering the graphics
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.440]   or even any of the AI processing, any of it.
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:32.960]   The game will all be handled remotely and you'll just be getting the frames sent to
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:33.960]   you.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:36.280]   You'll have an IoT downstream unit.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.280]   Right.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:40.000]   Street Fighter 30th edition came out this week.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.800]   I've played a lot of Street Fighter.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:46.600]   I've spent 30 years working on my Street Fighter skills.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:51.280]   And yeah, I won't even play with the wireless controller for Street Fighter because that
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:56.400]   gives that little bit of lag and inputs for playing people competitively.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:00.960]   If you're talking about like then the round trip between a server center and your computer
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:05.080]   and the lag on top of that because so many of these games are competitive.
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:09.200]   Gears of War, you know, PUG, you know, Fortnite.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.320]   I am unsold on this being the future.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.200]   We try it with OnLive.
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.320]   You know, Sony has been offering this for years.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.600]   If I remember correctly, they bought all the patents for OnLive.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:25.720]   Sony did and then tried to turn it into we're going to sell the entire PS2 catalog.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.760]   When you play those games, they're blurry.
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.760]   There's lag.
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.560]   The DLC doesn't work correctly.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:33.800]   I'm not sold on that future.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:36.240]   I mean, your camp is well, Brianna.
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:40.480]   I'm old enough to want my games rendered locally.
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:43.120]   But people said the exact same thing about movies.
[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.120]   They really did.
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:48.280]   They said, "Why would I want that I can get this beautiful version on a disc and it's
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:51.840]   exquisite and I don't have it's lossless and all this stuff."
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:54.080]   And people don't care.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:40:00.520]   Yeah, I think that there is the gaming industry, especially over the last decade, has been
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:07.720]   an industry that in transition where it once catered to gamers who Brianna, I'm in your
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:10.200]   camp, especially when it comes to competitive games.
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:13.080]   I want a lag-free experience.
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:19.880]   But the market of us versus the market of like Leo said, mobile or casual gamers, I
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:24.840]   think that it is orders of magnitude larger and the industry is looking at the bottom
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:25.840]   line.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:30.480]   And especially because so many of these companies, the publishers are public companies.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:34.120]   They're really looking at their bottom line and they're looking at the market and the
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:38.600]   ability to capture a market that was not previously gamers and didn't think of themselves
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:44.680]   as gamers and to transition these people is in capture this audience is far easier than
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:51.880]   it is to, like we've said in this conversation, super serve a market that's already there
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:57.200]   that may have very specific niches of things that they want, but they're simply as high
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:00.240]   overhead, low return on that investment.
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:05.040]   So I think to underscore that point, sorry, to understand that I was just going to reaffirm
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.040]   what you said.
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:11.960]   Yeah, the market is just much larger for people who care not about milliseconds of lag.
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:20.240]   Yeah, and Leo brought up the fact that Fortnite has overtaken PUBG as far as the battle royale,
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.680]   the global battle royale of choice.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:28.200]   And there's a lot of reasons for that, but a very not insignificant one is the fact that
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.960]   Fortnite's free.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:36.200]   And I think driving costs down is a huge factor in opening these experiences up.
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:40.440]   And as I said, if you're having a situation where in order to render a game, you need
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:49.440]   a three, four, $500 box in your house or heaven forbid a one to $3,000 PC, you compare
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:53.960]   that to a device you already have because it's your phone or your whatever.
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:58.960]   And you don't really care how powerful it is because all of that is handled in the cloud
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.360]   and it's just sent to you.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:05.840]   It expands that audience exponentially because people are just able to not have to worry about
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:09.400]   investing in the device that plays the game.
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:13.760]   We used to say that adult content drove technology.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:18.160]   I think it's pretty clear that in the last 10 years, it's actually gaming that has driven
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.960]   gaming hardware.
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.680]   It's driven new economic models.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.480]   AI has driven the cloud has driven AI.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:28.040]   And one of the things as an outsider, I'm not a casual gamer, but as an outsider, one
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:33.560]   of the things that's clear to me is that gaming is an incredibly diverse market.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:38.840]   I mean, if you just listen to this conversation, there are initiatives going in a lot of different
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.280]   areas.
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:45.160]   And I don't think anybody knows if VR is going to be the next big thing or if streaming games
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:48.840]   are going to be the next big thing or battle royale is going to be the next.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:52.560]   I mean, Fortnite came out of nowhere.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:55.400]   Everybody thought PUBG was going to be the next big thing.
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:58.600]   And the long comes this game that was fairly weak.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:04.000]   And they said, well, we could do a battle royale and give it away and make all our money
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.480]   in digital goods.
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:10.480]   It's really, I think it's very difficult to, I don't envy you, Jeff and people who have
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:15.560]   to cover gaming because it is an incredibly diverse field.
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:17.320]   It's not one thing at all.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:23.520]   No, and you have increasingly, you have these deeper and deeper niches that are in greater
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:24.520]   time.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.600]   Yeah, console people don't care what PC people think, right?
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:29.240]   Well, it's more, I think it's even more specific than that.
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.560]   It's not really even console versus PC anymore.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.880]   It's I'm a League of Legends player.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:35.960]   Yeah, you're either overcast before that.
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.880]   Who cares about the other guy?
[00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:38.880]   Exactly.
[00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:39.880]   What do you have to do with the League of Legends?
[00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:41.400]   Is it still popular?
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.400]   Oh, for hugely.
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.400]   Yes.
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:49.480]   But I did a stream recently with, you know, that I was hosting with some of the biggest
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.480]   League of Legends streamers.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.480]   They were competing.
[00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:53.480]   This was a year or so ago.
[00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:57.640]   And these guys, the whole, the whole gimmick for this stream was that we were going to
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:00.960]   make them play games that aren't League of Legends.
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:05.040]   And they just had a no interest and be no knowledge of any.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.040]   They weren't video gamers.
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.040]   They were video games.
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:09.480]   They were League of Legends players.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:15.600]   And that's an increasingly strong distinction of people who just play Fortnite or just play
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:19.760]   whatever that particular game is because the games are deep enough, the experiences
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.920]   are perpetual enough that they can do that.
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:27.000]   And the audiences for those things, you can make a living just streaming one particular
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.520]   game and getting very, very deep into it.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:37.080]   And the skill set that you need to be a top level player in those fields, it precludes
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:40.320]   you from playing anything else because you have to spend so much time perfecting your
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:41.320]   skills.
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:48.200]   I did watch on Microsoft's mixer, the Fortnite Pro Am.
[00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:51.400]   And I have to say it was quite engaging.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:55.440]   Nick, who of course is very well known streamer on Twitch.tv.
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:45:02.120]   He's actually streamed with Drake and DJ Marshmello, who is a, I'm told, I couldn't figure out
[00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:04.040]   why he was wearing that hat.
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:09.640]   What I'm told is an EDM superstar and YouTube superstar won a million dollars for charity.
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:13.720]   It was a three million dollar purse in this event.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:17.440]   That opened my eyes somewhat.
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:18.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:20.600]   You know, that's a lot of money.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:21.600]   And I don't know.
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:30.920]   Epic has set aside a hundred million dollars over the next year to make Fortnite into an
[00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:35.240]   E-Sport that's a hundred million dollar prize purse that's going to be distributed over
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.240]   multiple events.
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.240]   We don't know how many events yet.
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.000]   We don't know how that money is going to be given out.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   But a hundred million dollars to give away as prizes to entice E-sports players to play
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   Fortnite.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:54.560]   Now, if you look at the next 20 E-sports, League of Legends, Dota, whatever, whatever,
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:59.680]   anything you want, Counter Strike, anything, the biggest stuff.
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:02.360]   And you add up all the prize purses over a year.
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:04.160]   They don't make a hundred million dollars.
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.400]   The next 20 games.
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.400]   So it is a huge initiative.
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.080]   Fortnite is dominating the world right now.
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:16.800]   And it will only be more so because casual players and professionals who want to make
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:20.240]   that money are going to be focusing very intently on this game.
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:21.240]   Let me play.
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:24.520]   This is the last few seconds of the game in Fortnite.
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:28.560]   And I watched the entire final battle royale in its entirety.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.800]   And I actually really enjoyed it.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:31.120]   Let me see if I can get it to play.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.960]   And no, I can't, unfortunately.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:39.640]   But it was as engaging as watching the last few minutes of the Super Bowl or the NBA finals,
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:41.080]   it was really engaging.
[00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:42.960]   It was really fun.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:46.800]   And it kind of turned me around because I thought E-sports, no, nobody wants to watch
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:47.800]   people play.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.520]   They want to play.
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:52.360]   But Fortnite has turned me around a little bit.
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:53.360]   I can see the...
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:59.040]   On the way, another thing that people are doing apparently is watching the World Cup on PSVR.
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.040]   Yeah, baby.
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:03.080]   Have you tried that?
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:04.080]   I haven't yet.
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.680]   I'm anxious to try it.
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:08.840]   I have CBC streaming in virtual reality.
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:12.120]   I mean, again, we're in early days, right?
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:18.840]   The visual fidelity of these headsets is when you watch a video is still a little disappointing.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:20.800]   You get some graininess.
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:22.080]   It's not great.
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:28.400]   But it's improving with PS, the Vive Pro and the new Samsung headset have higher resolutions.
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.560]   And I think we're going to see that trend continue.
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:35.200]   And I'm very bullish on VR, have been for a long time.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:41.720]   I think that when people try VR, it is a special technology that I think is a completely
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:45.680]   different kind of way to engage with an interactive experience than anything else.
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:51.000]   And I think that there was a lot of energy, as you guys have mentioned, around it when
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.520]   it sort of was launching.
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:53.600]   And that is waned.
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:56.800]   And I certainly agree that it has waned.
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:01.120]   But I think as the technology improves and some of this rough stuff gets ironed out and
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:06.560]   bigger players get in the game, I think you're going to find in five, ten years that VR
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:08.960]   is massive and AR, even more than VR.
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.640]   People distinguish between the two and I don't.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.120]   Yeah, that's where I disagree with the job.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:17.280]   I do think, I think AR is going to be what catches on eventually.
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:23.360]   Because for me, it's like I would love to see my Twitter feed or my email or all that
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:24.360]   stuff.
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:25.880]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:30.040]   That's something I can use all day long, gang information around me.
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.320]   AR games have huge potential.
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:35.760]   We have only begun to begin, think about it.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:38.200]   VR just closes you off so much.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.120]   It brings up the nausea problem.
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:45.040]   It brings up the, you know, it limits your gameplay because you have to have that teleport
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:49.360]   mechanic because your eyes and your inner ear aren't seeing the same thing.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:53.960]   I think when Apple comes out with that product, it's going to be far closer to HoloLens.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:55.720]   Yeah, I think they're doing AR.
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.080]   I wonder if they're doing VR.
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:48:59.080]   Yeah, I think they are.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.080]   I think they are.
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:01.080]   I think they are.
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.080]   I think they are.
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:03.080]   I think they are.
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:04.080]   I think they are.
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:05.080]   I think they are.
[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:06.080]   I think they are.
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:07.080]   I think they are terms interchangeably and I shouldn't.
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:10.080]   But when I say VR is the future, I mean this.
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.080]   Oh, I will correct VR.
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:12.080]   I will correct VR.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:13.080]   Augmented reality for sure.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.080]   Because it eliminates the nausea problem you're seeing the real world in addition to overlays.
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:17.280]   It has lots of very practical uses.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:20.520]   I think AR we played with another AR headset.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:25.120]   How much was that headset yesterday that we played with Dream World?
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:28.440]   It was, I think two or three hundred bucks, but it was very much like HoloLens except
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:30.080]   it had a full field of view.
[00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.080]   It's very impressive.
[00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:32.800]   I think we're coming along with AR.
[00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.840]   And yeah, I would expect Apple will do it when they can make something that's a little
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:39.360]   bit more compact than today's VR headset.
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:43.560]   And I, again, like I said, I shouldn't conflate the two terms because they are distinct.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:49.440]   But I do think that the future is AR with VR capabilities and video games will still
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.800]   be mostly in the VR space.
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:57.200]   I think you'll still want this world to go away and a new world to replace it for fun.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:01.840]   And I think that you'll, that will be the way my kid will experience most of his digital
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:02.840]   entertainment.
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:03.840]   That's how it comes down to it.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:08.360]   I think that's going to come down to quality and somehow solving the nausea factor.
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:13.520]   And there definitely will always be a market for, and we've all talked about it.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:17.600]   But for the, we want some sort of escapism at some point.
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:22.520]   I just think that market is a fraction of what the AR market represents.
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:28.640]   I have a question for all three of you guys about Microsoft.
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:32.640]   You know, the HoloLens, I tried that in 2015 and it doesn't seem to, to have made much
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:34.200]   change since it's a sense.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:40.240]   It doesn't seem to change, but Microsoft has and Microsoft has made some tremendous investments
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:44.120]   in the last couple of years, especially with their acquisition of LinkedIn, their acquisition
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.680]   of GitHub.
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:52.200]   And I know, I doubt this will happen, but Brianna and Jeff and Leo too, I'd love your speculation
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:53.200]   on this.
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:56.280]   There's been a lot of rumors about Microsoft buying steam.
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:51:02.040]   I don't know that I buy that, but I could see their emphasis, again, not to mock a bomber
[00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:07.040]   with developers, developers, developers, but when we're having conversations about AR,
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:13.920]   especially when we think about the HoloLens and all of these emerging technologies, IoT,
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:21.440]   big data, artificial intelligence, I could really see Microsoft buying steam, not to acquire
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:27.720]   the game platform, but to, to ingratiate or buy the next generation of developers who
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:30.880]   might create content to populate AR systems.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:32.680]   What do you guys think about that?
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:38.560]   Well, there was a lot of sort of, a lot of hula-blue, I don't know, four, six months
[00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:46.440]   ago, somebody on a very well-known video game website wrote an article speculating that
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:47.760]   would be a good move from Microsoft.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:50.840]   And it turned into this whole thing, it kind of snowballed and it actually affected the
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:52.360]   stock price of companies.
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:54.160]   It was very odd.
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.320]   Pure speculation.
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:56.320]   Pure speculation.
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:03.680]   Now that E3, interestingly enough, and did announce five new studios that they have acquired
[00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:08.320]   to create first-party content for their platforms.
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:14.960]   So they are very much aware of needing to create exclusive content for their platforms,
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:20.080]   and they didn't have any of that to show, but they did announce these partnerships with
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:26.720]   some really actually very interesting developers that have made some really cool stuff.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:32.640]   But I think the idea of them buying Steam, I think it makes a lot of sense.
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:36.840]   That doesn't seem to be any indication that they're going to do that, but it would make
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:40.360]   sense on a certain level because Steam kind of owns the PC market.
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:45.920]   It's into kind of owns, but that doesn't get them what they really need, which is content.
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:46.920]   It would maybe-
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:49.360]   They bought three indie studios though, they announced that this week.
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:50.360]   Five.
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:52.240]   Five new indie studios.
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:59.200]   And the really strong studios are- many of them were already working on sort of pseudo
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:02.320]   first-party stuff, stuff that would be exclusive to the platform anyway.
[00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:08.520]   But some weren't, and I think it shows an understanding that that is what differentiates
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:14.360]   Sony as a platform right now from Microsoft, the PlayStation, is that Sony has really
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:16.040]   strong exclusive content.
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:21.320]   And Sony leaned into that very strongly at E3 this year.
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:29.000]   But as far as acquiring Valve or Steam or some variation of those two entities, Valve
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.120]   basically doesn't make games anymore.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:34.160]   They claim that they do and they have a new card game that's coming up based on-
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:36.000]   But they're a high-flow for indie developers.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:41.560]   And that's when I think about AR and I think about Apple, Apple already has a pipeline
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:44.120]   for indie developers and for major developers.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:49.640]   And if we're looking at 2019 at the earliest, maybe 2020 for an Apple AR product, I think,
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.960]   well, how does the rest of the industry compete?
[00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:56.000]   And that is with content and developers.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:01.440]   So that's one reason I think about a quiet Microsoft might want to acquire Valve.
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.440]   But you're absolutely right.
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:03.640]   This has all been speculative.
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:09.040]   I just think what is the pipeline to get content creators to create things?
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:11.040]   Because we've all had this conversation.
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:14.560]   VR has failed in large part.
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:18.280]   Not failed but has stuttered because of the lack of content.
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:22.680]   And this is something that will or could also kill AR.
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:27.600]   And so every major, major tech company has to be thinking about how do we populate our
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:30.840]   platforms with content and with talent?
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:34.600]   Well, I just feel like I need to say here.
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:38.640]   I want to take a step back and look at some of our assumptions here.
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:45.320]   Valve, I would say, increasingly has a toxic reputation with developers.
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:50.560]   And a lot of that reason is because rampant harassment of developers goes absolutely
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:52.600]   unchecked on that platform.
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:54.880]   Developers get rape threats, get death threats.
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:58.600]   I've certainly had that on Valve.
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:01.080]   There was actually some people in the hatred community.
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:06.520]   This was a mass murder simulator that came out a few years ago that were actually demanding
[00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:14.040]   to put specific women in the game industry into this game to kill as DLC for that.
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:17.080]   So I would say I think there's a cultural shift.
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:20.600]   I was at Microsoft Build just a few weeks ago.
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:29.240]   And what I see is a Microsoft that is increasingly fundamentally culturally different than what
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:36.120]   Valve has evolved into, which is this laissez-faire or anything goes kind of, you know, bonanza
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.520]   marketplace.
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:42.200]   And Valve should be ashamed for not taking responsibility after the active shooter game.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:48.360]   I don't like to usually get up on a high horse, but they have exploited for profit some of
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:52.840]   these really horrific, not just language, but threats.
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:53.840]   That's sad.
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:55.840]   That's really sad.
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:01.080]   I think what you're touching on, Briana, is that people don't think of themselves as
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:06.360]   gamers because they don't want to make heads explode in a shower of gore.
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:07.360]   Right.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:11.200]   And I think that's a really interesting point to bring up in regard to E3 because that is
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:13.240]   the front face of E3.
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:15.160]   It's not all first-person shooters, is there?
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:17.280]   They need to be careful about that.
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:19.840]   And I love a lot of very violent games.
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:25.680]   I'm not condemning those, you know, with a broad brush, but I do think that for the industry
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:31.920]   to broaden and to, you know, really take a cultural place that I think it deserves, that
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:39.840]   will, it will require this kind of event, E3, being more than just what's the next ultra
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:42.160]   violent thing that we can show people.
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:46.960]   And I actually believe VR will have a big place in that because while there's a lot of
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:49.920]   violent VR stuff, it's also a place for empathy.
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:50.920]   So yeah.
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:55.800]   I think what I worry about our industries is that the incentives are all upside down.
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:59.640]   Like we've seen the loot box structure take over because what you're talking about, Jeff,
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:04.320]   like free to play games, it brings people in and then people like me, like I will buy
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.000]   every loot box that comes out.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:10.440]   I've probably spent three or $400 on Gears of War.
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:18.320]   For, you know, the incentives don't really reward a game like Mass Effect as much today,
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:24.720]   which is a game about war and conflict and about the human cost of war and trauma.
[00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:28.360]   Like it's a really big game with some really ambitious themes.
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:33.920]   One of my very favorite games of all time is the Danganronpa series, which is essentially
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:37.320]   just a long visual novel about despair.
[00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:39.360]   Those are the things that...
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:41.160]   Can't wait to play that.
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:43.800]   It's really foreshadowed.
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:48.160]   Danganronpa came out and it's at the courts about a group of people that love despair
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.760]   and they want to inflict you on the entire world.
[00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:56.160]   And it's so contagious that they cause the world to turn in on itself.
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:58:01.840]   And it's about 16 students trapped in a school trying to murder each other, to escape.
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:04.480]   It's a really powerful story.
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.720]   But that's such a niche.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:11.120]   It's a very important game to me, but that's not what our industry is putting out as much
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:12.520]   as we used to.
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:16.720]   And that makes me sad because the financial incentives are just not there.
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:20.800]   And I will give Microsoft a lot of credit this year at E3 on their stage.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:25.120]   They gave a very significant amount of time to a very beautiful looking game called Sea
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:29.360]   of Solitude that is a game about a little girl on a boat.
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:32.120]   And it's touted as a game about loneliness.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:33.400]   This is a game about loneliness.
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:36.880]   Well, the Last of Us was pretty successful for Sony, wasn't it?
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:37.880]   Absolutely.
[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:39.520]   And Last of Us too had a big presence here.
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:42.120]   But again, that's ultra violent and dark.
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:45.720]   It very mature themes, very, I think, handled very well.
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:50.160]   Do you think gaming is a secret vice that people don't want to share?
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:53.200]   It's less and less.
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:54.200]   No.
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:57.000]   It's like I don't want to admit that I play those games.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.120]   You think that's part of it?
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:04.120]   We've found as I'm running for Congress that I have to say I'm a software engineer and
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:10.440]   not a game developer because it just, there's so many people that get really negative impression
[00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:17.600]   and nevertheless they're playing Candy Crush Saga or whatever it is on their mobile device.
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:18.600]   That's a gaming.
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:22.360]   Well, although I have to say gamers always say to me, you're not a gamer because I don't
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:24.200]   play whatever call a duty.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:30.000]   I mean, you're not a gamer if you don't play the game that noob, I'm a noob.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.200]   Minecraft, what's wrong with you?
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:36.920]   Yeah, that cultural stuff is garbage and needs to end too.
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:37.920]   And I think it will.
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:41.320]   I mean, the community is getting more diverse.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:42.520]   The games are getting more diverse.
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:44.960]   And it's a long way to go, long way to go.
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:50.960]   But I was encouraged by how many female protagonists were shown at E3.
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:55.960]   Good, it's not in the tight pants and the busty low cut.
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:58.960]   I mean, there was a little of that, but less and less.
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:01.360]   And I think it's baby steps unfortunately.
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:07.600]   But I'm hopeful that I'll tell you, I've been going to E3 since what?
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.960]   2004, 2003.
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:16.120]   And I look around and walking around and I see more females there than I have ever seen.
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:22.120]   And I think ultimately getting more people like Brianna making games and more diverse
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.280]   kinds of games being made.
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:28.360]   I think we're getting there and it's taking longer than it should.
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.360]   And I think there's a lot of room for improvement.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:36.360]   But I'm generally pretty optimistic about that.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:38.640]   Let's take a little break.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.600]   Now we can take a break and come back.
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:41.600]   It's great panel.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:42.600]   Branna Wu is here.
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.880]   She's running for Congress in the Massachusetts 8th District.
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:49.600]   Brianna Wu, 2018.com, if you want to support that, of course, SpaceCatGal and the game
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:50.600]   developer.
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:52.520]   I'm sorry, software developer.
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:53.520]   Software engineer.
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:56.240]   Software engineer.
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.080]   And always a pleasure to have her on.
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:04.520]   Dan Patterson from CBS Interactive, always a pleasure to senior writer for Tech Republic.
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:05.520]   Wonderful having you.
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.720]   And Jeff Kanata, I don't know why we don't have you on more often.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:09.400]   It seems like we only have you on during E3.
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.400]   We're going to have you on more often.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.400]   You're great.
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:16.880]   It does a couple of other podcasts, including DLC on the 5x5 network and with the vendor
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:19.000]   hardware to slash film.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   My favorite film podcast is a really great one.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   Thanks.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.360]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage.
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:27.720]   If you're buying a house, maybe you're going out and about looking for a new place.
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:30.840]   Or maybe you're refying the FEDGEST raids interest rates.
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:34.440]   That means and says they're probably going to go up again a couple more times this year.
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.880]   Might be a good time to refie.
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:36.880]   Let me tell you where to go.
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:38.480]   Quick and loans.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.920]   I think a lot of people already go there.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.160]   It's the number one lender in the country.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:44.560]   Not only number one in volume, number one in customer satisfaction.
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:48.840]   Year after year, according to JD Power.
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:50.160]   That says a lot about quick and loans.
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:55.440]   But I love them even more because they've reached out to the geek in all of us and created the
[01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:59.240]   first completely online mortgage approval process.
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:02.480]   You don't have to go get your pants on and go to the bank.
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.040]   You don't have to beg for money.
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.720]   You don't have to fill out a 20 page application.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.800]   You just fire up your browser.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:08.800]   You can do this on your phone.
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:09.800]   You could do this.
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:10.800]   It's fast enough.
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:13.840]   Get to an open house and get the loan before you leave.
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:16.840]   Rocket Mortgage.com/Twit2.
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:19.000]   Rocket Mortgage.com/Twit in the number two.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.720]   You answer a few simple questions.
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:25.160]   They will get all the information they need from their trusted partners with your permission,
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:26.560]   of course.
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:29.640]   Then they crunch the numbers based on income assets and credits.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:33.440]   In under 10 minutes, they're going to analyze all the home loan options for which you qualify
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:35.520]   and come back with the ones that are just right for you.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:39.280]   You choose the rate, the term, the down payment, and you're approved.
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.880]   Under 10 minutes in most cases.
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:43.040]   Now that is sweet.
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:46.840]   You could go to an open house, look at it, say, "Let's buy this place.
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.640]   Let's buy it and be approved."
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.360]   Show the realtor on your phone.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:53.560]   We're going to make it off for right now.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:57.080]   By the way, that's the secret in today's solar market.
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:59.920]   Rocket Mortgage from Quick and Loans applies simply.
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.320]   Understand fully mortgage confidently.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.080]   Rocket Mortgage.com/Twit and the number two.
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.080]   Twit2.
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.080]   They're an equal housing lender.
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:08.360]   They're licensed in all 50 states.
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:10.360]   Of course, they're going to analyze consumer access.org.
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.680]   30, 30.
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:15.280]   Rocket Mortgage.com/Twit2.
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:22.160]   We thank them so much for their support all this year of the network of this week in tech.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:25.680]   I was going to say I have an appointment at the bank tomorrow.
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:26.680]   Don't go to the bank.
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:27.680]   Look at a mortgage.
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:28.680]   No, I'm going to do some stuff.
[01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.520]   Okay, tonight, before you go to the bank, just do the rocket mortgage.
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:32.680]   We'll give that a look.
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:35.960]   At least you'll have numbers that you can say, "Well, this is what I can get from Quick
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:36.960]   and Loans.
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.960]   What do you offer?"
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:38.960]   No.
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:42.200]   Yeah, you know that's all the negotiation.
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:45.560]   So what made this such an exciting E3 for you?
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.040]   You said it was a really good one.
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:53.040]   Well, I think our industry has really moved forward.
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:57.720]   As Jeff was saying, I think we have a lot more women characters this year than we have
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:58.720]   traditionally.
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:04.920]   I thought it was really interesting to see how women in the game industry reacted to
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:08.080]   Cyberpunk 20, was it 20, 70, 70?
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.640]   We had Jessica Condit from Engadget on yesterday.
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:12.560]   She said she was so excited.
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.560]   What was that?
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:17.440]   It was like a great game, but it's also kind of hyper-sexualized in a way that kind of
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:21.440]   feels like they gave out this statue that's half-naked this year.
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:22.440]   Oh, Jessica.
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:26.240]   I think I thought it was very interesting to see women in the industry just kind of
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:30.360]   unanimously being like, "Yeah, you know what, we're good."
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:37.520]   Overall, last of us two that is going to star a lesbian character, I think that's a step
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:39.920]   forward for our industry.
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:44.960]   I just, we're finally seeing Kojima put out Death Stranding.
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:51.120]   He was fired from Konami under some really not great political circumstances and to see
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:54.600]   him coming back with one of the most interesting games of the show.
[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:56.080]   I think that's really good.
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.960]   Bloodstained is looking incredible.
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:02.160]   So, you know, I'll miss when he's sat in the ring for Congress because I want to play
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.160]   all these games.
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.760]   Well, once you get elected, you can do anything you want.
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:09.280]   You call that executive time.
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:10.280]   That's executive time.
[01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:11.280]   Yeah.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.280]   No, I'm kidding.
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.280]   Kidding.
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.960]   She's going to work very hard for all of us.
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:18.680]   No more gaming for the next few years for you, Brianna Wu.
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:19.680]   Everybody needs downtown.
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:20.680]   Yeah.
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:21.680]   No, that's true.
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:25.440]   Actually, in House of Cards, didn't he play Call of Duty?
[01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:26.440]   I think he did.
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:27.440]   Absolutely.
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:28.440]   That was really interesting.
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:35.360]   Here's an older guy, Vice President, playing Call of Duty.
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:40.320]   It kind of was in a way a mainstream acknowledgment that people play these games.
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:44.560]   And again, I think that's how they announced Monument Valley 2 also is through that show.
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:45.560]   That's right.
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:47.520]   I bet you that was a paid deal of some kind.
[01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:48.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:49.520]   Oh, I'm certain of it.
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.520]   Yeah.
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:55.200]   In fact, I saw a couple of mobile games get shown on House of Cards.
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.200]   All right.
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:05:59.120]   We can move on from gaming.
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:02.960]   This was a big week for content in other ways.
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:09.240]   Net neutrality fell and almost exactly at the same time on Monday, a judge ruled that
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:11.440]   AT&T could merge with Time Warner.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:14.560]   And by Friday, it was a done deal.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:22.200]   Comcast said, "Oh, and immediately made a $56 billion, I'm sorry, $65 billion bid for
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:23.440]   21st century Fox.
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:28.600]   They were waiting to see if the AT&T Time Warner merger went through."
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.800]   This is a bad nexus.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:31.800]   This is a bunch of...
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:35.200]   I thought Nielei Patel did a really good job on the verge.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:41.520]   He wrote that the court's decision to let AT&T and Time Warner merge is ridiculously
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.520]   bad.
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.520]   Yeah.
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:51.680]   And I think he made a very strong case that the judge seemed to confuse pipes platforms
[01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:54.120]   with content creators.
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:59.480]   And the judge, I understand the way law is written, says, "Oh, these are two independent
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.560]   vertical markets.
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:05.680]   There's no competitive issue here, so there's no reason they shouldn't merge."
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:11.200]   In fact, he had placed no restrictions on their merger, Richard Leon of the US District
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:15.840]   Court for District of Columbia.
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:22.120]   I have to say, I've been pointing all week, I've been pointing out that at one time the
[01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:26.160]   movie companies owned all the movie theaters.
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.840]   And it was clearly bad.
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:34.160]   There was no independent movie industry because you couldn't get it shown anywhere.
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:39.840]   And we as a nation decided that that wasn't a good thing and we broke them up.
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:43.640]   This is to me exactly the same thing with the companies that distribute content are now
[01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:45.960]   owning the companies that make content.
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.200]   And that's going to be bad for the independents.
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.200]   Yeah.
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:54.200]   You know, I realize I don't want to come in on Al Franken leaving the Senate.
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:55.440]   I think that's a whole thing.
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:01.040]   But if you read his book, "Giant of the Senate," he really talked very eloquently about his
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:07.320]   fight to end these giant media mergers about Comcast lying to the Senate in one hearing
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:13.320]   about some policies about offsetting their costs for lower income people and just completely
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:16.760]   making that up and not following through on it.
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.320]   You know, I think it's ridiculously anti-competitive.
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:25.840]   And the way I feel is when I get to Congress, I'm going to do everything in my power to break
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.160]   these giant companies up.
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:30.280]   And they just have too much power.
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:33.840]   If you look at the amount of money they're throwing into the system, it's bad.
[01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:35.920]   This is bad for United States innovation.
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.480]   It's bad for cybersecurity.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.800]   It's bad in every possible way.
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:42.240]   It could be bad, including consumers.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:47.560]   And this is only going to get better if you vote people in that care about you more than
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:50.680]   they care about accepting money from these companies.
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:53.680]   So some things fundamentally got to change.
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:58.320]   And America's not going to get better on this path we're on.
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:08:59.320]   Yeah.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:00.320]   600 grand on Michael Cohen.
[01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:03.000]   That's a pretty good return on investment.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.320]   It should also be noted.
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:09.640]   And I'll disclose my significant other works in the AG's office.
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:18.720]   But New York is leading 23 states in the Attorney General Underwood, Acting AG Underwood, is
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:19.960]   protesting this.
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:25.200]   And it's important to say the states are fighting this because we-
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:27.320]   You're talking about net neutrality.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:29.080]   Net neutrality, yeah.
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:33.200]   And the states have become the front line of defense for all of the reasons that you
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:34.520]   guys enumerated here.
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.920]   That this is bad for innovation.
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:40.320]   It's bad for big business and it's bad for independent business.
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:42.640]   And it's certainly bad for consumers.
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:46.600]   And to have the states stand up and say, "Hey, look, we're a part of the conversation."
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:52.080]   Two is incredibly important because this is yet another roadblock, or at least the states
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:56.400]   represent a roadblock to this rollback.
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:02.480]   It was really no coincidence that on Monday, both net neutrality ended and AT&T got the
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:04.000]   go-ahead to merge with Time Warner.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.800]   That's why I would say-
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:06.800]   Yeah.
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:10.440]   And Travis says on Twig, and he's, you know, a professional journalism has a lot of interest
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:15.280]   in this, that this is really just old companies, old line distribution and media companies,
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:20.160]   with their last gasp trying to hold on to the old business model.
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:27.840]   But I have to say, without net neutrality, when a company like AT&T owns a lot of content
[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:33.840]   and doesn't own other content, there's nothing to stop them from saying, "Well, we'll give
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:39.600]   you access to HBO for free, no bandwidth cost, but we're not going to charge you if you want
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:40.960]   to watch Netflix."
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:42.760]   That seems to me baldly anti-competitive.
[01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.960]   It hasn't happened yet, but I expect it will.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:50.840]   And they do it with zero rating, which is, you know, it's hard to explain to normal people
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:53.840]   why saving their money is a bad thing.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:54.840]   Yeah.
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:59.440]   Well, it doesn't even have to be consumer facing, at least to start, right?
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:05.600]   They can just have these shady deals between companies and start having to charge Netflix
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:06.600]   more.
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:13.920]   I mean, all of this stuff is really disheartening and really bad, and I don't know what we can
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:14.920]   do.
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:21.520]   You know, I'm hopeful we see Washington State as being a state that seems to be fighting
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:22.520]   this.
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:25.720]   California, I understand, is going to- There's 23 states.
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:26.720]   Yeah.
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:33.040]   I'm hopeful that within the borders of individual states, this stuff will take a hard line and
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:36.680]   will say, "Hey, we will still enforce net neutrality," but I can't imagine that's going
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:38.160]   to last.
[01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:40.400]   And if it's- I don't know.
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:46.400]   I feel like this is a very bleak moment for our digital future, to be honest.
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:50.400]   But I've said this on Twitter before, and I want to repeat this.
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:54.560]   This is not as hopeless as people may believe that it is.
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:12:00.840]   In the house where I am running for Congress, eight votes, eight votes, eight votes, run
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:06.160]   the table on all the technology policy there on a very specific committee.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:11.480]   And then in the Senate, it's 15 votes, run the table on all of that policy.
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:16.480]   So we don't have to get everyone in Congress to not take money from Verizon and AT&T.
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:22.520]   You just need to get enough of us that believe in these issues, running for Congress and
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:23.880]   serving on those committees.
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:28.280]   You can change privacy, you can change net neutrality, you can get right to repair in
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.600]   there, you can get right to encryption.
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:32.840]   There are all these issues that we care about.
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:37.800]   They're so critical for a free republic that we can make a difference with.
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:39.960]   But it's like, "I'm only one of eight votes.
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:44.640]   I need other people, other engineers, other tech cats to run for office with me."
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:48.680]   And believe me, I would so much rather be making software right now.
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:52.720]   But this is the time where we have to stand up and save our future.
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:54.200]   So it's inconvenient.
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:13:01.440]   After Twit last Sunday night, Jip Pai published an op-ed piece, a commentary on CNET, saying,
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.600]   "I support a free and open internet."
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:10.480]   He says, "You don't understand that if we don't change these rules, you're not going
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:13.920]   to get investment in a better and faster internet.
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:17.280]   You're not going to see the better access that you want.
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:25.120]   You're not going to see rural internet progress, that it's important to give these companies
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:29.120]   a free hand so that they do invest in an improved internet."
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:30.120]   Please.
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:32.720]   That's always worse than store.
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:33.720]   Please.
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:34.720]   Yeah.
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:39.440]   You know, net rural electrification only came because we mandated it.
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:41.600]   It's the exact same with the internet.
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.280]   We can solve that in other ways.
[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:48.440]   We can have tax incentives or a thousand other ways to solve that problem that don't involve
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:53.480]   giving these telecom companies free rein over information to this degree.
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:55.320]   So now, try again.
[01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:56.320]   Yeah.
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:59.000]   He says, "This approach will be very positive for consumers.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:04.320]   For instance, recently I heard from a rural broadband provider in Vermont, V-Tel, saying
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:08.000]   they wrote to say, "Regulating broadband like legacy telephone service would not create
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.560]   any incentives for V-Tel to invest in its network.
[01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:12.480]   It would have the opposite effect."
[01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:17.360]   I'm sure he's heard the same thing from AT&T and Comcast and Verizon.
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:22.000]   I don't have any faith that this dude even believes it.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.560]   He doesn't even...
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:24.560]   You're right.
[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:29.360]   You can feel that in the statement that he doesn't even believe what he's saying.
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:30.360]   It's this new poll.
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:31.360]   I don't know.
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:32.360]   I don't want to get angry.
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:36.760]   There's also a little bit of a lie that he's repeating that I keep hearing from people
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:44.720]   who are in favor of scrapping net neutrality that at the dawn of the Internet, Congress
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:48.120]   and Clinton agreed on a light touch framework.
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:50.720]   Under that approach, the Internet was open and free.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:53.040]   Network investment topped one and a half trillion.
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:58.200]   Netflix, Facebook, Amazon, and Google went from small startups to global tech giants.
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:59.720]   I hear this again and again.
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:01.960]   No, we're just going back to the way it used to be.
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:08.200]   The unregulated light touch Internet.
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:14.200]   You can sigh, but you've got to tell me why that's not true.
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:16.360]   This is a very predictable argument.
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:19.840]   They always push for lack of regulation.
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.840]   Look at Theranos.
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:23.080]   Theranos, rather.
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:25.440]   That book, Bad Blood, I've read that four times.
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:26.440]   Isn't this fascinating?
[01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:27.440]   It's hard to believe.
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.440]   What happened?
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:29.520]   It's hard to believe.
[01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:30.520]   It's hard to believe.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.680]   It's not hard to believe.
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:33.680]   We cover the tech.
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:34.680]   Come on.
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:38.880]   The only reason anything happened there is because we had basic regulations to protect
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:39.880]   people's health.
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:46.720]   I think in that same way, this laissez-faire approach to absolutely everything in technology,
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:52.840]   it's just not always the answer.
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:55.040]   We didn't have speed limits.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:58.360]   When cars first came around, so why have speed limits?
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:03.440]   There were no seat belts in a car when the Model T was first introduced.
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:07.520]   I don't know why you're so upset that we took all the seat belts out of the car.
[01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:09.880]   It's a completely different universe now.
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:10.880]   It's insulting.
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:16.440]   Facebook can say that about the election interference.
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:19.520]   We didn't have this when it first started.
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:22.760]   We have to look at systems as they are today.
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:26.560]   We don't look at what's best for AT&T and Verizon.
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.200]   They do business here in America.
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:31.640]   The question is, is this better for the American people?
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:33.480]   It's not.
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:37.920]   I think it's a Texas 2-step.
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:43.120]   All of this is yes, an eye on today, but also an eye on the future.
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:47.160]   Let's not forget that 5G is coming and coming somewhat fast.
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:53.240]   5G is a disruptive technology like we have not seen in mobile.
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:57.240]   If these companies are not able to control it in the way they want, it could fundamentally
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:59.920]   disrupt the way they operate now.
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:05.280]   Actually the 5G standard for the first time got somewhat ratified.
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:10.080]   The specifications were finalized this week.
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:15.240]   I'm not sure really, and I don't know if anybody is, what 5G means.
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:18.360]   It seems to mean different things to different people, even different things to different
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:20.000]   telcos.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:26.600]   But I think what we all want is a faster network that can handle more traffic.
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:33.320]   I think that's what 5G promises, even gigabit speeds, over wireless broadband.
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:36.200]   That would be pretty impressive.
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:42.160]   I guarantee you that's exactly what companies like Microsoft, Sony, and EA are looking at
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:44.200]   when they talk about streaming games.
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:45.400]   They're looking at the future where…
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:46.400]   100 percent.
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.400]   Absolutely.
[01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:52.240]   You can play Fortnite on your smartphone in the middle of a desert because you've got
[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:55.720]   5G.
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:56.720]   I'm ready for that future.
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.720]   I am too.
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:17:59.720]   I am too.
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:03.360]   Actually in the middle of the desert might be dovetail with the arguments you guys just
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:05.600]   made a moment ago, which is world of vacation.
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:10.600]   Although people who live in rural areas don't have the same voice that us in urban areas
[01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:13.920]   do, 5G could change that.
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:20.160]   That's why I'm wondering, maybe Pi is saying, "Look, we've got these new technologies."
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:23.000]   Now he is, in fact, saying we've got the new technologies coming along.
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.760]   We want people to invest in these.
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:30.360]   We need to see 5G coming and we don't feel like if we regulate the hell out of these
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:35.520]   ISPs, they're going to be incented to develop things like 5G.
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:37.240]   Except they are, obviously.
[01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:38.440]   Because they'll make money.
[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:39.440]   Yes.
[01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:40.440]   Right.
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:43.080]   Plus, why does this talk competition?
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:48.520]   I mean, on the way we're going, they won't.
[01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:53.120]   Yeah, in fact, that was a green light.
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:56.880]   The judges decision was a green light for Comcast to bid against Disney.
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:02.480]   They're both bidding for 21st century Fox.
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:07.040]   Not Fox News, but regional Fox Sports.
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:10.280]   I don't know.
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:11.640]   Sky I think is part of it.
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:13.880]   The other thing that's interesting is Hulu.
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:21.400]   It would give Comcast a 60% controlling interest in Hulu.
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:24.920]   That might, you might say, "Well, that really is these companies saying, 'Okay, we've got
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:28.480]   to recognize that the future is upon us and we need to be..."
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:33.360]   If we're going to succeed, Comcast can't succeed as a dumb pipe company.
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:35.880]   We've got to have some content to sell as well.
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:36.880]   Yeah.
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:37.880]   Content is king.
[01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:38.880]   Right.
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:43.640]   And controlling content and the ability to create new content based on owned IP is, I think,
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:45.640]   where everybody realizes their bread is buttered.
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:49.720]   So, yeah, it'll be interesting to see how this bidding war shakes out.
[01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:51.920]   Disney bid $52.4 billion.
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:57.360]   Now it's their turn to counter if they want or to give up and let Comcast get it.
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:03.480]   It includes 21st century Fox movie studios, the National Geographic and FX channel, Star
[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:10.000]   TV, Stakes in Sky and Hulu, as well as the regional sports networks.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:16.440]   But Comcast already owns NBC Universal, which is a movie company and NBC and MSNBC.
[01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:21.240]   It's interesting that two of the three big news, well, actually really all three big
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:30.360]   news channels are owned by these massive corporations, Comcast owns MSNBC, AT&T now on CNN and Fox
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:31.360]   is Fox.
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:32.360]   Yeah.
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:37.000]   It'll be interesting to see how much those channels actually are worth in the next five,
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   10, 15 years.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.800]   Do you think they're going to be disintermealing?
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:40.800]   Intermediated to you?
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:41.800]   I do.
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:42.800]   Your word.
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:43.800]   Yeah.
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:44.800]   Your word.
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:45.800]   My word, which you used.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:46.800]   I got it.
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.640]   I learned about watching you.
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:55.600]   But yeah, I think that's clearly the trend and maybe those channels are less channels and
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:56.600]   more branding.
[01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:02.280]   Like, you know what you're getting when you watch an MSNBC or a CNN or, you know,
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:08.920]   HGTV, for example, it's not so much the channel as it is a brand that now is valuable.
[01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:19.320]   One of Judge Leon's points, which is a little bizarre was now AT&T can take pieces of CNN,
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.800]   chop it up and put it on your phone.
[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:22.960]   Won't that be great?
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:24.520]   I think that's content.
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:25.520]   That's content.
[01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:26.960]   I think it's already happened.
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:29.560]   But okay, Judge, you know, welcome to the 20th.
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:34.240]   Well, I mean, I certainly can't speak for executives, but that is a huge component of
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:36.480]   our strategy at CBS News.
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:44.400]   If you go to CBS News.com/live, OTT is a significant, this is 24/7 always on and OTT is the strategy.
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.560]   It is the brand in the top.
[01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:50.960]   That's OTT and I am without going over cable or broadcast.
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:52.880]   Yeah, I'm sure that there's a cable presence.
[01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:57.920]   I have no, I don't know anything about it, but I know that the live stream, which is a
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:22:04.640]   24/7 live channel, news channel, they care far more about this, the streaming than a
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:08.960]   channel that you would select in the old days.
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:11.680]   There are, this is another New York story.
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:15.320]   I don't know if your wife is involved in this, but New York is threatening to revoke
[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:22.120]   charter's purchase of Time Warner Cable because they made promises, including network construction
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:26.240]   that they never completed in their New York State Public Service Commission ordered charter
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:32.000]   to pay $2 million in fines and finish that gosh darn network construction.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.360]   I mean, it really does show you, they don't care.
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:39.040]   They make promises, they don't care.
[01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:40.040]   Also shocking.
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:43.040]   Shocking, shocking, shocking.
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:45.320]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:52.000]   I just, not a lot of love lost for me for Comcast or AT&T or Verizon or any of these companies.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:58.480]   They don't really seem to care that much about consumers and they, Comcast for instance,
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:03.480]   used a throttling system.
[01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:05.200]   Remember when they said, oh, bandwidth hogs, remember those bandwidth hogs?
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:12.240]   After 2008, they turned on a bandwidth throttling system to block BitTorrent, they just disabled
[01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:13.400]   it.
[01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:17.840]   And John Brodkin on ours, Technica says it just proves that the data cap is just a money
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:18.840]   grab.
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:21.840]   There's no network congestion issue.
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:27.520]   They deployed their network congestion management solution after it was caught throttling BitTorrent
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:28.520]   traffic.
[01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:34.560]   Oh, by the way, that was back when, oh yeah, there wasn't that neutrality regulations.
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:39.000]   Comcast was throttling BitTorrent and the FCC said, you can't.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000]   Okay.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.240]   Gee, that free and open internet.
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:48.280]   News of Comcast disabling it came in a company announcement on Monday.
[01:23:48.280 --> 01:23:54.120]   Monday was a bad day for the internet.
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:24:00.040]   When ours Technica asked Comcast why it still imposes data caps now that it has no need
[01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:05.680]   for a congestion management system, they offered this statement, our network and consumer
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:11.000]   devices have evolved to a point that our old system is no longer necessary.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.240]   It's been inactive for more than a year.
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:18.000]   Well over 99% of our internet customers are using more modern gateways and modems so we
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.960]   don't have congestion on individual channels.
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:20.960]   It's not a problem.
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:21.960]   It fixed itself.
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:22.960]   It fixed itself.
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:23.960]   Yeah.
[01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:24.960]   Yeah.
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:30.400]   I hope by the way that Monday was a bad day for the internet is the title of this episode.
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:33.320]   It is kind of an evergreen tweet.
[01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:38.920]   Yeah, every Monday, yeah, bad day for the internet.
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:42.560]   How does your router even affect what you're downloading?
[01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:44.080]   That doesn't even make sense.
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:46.720]   I think I think there's a data in their defense.
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:53.400]   I think Comcast does have, because of DOCSIS 3, more capability to manage the network at
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:55.920]   the cable modem.
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:58.120]   So I think that maybe, but you know what?
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:00.160]   I think Comcast has never done.
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:04.320]   And I've gotten hit by the three months in a row going over your data cap, they start
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:08.560]   charging you $10 a gigabyte.
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:09.560]   What would it know?
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:10.560]   I came over with the prices.
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:11.560]   $10.
[01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:12.560]   Yeah, terabyte.
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:14.280]   It can't be that.
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:16.200]   Must be more than that.
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:19.360]   They don't tell you how they measure it.
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:22.400]   My measurements never match their measurements, but that doesn't matter.
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:25.440]   All the only thing that matters is their measurement.
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:30.040]   So there's no appeal as far as I can tell.
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:33.320]   So I just bought a second Comcast cable modem.
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:34.640]   I just got more.
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:36.120]   More Comcast.
[01:25:36.120 --> 01:25:37.680]   What else are you going to do?
[01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:39.560]   What else are you going to do?
[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:45.000]   It looks like that this, what's the pressure is going to be on the content creators like
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:52.760]   Google, like Netflix to become ISPs with and that wouldn't be a bad outcome.
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:54.400]   That would encourage competition.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:58.760]   I'm a little disappointed, frankly, that Google gave up on its ambitions and fiber.
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:25:59.760]   Yeah.
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:00.760]   Yeah.
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:01.760]   Didn't they restart that or something?
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:05.040]   I don't think so.
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:06.320]   I don't know.
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:09.200]   I think all of us would probably agree more competition.
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.360]   This space would be a very good thing.
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:16.120]   If I'm fortunate enough to be elected, if there are any regulatory hurdles, they're stopping
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:19.840]   them from being able to get into these products in this space.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:22.440]   We need to look at that and talk about that.
[01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:24.600]   That's what Adjapai is doing.
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:25.600]   Absolutely.
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:26.600]   No.
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:31.080]   Well, I mean, he says he's doing it.
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:34.080]   My point is here, a lot of this- He's enriching himself.
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:35.080]   What he's doing?
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:38.000]   We're not going to get more companies.
[01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.200]   We're not going to get speed increases if there's no motive to do that.
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:46.640]   Like, throughout the United States, it's clear the ISPs are adieuppling.
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:51.360]   Here in Massachusetts, there are vast parts of the state that do not have broadband, do
[01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:54.360]   not have computer science education in schools.
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:27:00.680]   It's like, how on earth are kids today that are trying to get an education, go on to work
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:02.320]   and have productive careers?
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:07.680]   If they don't have broadband internet access at this point, I honestly- I have no idea
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:11.360]   what their future is going to be like 20 years down the road.
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:15.960]   If they are as tech illiterate, you would probably be if you grew up with that.
[01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:17.600]   That's the real argument.
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:23.400]   Access to the internet, tech education is vital for the future of the country.
[01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:24.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:25.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:26.400]   And I agree with you, Leo.
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:33.040]   I think that there is clear demonstrable effect of Google entering that marketplace.
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:36.680]   And it really is a shame that they seem to have abandoned that plan because it seems
[01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:37.680]   like it worked.
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:42.440]   Without competition, you Austin- where was it?
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:43.440]   I forgot.
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:49.040]   Kansas City, you wouldn't see the other companies stepping up and offering gigabit internet.
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:54.480]   I remember when I think it was Time Warner's CEO said, "Nobody wants gigabit internet.
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:56.280]   Nobody wants that.
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:58.240]   We don't offer it because no one wants it."
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:01.400]   And then the one comes, "Google offering it at 40 bucks and then suddenly everybody
[01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:02.400]   wants it."
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:03.400]   "Oh yeah, you could get that."
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:04.400]   Yeah.
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:05.560]   And of course, these companies stepped up.
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.080]   They lowered their prices.
[01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:11.920]   Where Google was doing fiber, prices went down, speeds went up.
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:16.560]   It's a shame that they've just, I mean Atlanta, I guess, lost out because they were the next,
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:18.800]   I think they were the next city.
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:20.840]   And Google just seems it backed off completely.
[01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:22.920]   I don't see any evidence that they're coming back.
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:23.920]   Right.
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:24.920]   Let's take a little break.
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:25.920]   Let's take a little break.
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:29.720]   Brianna Wu, vote for you is a vote for good.
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:30.720]   BriannaWoo2018.com.
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:31.720]   Damn Patterson.
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:33.880]   We like, who are you going to call?
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:35.880]   Who are you going to call?
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:37.720]   I like that.
[01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:40.040]   Who are you going to, I put a lawn sign up for that.
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:42.120]   Who are you going to call?
[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:44.720]   When the internet goes down, who are you going to call?
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:47.160]   Will you let the laws out?
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:50.080]   I don't know.
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:57.440]   That's Jeff Kanata from 5x5.tv/dlc downloadable content.
[01:28:57.440 --> 01:28:59.400]   Actually a good name for a podcast.
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:00.400]   Thanks.
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:03.000]   Art all podcast DLC, really.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000]   I think so.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.000]   It's not they should be.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000]   They ought to be.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000]   Free DLC.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000]   Free DLC.
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000]   No loot boxes here, baby.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:11.000]   That's right.
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.560]   My son has started buying loot boxes, my 15 year old.
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:17.400]   It's gambling, right?
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:22.240]   Seems to be what some legislators are thinking.
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:25.800]   Do you buy loot boxes, Jeff?
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:28.200]   I have been known to buy a few loot boxes in my time.
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:29.200]   Yes, indeed.
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:32.840]   It says I'm the guy who spent $300 on Simpsons donuts.
[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:35.600]   But you knew what you were getting.
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:36.600]   That's true.
[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:37.600]   I was getting donuts.
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:38.600]   You're right.
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:39.600]   A loot box is random.
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:41.600]   You don't know what you're going to get, do you?
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:42.600]   Right.
[01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:43.600]   Yeah.
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:44.600]   He spent the other night.
[01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:46.000]   He spent $40 on loot boxes.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:50.560]   I think, yeah, I feel really strongly like we need to inform consumers that the odds on
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:55.640]   these loot boxes, because like what I've seen is if you go to a game studio, I will never
[01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:56.640]   forget this.
[01:29:56.640 --> 01:30:01.080]   I once had somebody that was working on big data analytics, sit down and show me all
[01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:05.080]   the information they had on the people that were playing their game.
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:11.320]   And they would actually tailor the return rate on the loot boxes for how much they thought
[01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:13.000]   that person would spend.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.000]   Oh.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000]   What I want to see.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000]   It is absolutely the case.
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.000]   Yeah.
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000]   Oh.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.000]   I'm an adult.
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.000]   And I'm just going to own it.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.360]   I am the whale that these people look for when they're trying to market these games.
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:25.160]   I do buy loot boxes.
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:27.320]   I buy gold.
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:29.600]   I will do time speed up items.
[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:32.520]   It's just it's a vice of mine.
[01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:36.960]   But I think that they need to be upfront with the odds for people.
[01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:41.800]   It really worries me how they are marketing these mechanics towards children.
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:46.760]   Because like I'm over 18, I can make a poor and poor choice there.
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:51.400]   But like a child, it's just a fact that many parents are having kids, they're making these
[01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:53.520]   purchases on their bank accounts.
[01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:56.040]   And it just it seems very exploitative to me.
[01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:59.040]   Well, it was it was a teaching moment for us.
[01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:02.280]   Because we could explain what gambling is.
[01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:04.560]   We could explain how you know how it works.
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:09.320]   But it's worse than gambling Leo because that's the dirty little secret that that Brianna is
[01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:10.760]   is referring to.
[01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:12.520]   It's not a level playing field.
[01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:13.520]   It's not really bad.
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:17.080]   So they like know that he could he'll spend more money.
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:18.720]   So we'll give him less.
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:19.720]   Yeah.
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:20.720]   Yes.
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:21.720]   Exactly.
[01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:24.720]   Oh my gosh, all my loot boxes are exactly what I was hoping for.
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:28.440]   I guess I should buy more loot boxes and then the more you buy them, the less that happens.
[01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:29.960]   And now you're hooked.
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:30.960]   Yeah.
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:31.960]   Wow.
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:37.360]   I'm trying to see what game he's a spanish probably overwatch.
[01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:39.160]   But that's what you're talking about.
[01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:40.160]   Again, I'm not that DLC.
[01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:41.160]   Yeah.
[01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:42.160]   Yeah, it's kind of a message.
[01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:45.560]   Blizzard, I'm not using any specific game company or any specific game of doing that.
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:47.560]   I just know that that's rampant in the industry.
[01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:49.160]   Yeah, it does.
[01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:51.400]   Wow.
[01:31:51.400 --> 01:31:54.000]   So they're fungible loot boxes.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.560]   All right, well, we're learning something here today.
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:57.760]   Jeff Kanata is also here.
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:58.760]   I said Jeff Kanata.
[01:31:58.760 --> 01:32:04.120]   Dan Patterson, I didn't say from CBS Interactive, senior writer at Tech Republic.
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:05.120]   We had a good week this week.
[01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:06.360]   Do you want to see a little video we made?
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:09.960]   We made a fun little video of some of the things that happened this week on Twitter.
[01:32:09.960 --> 01:32:11.840]   Previously on Twitter.
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:15.560]   And if they let you download Chrome, that's game over game over then.
[01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:16.560]   Whoa.
[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:18.360]   Hey, it's already game over.
[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:19.360]   Oh, kitty.
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:20.360]   What do you mean?
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:21.360]   Kitty, kitty.
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:22.360]   No.
[01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:23.360]   Triangulation.
[01:32:23.360 --> 01:32:28.360]   Tom McCaskill is our guest.
[01:32:28.360 --> 01:32:31.720]   He is the CEO of Smugmug.
[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:33.960]   Smugmug, news got very interesting.
[01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:35.640]   You announced you were buying Flickr.
[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:37.760]   Smugmug is relatively large size.
[01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:40.840]   We have billions of photos, but it's dwarfed by Flickr.
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:42.080]   That's really exciting for me.
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:45.000]   Not only is the opportunity exciting, but the challenge is exciting.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.800]   I get fired up by challenges this week in Enterprise Tech.
[01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:49.800]   Well, folks.
[01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:51.160]   There is less show.
[01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:54.680]   This has actually been the longest assignment I've ever had as a Jesuit.
[01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:57.080]   Most of my assignments are two to three years.
[01:32:57.080 --> 01:32:58.640]   This has now run seven.
[01:32:58.640 --> 01:32:59.880]   I don't know how to stop.
[01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:01.240]   Curtis, any suggestions?
[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:07.400]   I just know, Padre, that you're going to bring the sort of energy and wherever you go next,
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:10.160]   they're going to be fortunate and blessed to have you.
[01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:15.360]   How long they'll leave up a tweet if suddenly Pope Francis says, "Hey, I always watch Twiad
[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:16.360]   every Friday."
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:17.360]   That's a good deal.
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:18.360]   Twiad.
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:20.560]   "Tell your boss it's job-related."
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:25.280]   He's tweeting for the Pope, baby.
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:26.280]   And there he goes.
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:29.840]   Father Robert and his shark backpack.
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:32.880]   Goodbye forever.
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:36.680]   How many priests have shark backpacks?
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:39.520]   It's a pretty small vindigas, I guess.
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:41.520]   It's a pretty small backpack.
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:43.360]   It's not actually his backpack.
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:44.360]   It's not his backpack?
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:45.920]   Who is it?
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:46.920]   It's Kevin.
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:47.920]   Kevin really likes sharks.
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:48.920]   Kevin's backpack.
[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:51.480]   So he was stealing the backpack?
[01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:52.480]   He was stealing.
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:53.880]   He thought it was a loot crate.
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:54.880]   He didn't know.
[01:33:54.880 --> 01:34:01.840]   Father Robert will continue to know how through, I think, the end of August, and I think he's
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:03.280]   going to come back one more time.
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:04.280]   We can't really get rid of him.
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:05.280]   We keep trying.
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:07.200]   But he'll come back one more time in August.
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:12.480]   And then he is, right now he's an organ for his tertian ship, and then he goes to Rome.
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:16.920]   Literally work in the technical office at the Vatican.
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:17.880]   Wow.
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:18.880]   That's a good look.
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:23.040]   He's building a podcast studio in the Vatican.
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:24.320]   A really nice one.
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:25.320]   That's awesome.
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:26.320]   He really is.
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:28.320]   He's got gold leafing.
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:29.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:31.920]   They got this some guy.
[01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:34.200]   Michael, somebody is going to be paying the ceiling.
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:35.600]   It's going to be great.
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:37.080]   That's going to be great.
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:39.080]   I've met a lot of people in my tech career.
[01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:43.640]   He is absolutely one of the most fascinating people on the behalf of the Vatican.
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:44.640]   He is a gym.
[01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:45.640]   He's such a nice person.
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:47.160]   He's such a nice person.
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:49.040]   He makes me want to be a nice person.
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:50.320]   That's how good he is.
[01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:52.560]   Yeah, it doesn't make me want to be a nice person.
[01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:55.000]   So I'm immune to his charm now.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000]   Yeah, no, he's a great guy.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.000]   We've been very lucky to have him.
[01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.280]   And I think we'll see more of him.
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:01.480]   I don't think he's gone for good.
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:05.400]   Our show today brought to you by Mooog Soft.
[01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:09.760]   If you're an IT, you know that sometimes it feels like you're in a pachinko parlour.
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:15.240]   You ever go into those in Japan, the pachinko parlours is so loud.
[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:19.880]   All those alerts and tickets coming in, it's hard to know.
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:21.400]   It almost freezes you.
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:24.520]   It's hard to know what to do first, how to fix the problem.
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:25.720]   It's just overwhelmed.
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:31.160]   No mere mortal can analyze all those alerts and respond to all those tickets.
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:32.600]   That's why you need Mooog Soft.
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:38.880]   Mooog Soft takes that pachinko parlour and turns it into a zen garden of calm and peace.
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:43.080]   By reducing your IT alerts and tickets by up to 99%.
[01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:45.920]   But it doesn't just turn off the alerts.
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:51.280]   It's an algorithmic IT ops platform that analyzes the incoming alerts.
[01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:53.960]   This is such a good use of machine learning.
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:59.160]   Figures out how they relate, what needs to be acted upon to solve them all.
[01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:01.240]   It integrates with all your existing IT tools.
[01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:03.240]   You're not disconnecting.
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:05.840]   You're kind of organizing.
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:10.720]   Their patented technology organizes, correlates events into actionable work items.
[01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:12.280]   They call them situations.
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:14.480]   So you can focus on what matters.
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:19.720]   Turn off the pachinko machine and really get the job done.
[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:22.360]   Great testimonial from a company called HCL Technologies.
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:23.360]   You may know them.
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:30.800]   They do a mobile IT managed service provider and they have an award winning dry ice platform
[01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:35.360]   that integrates Mooog Soft AI ops as the event management layer.
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:39.360]   According to HCL Technologies, it's helped clients streamline operational workflows reduce
[01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:43.240]   time and the detect to correct like cycle of incident tickets.
[01:36:43.240 --> 01:36:49.040]   Literally a 33% reduction in mean time to restore means they could support more customers
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:52.760]   with service quality, keeping operational costs low and efficiency high.
[01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:54.400]   Read all about it.
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:55.600]   Find out if it's right for you.
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:37:01.720]   I think it might be if you've got the pachinko parlor in your brain by going to Mooogsoft.com.
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:07.840]   M-O-O-G-S-O-F-T.com to learn more, you can get a demo.
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:11.480]   There, reduce your IT alerts and tickets by up to 99%.
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:13.120]   Wouldn't that be nice?
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:14.120]   Mooogsoft.com.
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:15.120]   Let's see.
[01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:16.120]   Boy, I think that's it.
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:24.200]   I think that's all that happened this week.
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:27.240]   Actually, I read a story that's a little scary.
[01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:34.280]   I was on the front page of TechMim this week about a Chinese company that has managed to
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:38.640]   get their logistics company.
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:39.640]   What is it called?
[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:40.640]   JD something?
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:45.680]   They're like an Amazon, a smaller Amazon.
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:51.160]   They've reduced the size of their workforce to four people while signing out something
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:53.840]   like 200,000 orders a day.
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:54.840]   Automation.
[01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:58.320]   Automation.
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:37:59.320]   I think this is what's coming.
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:01.000]   Now, this is in China.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:05.560]   As we know, the president is very interested in making China great again.
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:08.840]   I'm sure he has a plan.
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:15.360]   There's Shanghai Fulfillment Center, ships 200,000 orders a day with four humans.
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:17.160]   By the way, the humans aren't doing any shipping.
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:20.280]   They're just there to serve as the robots.
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:22.280]   Wow.
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:24.680]   JD says it's objective.
[01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:30.280]   Not to eliminate workers, but to get faster and more reliable.
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:31.280]   They're going to eliminate workers.
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:34.320]   No, they say they're going to shift warehouse people to other jobs.
[01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:35.320]   But really, come on.
[01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:36.320]   Not our goal.
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:37.320]   It's just a fun byproduct.
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:40.320]   It's just a fun byproduct.
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:48.080]   I was talking to a woman yesterday that had a job at an Amazon distribution center right
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:50.480]   here in my district.
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:58.080]   It just is a matter of being dangerous and having the capacity to hurt people.
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:03.560]   We're essentially running all over a football field sized warehouse all day long.
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:09.240]   I am amenable to the idea that there are some jobs that maybe robots would be better
[01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:10.240]   off doing.
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:17.400]   I think the problem is when we look at this trend of our tax base starting to shrink and
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:22.720]   shrink and shrink, which is why some may smaller communities throughout America don't have
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:27.080]   functional schools or towns because the tax base is just eroded.
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:30.400]   I really worried this trend is going to accelerate it.
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:35.960]   I agree with Bill Gates, who put out a very thoughtful piece a while back that basically
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:40.920]   proposed that the robot that takes your job should pay your taxes for you.
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:42.840]   That's kind of interesting.
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:47.880]   We've always taxed in this country, we've never taxed production.
[01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:51.600]   We've only taxed income.
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:57.200]   I guess that's what a VAT tax really is all about in a way.
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:39:59.640]   Value added taxes in Europe and other countries.
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:04.160]   In fact, I think we're one of the few developed nations that doesn't have a value added tax.
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:10.200]   Basically follow the production of the good and the tax is applied at each stage in production
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:15.440]   until it gets to the consumer so that you're in effect taxing production.
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:17.520]   I think what Bill Gates really is talking about.
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:21.040]   Maybe he's secretly saying what we need is a VAT tax.
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:23.560]   Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world.
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:27.760]   He's already $40 billion richer this year.
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:32.680]   Compare that to the average Amazon worker who makes $12,000 a year.
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:34.680]   Let's thanks that.
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:36.480]   I think we do.
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:41.440]   I was going to say, I think the good news is if you have four employees, super easy to
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:42.440]   unionize.
[01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:46.040]   You need to convince three other people.
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:49.040]   I don't know if they have unions in Shanghai.
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:51.000]   My thinking is it's a worker's paradise.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000]   What do you need unions for?
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000]   Good point.
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000]   I don't know.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.800]   I'm starting to sound like a commie here.
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:40:58.800]   I apologize.
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:00.800]   We'll move on.
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:01.800]   Come radly out.
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:03.720]   Jeff has the right to earn as much money as he can.
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:06.520]   Amazon's really creating a lot of value.
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:13.000]   I do wish he would pay his workers maybe a little bit better.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:15.600]   Apple Map was down for several hours.
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:17.120]   Directs into search not working.
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:22.600]   I'm just waiting for the stories about people driving off of bridges.
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:24.480]   Never coming home.
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:25.480]   Did anyone notice?
[01:41:25.480 --> 01:41:26.880]   No, I didn't.
[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:30.960]   Actually, I saw the story and I immediately went to Apple Maps.
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:34.560]   But I think it was only if you were trying to get directions because Maps was working
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:35.560]   but I couldn't get direction.
[01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:38.840]   The good news is there's a lot of other mapping applications.
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:39.840]   Yeah.
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:44.080]   I think now that Waze works with CarPlay, there'll be even fewer people using Apple Maps.
[01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:45.080]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:46.360]   I'm looking forward to that one.
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:49.680]   What if Apple Maps went down and nobody complained?
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:51.680]   God.
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:53.880]   That was when I decided to get out of radio.
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:54.880]   Actually, it wasn't.
[01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:56.400]   That was early in my career.
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:57.760]   I should have just...
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:41:59.640]   I should have read the writing on the wall.
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:03.200]   I was doing an overnight shift and I had tapes.
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:06.880]   I was supposed to run tapes of church services because it was Sunday morning.
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:11.880]   And foolishly during the middle of a church service said, "I just lie down and take a
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:15.440]   little nap."
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:18.280]   And I woke up and the tapes going...
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:20.040]   It had run out.
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:21.040]   I got a nose.
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:25.600]   But the thing that the epiphany for me was that not one line was lit up in the phone.
[01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:28.080]   Nobody even noticed.
[01:42:28.080 --> 01:42:29.080]   That's the worst.
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:31.800]   You're doing a job like that and nobody even cares.
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:36.960]   I've had that before with videos that I've uploaded.
[01:42:36.960 --> 01:42:39.760]   There's a horrible error that I find an hour after I've uploaded.
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:42.080]   I'm like, "Why didn't anybody get mad?"
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:44.080]   "Nobody noticed."
[01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:50.480]   Apparently Amazon is already automating white collar jobs as well.
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:57.200]   If you thought your job was safe because you're in the front office...
[01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:00.680]   No.
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:07.400]   The company has launched a pilot project called Get This Hands Off The Wheel.
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:12.720]   It automates demand forecasting, negotiating prices with vendors.
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:17.600]   And of course, because of the Amazon marketplace, vendors can bypass Amazon buyers, sell their
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:20.160]   where direct wears directly.
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:22.240]   This has been going on for a couple of years.
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:27.160]   Algorithms originally could be overridden by humans if they thought there was a mistake.
[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:30.680]   But you know, it's not really necessary anymore.
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:35.760]   So now if you want to override the software, you have to justify it.
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:38.480]   You have to explain.
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:43.680]   Neil Ackerman, a former Amazon executive, told Bloomberg, " Computers know what to buy and
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:46.000]   when to buy, when to offer a deal and when not to.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:51.040]   These algorithms take in thousands of inputs and always running smarter than any human."
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:52.040]   I think we knew this.
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:53.040]   Always.
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:54.040]   Always.
[01:43:54.040 --> 01:43:55.040]   Always.
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:56.040]   Always smarter than any.
[01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:59.120]   My neighbor, Swell Guy, used to work on Wall Street and he was one of the quants, one of
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:02.240]   those wanted guys who could look at numbers.
[01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:06.000]   I mean, he's a great guy, 10 times smarter than I'll ever be.
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:11.320]   And I chat with him and he's like, "I'm home all day, algorithm."
[01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:12.320]   Wow.
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:13.320]   Wow.
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:14.320]   He's done.
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:16.120]   He quanted himself out of a job.
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:17.120]   Yeah.
[01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:19.360]   And that's what we're going to get to, right?
[01:44:19.360 --> 01:44:24.200]   As a Wall Streetification of everything where that's the price that was negotiated, we don't
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:25.200]   know why.
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:26.200]   Right.
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:27.200]   There's two computers talking to each other.
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:28.200]   They came to this part.
[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:29.200]   It's easier though.
[01:44:29.200 --> 01:44:30.200]   You don't have to justify it.
[01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:32.080]   As the Sun says, "We'll pay you a buck 99."
[01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:33.080]   That's that.
[01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:34.080]   The computer said so.
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:35.080]   Yeah.
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:36.800]   And our computer responded with that works for us.
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:38.600]   And I guess it does then.
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:39.600]   We're done.
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:40.600]   We're done here.
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:41.600]   Let's move on.
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:42.600]   So in the games, we'll play themselves.
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:45.960]   I'm being interested, Brianna, when you get to Washington, and by the way, yes, we will
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:51.400]   be there on January 3, 2019 for your inauguration when you get sworn in in the Congress.
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:54.960]   I'm looking forward to that, the 118th Congress.
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:58.560]   When we go though, I'm not going to bring my cell phone because apparently there are
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:04.440]   more than 40 stingrays in Washington, many of them outside of embassies, government
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:05.680]   offices.
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:09.880]   And it turns out when John Kelly, currently chief of staff at the White House, was serving
[01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:14.120]   as the secretary of Homeland Security, his phone was hacked.
[01:45:14.120 --> 01:45:24.560]   Buzzfeed via FOIA request found out Kelly wrote in an email that his personal email had
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:25.560]   been hacked.
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:26.560]   He was raised.
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:28.520]   There was no joke.
[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:29.520]   Yeah.
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:33.160]   As we discussed, Kelly wrote, "My folks are nervous about the emails you sent and ask
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:36.560]   that you no longer include them on any postings.
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:40.760]   Then there is hacking, which one of my own personal accounts has suffered recently.
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:44.200]   I do almost everything now by phone or face to face."
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:46.160]   You know, phone's not my...
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:47.160]   Yeah.
[01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:53.120]   Politico had reported that Kelly used to compromise smartphone for months.
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:57.560]   And there is significant evidence that we've written about and other news outlets have
[01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:00.320]   written about that some of these stingrays were Chinese.
[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:05.880]   And this was right before the president met with the North Korean leader last week.
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:09.800]   These aren't all White House stingrays or US government stingrays.
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:13.080]   Some of these are from foreign actors.
[01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:18.520]   And we are seeing an escalation in foreign cyber war that seems hyperbolic to most consumers.
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:24.120]   But we inside Tic, of course, know that hacking is real, but it is an escalation of hacking.
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:29.880]   And these are attacks by foreign actors or by surrogates of foreign actors directed at
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:37.080]   political or high level business targets with the intent of undermining communications and
[01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:39.360]   trust in critical infrastructure.
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:41.760]   This is very serious.
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:46.760]   From this picture I deduced that President Trump is using an iPhone in a Mophie case.
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:49.120]   That's a good eye.
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:51.920]   iPhones are vulnerable to stingray attacks as well.
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:56.320]   I was in Kiev last year and the second I touched found it by strobele airport.
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:58.160]   I was attacked by stingrays.
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:46:59.160]   Yeah.
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:08.880]   And according to Politico, he refuses to update his iPhone because it's too inconvenient.
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:13.520]   One is hate to ask a rhetorical question, but who the heck is doing his tech?
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:14.720]   Yeah, no, no.
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:16.640]   Well, he says, get out of here.
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:18.880]   Yeah, I'm the person that's doing his anything.
[01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:19.880]   Get out of here.
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:21.880]   It's Rudy Giuliani.
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:22.880]   Nice time I checked.
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:24.400]   I think Rudy comes in.
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:26.920]   He's using your fired as a Twitter password.
[01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:27.920]   I'm not joking.
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:30.120]   He was using your fired all lowercase letters.
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:34.760]   The hackers in the gray and black hat community had his password for ages.
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:36.760]   It's all I'm not kidding.
[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:40.200]   You're fired was his password.
[01:47:40.200 --> 01:47:42.040]   Yeah, all lowercase letters.
[01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:43.760]   The first thing you'd guess.
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:44.760]   Yeah.
[01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:49.400]   Well, and it's definitely the first thing a brute force attack would target.
[01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:53.680]   It's using his own catchphrase as his password.
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:54.840]   Go to black hat.
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:58.920]   I mean, the infosecond world is in the matter about this for a year and a half.
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:02.760]   According to officials interviewed by Politico, the president uses at least two iPhones.
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:04.280]   He's supposed to swap them out every month.
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:06.680]   He hasn't done it in five months.
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:10.280]   It's been five months without having the phone checked by security experts.
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:16.840]   He has two phones, one equipped only with Twitter and preloaded with a handful of news
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:19.640]   sites and the other capable only of making calls.
[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:24.480]   I don't know how that makes it more secure, but anyway, normally the president would
[01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:29.200]   hand over his White House phone every 30 days to be examined for hacking and other suspicious
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:30.560]   activities.
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:35.520]   But according to Politico, Trump says, no, you know, next month.
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:37.080]   I don't he doesn't need to worry about hacking.
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:38.800]   He just straight up says that.
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:41.400]   There's no mystery.
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:42.920]   There's no mystery.
[01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:48.000]   Good news GDPR is killing email marketing to the disappointment of no one.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:52.560]   So remember when you got last couple of weeks ago, May 25th was GDPR became long the week
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:56.920]   before that lots of email, you know, we're changing our privacy policy.
[01:48:56.920 --> 01:49:02.720]   Well, turns out a lot of that email was now GDPR says, if somebody bought something from
[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:05.760]   you, you don't have to have their permission to send them email.
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:08.840]   But if they just showed interest or they sign up for a mailing list, you got to get their
[01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:10.720]   express permission.
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:15.640]   So a lot of those emails were asking you, is it okay if we keep sending you newsletters,
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:16.640]   but you just ignored them.
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:17.640]   I just ignored them.
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:19.720]   So they can't.
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:22.680]   This is from a policy.
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:23.840]   I love it.
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:25.080]   We need to adopt it here.
[01:49:25.080 --> 01:49:32.280]   A digital marketing agency called huge, or maybe it's huge, told CNBC nearly two and
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:35.000]   five Americans have completely ignored the emails.
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.240]   That's all.
[01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:43.160]   I thought it was like four out of five or eight, five out of five.
[01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:48.760]   But if according to Mailchimp, about one in five marketing emails get opened, so it's
[01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:51.520]   definitely going to cut back.
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:55.360]   There is a downside to spam in the GDPR though.
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:58.800]   And it should be said that almost everyone I've spoken with, at least in business technology
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:03.520]   is very, supports the GDPR.
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:07.740]   But I talked to IBM Security last month, and they said we can see, expect to see, is short
[01:50:07.740 --> 01:50:12.800]   spike in spam in large part because of the who is database.
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:17.440]   And then many people in the InfoSec community would use who is and other similar tools to
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:21.320]   track down IPs that were spamming.
[01:50:21.320 --> 01:50:24.800]   And it was one of the first things you would go to because it was very easy to do.
[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:30.880]   Just blacklist the IP address and use automation to blacklist lots of IP addresses.
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:35.400]   And it cut down on the amount of spam that we saw over the last half decade or so.
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:39.040]   And what is his name is Caleb Barlow.
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:41.120]   And he's a GDPR expert at IBM Security.
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:46.400]   And he said, well, this actually kind of in the short term, in the very short term, hurts
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:47.920]   the anti-spam initiative.
[01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:53.080]   Because now without these tools, spammers will move around a lot more freely and use
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:57.520]   IPs and hack domains to send spam messages.
[01:50:57.520 --> 01:50:58.520]   Interesting.
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:50:59.520]   Yeah.
[01:50:59.520 --> 01:51:04.280]   Well, it's like when you catch a fish, they thrash a lot a lot before you hit them on the
[01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:05.280]   head.
[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:06.280]   Those are great metaphor.
[01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:07.280]   Yeah.
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:08.280]   Yeah.
[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:09.280]   A lot of thrashing going on.
[01:51:09.280 --> 01:51:11.520]   We're going to take a little break, come back with our final thoughts, final words.
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:12.520]   What a great panel.
[01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:15.520]   You guys have been fantastic this week.
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:17.480]   Our show brought to you by LastPass.
[01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:19.440]   Now I don't have, I probably don't have to tell you about LastPass.
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:21.000]   I hope I don't.
[01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:28.640]   33,000 businesses, including ours, use LastPass to manage and secure our company's passwords.
[01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:35.160]   We started using LastPass when an engineer, who no longer works here, thought it was really
[01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:40.880]   too inconvenient to remember all the passwords to our website and our e-commerce stuff.
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:45.640]   So we just made a webpage with all the passwords and posted it.
[01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:48.840]   And we had a little perturb when I found out.
[01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:50.880]   And that's when we started using LastPass Enterprise.
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:53.840]   It's the password vault.
[01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:56.320]   Secures every password protected entry to your business.
[01:51:56.320 --> 01:52:02.600]   If you think about it, you've got passwords all over your business that can make a huge,
[01:52:02.600 --> 01:52:05.440]   huge difference if somebody were to get it.
[01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:10.040]   81% of breaches are caused by weak passwords.
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:13.000]   You know, I was just thinking, I think my Twitter password is you're fired.
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.240]   I better change that.
[01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:18.680]   LastPass protects every password in your business without slowing down your employees.
[01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:23.320]   From easy onboarding to password auto-filled automated security reports, LastPass makes
[01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:26.560]   it easy for businesses to take control of passwords and reduce the threat of breach.
[01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:28.920]   We have had no problems since we started using it.
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:32.720]   We require two factor, which is a big feature of LastPass Enterprise.
[01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:34.600]   I really like that.
[01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:37.520]   Every employee gets their own secure vault for managing passwords.
[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:42.880]   You have complete control over not only the master passwords, but access to specific devices
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:44.160]   and location.
[01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:47.240]   You can enable password resets.
[01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:50.800]   It password sharing is great because you completely control who has rights to which
[01:52:50.800 --> 01:52:53.360]   password keeps our data secure.
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:59.280]   Of course, everything at LastPass is encrypted with AES-256 bit encryption, prevents man
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:01.440]   in the middle attacks.
[01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:03.280]   There's a LastPass for everybody.
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:05.760]   LastPass premium for personal use.
[01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:08.880]   We use LastPass families at home and I have for years.
[01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:12.560]   LastPass teams, if you're a smaller business for 50 or less or LastPass Enterprise, which
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:13.560]   is what we use.
[01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:15.880]   In fact, we love LastPass so much.
[01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:20.320]   We actually give it as a benefit to employees.
[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:24.640]   When you work here, you get a free copy of LastPass for yourself.
[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:26.240]   John, you use it?
[01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:28.040]   Carsten, you use it?
[01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:30.760]   Now, are you using two factor?
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:32.320]   Yes, Carsten?
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:33.320]   Yes, John.
[01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:35.160]   Yes, you guys, A plus.
[01:53:35.160 --> 01:53:37.200]   Gold stickers for you both.
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:41.920]   At working at home, fix your password woes with LastPass, the number one most preferred
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:43.320]   password manager.
[01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:48.920]   I started using it when Steve Gibson interviewed the founder and looked at all the source code
[01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:49.920]   and everything.
[01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:52.680]   You got a complete look at LastPass and said, "Yep, thumbs up.
[01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:53.680]   This is it.
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:54.680]   Steve uses it.
[01:53:54.680 --> 01:53:56.560]   I use it.
[01:53:56.560 --> 01:53:58.040]   I have for years."
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:54:01.280]   Learn more about LastPass at lasspass.com/twit.
[01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:04.440]   This is the way to secure yourself online.
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:08.040]   LastPass.com/twit and choose the product that's right for you.
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:10.880]   We use Enterprise.
[01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:11.880]   LastPass does not have the problem.
[01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:16.760]   I'm really upset that PGP has this week.
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:21.840]   There was a PGP issue, open PGP issue a couple of weeks ago.
[01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:27.280]   And now we've learned that PGP signing has been broken for years.
[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:30.760]   It's a decades old bug that allows anybody's signature.
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:37.520]   I use GNU Privacy Guard to sign all my emails so that you know A that I wrote it and B that
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:38.800]   it hasn't been changed since I wrote it.
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:41.400]   Turns out, not so good.
[01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:50.200]   The good news is this flaw, which is CV 2018 12, 0, 20, was fixed before it went public.
[01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:52.360]   So that's the good news.
[01:54:52.360 --> 01:55:01.040]   The word should go out though if you're using Open PGP or GNU Privacy Card, get the update.
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:11.960]   PGP has been updated in 2.2.8 and NIGMAIL 2.07, GPG Tools 2018.3, Python, GNU, PG 0.4.3,
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:13.520]   all fixed.
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:16.000]   I feel like that's baked into the name.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.840]   It's not saying impenetrable privacy.
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:20.240]   It's like pretty good.
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:21.240]   Pretty good.
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:22.240]   It's pretty good.
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:25.040]   We're trying to get Phil Zimmerman for triangulation.
[01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:26.880]   We get him yet?
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:28.200]   Next week.
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:29.200]   On Friday.
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:31.000]   Am I doing the interview?
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.200]   Oh, I'll see you 9am on Friday.
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:34.640]   Phil Zimmerman will be joining us.
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:35.880]   The creator of PGP.
[01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:38.360]   I've interviewed him before.
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:39.920]   I think he's got something new he's up to.
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:45.680]   But honestly, despite these flaws, it is still the right way, I think, to encrypt email
[01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:46.680]   and I use D.
[01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:47.680]   Jan, did you teach?
[01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:52.160]   You were teaching journalists how to work securely and safely in the proper place.
[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:58.560]   Yeah, in 2014, I was in Cairo and we brought a bunch of guys from Sudan who we taught
[01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:01.720]   to use PGP.
[01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:03.720]   Oh, you did.
[01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:05.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:06.160]   Okay.
[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:09.160]   Yeah, but it's complex, especially with language barriers.
[01:56:09.160 --> 01:56:10.960]   It's very hard.
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:14.200]   I mean, there is no, that is the standard.
[01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:18.080]   Yeah, and I wish there were an easier, simpler way and I wish we'd all could use it, but
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:20.040]   there really isn't.
[01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:21.840]   So what was your success rate?
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:22.840]   People figure it out.
[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:23.840]   Were you able to show them?
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:28.160]   Well, these were individuals who were from Sudan.
[01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:32.080]   And the education level was quite varied.
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:38.080]   One, I wrote a story about who was a migrant who was stuck in Sudan and he had to sell
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:41.720]   a kidney or make bombs for ISIS.
[01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:44.240]   So their situation is not great.
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:51.720]   But what they did do is understand the fundamental concepts of privacy and privacy of thought,
[01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:58.120]   privacy of communication and why that enhances not just democracy because we weren't there
[01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:04.160]   to teach democracy, but why that enhances their agency and ability to be humans.
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:09.600]   And if you live in a repressed society or if you live in any society, when we cannot
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:16.000]   think and form thoughts privately, when we cannot communicate privately, it suppresses
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:21.080]   our own ability to act within our society and be change agents.
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:22.080]   Yeah.
[01:57:22.080 --> 01:57:26.480]   And I honor your attempt to spread the word on that.
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:28.440]   I think that was really a good thing to do.
[01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:30.360]   And these people who lives are at risk.
[01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:31.360]   Yeah.
[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:35.640]   Really, really do need to do the best they can to learn this stuff.
[01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:42.440]   Another bad thing that happened to the internet on Monday, if you're in Tanzania, in Tanzania,
[01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:50.000]   all bloggers and online forums were told to suspend immediately or face criminal prosecution
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:53.160]   if they hadn't registered.
[01:57:53.160 --> 01:58:01.080]   Back in March, Tanzania, the Tanzanian Communications Regulatory Authority decided to make a compulsory
[01:58:01.080 --> 01:58:06.960]   for bloggers and owners of other online forums like YouTube channels to register with the
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:12.840]   government and pay up to $900 for a license, which is a lot when you consider that the
[01:58:12.840 --> 01:58:19.680]   per capita income in Tanzania is slightly below $900 a year.
[01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:23.160]   So a number of forums shut down on Monday.
[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:27.840]   Anyone convicted of defying the new regulations faces a fine of $2,200 in imprisonment for
[01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:31.040]   a year or both.
[01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:39.880]   So just another place where free speech is not encouraged.
[01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:45.480]   And if you're in Canada, you might be a little concerned that the random immigration lottery
[01:58:45.480 --> 01:58:59.920]   uses an Excel spreadsheet, which is not random because it's a pseudo random number generator.
[01:58:59.920 --> 01:59:04.000]   I think this is an example, again, Brianna, who of how you can explain to Congress what
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:05.000]   pseudo means.
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:10.200]   Well, bring a whole presentation between pseudo random and true random.
[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:12.800]   Actually, Excel isn't even really good at pseudo random.
[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:17.360]   In fact, at times it's been so bad the programmers could reverse engineer the results.
[01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:21.920]   A team of cryptographers at the University of Haifa were able to predict the numbers
[01:59:21.920 --> 01:59:25.880]   Excel would generate by determining the initial values it's working with.
[01:59:25.880 --> 01:59:29.240]   You could reverse engineer it.
[01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:32.120]   So probably not the best thing for an immigration lottery.
[01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:33.120]   That was.
[01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:34.120]   Yeah.
[01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:36.120]   I can, you know, we can get you a good random number generator.
[01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:37.920]   Father Robert will build you one.
[01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:39.560]   I'll be correct.
[01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:40.560]   Yeah.
[01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:42.640]   Oh, and here's some, you know what?
[01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:48.240]   I'll really bash the president, but I have sometimes, I think he's got things right.
[01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:51.920]   Trump has ordered the government to stop work on the Y2K bug.
[01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:52.920]   What?
[01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:55.160]   No, we're all doing.
[01:59:55.160 --> 01:59:57.360]   Well, perishable perish.
[01:59:57.360 --> 02:00:02.800]   Apparently, somehow this, oh, I'm not a Bloomberg professional service subscriber, but apparent,
[02:00:02.800 --> 02:00:05.760]   but I read the story before my subscription, right now.
[02:00:05.760 --> 02:00:11.600]   Apparently this was still in the encoded in law that when an agency followed her port,
[02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:16.880]   they had to explain what their 20 Y2K mitigation strategies were.
[02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:26.760]   However, federal workers are probably should be worried about 2038 when the Unix time bomb
[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:27.760]   will explode.
[02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:29.280]   So maybe we can get a new law.
[02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:30.720]   You could be, we could be working on that.
[02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:33.520]   Let's keep Brianna in Congress through 2038.
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:35.480]   I will, I will get right to work on that.
[02:00:35.480 --> 02:00:39.120]   You know, I would be real money to have.
[02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:43.920]   It hurts me to say this, but I do think Trump has actually done some good things when it
[02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:45.560]   comes to information security.
[02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:51.520]   He has really pushed towards moving more government databases onto the cloud.
[02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:53.720]   Now, you know, it's a mixed bag.
[02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:54.720]   Is it Trump or Jared?
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:55.720]   Maybe that's a Jared.
[02:00:55.720 --> 02:00:56.960]   It's a continuity of policy.
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:00:59.000]   It's the Trump administration.
[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.400]   This is the one good thing I could say about that.
[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:05.360]   And you know, moving things to the cloud, it does give it, it's like one central location
[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:07.360]   where it can be attacked.
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:09.960]   But you know, sometimes you want to be modern.
[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:12.240]   Yeah, definitely.
[02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:17.440]   There's not really any government agency that is responsible for code auditing and making
[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:22.600]   sure that systems are, you know, secure for many areas of the federal government.
[02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:25.440]   So I think that's been a step forward.
[02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:27.600]   And I think you said it's continuity of policy, Dan.
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:29.960]   I think that that's a part of the policy is.
[02:01:29.960 --> 02:01:30.960]   Yeah.
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:31.960]   Yeah.
[02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:34.000]   So having said that guys, you guys are fantastic.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:35.000]   I love you all.
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:36.000]   I got a script.
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:37.000]   Five o'clock.
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.000]   It's the witching hour.
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:39.000]   Okay.
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000]   I was going to talk about Elizabeth Holmes.
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.480]   Oh, I am here for this.
[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:44.480]   Okay.
[02:01:44.480 --> 02:01:45.480]   Bye, Dan.
[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:46.480]   Thank you so much.
[02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:47.480]   I appreciate it.
[02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:48.480]   Thank you guys.
[02:01:48.480 --> 02:01:49.480]   Take care.
[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:53.120]   Elizabeth Holmes, Theranos, of course, we mentioned it briefly earlier.
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:58.520]   We had a great triangulation interview with the Wall Street Journal reporter John Kerry
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:01:59.520]   Roo.
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:05.960]   Was that last Friday with Megan Maroney about his really good reporting that he did?
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:09.320]   Really blowing the lid off the Theranos scam.
[02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:13.000]   I think we could safely say that was a scam.
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:16.240]   Scammed a lot of money out of investors.
[02:02:16.240 --> 02:02:24.360]   But more importantly, maybe out of the US military, out of independent drug stores,
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:27.920]   there's some serious fraud that went on.
[02:02:27.920 --> 02:02:35.360]   And now criminal charges have been filed against Elizabeth Holmes, the founder and CEO.
[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:38.160]   And here number two executive, Sonny Balani.
[02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:39.160]   Yeah.
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:40.160]   Yeah.
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:45.440]   I have to say, it's not our job to determine who is innocent or guilty.
[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:47.920]   You know, that is up for a jury to decide.
[02:02:47.920 --> 02:02:54.240]   But I can think of almost no one in America that needs to go in front of a jury and answer
[02:02:54.240 --> 02:02:58.320]   for some of these allegations as much as Elizabeth Holmes.
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:06.320]   I mean, it's stunning everything from running blood tests and having no quality control,
[02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:12.280]   lying the safe way, lying to drug stores, lying to the United States military, marketing
[02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:15.280]   a glue robot as a blood test device.
[02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:16.280]   Yeah.
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:17.280]   I mean, all this stuff.
[02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:22.320]   If you read the book, it is just jaw dropping page after page.
[02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:23.760]   You cannot believe it.
[02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:24.760]   And I am so hurt.
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:26.760]   I don't understand what the end game was.
[02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:28.760]   What was her plan?
[02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:32.440]   This is just kicking the can down the road.
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:35.640]   What did she think was going to happen?
[02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:42.200]   I think she believed she could keep putting off regulators looking at the science until
[02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:45.240]   she actually had a product that worked.
[02:03:45.240 --> 02:03:50.680]   And I think she just came to believe all the things she was selling to people.
[02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:56.280]   I think it's, you know, it's something for a psychologist to be diagnosed, not me.
[02:03:56.280 --> 02:04:02.000]   But it's, I will say the allegations in the book, bad blood, were beyond concerning.
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.840]   And there were a lot of individuals who got blood tests were just, you know, playing
[02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:05.840]   on wrong.
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:06.840]   Yeah.
[02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:13.920]   It certainly seems to me that it was clear to her and them very early on that this was
[02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:15.320]   not going to happen.
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:20.200]   But you always wondered, yeah, when you heard about Bernie Madoff, what did he think was
[02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:21.200]   going to happen?
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:22.200]   Right?
[02:04:22.200 --> 02:04:23.200]   Yeah.
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:26.240]   I mean, how he was kicking the can down the road for years.
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:27.240]   Decades.
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:28.240]   Yes.
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:29.240]   That's a good point.
[02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:33.960]   Con artists be conning, I guess.
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:38.560]   It seems to me like there was a pivot point where she decided no longer am I even attempting
[02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:39.720]   to make this real.
[02:04:39.720 --> 02:04:42.960]   I'm just trying to survive.
[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:44.200]   Pull the wool over.
[02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:45.200]   Yeah.
[02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:46.200]   Pull the wool over people's eyes as long as possible.
[02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:47.440]   And I just don't understand.
[02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:51.840]   I guess, I guess at a certain point you feel cornered and you just trying to survive.
[02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:55.800]   But it is an incredible story that seems unreal.
[02:04:55.800 --> 02:04:56.800]   Yeah.
[02:04:56.800 --> 02:05:03.880]   I have to say this, it is so insulting to me for all the women in tech and engineering
[02:05:03.880 --> 02:05:09.880]   that are out there gang and done every day, going unrecognized at game studios and major
[02:05:09.880 --> 02:05:18.240]   companies like Facebook, really talented women, for her to come in and just so comport
[02:05:18.240 --> 02:05:20.480]   herself with such recklessness.
[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:25.760]   And there's a part of Bad Blood where she's really caught on the ropes.
[02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:28.840]   The press is starting to go after Theranos.
[02:05:28.840 --> 02:05:31.480]   And she tries to come forward.
[02:05:31.480 --> 02:05:37.480]   She proposes like talking about sexual assault in college as a PR strategy to kind of shift
[02:05:37.480 --> 02:05:44.000]   the public narrative and claim that these attacks on her are due to sexism and to attack
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.840]   John Kerry for being a sexist.
[02:05:46.840 --> 02:05:53.440]   And that is such an incredible disservice to women that are really struggling with this.
[02:05:53.440 --> 02:06:00.160]   To have someone that from all accounts seems to be a con artist to weaponize that, it's
[02:06:00.160 --> 02:06:01.680]   so offensive to me.
[02:06:01.680 --> 02:06:02.680]   Yeah.
[02:06:02.680 --> 02:06:03.680]   Yeah.
[02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:04.680]   100%.
[02:06:04.680 --> 02:06:05.680]   Good point.
[02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:07.480]   And just one last kind of a public service announcement.
[02:06:07.480 --> 02:06:10.480]   I'm probably the last person who remembers meta filter.
[02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:11.480]   Remember meta filter?
[02:06:11.480 --> 02:06:12.480]   I do.
[02:06:12.480 --> 02:06:13.480]   Yeah.
[02:06:13.480 --> 02:06:14.480]   They're still around.
[02:06:14.480 --> 02:06:21.200]   It was in the heyday of the early days before Google, it was a great site to go to and find
[02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:24.560]   out about stuff before, long before Reddit or dig.
[02:06:24.560 --> 02:06:26.440]   Unfortunately, they're losing money at $8,000.
[02:06:26.440 --> 02:06:31.640]   At the rate of $1,000 a month, they've attempted to monetize through ads that did not work.
[02:06:31.640 --> 02:06:37.000]   So if you are a meta filter fan, and I still am, it might be worth checking it out and
[02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:40.280]   seeing what we can do to help maybe sponsorships.
[02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:41.640]   I don't know.
[02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:44.920]   But yeah, it may just be the end of the end of an era.
[02:06:44.920 --> 02:06:48.200]   These things happen for meta filter.
[02:06:48.200 --> 02:06:54.720]   But it was, it still is a great place to go and read stuff about the internet.
[02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:57.680]   Thank you so much for being here, Brianna Wu.
[02:06:57.680 --> 02:07:01.760]   I put in a little bit towards your election in the fall.
[02:07:01.760 --> 02:07:04.440]   I hope that's not a conflict of interest.
[02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:05.440]   I don't think so.
[02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:06.880]   No, I'm a fan.
[02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:09.600]   I support you.
[02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:14.080]   How many of your donations come from inside the district and how many from outside?
[02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:15.480]   I'm just going to be honest with you.
[02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:20.160]   The overwhelming majority of people that support me are tech people because we're talking
[02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:23.000]   about the policies that they care about.
[02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:27.200]   So, you know, that's, it's very interesting because when I'm running in the district,
[02:07:27.200 --> 02:07:32.480]   I talk about wealth inequality and healthcare costs and housing and affordability and mass
[02:07:32.480 --> 02:07:38.840]   transportation, which is broken, but you know, really any politician has to find a base
[02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:40.720]   to fundraise from.
[02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:45.880]   And for me, because we're raising on issues like privacy and net neutrality and encryption
[02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:51.080]   and, you know, all these engineering issues, I sleep so well at night, Leo, because this
[02:07:51.080 --> 02:07:53.520]   is, this is stuff that should have a place, right?
[02:07:53.520 --> 02:07:54.520]   I agree.
[02:07:54.520 --> 02:07:55.520]   I agree.
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:56.520]   And I'm very glad to support you.
[02:07:56.520 --> 02:07:59.920]   And really, the most important support comes from the voters in the Massachusetts State
[02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:05.600]   District. You'll have a choice in September, please, please, whatever your opinion, vote.
[02:08:05.600 --> 02:08:08.480]   That's all we can, you know, that's to me the big thing.
[02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:09.480]   Everybody needs to vote.
[02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:10.480]   Absolutely.
[02:08:10.480 --> 02:08:12.400]   No more sitting on your hands.
[02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:14.280]   It does make a difference.
[02:08:14.280 --> 02:08:18.160]   And whoever you're going to vote for, all we ask is vote.
[02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:19.160]   Yep.
[02:08:19.160 --> 02:08:20.360]   You're great with that.
[02:08:20.360 --> 02:08:21.360]   Thank you, Brianna.
[02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:22.360]   Thank you.
[02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:23.360]   Oh, so great to see you again.
[02:08:23.360 --> 02:08:25.000]   Jeff, canada, congratulations on your second.
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000]   You're happy Father's Day.
[02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:28.000]   Thank you.
[02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.000]   Yeah.
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:30.000]   Appreciate that.
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:31.000]   Yeah.
[02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:32.000]   Yeah.
[02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:35.640]   Really, it's great to follow you on Instagram and see the pictures and, and, and, and
[02:08:35.640 --> 02:08:38.200]   it's so fun being here.
[02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:39.600]   It's been a while, but I'm glad that.
[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:40.800]   It's a bit of a bit of a, yeah.
[02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:41.800]   Yeah.
[02:08:41.800 --> 02:08:42.800]   Wonderful.
[02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:43.800]   I don't know why we labeled you the game guy.
[02:08:43.800 --> 02:08:45.000]   You're more than that, obviously.
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:48.640]   I like to think I'm more than that as well, but I appreciate it.
[02:08:48.640 --> 02:08:49.880]   Five by five games.
[02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:50.880]   It's all fun talking games.
[02:08:50.880 --> 02:08:55.600]   Dot TV slash DLC and of course slash film that I think the vendors can be on next week.
[02:08:55.600 --> 02:08:56.600]   Oh, right on.
[02:08:56.600 --> 02:08:58.320]   Yeah, the slash film podcast is great.
[02:08:58.320 --> 02:09:03.480]   If you love movies, what is, what is the most recent subject?
[02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:06.760]   We are doing the Incredibles 2 actually tomorrow morning.
[02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:09.120]   We'll be recording the Incredibles 2 review.
[02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:10.120]   Have you seen it?
[02:09:10.120 --> 02:09:11.120]   Do you like it?
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:12.120]   I have.
[02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:13.120]   I liked it a lot.
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:14.120]   Yeah, it's really good.
[02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:16.200]   Smashing bat box office records, right?
[02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:17.200]   It is.
[02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:18.200]   Wow.
[02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:19.760]   It is absolutely over performing.
[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:23.400]   It's $180 million for the opening weekend.
[02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:24.400]   Wow.
[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:25.400]   It's huge.
[02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:28.720]   But the pen up demand for a sequel to the Incredibles.
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:30.920]   15 years it took him to make it.
[02:09:30.920 --> 02:09:31.920]   That is a long way.
[02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:32.920]   It was a great movie.
[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:33.920]   It was amazing.
[02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:34.920]   Isn't that lovely?
[02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:35.920]   I love it.
[02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:40.120]   I highly recommend people rewatch the first one if they're planning to see the second one
[02:09:40.120 --> 02:09:41.720]   because I'm so glad I did.
[02:09:41.720 --> 02:09:45.600]   I rewatch the first one right before seeing it and it picks up right where the first one
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:47.240]   leaves off, which is pretty neat.
[02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:49.200]   What do you think the big summer movie will be?
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:50.520]   Is this it?
[02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:51.720]   I think it was already.
[02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:52.720]   It's already.
[02:09:52.720 --> 02:09:53.720]   Solar.
[02:09:53.720 --> 02:09:54.720]   No infinity war.
[02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:55.720]   Yeah.
[02:09:55.720 --> 02:09:56.720]   Yeah.
[02:09:56.720 --> 02:09:57.720]   It's a little kind of wonderful.
[02:09:57.720 --> 02:09:58.720]   It did pretty well, didn't it?
[02:09:58.720 --> 02:09:59.720]   Yeah.
[02:09:59.720 --> 02:10:00.720]   Yeah.
[02:10:00.720 --> 02:10:01.720]   It did pretty well.
[02:10:01.720 --> 02:10:02.720]   Yeah.
[02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:03.720]   It did pretty well.
[02:10:03.720 --> 02:10:05.720]   We still have a Jurassic World coming out next week.
[02:10:05.720 --> 02:10:06.720]   Oh, yeah.
[02:10:06.720 --> 02:10:08.520]   Well, summer is almost here.
[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:09.520]   It arrives Thursday.
[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:16.520]   I hope everybody has a wonderful last few days of spring and we will see you next summer.
[02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:17.800]   Thank you very much for joining us.
