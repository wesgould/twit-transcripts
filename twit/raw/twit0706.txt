[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.760]   Hi, Lindsay.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.760]   Hi.

[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.640]   Is there a distinction between CNET and all the tech sites?
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.640]   Sure.

[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.400]   Technica in charge of culture. I'm still over at a arse technica in charge of culture but sometimes
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.520]   I come on the twit.tv and hang out with some really nice folks. Yeah we love they don't even
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.160]   offer me any whiskey in exchange or Sam you might have seen him. One day one day the technology
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.200]   will be there we encourage you to supply your own whiskey and yeah and sip with us however or it'll
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.800]   be like the end of William Gibson's all tomorrow's parties we have the right printer next thing you
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.800]   know you just enter in the thing and out guys the product yes. I don't know about that that
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.400]   sounds like fun that's the future though right. That is the future. Yeah okay I just should.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.640]   Sometimes well the future is here as he said the future is not evenly distributed and I thought
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.880]   maybe William had a kind of like sentiment insight to insights so Sam has a pile of tech culture
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.320]   sitting behind him and I think it's going to be part of the game during the show today to see
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:13.240]   whether it falls on his head. No I hope not. This is centimeters away the perspective is
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.600]   definitely centimeters. If he gets bonked by starry starry night. Will know. There's no earthquakes
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.160]   right now. That's actually it's hard to see in the camera but that is a bit super mario starry night.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.200]   Oh that's amazing. You kind of make out level one one of super mario brothers on it. Wow that's
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.560]   really cool. I don't even know. I did not paint it. You don't live any place that's earthquake prone to
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.240]   you. Seattle. Oh no. Were you.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.960]   You just did that. We've been waiting for someone to pull out the jinx. Were you in
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.440]   snowpocalypse earlier? Yeah earlier. Now it's melt meltmelt.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.840]   Meltip's. My apocalypse from the melting.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:59.320]   So Seattle that's I think there's a couple of big companies there. Boeing is one and Amazon
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:05.880]   is another. Amazon apparently not totally beloved in Seattle. What is the overall climate for
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.560]   Amazon in Seattle? I really look forward to seeing these little drone trash cans start
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:19.160]   rolling around. How are our citizens react to them. There is a spheres in the middle of downtown
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.560]   Seattle in the South Lake Union neighborhood where Amazon has a lot of buildings already.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.640]   The sphere is being this Amazon leaning biosphere concept where there are plants and
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:35.080]   meeting rooms and coffee and citizens call those Bezos Bezos balls.
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:42.520]   Which it takes a lot to say. So you know he flunks them down in the middle of some of the most
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.160]   prime real estate in all of the city. That's kind of how to sum it up.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.880]   Of course rents are higher now because of all those Amazon people right and property values.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.240]   Do you ever feel like you're just you're all just guinea pigs for Amazon?
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.720]   But didn't just kind of accept it because it's been so long. I mean I helped participate in the
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:08.440]   guinea pigging of their gig economy flex driver service where when you live in a prime now city
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.320]   there were people who get paid 17 bucks an hour give or take to wear and tear their own cars
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:20.120]   and deliver your dog food. Wow yeah yeah. We now have they've I think that they were doing that
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.760]   here but now they look like they're all prime vans. I'm sure there's still gig economy driving.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.520]   I had somebody deliver something the other day and I it really looked like she just got out of the
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:34.200]   camera. Yeah it's really weird it's some unmarked vehicle. Yeah this happened to me last week so.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:39.880]   I've gotten to know my driver though she's really cute. It's fun. Yeah and she works hard and I
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.960]   think she's supporting some kids and but yeah I'm glad that they got her a fan.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.960]   Well I got curious about car sales for 2018 just because I wanted to see if they're trending up or
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.160]   trending down and what one of the things that happened in the past year is more people bought
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.040]   SUVs and minivans. That's what happened every year for last decade. Well no this was no this is
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.640]   actually it was it's actually going on. It was a little bit of a flip. It's good news for the car
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.320]   companies because it's higher margins but what I was wondering is if people are buying these cars
[00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.560]   because they see them as investments in the gig economy. Since if you can carry more passengers
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:17.560]   or more cargo then you can work for Amazon or Lyft. That's why we bought an Audi 8L so I can
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:23.160]   drive a little Uber and Lyft in my spare time and I think it's nice. People like the comfort
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:29.160]   in the back. It's lots of legroom and I've been mostly positive tipping is still a problem.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:35.800]   Only reason I bring this up is because Amazon is not going to be in Long Island City after all.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:44.040]   This is this so I don't know what do you think it seems a little like I'm taking my ball and
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.800]   going home. In fact I think that's what Mayor Lazio said. I'll meet the press today.
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:54.280]   Yeah I mean it seems like Amazon was like oh this whole past year of them posturing about this
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:59.080]   seemed like much to do about not. There was a huge search for aged data. But it was a great data
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.240]   collection. They got information about all these cities. They got everybody under NDA. They have
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.480]   all of this information that their competitors do not have. They can now use that. Oh what?
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.480]   And they also know what cities are willing to do to have them there. Yeah exactly.
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.480]   Well and that's of course the issue at hand was that there were three billion dollars in tax
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.400]   incentives. That doesn't mean money that they were giving Amazon. It means that they would pay
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:25.240]   that much less in taxes over a period of time. But you know the timing for this was especially
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:30.360]   I don't want to say unfortunate but it felt a little tone deaf because we've seen such a
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.840]   stratification of economies and jobs. And so for Amazon to come in and say guess what? We're
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.680]   bringing these jobs in. Twenty five thousand jobs. You probably won't be able to get one of these jobs
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.040]   and you also probably will not be able to afford your rent once we're done.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:46.040]   Yeah so we're going to push it. That's what happened in Seattle right? We pushed you out.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.720]   And this has been percolating through New York for the past decade too where there's been a
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:54.760]   growing sense that people are getting pushed out thanks to the influx of money that's washing
[00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.040]   through the global economy. And so you had a lot of people who were like wait a minute. This isn't
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:03.560]   my city anymore. And you've given it to a corporation that's not going to give us anything in return.
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:09.080]   So I sort of wondered if New York actually was too much of of there was too much employer
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:14.200]   competition for Amazon. And then the end in New York it's pretty easy to take a job with one of
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:20.440]   a bazillion large corporations. Amazon couldn't be king in that setting. Virginia maybe a little
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:26.680]   bit more especially with so many former government workers not cycling back into government work
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.400]   right now. Yeah and that's the thing about the places they picked New York and DC. They picked
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.640]   those because they wanted to hold some finance and retail up in New York and then they wanted
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.360]   to make sure that they could provision the government with the rest of the federal contractors inside
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:45.240]   the Beltway. And that's and in Virginia that's just the cost of doing business as far as everybody's
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.880]   consumer. No Virginia is the other HQ2 that they are going ahead. And the erstwhile Crystal City I
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.920]   believe it's being renamed. I cannot remember what they're calling it but when I was finishing high
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.920]   school in that area the development was called Crystal City. And it's right next to National
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:04.680]   Airport. It's on at least one major metro line the blue it's really close to the Pentagon.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:09.320]   And thanks to security regulations and things like that if you're going to service those
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.640]   contracts it helps to have people on the ground there. Amazon says that's going to proceed as
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:19.400]   planned. You said the jobs would not go to New Yorkers at 25,000 jobs. Who would they go to?
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.600]   They're going to go to college graduates or they're going to go to high skilled tech
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.880]   people. They're too skilled. Well yeah they're going to go to high skilled tech people who would
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:31.560]   otherwise be working in the Bay Area or in Seattle or in DC or in Austin or possibly Atlanta.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:36.120]   So it's a gentrification of Long Island City that the residents didn't seem to want. The
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:42.120]   governor wanted it. The mayor wanted it but there was ground ground swell up opposition.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.120]   Yeah a lot of civic resistance. But it feels like Amazon was a little bit of a snowflake here.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.680]   Like they said oh you don't like it okay fine we'll leave. Yeah. Couldn't they take a little heat?
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:55.960]   I felt maybe they've replied their hand. I don't know. They did. I mean by choosing two cities in
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.320]   the first place they spread themselves out. I mean we all thought it was going to be one and then it
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:04.360]   was two and then they. Three actually because they're also building that 5,000 person center in
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:09.720]   is that Austin Memphis Memphis. Because Tennessee between Memphis and Knoxville those are ground
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:14.520]   zero for FedEx is there. I believe UPS is a pretty big outpost there. That's where you have a lot
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:19.560]   of logistics talent and so if Amazon's going to double down on that part of their market they're
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:25.560]   going to want to be where the aggregation of talent is. And pretty soon everything's going to be
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:31.720]   owned by Amazon. I mean. Nashville is and Nashville is becoming a huge draw for college graduates.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.320]   So that's another place where you're going to it'll be easy to aggregate talent and to
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.000]   poach it from other companies because there's not that much difference between the cities and
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.240]   Tennessee. So you used to work at FedEx moved to Nashville where Amazon's going to be.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:49.160]   So I'm just curious to have because you live in Amazon town. Yeah I have context to offer. I did
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:54.440]   work for them for four months. That's a Googleable story. Readers feel free to type my last name
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:59.320]   and Billy Ray Cyrus. It's a long funny tale. That was back in 2007. But.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:04.600]   Do you still have a breaky heart after those years? It's a great story I promise you. But.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:12.280]   The thing is this is a company that has proven in its time in the in Washington state to not
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:18.200]   contribute much more than the bare minimum in terms of one of the biggest stories that came out
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:23.720]   of the past year in Seattle was a huge push and organic push from some of the really really radically
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:29.720]   left leaning city council members for a head tax that basically established a certain amount of
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:35.080]   more tax for companies in Seattle who make certain amount of money per year and have a certain number
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.720]   employees per year. We're a regressive state. We don't have state income tax Seattle has a tax
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:45.080]   shortfall all of the time. Amazon was one of the prime leaders in terms of funneling money into
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.560]   opposition groups doing it in such a way that journalists had to dig up and find that that was
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:55.640]   the case. Isn't there a Seattle city tax of people making more than 250,000 a year or am I mistaken?
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:02.440]   I'm not I can't help you with the entire tax code. So yeah. But. Can you help me Sam? I've done
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.440]   my time. Oh yeah. We need you. You mean. Sorry. Talk about it. But.
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:14.120]   Company known for a lack of general giving back either in arts or in city and state value.
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:20.360]   In that way. And then also the hiring does tend to just bring in a lot of people from out of state
[00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:25.640]   who are the pattern tends to be by up in the middle of the city, disrupt and then leave.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:30.120]   It's a lot of people who come in for two, three, four years, cash out, get burnt out and get the
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.600]   heck out and the result has been it's a hard thing to write about. The stranger was my former
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:39.000]   employer here in Seattle and all week in paper and they have chronicled at length a lot of the
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.640]   sort of cultural and human cost that comes with Amazon. So I think there's a lot of that that
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:48.200]   gets lost in the headlines when a city like New York says, what is this employer going to do?
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.560]   What are they going to do with their money and what's the cultural impact going to be? So
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.760]   that's been the biggest thing I've noticed. I've been here only 12 years. I'm also sort of a
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:59.320]   transient. But when I moved here, I could afford to live on $11,000 a year scrapping by and that
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.200]   Seattle is no longer anywhere in that kind of place. So this.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:08.200]   I have a quick question. How because you've got Amazon Microsoft used to be the big tech gorilla
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:13.160]   in the area. How are Microsoft is perceived in Seattle relative to Amazon people?
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:18.200]   I think there's a perception more of philanthropy and more of spreading out. There's also the
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.920]   bridge culture, the East Siders. If you go east of Seattle, you end up in towns like Bellevue and
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:28.200]   Redmond where Microsoft has a lot of campuses. So I think that to some extent sort of changed it.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:33.560]   It was a lot of local engineer culture people. Mostly because Boeing had been here sort of
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:37.640]   establishing that culture for decades. So it wasn't, you know, there are lots of international
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:42.840]   hires that came in as a result to desert diversify the technological culture within
[00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:47.960]   Microsoft, which I think is good. But then Microsoft has generally been more on the up and up and
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.720]   giving money to University of Washington, giving money to city and state initiatives.
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:57.000]   The perception is generally, yeah, there is an economic impact that's both good and bad.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.240]   And Amazon has been perceived as a lot less balanced.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:03.480]   Well, that was my other question was if there was a really tight time between UW and Microsoft
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:07.320]   and that helped foster a feeling of being better integrated into the Seattle as a community.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:07.320]   Sure.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.520]   Or maybe Amazon has.
[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:12.600]   I remember a college boyfriend of mine got recruited or was, you know, he didn't end up going.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.040]   But he was recruited by Microsoft out of school in Boston.
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.080]   And there was a lot of that going on.
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.760]   But I think it was kind of Cambridge at Harvard.
[00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:28.760]   I often say I went to school in Connecticut for the same.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.320]   It's just you're like, I don't want to talk about it.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:36.360]   But they did recruit at the time in the 90s, a very long time ago,
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:39.160]   they did recruit people from out of state heavily. It was the same thing.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:44.680]   College graduates from out of state. But I think that it was the boom hadn't quite happened yet.
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:45.160]   Seattle.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.360]   It didn't seem bad.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.320]   Culture clash.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:51.560]   Is it that these San Francisco complaints all the time and part of its money, part of it,
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.360]   you're just being forced out, the rents are too high. You can't buy a house.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.400]   But also part of its culture, like you don't want to monoculture.
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.520]   San Francisco, which used to be this great diverse city, has become a monoculture.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.360]   Yeah, really. It's so boring now.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.000]   It's boring.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.400]   It is. And you go out in San Francisco to a bar or a restaurant.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.200]   We went to that tech TV reunion, Mike remembers that.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.800]   And it was just a bunch of yuppies from startups around.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.040]   And it was cold, so they were wearing blankets.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.720]   The bar provided them with blankets.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.840]   And it just seemed like a...
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:24.200]   It was like, go home. This is San Francisco.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.200]   Get rid of the blanket.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:31.560]   The hiring that happens at companies like Amazon, I think drives a cultural glut,
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:37.080]   where you have folks who are 29 to 35, who have a ton of money, who are primarily male.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.400]   And they've got a lot of money, and they're hitting up these condos in the middle of the city.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:44.360]   So it's expensive addictions to whiskey.
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:49.000]   That's sort of the culture I've perceived from my friends who date around Seattle.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.480]   And they flip through apps, and it's just boring guys who think having whiskey and going hiking once a month is their personality.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.800]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.360]   I'm not sure.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.320]   I'm not sure.
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.360]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.240]   Well, you're talking.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.280]   I'm used to this in Seattle.
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:12.440]   Well, as long as we're piling on, the story came out this week also that Amazon,
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:22.040]   despite making gobs of money, $11.2 billion in 2018, double what they made the year before paid 0,
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:27.000]   0 in federal income taxes.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.880]   That's of course because they have losses, right?
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.000]   They offset the taxes.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:31.720]   This is the law.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.680]   They're not breaking the law.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.200]   They're not stealing.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.280]   But at the same time, it's the same kind of sense of you're taken.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.320]   You've built a business, an incredibly profitable business.
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:45.400]   Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, Amazon at one point, worth more than a trillion dollars.
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.280]   And you're not giving back.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:52.680]   I always try to look for the silver lining when I think about these basis.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.400]   He's always gone for the long game, very long game.
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:58.840]   I'm hoping one day he wakes up and he pulls a pull the bill gates and is like,
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.760]   all right, time to put all of this back.
[00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:03.000]   But I have seen nothing.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.280]   Gates didn't do that, right?
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.680]   He didn't do anything for remember?
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.000]   We would talk about this all the time about 15 years ago.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.520]   And now he doesn't give.
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.080]   He doesn't give.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:11.640]   He doesn't give.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.200]   He's woke.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.880]   And now he's woke bill gates where there was an interview I was reading in the Los Angeles
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:20.200]   time this morning where he and Melinda were saying, look, they're talking about there's
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:24.200]   a nationalist case being made for globalism because it can boost economies.
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:28.920]   Data is inherently gender biased, so we need to find ways to eliminate that.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.000]   You're talking about the letter that he and Melinda sent out.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:31.480]   Exactly.
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.920]   And this is a thing he does now.
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.440]   This is also the dude who released a bunch of live mosquitoes in Davosol.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.320]   Yeah, remember Andrew Carnegie built a lot of libraries too.
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:43.480]   I mean, there's a, I think as you get older, you start to fear death mortality.
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:45.160]   Well, I don't think Bezos will.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:49.720]   I think he may end up either funding a massive cryogenics effort, so he's like a headman.
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.680]   He's not going to die.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.240]   He's not going to die.
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:51.720]   That's the problem.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.160]   Or he's going to like, we're going to discover he's been building a moon base.
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.480]   Sure, but he has also been investing heavily in journalism to his credit.
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.680]   It's Washington Post.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.920]   I mean, he's been pouring money into it and they have been growing quickly and doing very
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.480]   good work.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:10.440]   And in fact, they were the ones to report this this morning or yesterday to report this tax
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.000]   to you.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   Right.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.280]   Isn't it interesting?
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.440]   But on the other hand, I also feel like...
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.760]   That's to the credit of both the Washington Post and Jeff Bezos.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.360]   He wants it to be profitable though.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:19.880]   He's not investing in the Washington Post.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.400]   But you contrast that, for example, BuzzFeed had that series of high profile layoffs and
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:27.720]   I kept checking the site to see how they were covering their own story because it was a story.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.520]   They didn't cover it.
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.720]   They didn't have anything until after they were able to unionize and then they finally
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.240]   ran it as a news story.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.560]   And so I'd say that Washington Post is doing a lot of things right, whether or not Bezos
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.400]   is a hands-off leader or...
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.560]   I have heard that he is hands-off.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.000]   That he's in totally hands-off other than the business part of it.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:45.960]   That he's not...
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.600]   He has not been sticking his nose into the journalism.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.120]   But you contrast that with something like Ian, how BuzzFeed didn't cover its layoffs,
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.400]   which were a huge story.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:53.880]   Sure.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.760]   And I think a lot of the people who would have covered the last got laid off.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.440]   I'm not joking.
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.400]   No, that actually is what it was.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.080]   They really, yeah, they decimated the news.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:01.960]   It was rough.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.280]   It was...
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.800]   We'd cover it, but nobody's left.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:04.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.560]   All right.
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:08.040]   I just...
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:15.160]   You know, this is kind of the tenor of the year and also somewhat of the second half of 2018 was
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.040]   the big five.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:16.520]   Five.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:22.600]   The fangs are too big and too irresponsible.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.240]   And we've got to do something about Facebook, Amazon,
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:27.880]   Microsoft.
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.880]   Hey, remember when Microsoft got busted for antitrust just for bundling a browser with their
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.440]   operating tools?
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.280]   No, we're talking about that the other day.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:34.440]   Right.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:35.160]   Do you remember that?
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:35.640]   Yes.
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.120]   It was...
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.080]   That was misguided.
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:37.800]   It was a century, remember?
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:38.840]   That was misguided.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:38.840]   But I could see.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:39.960]   It went on for years.
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.960]   It ended up in Europe with the ballot, a browser ballot,
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.040]   where were you installed Windows for the first time and said,
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.520]   "Well, which browser would you like to use?"
[00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.000]   Which was a dopey solution.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.160]   It didn't change anything.
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.440]   So that was misguided.
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.160]   Oh, I don't necessarily think it was guided.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.360]   I just think that it was...
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:01.640]   They look at the metric, but you look at the bar that they had to...
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.280]   You look at the bar that was set for, is this an antitrust case or not?
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:09.560]   And then you contrast that with the way companies are operating and you have to ask yourself,
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.720]   "Why are we not seeing..."
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:13.400]   Well, Europe is still going after these guys.
[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.200]   Europe is, yeah.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:19.560]   And Google recently released guidance saying our profits are likely to get hit thanks to GDPR
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.840]   and increase regulation.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:23.320]   That's fine.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:27.560]   Because it's going to affect how much information we can gather and then monetize.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:31.960]   I think that's true for almost any major international company as being affected by GDPR.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.880]   Well, the thing I'm going to be wondering about is how are they going to lean on American users
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.200]   and consumers to make up the profit shortfall?
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.600]   Because we don't have those protections.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.640]   So we are basically sitting ducks as users.
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.200]   Oh, you think we're going to end up paying the fines, basically?
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:50.280]   Well, at least Amazon bought a Euro.
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.720]   Okay.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.720]   I know a lot of people who are not very happy about that.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.960]   Anything to say about people who work at a Euro?
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:05.160]   I think that this, I can't quite see how it's going to come together yet.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:09.320]   But I have an Euro router and I have all the...
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.720]   Show us just disclaim, Euro is a sponsor.
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.160]   And I too have an Euro router.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.760]   I love my Euro.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.120]   I love mine too.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:16.600]   It's new.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.600]   I'm enjoying it.
[00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:24.280]   I think that there's a lot of potential for Amazon's digital assistant to get much better.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:33.320]   And this may be a way to put legs into sensing what else is going on in a more sophisticated way
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:33.800]   than ever.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:34.360]   Oh, the upside is...
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.480]   ...than everyone's currently able to do for the...
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:36.520]   For the upside is clear.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.960]   The upside for them is clear.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:38.440]   Sure.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.600]   But isn't it also concerning?
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.960]   This is more of the same.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:42.840]   Nothing is neutral anymore.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.960]   Well, your Euro knows, as you know, if you look at the Euro app,
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.200]   it knows every single device that's in your house.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:48.600]   Sure.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:48.920]   Exactly.
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.280]   And how much you use it.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.280]   When it's on, when it's off, when you're home,
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:56.520]   because you join the router, when you leave, and Amazon will have all that data.
[00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.120]   You know why Amazon wants that?
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:04.120]   Because Google is at this point, I neck and neck with Amazon in terms of fingers into the smart home.
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.640]   Google already knows everything about you.
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:06.120]   That's true.
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.160]   Google knows all that stuff and Amazon is at a disadvantage.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:12.840]   And it's kind of too bad that both of these platforms know this much about you.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.680]   But that is why Amazon's doing it.
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.680]   They need to know as much as Google does.
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:24.120]   My Amazon birdies tell me basically that just the amount of money that Echo devices drives means
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:30.120]   there are so many different teams that are all battling to pitch and make whatever the next thing
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:30.360]   is.
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.800]   Meaning there's just skunk works going on for all kinds of different stuff.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:39.000]   And we saw a hint of that at an event last year where they unveiled the Amazon Echo Wall
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.560]   Clock and the Amazon Echo Microwave.
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.560]   The clock was just recalled this week.
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:43.880]   Yeah.
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.000]   It wasn't working.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.600]   What I'd actually keep an eye on too is the Amazon Small Business Bundle where you set up your mesh
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:56.120]   wireless network plus some voice activated speakers and it's things like schedule this client meeting,
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:00.760]   send out this email at this time, and you help people automate small home offices.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.480]   Sam, do you think that you tie them into the Amazon cloud that way?
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.840]   Because the cloud can host everything.
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:08.520]   And this is how they build out their non-retail customer and keep them that way is by tying it
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:08.920]   into a hardware.
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.200]   And compete with Google, which is already--
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.440]   Sam, the Euro acquisition has to do with Echo.
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:13.000]   You think that that's--
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:13.560]   Absolutely.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.160]   Understanding the Echo ecosystem.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:18.040]   Meaning that the purse strings are totally open.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.880]   So if anybody on that team says, we're going to create the total perfect thing,
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.720]   we want to be able to ship somebody something in a box via amazon.com,
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:30.040]   everything that they need to continue to do all the stuff that gets promoted.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:35.160]   Even if that ends up polluting and diluting this pool of IoT nonsense,
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:40.440]   and in my opinion, makes it more complicated, everyone still wants to be the one stop.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:44.360]   And they're getting closer and closer with how many people bought up those dots.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:50.200]   Dot sales absolutely set Amazon on a five-year path of just capitalizing on that while they have
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:50.360]   that.
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:55.560]   I have that question in every room of my house, and I have euros in on many of the rooms in my house.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.840]   I cannot believe you do that.
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:57.720]   That's insane.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.440]   Yeah, I don't have any smart home devices activated in my house.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.000]   Really?
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.200]   Really, I shouldn't have those?
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:02.760]   Because--
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.120]   Well, I also have Google Homes.
[00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:04.920]   We have this--
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.480]   We even have a Cortana in my living room.
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:09.400]   If we think-- I have an Amazon.
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.600]   It's a personal decision, personal decision and all that.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.080]   But--
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:14.360]   But maybe I'm an informed.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:20.200]   None of the fang companies are forthcoming with what they're collecting,
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:24.680]   when they're recording and when they're not, how that data is secured,
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:29.400]   how it's tied to your ID or not to your ID, how it's bundled, who it's sold to,
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:29.880]   how they're going to do it.
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:30.440]   What are they going to do with this thing?
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.000]   They don't give you the opportunity.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.280]   What are you worried about that they're going to do?
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.320]   They mark it to you.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.640]   In ways that you don't necessarily want to end.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.360]   What if my echo one desk says, oh, hi, Leo.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.440]   I see that one of your Hue lights has burned out.
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.560]   Would you like to buy another one?
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.640]   Oh, I mean, they're already on that way.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.760]   They've already got a bad thing now?
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.360]   No, no, necessarily.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:51.960]   I mean, there are-- but there are other privacy implications when it comes to law enforcement.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:57.800]   Well, basically, the best-- the most revealing stuff is when you see the subpoenas that get sent to you.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.360]   Yeah, but I'm carrying my pocket.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.640]   I mean, set the roof on to a ton of data.
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:05.480]   I would submit your wall carry in your pocket in a microphone and a camera.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.080]   That's what we connected to the internet.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:10.520]   So honestly, does it really matter that I also have a microphone in my living room?
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.400]   Yes.
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:15.800]   I think it's the TOS that you sign when you install that Amazon device.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.080]   That is what's scarier.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:21.560]   I mean, with my cell phone, I do everything I can to lock down microphone and camera access.
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:21.960]   And Lord knows how--
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.800]   You are so rare, though, Sam.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:28.600]   I think that for 98% of people, Leo's point is absolutely apt.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.320]   You're being heard anyway.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:31.800]   It's just--
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:32.680]   Being heard anyway.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.280]   It is almost inescapable.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:34.760]   Yeah.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:38.520]   But the reason I bring this up is when you talk about law enforcement.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.600]   Law enforcement is not going to subpoena my echo or maybe they are because they have it,
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:43.160]   but they--
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.160]   Well, most likely, they're going to go after my phone.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:49.400]   I guess what I mean is that the subpoenas sort of indicate how much wealth of data they have.
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.160]   But again, you mentioned GDPR.
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.640]   How do they make up for that data shortfall?
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:57.960]   I mean, once you have as much data as Amazon has about your shopping habits,
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.000]   about your geolocation, depending on the app you have installed,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.920]   about when you talk to your phone or when you talk to your echoes,
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:09.400]   these are-- they want-- the more of these triangulation points they have,
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.360]   the further they go.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.760]   And that doesn't mean it's going to necessarily be anti-consumer or terrible or dystopian.
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:21.080]   But it's just a whole giant world out there of how crazy, weird, bad, and penetrative this stuff
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.840]   can be in ways we don't know.
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.680]   And then once every nine months, we see a story from a company like Facebook that says,
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.000]   whoop, see some of that data went away and away.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:29.240]   Well--
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:29.240]   Well--
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:29.640]   We didn't mean--
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.440]   Sorry about that.
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:30.920]   You'll agree.
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.480]   You'll have a deal, though.
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.120]   Facebook pays fast and lose place fast and lose to that data.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.440]   I don't have a Facebook account anymore because of that.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.240]   That I agree with.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.840]   But also, I don't need a Facebook account.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:41.080]   And I never gained anything of real value from it.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:45.640]   But if my Amazon spot can say, hey, I noticed your whiskey bottle is a little low,
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.560]   would you like me to order another one?
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.840]   That's valuable.
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.720]   It is valuable unless-- here's the counter argument.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.840]   I tend to agree with you.
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.560]   And I've got-- or at least I'm very fatalistic about it.
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:56.920]   This ship has sailed.
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:57.960]   I can tell that--
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:58.520]   That's kind of skill.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.800]   My data has been trying--
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:00.280]   You should give up.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:00.920]   --to tell me times--
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:01.800]   You think we should give up?
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.920]   No, I don't think we should give up.
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.800]   That doesn't mean I haven't given up.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.720]   But in any case--
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:06.400]   I'd give up.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.040]   But that's my job.
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.280]   I think that there's an opportunity cost that comes into play here.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.280]   So Amazon may say, hey, your whiskey's out.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.480]   Do you want to order more?
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:17.360]   You may say, oh, yeah, sure.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.760]   But the reality is, there might be another whiskey out there that you like more,
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:26.120]   that costs less, that you're not looking for because Amazon made it too convenient for you.
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:30.360]   And that's a cost that I think is a real consumer cost that we're all going to start to feel over time.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:35.160]   We are already seeing that because there have been research reports published where
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:40.360]   it's Amazon already waits search results so that their choices for you,
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:45.240]   based on your buying history and based on cost per unit, are weighted higher than what might actually be the best--
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:45.960]   Oh, yeah, we saw that.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:46.600]   --of the consumer value.
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.080]   That's right.
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.320]   You may not get the lowest price because you spend more money.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.360]   So we're going to give you a--
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:50.520]   Exactly.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:54.200]   --in fact, algorithmically, we might even bump the price before we serve you the page.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:54.760]   Exactly.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.600]   So you have that.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.640]   Again, it comes down to--
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:58.360]   That's a little scary.
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.160]   I can't do it.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.840]   --and let us have a literal cost.
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:01.560]   That's a cost.
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.240]   And there's another thing to consider.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:06.840]   And this was actually a piece that Heather Kelly wrote for CNN this past week,
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:11.160]   which is, if all of these companies are making money off of the data that you're generating,
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:12.600]   why aren't you getting a cut?
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.400]   It's your data.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.600]   It's your product.
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.560]   Why are they repackaging you and selling it back to you?
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.240]   I just wanted to pay federal taxes.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:23.160]   How would it work to give me a cut of my information?
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.200]   I mean, there are moves.
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.680]   But I feel like they're tilting at windmills.
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.360]   I feel like they're exotic.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.520]   Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the Worldwide Web,
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:34.120]   has a company that he started that will somehow, magically,
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.600]   take all your personal data, lock it away,
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.360]   and then dole it out to the companies for payment.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.920]   I don't see that ever happening.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:44.200]   Well, I want somebody to sell me a TV for $200.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.560]   That's what I want.
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.320]   Yeah, but what kind of TV would you get for $200?
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.760]   That's a very nice--
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:49.960]   A TV that watches me.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.760]   A very nice TCL TV that's made in China.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.040]   As a matter of fact, they're surprisingly inexpensive.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.960]   Oh, they're so inexpensive.
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:00.600]   And they try to get everything that you watch and do.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.960]   So what? I don't care.
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:04.360]   They were jacking me.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.760]   I care if the Chinese know I watch the Umbrella Academy.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:07.720]   What does that matter?
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:09.560]   Seriously.
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.000]   When you start getting the advertisements,
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.840]   if you like this comic, then you'll like that.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.680]   Look, we're already getting advertisements
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.280]   on every possible surface.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.240]   I mean, I would rather have advertising about stuff,
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.760]   at least I'm interested in buying.
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:24.760]   What's actually interesting, I'm a KQED supporter.
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:27.720]   And I got a pin code for a pledge free stream
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.760]   during this last pledge.
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.040]   Oh, hello, you finally.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:31.480]   Because if you donate a certain amount,
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:34.040]   then they'll give you a pin and you don't have to hear
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:37.080]   those poor guys going, and we'll give you the Aton, Han, and--
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.280]   Just out of curiosity.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.880]   Who sponsors Masterpiece Theater?
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.360]   Viking Cruises.
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.080]   You know why?
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.560]   I know that because they play a goddamn ad
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:49.240]   on this ad free service every time you watch the show.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:49.880]   It's like you've got me.
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:50.840]   I'm just watching McSteve's.
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:51.400]   I don't know whose possible--
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.280]   Yes, see, that's the thing.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.640]   Rick Steves, I bet he has.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.200]   So public television and radio,
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.480]   and I don't fault them.
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.360]   They still make great content, but they're not ad free.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.800]   They're no longer ad free.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.880]   And pledges, just those are the worst.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.160]   Thank God they're giving you a chance.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.640]   That's because they get no public support anymore,
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.400]   but that's from individual users.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.080]   They understand that they have to do it.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:11.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.000]   I know that they have to do it.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.040]   Look, you're going to see ads, no matter what you do.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.080]   Right?
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:20.600]   Unless you-- I don't know if you get offline and you don't watch TV.
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.560]   I-- this is a little bit of a slight change of subject
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.840]   or a shift slightly to the left.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.680]   I will say the upside of all this triangulation
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:27.880]   is that the ads I get--
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:28.360]   Are better.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:30.200]   --especially on Instagram.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.240]   Oh, they're too good.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.000]   I stopped-- I stopped Instagram.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.680]   I just-- I spend too much money.
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.360]   I'm wearing Instagram underwear right now.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.000]   I had to stop.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:37.880]   Instagram underwear.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.160]   I had to stop.
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.000]   I would wake up at three in the morning and buy stuff.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.120]   Right?
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:42.680]   Yes.
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.840]   And that's why the Instagram app is genius,
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:46.840]   because people are like, this is actually fun.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.480]   There is an app-- they have now the shopping app.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:49.960]   And people--
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:50.440]   They do?
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.680]   There's a separate Instagram shopping app.
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.640]   Because people like it so much.
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.000]   It's so effective.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.520]   I mean, so there's that.
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.160]   That's the upside.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:31:59.720]   I buy more--
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.120]   --and this consumer debt has hit New Hall.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:05.240]   You know, in a way, this is a digital divide,
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.360]   the haves and the haves-nots,
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:08.360]   because people can afford to, can pay for
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.920]   ad-free or less ad experience.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.360]   Which is what I do to be honest.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.000]   You pay for it.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:13.320]   I do.
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:16.760]   Well, it was interesting because we stream almost all of our media.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:17.560]   At this point.
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:21.080]   And when we were watching live TV for some--
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.040]   We were watching the Super Bowl.
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:22.840]   That's what we were watching.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.600]   And the ads came on.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.280]   And all of us were just kind of transfixed.
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.800]   Just, oh, what it--
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:28.920]   I've never seen that.
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:29.640]   I hate ads.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:30.840]   No, I hate ads on TV.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:30.920]   Because I--
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.280]   We're like soft and vulnerable.
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:32.680]   Exactly.
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:34.680]   Who?
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.200]   Not being exposed constantly.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:36.600]   But it's--
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.240]   Arstechanagus.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.840]   It takes a lot of advice.
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.440]   I pay for Arstechanica for the same reason.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.280]   We not only-- sorry to interrupt.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:44.200]   Not only do we block ads, but we also--
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.200]   When you pay for it, we also block all the trackers,
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.760]   meaning all that activity that you don't necessarily want
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:49.720]   companies calling.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.200]   I have a very long answer to why we should care about that.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.040]   But otherwise, the show would go on to seven hours or 27 hours.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:54.360]   No, let's hear it.
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.400]   Why should we care about that?
[00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:58.520]   The shortest answer, in my opinion, is that tech companies
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:02.280]   are building to total automation, total machine learning.
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.760]   And they're going to go in directions that we cannot even predict
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.280]   that may really benefit from some sort of government surveillance
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:12.440]   and want to do everything they can to line all of that up one piece at a time
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.120]   until larger companies can take control of our day-to-day lives
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.000]   and profit off of it in that same way when we're just saying,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.440]   why am I not getting money for giving Amazon these little bits of data?
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:26.040]   I think that's going to go up to 1,000 to 1,000,000% more
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:29.720]   because of the kind of cobbling of data and what that leads to
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.160]   for the few giant companies who have all of that in their servers
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.600]   and all of us who do not.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.880]   You're exactly right.
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.440]   It's exactly why they will not be regulated out of this,
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:42.040]   because ultimately, in this post-9/11 world,
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:43.880]   governments want this kind of information.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.400]   And so they're very happy to let these guys continue to do what they do.
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:50.840]   And there's plenty of sci-fi out there about giant corporations running things.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.880]   I mean, oh my god, is Shadowgate is the one that's based in Seattle?
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.760]   It's a pen and paper RPG where its corporation's not government.
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.840]   I mean, you know, we got like a big answer.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:02.200]   That's the world of neuromancer is run by corporations, right?
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:02.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.920]   And if you look at the Blue Ant trilogy,
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.960]   that's the way of thinking he's positing is that corporations are effectively
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.240]   setting cultural agendas.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:12.840]   This is so I interviewed and I mentioned it several times,
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.720]   but it's new to you guys.
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.160]   So I'll say it again.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:20.120]   Susanna Zoboff's new book is surveillance capitalism.
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.720]   Excellent, highly recommended.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:25.400]   And that's exactly what she's concerned about is not,
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:29.240]   it's not, you know, initially we made the deal with a devil because we get free services
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:31.400]   and in return for ads.
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:37.320]   Eventually, we have free services and tracking in return for targeted ads.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.880]   And even at that point, I don't have so much of a problem with it.
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:43.800]   The next step is sort of what Instagram's doing, which is predicting behavior.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:46.120]   It's an excellent book predicting behavior.
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.600]   And then final step is influencing behavior.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:53.720]   And I think we're rapidly moving to that point where they convince you to do something,
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:57.080]   to buy something, to behave a way, to vote a certain way.
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:57.960]   Oh, sure.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.160]   Using these, these.
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:02.280]   Well, you look at how corporations have taken political stances at this point,
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:05.560]   because they've been able to come out of five people's impulses and philosophies.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:09.160]   Or they at the very least look at the last elections and navel.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.880]   Enable shaping our behavior.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:12.520]   Absolutely.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:16.920]   I mean, and that is obvious that our behavior is shaped by the bubbles we place ourselves in
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:20.360]   and then what we allow, what we allow to be kept out.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.240]   Facebook will pay lip service to this, but they don't really,
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:27.320]   you know, they're dealing right now with this issue of whether they allow
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:31.000]   vaxxers to continue to post on Facebook anti-antivaxxers.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.360]   And this is a tough one for Facebook because...
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.800]   Public health versus free speech.
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.040]   Yeah.
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.160]   Direct opposition.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:37.640]   Yeah.
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:41.320]   And honestly, I don't think Facebook wants to ban anything because...
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.280]   It's not their best interest.
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:43.320]   It's not their best interest.
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.760]   Not their corporate interest.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.760]   So they're walking this very fine line.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.280]   They're afraid of government regulation.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.160]   I agree with you, Sam.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:54.360]   It's highly unlikely because there is a very tight partnership between the data
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:59.160]   gatherers and the panopticon in the government that wants to see everything.
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:02.120]   So maybe they don't need to worry about it.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.880]   They also were worried about public opinion.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:07.640]   And clearly, a lot of what Facebook does is to try to assuage public opinion.
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:11.080]   They have made a decision yet on this anti-vaxx issue.
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.920]   I think they decided...
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.240]   I think they did ban a few anti-vaxx groups.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.200]   The problem is...
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.560]   Anti-vax groups are now spreading information among each other as to how to
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.240]   circumvent the conversation.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.320]   God, if only there was a vaccine to stop this from.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:27.800]   It's a really interesting problem.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.840]   And it's just one of a million of these because it's not...
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:35.080]   I mean, and society itself doesn't agree on what to do about this.
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:37.640]   I don't think Facebook has finally decided yet.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:39.800]   It is definitely a public health concern.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:44.120]   We're having measles outbreaks in Seattle, I think, in Texas.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.440]   And kids are children, babies are dying.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:47.560]   Well, here's a question.
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:53.640]   Historically speaking, has Facebook ever engaged with a social issue proactively,
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:57.320]   or has it usually been in reaction to negative press or negative scientists?
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.120]   I think they have their emergency system, right?
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.720]   Where you're at a disaster...
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:02.280]   That can work.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.480]   I think that they didn't do that in response to anybody.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:06.760]   They just thought, "Oh, this is a good idea."
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.360]   Are you sure it wasn't a way for them to gather data?
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.880]   No, seriously.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:11.080]   You're so paranoid.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.040]   I'm not paranoid.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:16.280]   I think the Facebook exists to gather data, repackage it, and monetize it.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.680]   So if they roll out a system where people self-check in after a disaster,
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.840]   how do you think that...
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.120]   What do you think that they could sell it in?
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.800]   I think they're sitting there, eavily.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:26.280]   Yeah, no.
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.320]   I don't think they could...
[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:27.640]   I think that that...
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:28.200]   ...evilly.
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:28.920]   I'm thinking that.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:33.240]   I think that what happens is that there is an actually legitimately positive human
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:37.160]   intention, and then that gets used.
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:40.200]   And then there's a meeting where you say, "Let's talk about the successes of this program."
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:41.320]   They quantify the successes.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:44.360]   And somebody in that meeting says, "Hey, this could help us meet our goals.
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.600]   Let's try to use this as a target."
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:47.560]   It's not in a ferry.
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.440]   It's not malicious.
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:48.840]   No.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:49.960]   It's not malicious.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:50.680]   It's merely...
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:54.520]   It's merely, "Hey, this serves our company's needs."
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.720]   And there's not an incentive to put it into the counter-conscious.
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.440]   That's the problem.
[00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.600]   And I think Zuboff brings this up.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.560]   It's kind of happening in just the natural course of events.
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:07.240]   It doesn't take evil people to create this.
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.920]   It just happens.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:14.040]   And this is the concern with having a few extremely large companies in charge of
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.800]   pretty much everything we do.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:16.440]   It's that...
[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:20.440]   I think what happens is that very rarely, although it's possible that there is a
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:23.160]   malicious leader in charge of those companies,
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:25.880]   it's really more that human behaviors get amplified in any system.
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:26.680]   Exactly.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:28.520]   And human behaviors are self-serving.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:29.320]   We're seeing that happen.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:30.120]   Technology is an application.
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.840]   We're also talking about how people stay in their bubbles.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:37.640]   And I have lost track of the number of B2B conferences I've gone to,
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:42.920]   where I sit in rooms with really smart people who are really devoted to the projects they do.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:44.840]   And they say things excitedly like,
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:48.760]   "Once the systems in place will be able to eliminate 70% of shipping jobs
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.760]   and keep cargo more secure."
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:54.440]   And when I ask, "Well, what happens to the people who used to work in shipping?"
[00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.960]   They say very excitedly.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.760]   They're free to do more imaginative and creative work.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:01.880]   And that's what I'm thinking.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:05.400]   That is what you would like to do if you were freed from your current job.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:10.120]   But you cannot presume that everybody approaches work the same way you do
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.560]   and gets the same thing out of it.
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.080]   Well, and everybody would like to do that.
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:13.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:18.600]   But we so far haven't found a way to make creative work more profitable.
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.440]   We don't have a full employment plan for creatives.
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:23.000]   And maybe not everybody who works does so
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.560]   because they derive their personal identity from it.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:29.320]   Maybe sometimes people just work because it funds the stuff that they do find meaningful.
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.320]   But these are not ideas that are in people's bubbles.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:34.680]   And so these folks in tech are well-meaning.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.960]   But they're coming at it from one really specific reference point.
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.920]   As opposed to taking a look at all of the possible reference points
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.160]   that will be affecting real people in real life.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:46.600]   I want to get back to Leo's kind of initial question about
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:50.040]   Facebook's ability to be proactive.
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:53.080]   And we have example after example after example of no.
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:56.920]   I think discrimination and advertising is the biggest one
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.440]   that just kept on coming back.
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.680]   And Washington State, our attorney general,
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:03.320]   was the one who really just slammed down and said,
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.560]   "We've got you saying you're going to do more,
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.560]   waiting a few months saying you're going to do more."
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:10.040]   And then we have more proof after those two announcements.
[00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.320]   You're still not being proactive.
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.600]   It's almost a parody at this point.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.080]   You can just see it happening.
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:18.920]   And so it's just a company that has never at any point
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:21.640]   really risen up and said anything about,
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.640]   "This is a story that's not in the headlines yet,
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:26.840]   and we really care about it unless it's them saying,
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:29.320]   we really swear virtual reality is going to be a big deal."
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.280]   Like that's as far as they've gotten in being proactive is,
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.800]   "Here's a thing that we've invested in,
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.640]   and we swear you're going to want to spend money in it."
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.880]   That's like as far as they get for being proactive
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:40.040]   about their sense of future and responsibility.
[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.520]   Sure. I mean, I think that Elon Musk is sort of a weird
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:43.400]   exception to that.
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:47.640]   His proactiveness is often just kind of spouting off.
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:51.480]   But he is genuinely concerned about things that could make him alive.
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.960]   More microdosing throughout the tech industry
[00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.080]   would probably be a good thing.
[00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:57.400]   Well, I think that Elon Musk's example is great
[00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:00.600]   because if you put aside all the weird stuff he's done in the middle.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.360]   He follows me everywhere I go though, my Tesla.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.600]   It records every move I make, what pedals I push, what buttons I push.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:08.280]   But this is a dude who's genuinely concerned about energy supply,
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.640]   clean energy, renewable energy.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.200]   And AI.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:10.840]   I agree.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:12.440]   And the ramifications of AI.
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.120]   Although you know there's that whole "Oh, by the way,
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:17.000]   AI can now write your journalism stories better than people can."
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:17.480]   Sure.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.480]   Came out this week, and that was a little unnerving.
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.040]   Honestly.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:24.760]   I don't, I would hate to say, well, Elon's good and Mark's bad.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.080]   No.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:30.920]   Because honestly, I think they all come from a similar ground of being.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:31.480]   Yeah.
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:35.800]   Where they believe in technology, they believe ultimately technology make lives better.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:39.320]   And they don't, I think your bubble in that description is actually very good.
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.560]   They just don't, is that yours?
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.280]   I mean, I think it's our entire industry.
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.880]   But we can take joint ownership.
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:51.400]   In general, that living in the bubble is what keeps them from seeing the consequences
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.480]   of what they see is just, well, this is good.
[00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:55.480]   We're changing the world for the better.
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:42:02.120]   And I, you know, as a technology user, was very bullish about the future initially, right?
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.640]   The internet's going to democratize.
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.640]   It's going to eliminate gatekeepers.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.120]   Oh.
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:12.120]   And was not clear and probably should have been what the consequences of true free speech are.
[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:14.920]   And this amplified, what would I didn't know about?
[00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:17.240]   I don't think people thought about was the amplification.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:17.960]   That's the power.
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.240]   It is the power.
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:24.760]   And then people who have power already through money and through access get more power to
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:25.240]   amplify.
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:25.560]   Right.
[00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.040]   It's constant.
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:26.840]   It's a fan.
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:29.000]   This is too long a question to give you.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.600]   I only want a minute or two answer.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:32.120]   Is there any hope?
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:36.200]   Oh, the hope has been established already by an internet.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:41.320]   I, I would point to myself as a 37 year old who was able to access a completely different
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:47.080]   worldview in life outside of a very small suburban town by simply clicking around and finding
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:47.080]   life.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:47.640]   Oh, I agree.
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.560]   We always, and I think see the benefits.
[00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:52.600]   And I think that has grown and grown and grown.
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:54.120]   Those systems are still out there.
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:59.400]   They're still decentralized, wonderful computer systems that let us do some really cool things
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:01.400]   and become more human and more connected.
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:06.360]   So you think it's possible to turn to take the technology we have and make it better.
[00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:07.240]   Make it more human.
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:08.360]   Make it more fair.
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:09.560]   I think that.
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:10.120]   Without giving it up.
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.680]   You can't, you don't have to throw the baby out with the bath water.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:18.520]   I mean, my dream is a completely decentralized version of social media that isn't terrible,
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:20.360]   that everyone actually chooses to use.
[00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:24.200]   And I think it could happen within the next 10 years.
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:26.200]   I don't see that happening tomorrow or one year from now.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.480]   I was unmasked on.
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.720]   I loved Mastodon, but that's not exactly.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:30.040]   I think.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:33.800]   I mean, there's like 27 different skeletons of that not working, but I do believe that
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:39.720]   is a large step forward for us as a society and as governments all coming together and
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:44.040]   trying to find an infrastructure that's a little more open and free in that way.
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:46.920]   I do now see the consequences, but maybe it's too late.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:51.640]   I think that my hope, and this is a little dark, my hope lies outside of the world that
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:53.000]   I live in right now.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.080]   So I don't think that our world is over.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:44:00.040]   I think that the society that we have built in the way that we have built it will not last forever.
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:00.760]   Screw it up.
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:01.640]   We've screwed it up.
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:07.480]   And there is somebody somewhere in a small town in Indonesia right now who's thinking about something
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.400]   that we don't know.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.280]   We don't understand yet.
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.520]   I'm saying the nuclear war is zombie attack.
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:16.120]   Well, not necessarily, but cultures come and go and rise and fall.
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:19.800]   And we may have done a really great job at some things and now somebody else is going to
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:20.920]   do a really great job at other things.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:25.080]   Usually those come with bloodshed and a massive loss of war.
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.840]   But not necessarily.
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:27.880]   Sometimes it's.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:28.680]   Look at most of Europe.
[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:31.080]   Europe has just had, you know, like Britain.
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:37.320]   Well, yeah, there was like Dickensian Britain and that was a little rough, but not completely
[00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:38.600]   destroyed.
[00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:44.040]   We're seeing the end of European colonialism as it were because you could argue that America
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:48.040]   was pretty much the last, the last wave of that.
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:52.600]   And if you look at our actions from the 19th and 20th century, we were doing the same thing
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:56.920]   where we were acting like our job is to export our culture, our values.
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:03.320]   You could say the consequences of industrialism and colonialism are two world wars, millions of deaths.
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:06.440]   But I think when you have, when you have a group,
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:10.280]   but you have generations now who are aware of the fragility of the planet
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:13.560]   and the finite amount of resources we have left.
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.000]   And that's.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:15.960]   But there's my point.
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:20.760]   And that's why we're going to not have a cultural revolution.
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.320]   We know how painful that could be.
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:23.800]   We already have.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:25.720]   We're going to go, all right, just take me.
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:27.160]   Well, there could be.
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:30.680]   I mean, we may be in the beginning of some terrible economic decay right now.
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:32.920]   And you look around our country, the haves versus the have not.
[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:33.480]   It's terrible.
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:38.520]   The have not may continue to grow to a point where we simply do not have the power we used to.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:40.040]   Yeah, you know, it's going to be war related.
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:41.800]   It's not some guy in Indonesia.
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:45.560]   I think it's infrastructure decay because you take a look at the fact that we don't spend
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.000]   in this country to keep uproads.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.160]   We don't spend on public health in a way that guarantees that children and young adults
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:54.520]   are as healthy as they could be or are launched into adulthood as we're.
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:55.880]   Way more death and child society.
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:46:00.200]   I like that you asked about the future of how technology will affect us.
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.000]   And this is where we get.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.120]   Only have one or two minutes.
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:04.360]   I didn't even think about talking about World War three in time.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:08.600]   I think the point that I was getting around to eventually since technology has
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:14.200]   disintermediated specialization and its its redistributed economic opportunity.
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.480]   It's going to really usher in a whole new cultural model.
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:20.360]   That's what we were hoping for, but I don't see any side of that.
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.200]   Again, the future is not evenly distributed.
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.520]   You just have to look for it outside of where we are now.
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:27.000]   I think we're all products of the 20th century at this table.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:30.360]   Yeah, you're not logged into the right Twitter accounts over there, Leo.
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:31.240]   The culture's happening.
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:32.360]   Logged off Twitter too.
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:33.160]   But I'm with you.
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:36.440]   I do feel like decentralized open is the future.
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:37.880]   It is doable.
[00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:39.320]   It is out there.
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:43.960]   But I feel like it also is facing incredible resistance from two forces,
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:48.840]   one of course, the moneyed economic forces of Facebook, Amazon, Google.
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:56.760]   And the other frankly is, I think, a population, global population that is afraid of disruption,
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:03.320]   of famine, of war, and will settle for surveillance economy as long.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.040]   Look at China.
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:05.720]   China is a perfect example.
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:07.480]   We're in order to pursue order.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:12.200]   Do you know what the number one app in China right now is?
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:14.920]   Number one, beating DD, beating WeChat.
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:23.000]   It's a propaganda tool from the Communist Party called Shwishi Changguo,
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.880]   which translates to study powerful country,
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:27.800]   is number one in China.
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.280]   We know about the social credit scores.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.040]   Or do they say it's number one in China?
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.080]   No, it is number one.
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.200]   Apple says it's number one.
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:38.520]   It's number one, you could say because, well, if you're anybody in China,
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:39.160]   you're going to download it.
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:42.280]   I mean, you're going to love it or use it, but you better well Dan will download it,
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:42.440]   right?
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:43.720]   They know whether you're downloading it.
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:49.640]   Sounds like a popular president getting 99.9% of the vote.
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:51.320]   But I don't think it's like that in China.
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:54.520]   I think that the vast majority of the populace, not the weagers,
[00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:56.920]   there's definitely pockets of resistance.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:02.520]   But in return for modernization, this is kind of the story of China.
[00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:04.200]   Well, this is the three gorgeous Dan.
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:04.680]   Exactly.
[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:07.640]   I remember when the three gorgeous Dan was billed back in the 1990s,
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:10.040]   a reporter from Rolling Stone went and was like,
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:12.920]   you're wiping out villages in this gorgeous landscape.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:16.920]   And in return, the guy was like, I don't have electricity in an oven.
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:17.400]   Exactly.
[00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:18.520]   And I would like those things.
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:18.920]   Exactly.
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:21.000]   And the guy was like, oh, this is what we're up against.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:21.560]   Yeah.
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:24.360]   But I think there are people who want order.
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:28.040]   Who want peace, who want food, who want their children, will be safe.
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:33.240]   And we'll give up dumb things like privacy in return.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:33.880]   And I think that's where-
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.480]   Privacy is a fairly modern construct anyway.
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:35.880]   That's right.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:36.360]   We'll think about it.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.000]   That's right.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.560]   I mean, I'm not saying I don't like privacy because I do.
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:40.120]   I really like it.
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.080]   Oh, I love it.
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:44.360]   I think you're going to have to look at the global south for what the
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:46.280]   next iteration of a pro-tech culture is.
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:50.600]   One of the most exciting stories in the aughts was how Africa had
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:53.800]   effectively leapt over broadband and gone to mobile commerce and
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.840]   mobile banking back in the early 2000s.
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:59.480]   And what I really admired and liked about the-
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.400]   This was a culture that was like, we have these needs.
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:06.440]   We need a solution that works for us and not a solution that is laid down
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:09.320]   in a culture that doesn't understand the constraints we have.
[00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:14.520]   And I feel we're going to see that again, either through people who are climate change
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:20.040]   refugees and understand very intimately how fragile our communications networks
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:23.480]   and our civilizations can be, or through people who have been facing
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:28.280]   shrinking resources and can ask themselves how they can deploy technology to manage
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.840]   those resources or not even need as much of them as they used to.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:32.920]   You're very optimistic.
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:33.240]   I am.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:34.120]   I am.
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.800]   People are really creative though.
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.600]   We've been around for how many thousands of years at this point.
[00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:42.360]   And the one last thing is that the global population is about to peak.
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:45.800]   So that's probably, I think probably a good thing.
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:48.440]   We get to take the pressure off that a little bit.
[00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:51.960]   And somebody somewhere will take advantage of all this change.
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:53.000]   It just may not be here.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.760]   And I think we've gotten really cocky about it.
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.520]   And then there's CRISPR.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:59.560]   We're so young.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:01.400]   We have all the equilibrium.
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.200]   It's all perfect.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:02.920]   Everybody's happy.
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:04.440]   And then oh, we got genetic modification.
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:05.640]   You're such a young country.
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:10.040]   We're so young, especially compared to places like Britain, which can go back
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:13.960]   which go back centuries and China, which same.
[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:17.640]   Do you think though that America is the hope of the West anymore?
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.120]   No.
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:18.680]   No.
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:22.840]   But I think also one of the peculiar things that hobbles American culture
[00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.880]   is our inability to think in terms of the long now or the long future.
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:27.240]   Because we don't have one.
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:29.160]   Well, we don't have a conception of a long past either.
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:34.840]   For us, we started when we landed at Jamestown, which now there were lots of people here before that.
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:35.400]   Oh, yeah, them.
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:38.200]   We just don't consider it part of our national culture.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:41.480]   Had you however asked that question 20 years ago, you might say,
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:45.160]   "Yeah, because all the innovation, all the invention, we created the internet.
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.360]   We're changing the world.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.440]   The future is ours."
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:54.120]   And then what's happened 20 years later is this grim dystopia that's emerging
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:56.200]   out of the surveillance capitalism.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:58.360]   Exactly what a lot of people predicted would happen.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:50:59.800]   Well, that's what so fascinating.
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:01.560]   The diamond age came out like 20 on years ago.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:04.280]   It was basically watching us happen in slow motion.
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:06.600]   Like, yep, okay, we, yeah.
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:07.720]   Dystopia is already here.
[00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:08.840]   It's just not even the least trivial.
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:09.400]   Exactly.
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.960]   Let's take a break on that gloomy notion.
[00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:14.520]   I'm the drink whiskey.
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:15.720]   I really like this group.
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:19.880]   Sam, I'm sorry, we can't give you some of this fine, cast strength whiskey.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.160]   I live in Washington state.
[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:22.360]   We have our own inebrians.
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:22.600]   Good.
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:30.760]   Sam is always a welcome visitor to our shores from his eerie up there in the Pacific Northwest
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:34.760]   Sam Moskovich Tech Culture Editor at ours, Technica.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:38.600]   We're also thrilled to have Lindsay Turntine here who is now in charge of all of CBS.
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:41.000]   VP at CBS.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.200]   Is it CBSI, right?
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:42.920]   It's CBSI.
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.480]   It's VP of, it's a long title.
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:48.360]   But basically, I'm in charge of tech content at CBSI.
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:51.080]   In charge of tech content at CBSI.
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:52.520]   I.
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:54.520]   That's where the eye in.
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:58.040]   You know, I was the third employee at CBSI.
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:51:58.680]   I've seen it.
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:51:59.640]   What?
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:00.200]   Yes.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:01.720]   I'll tell you that story someday.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:02.760]   Back in the early 90s.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:04.600]   Before I got there.
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:08.200]   Halsey Minor and Shelby Bonnie were back East.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:12.600]   And they said we want to start a television network with technology.
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:14.360]   And I was doing a radio show.
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:18.040]   They said you're the only guy I really knows about national broadcasting.
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:19.480]   Would you come to work for us?
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:20.040]   And you did.
[00:52:20.040 --> 00:52:22.680]   Till Halsey decided you don't like me.
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:23.960]   That didn't last that long.
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:26.040]   But it was an interesting experience.
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:26.680]   Wow.
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:28.760]   I started before Halsey left.
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:31.000]   And then, but not long before he left.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:31.880]   Yeah.
[00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:32.920]   I made their first pilot.
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:37.480]   And then I was the guy who told him, guys, I did the due diligence on starting a television
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:37.720]   network.
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:39.240]   I said, do you have half a billion to throw away?
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:42.440]   Because that's how much it's going to cost you before you start making money.
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:44.920]   And that's when they said, well, maybe we'll think of some other things we can do.
[00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:46.360]   They diversified pretty quickly.
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:48.280]   Called the internet.
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:54.280]   Our show today brought to you by the internet and people who make the internet safe and private
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:56.920]   for you express VPN.
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.400]   We've been talking a lot about privacy.
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:04.360]   There's actually something you can do proactive right now to protect yourself.
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:08.760]   I'm not just talking about an open access Wi-Fi hotspot at a coffee shop.
[00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.520]   I'm talking about your own home.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:16.600]   I'm talking about wherever you go express VPN encrypts your traffic from your device,
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:19.800]   your computer to their servers, their servers all over the world.
[00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:23.960]   You emerge into the internet, the country of your choice with the IP of your choosing
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:30.680]   so that no one knows it's you and your ISP, your carrier cannot spy on you.
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:33.160]   They can't see what you're doing.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:34.920]   And it's so easy with Express VPN.
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:38.840]   They have apps for every platform, Mac, Windows, iOS, Android.
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:40.920]   They run seamlessly in the background.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:42.120]   You push one button.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:42.440]   Boom.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:43.080]   You're protected.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:44.280]   Turn it off when you want.
[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:47.960]   And the thing about Express VPN, they have so many servers, they have so much bandwidth,
[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:48.920]   they don't slow you down.
[00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:51.720]   And I think a lot of people stop using VPNs because they say,
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:53.240]   ah, you know, it's inconvenient.
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:54.200]   It's too slow.
[00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:57.800]   It says convenient and fast as it can be with Express VPN.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:02.280]   You can now safely surf wherever you are, even public Wi-Fi without being snooped on,
[00:54:02.280 --> 00:54:04.440]   without having your personal data stolen.
[00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:05.880]   Read their privacy policy.
[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:10.760]   I always encourage you when you look at VPNs to read and see, do they log?
[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:11.320]   No.
[00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:12.680]   They keep track of anything you're doing.
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:12.920]   No.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.920]   Do they know anything about your business?
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:15.240]   No.
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:22.440]   It's rated number one on tech radar, 30-day money back guarantee, and it's less than $7
[00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:23.000]   a month.
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.880]   If you don't want to hand over your online history, your internet provider,
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:33.960]   your data resellers, express VPN.com/twit, you'll get a three extra month bonus when you sign up for
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:34.760]   a one year package.
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:37.800]   And again, 30-day money back guarantee, so there's no risk.
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:47.480]   Express VPN.com/twit, express VPN.com/twit, it's our absolute choice for VPN.
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:51.960]   You're not going to Barcelona for mobile work homes?
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:53.160]   No, I'm not going to Barcelona.
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:54.680]   I wish that I go.
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:55.240]   I know.
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:57.880]   I don't usually, I go every once in a while.
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:54:58.360]   Okay.
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:02.040]   So, I feel like it's like an every three years coming up this next weekend.
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:03.000]   It's coming up this next weekend.
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:03.400]   Yeah.
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:08.040]   The first taste of new phones at Mobile World Congress will be this Wednesday,
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:11.080]   but Samsung's doing it in San Francisco, which is weird.
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:11.080]   Right.
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:13.480]   It's like the opposite of that Mobile World Congress.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:15.400]   Almost literally.
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:17.960]   It's their Galaxy S10, and we know everything about it, right?
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:18.760]   Everything's been late.
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:20.280]   As usual with a Samsung event.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:21.320]   Even more than that.
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:26.360]   But I mean, it's like down to every single spec, and which phones are coming out, and it's
[00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:28.360]   an incredible amount of nuance.
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:30.840]   I almost feel like they do this on purpose just because they know they're,
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:32.680]   well, we're not going to surprise anyone anyway.
[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:35.000]   Well, I think that it keeps the excitement going for longer.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:35.320]   Yeah.
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:39.480]   Having a steady stream of leaks gets more and more people interested in wanting to see it.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:43.560]   They know that there's something for them, so then they actually tune in to see the real pictures.
[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:49.080]   And it, it's, I have no idea, honestly, if Samsung is leaking these intentionally,
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:51.000]   but they're not fighting it.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:51.640]   I do know that.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.240]   I feel like they have to have leaks phone number.
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:53.800]   I'm just saying.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:56.520]   I just can't prove anything.
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:58.840]   Can't prove anything.
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:01.960]   You know, Apple will continue to be this super secret.
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:04.920]   I nobody knows a company, although they haven't been able to.
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:05.960]   What's it getting to supply chain?
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:08.280]   Oh, much different than they used to be.
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:08.280]   Yeah.
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:11.960]   Once it gets to the supply chain, all bets are off and start making it,
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.640]   and nobody's going to keep that a secret.
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:15.160]   All right.
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:16.760]   So what do we know?
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:17.720]   What do we think?
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:18.520]   Are we excited?
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.120]   About you, galaxies?
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:22.040]   About so many galaxies.
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:22.760]   What five of them?
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:28.200]   Four, I think is four, but maybe five is sort of the question because there's this
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:31.560]   mysterious monstrous 5G potential model.
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:32.600]   Phone. Is that one of them?
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:33.800]   No, that's a TCL.
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:35.160]   Well, the folding phone for the Samsung.
[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:37.080]   Oh, you're talking about the the the slappiest one.
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:37.800]   No, I'm talking about it.
[00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:39.000]   We'll talk about that next.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.960]   I like the pricing strategy they've got where they've got the higher end ones,
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:42.920]   then the entry level.
[00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:44.040]   Oh, that's good.
[00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:44.520]   The entry level.
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:45.720]   How low are the entry level?
[00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:46.920]   Oh, not low.
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:48.600]   It's like 799 or something.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:52.600]   But you know, they wouldn't be doing that if Apple weren't feeling the pinch from overpriced phones.
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:55.480]   They're also going to have a plus version, actually named plus.
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:57.960]   That's what I always find so bold about Samsung's aiming.
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:01.080]   It's like, take the Apple paradigm and then just do it.
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:01.960]   Yeah, we'll just copy it.
[00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:02.680]   It's working.
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:04.440]   You people are habituated to it.
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:04.920]   Sure.
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:06.040]   We're not going to make you think.
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:07.160]   Just buy our phone, please.
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:09.240]   So they'll be an S10 and S10 plus.
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:11.080]   They'll be a cheaper S10, which is the E.
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:16.920]   They'll be the, as you say, mysterious monstrous 5G version.
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:21.000]   There is a four cameras on the plus, on the back,
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.360]   few on the front.
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:23.480]   I'm not even joking.
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:25.720]   So many cameras.
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:31.720]   If you had gone back to the year 2000 and said, in the future, your phone will actually eliminate
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:34.200]   every, the need for cameras.
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:34.760]   That's not a special.
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:35.080]   That's a special.
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:35.080]   That's a special.
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:36.840]   That would have been like, what, how?
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:40.440]   And now we're busy talking about phones with four cameras.
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:45.800]   But that to me is such an easy move on their part in terms of taking relatively cheap sensors,
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:51.000]   dumping them in and then having every blogger get out there and vlogger, get out there and say,
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.120]   look at the photos.
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:55.960]   It is the such a huge selling point for any like MK,
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:58:00.680]   oh, I, Mark has Brownlee, he, you know, he's going to get up there and he's going to test out all those,
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:03.400]   those lenses and that's going to, that's going to move units.
[00:58:03.400 --> 00:58:06.520]   So I'm not shocked at all that they're going to have like 20.
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:11.240]   It's going to be like a spider's eyeball by the time we get to, you know, 2022.
[00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:12.520]   Look, let's face it.
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:14.440]   Cameras are probably the number one feature on phones.
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:15.800]   These day, not the phone.
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:18.680]   And it's the differentiator when every phone looks exactly the same.
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:20.440]   Can they compete with Google though?
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:23.320]   Doesn't Google have the magic Google flu here?
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:26.760]   Google's interest in the pixel has, we were going to talk about this elsewhere,
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:29.640]   but it's gone up 50% in the last year at least a little bit more than that.
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:31.400]   But it's still a minor blip.
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:35.480]   Still a minor blip, but people talk about it and Google has done a fantastic job getting people
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:38.440]   who love cameras interested in their stone.
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:43.240]   And I have to say the thing about the Google pixel is that the integration of,
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:47.240]   of hey, Google integration, it's so good.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:50.520]   And so compare that to what Samsung is going to offer and Samsung can offer.
[00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:51.960]   They got beautiful hardware in the world.
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:53.000]   Shame.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.520]   They're still working on it.
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:55.960]   And there's going to be a Bixby button.
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:58.920]   It looks like on these Evleke photos, there is a Bixby button.
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:00.840]   There's going to be a Bixby button.
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:01.320]   You come on.
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:03.960]   There's probably going to be more Bixby buttons at this point.
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:05.560]   I do not understand this.
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:09.160]   I do not understand why they're still working with--
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:09.960]   And not licensing.
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:12.040]   And not licensing Google's technology.
[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:15.720]   No, because Google Assistant is so one of the things we do for a fan around the house
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:20.440]   because this is how we roll is we ask Siri and Google Assistant the same question
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:21.160]   and see how they--
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:21.880]   I do this all the time.
[00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:23.400]   And see how they answer.
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:29.320]   And Google Assistant just nine times out of 10, much, much better.
[00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:31.800]   So you do have some of these assistants in your home.
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:34.920]   My husband covers mobile technology for Tom's guide.
[00:59:34.920 --> 00:59:41.240]   So we have all-- so we have an entire room full of the stuff that gets shipped for testing.
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:44.520]   The market has spoken in terms of this proprietary button.
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:48.440]   People are still clearly buying S8s and S9s with this ridiculous Bixby button,
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:51.720]   not being able to remap it to a better service or even to just,
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:54.040]   I don't know, a camera button or some sort of shortcut.
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:55.160]   So they're not going to--
[00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:55.720]   But they could.
[00:59:55.720 --> 01:00:00.280]   --as long as Bixby can penetrate one market and give Samsung that kind of data
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:03.080]   and that kind of access, it's going to be there, plain and simple.
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.280]   Samsung has the data.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:04.840]   We have someone--
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.680]   They probably know that nobody pushes that button.
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.880]   Depends on what you're--
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:07.960]   It depends on what you're--
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:11.560]   --name Bleak, who's pointing out that Samsung is doing very well with Bixby
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:12.440]   and the Korean market.
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:16.120]   So I appreciate that because this does point out that we're looking at this
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:19.800]   from a really American point of view and AI is going to be something where
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:23.000]   it's going to be tied into different geographical markets too.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.440]   There's also-- historically, Samsung has been at great pains to differentiate
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:27.480]   from Android and Google.
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:30.120]   They don't even want to mention the A word.
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:34.360]   They looked for a long time at putting a different operating system in their stuff,
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:37.080]   Tizen, but they couldn't make it work.
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:42.200]   I really feel like Samsung, as much as they could, wants to be the not Google.
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:44.120]   Well, here's the other thing that Samsung is doing.
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.760]   That we don't think about in American households.
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:50.200]   Samsung has absolutely penetrated the home appliance market.
[01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:51.560]   Good point.
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.320]   All of my appliances are the same thing now.
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:53.320]   Yeah, me too.
[01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:53.800]   Yeah.
[01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:57.320]   And they make that stupid sing song chime though all the time.
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:57.800]   I love it.
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:58.680]   They're singing all the time.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:00:59.800]   I love it.
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.640]   I actually love it when my washer sings to me.
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.920]   I haven't turned it off.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:03.480]   I like it a lot.
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:12.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.920]   It has gotten much, much better.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:16.600]   It was terrible at first.
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:21.960]   And now I had a problem with my refrigerator, and they were extra, extra, extra helpful.
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:23.960]   Because I think it was so bad in the past.
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:24.440]   Yeah.
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:29.800]   In any case, most of those devices come with at least the ability to be attached to your
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:34.760]   network, or they will soon. And I think that that's what Bixby has to do with.
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:38.680]   Once Samsung has got all the hardware in your home outside of your phone, potentially,
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:42.440]   even if you don't own a Samsung phone, that there's going to be some tie in there.
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:46.360]   And Samsung really does want to make creating a
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:50.680]   interoperability between your television and your devices and eventually your phone.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:54.200]   I would love to see how Samsung and Amazon are going to deal with each other then.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:59.560]   Because Amazon is doing its best to wire your home and get you from point of sale to
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:03.400]   point of use in your household. Samsung is coming out from exactly the opposite direction.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.240]   Where does that happen?
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:08.520]   It's why they keep Bixby alive, because at some point they hope that they can
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.360]   introduce Bixby in your home.
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:12.360]   Absolutely. And then that's what I was saying.
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:16.040]   The last few years is there to help your appliances talk to each other.
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:16.520]   Right.
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:21.720]   The last few years at CES, the whole appeal to smart appliances and smart home has been the
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:27.320]   idea that the cloud of information associated with you, your favorite recipes, your groceries,
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:30.680]   your family schedule, how often you eat, what times of day you eat.
[01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:34.120]   All of that is eventually going to get loaded into your appliances.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:38.920]   And then your appliances can order groceries for you so you don't have to do it.
[01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:42.680]   Or they can send you reminders so that if they detect that you're driving by a store,
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:46.040]   they can be like, "Ping, you need to buy milk and you can hit that on the way home."
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:48.840]   Like that is the vision of the smart future that they have.
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:52.280]   I just, as long as they keep putting in the headphone jack, I don't really care
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:53.880]   that any of that.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:56.040]   I can't take a refrigerator without a headphone jack either.
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.160]   I'm absolutely right.
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.640]   They don't have the courage to take that out.
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:03.880]   They will also, by the way, replace the notch with the new dot.
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:09.320]   This is going to be the wave of the future, a circular cutout for the camera.
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:10.280]   Sure.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:11.400]   It looks better.
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:11.880]   It looks better.
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.560]   I think it's less obtrusive than a dot.
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:14.920]   I mean, a notch.
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:15.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:16.680]   A dot's better than a notch.
[01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:20.440]   But we'll see Apple's the trendsetter there.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:24.520]   I would just mostly want to have a little Android background image that makes it look like
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:27.640]   Johnny 5 from Short Circuit whenever you're frozen up on that.
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:28.440]   That's my dream there.
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:30.200]   Oh, I think the shape is perfect.
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:31.160]   I think you could do that.
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:32.040]   Oh, that would be delightful.
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:32.360]   Yeah.
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:33.640]   All right.
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.240]   Just a little Johnny 5 dot up there.
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:35.720]   Yeah.
[01:03:35.720 --> 01:03:36.040]   Yeah.
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:39.960]   Does the Aldebarge song play as your ringtone then too?
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.560]   Just Johnny, he says.
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.000]   Oh my god.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:43.480]   I don't know.
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:45.000]   You guys are in different generation.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   A cool one.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:47.400]   We agree.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:47.720]   Yes.
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.160]   Do you want to talk about Arthur Godfrey?
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:52.520]   I'm here, but I don't know what this Johnny 5 stuff is.
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:53.300]   They will, Samsung will do a photob
[01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:58.760]   photobofone, although I noticed there's not a lot of leaks about the photobofone.
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:03:59.400]   Would they offer it?
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.400]   Do you think it's going to be for sale?
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.800]   Gosh, they really want to make it for sale.
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:07.880]   I think that this is going to be important for some trend setting and just getting attention back
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:08.760]   onto phones.
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:10.120]   It's a differentiator as well.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:11.080]   It's a differentiator.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.760]   It's going to look great on the gram.
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.120]   It's going to look great on the gram.
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:17.640]   Because you'll have people doing, you know, they have an umbrella and they're smiling into the rain
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:19.480]   and their wrists will be prominently displayed.
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:21.640]   And are you talking about the CCL one now?
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:21.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.320]   So, oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:26.280]   Sorry, I jumped ahead to the wrist.
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.920]   Samsung's been talking about the photobofone for a while.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:32.920]   I suspect if I were just going to, I'm not out there personally reporting on it,
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:37.480]   but if I were going to guess, Samsung will talk about it at their event,
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:40.440]   but not release it at the same time as the Galaxy phone.
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:42.280]   I don't think there's going to be a photobotable Galaxy.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:42.840]   It'll be wrong.
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:48.280]   I'm making CCLs trying to get in on this conversation because people like us are sitting around
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:50.040]   being like, oh, yeah, and then there's that wrist one.
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:53.080]   And if Samsung's already talking about a photobotable phone, TCL is going to come.
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:55.640]   People are going to be really fascinated by the idea of this.
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.840]   This looks terrible.
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:59.640]   This looks like a slave bracelet.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:03.720]   This doesn't, this is not, I'm slave to my technology.
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:04.680]   Look how big that is.
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:07.080]   Is it really that much of a leap from the Apple Watch?
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:13.000]   No, I think the question wants it out because people are hard.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:18.920]   Yeah, I think we were talking about this right before this show that the potential
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:23.080]   of a phone that you bend around your wrist is actually potentially fantastic for people
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:24.440]   like me who often don't have pockets.
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:25.080]   Right.
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:27.080]   And you're already shackled to technology.
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:29.320]   Why not just go all the way?
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.680]   I mean, I remember that...
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:32.920]   I can't remember.
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:33.480]   I can't remember.
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:34.920]   They should call it the shackle.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:38.280]   Can you imagine they don't change women's clothing to give us pockets,
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:40.680]   but they're willing to launch an entire new tech category?
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:45.880]   You know what actually pockets have, have you noticed that recently dresses have pockets?
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:47.080]   Yeah, it's true.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.040]   They're not pants.
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:49.880]   Well, no pants also have pockets.
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:50.680]   Pants have pockets.
[01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:51.880]   Sometimes, like vestigial pockets.
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.000]   They just do have pockets.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.080]   And now they do, and also yoga pants have pockets.
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:55.480]   Yeah.
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:55.880]   No.
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:56.360]   Yes.
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:59.160]   They're on this side of your thighs.
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:00.360]   And it is life changing.
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:00.680]   Yeah.
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:04.520]   Well, sometimes pants pockets are just vestigial or they're for show when you're like,
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:07.400]   "Oh, it's nothing actually fits in the face on a whale.
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.040]   Nothing happens."
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:08.440]   But...
[01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.760]   Mandy the clown in our chat room makes her own pockets,
[01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:15.560]   but she's got like phones in there and bananas and all sort of, you know, dessert.
[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:18.440]   The scarf that comes with a pocket knitted in, that's the stuff.
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:20.920]   The hide a pocket in the scarf.
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:21.640]   Hide a pocket.
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:23.480]   I'm just waiting for somebody in the chat room to be like,
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.920]   "Remember cargo pants, you guys?
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:25.640]   They still make them."
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:26.840]   I still wear them.
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:28.040]   Utilikild or bust?
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.000]   That's what I'm wearing under here.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.280]   Are you wearing a Utilikild?
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.240]   Oh, god, no, never.
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:33.080]   No, I do want to say though,
[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:35.320]   that we've got Samsung, LG, and TCL.
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:39.080]   They're all interested in ultra thin screen technology.
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:41.800]   So for Samsung to come out and say we have a foldable phone,
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.960]   just to hold it up and say it exists,
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:46.440]   is a giant attack against LG,
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:49.160]   which has just been rolling over them within terms of...
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:52.760]   Almost literally rolling over them with rollable screens.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:55.800]   So that's, I mean, that's, I think that makes sense for them to say,
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.960]   "Hey, here's phones you can definitely buy,
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:59.640]   and here's the one you're going to want to buy
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:01.320]   when we can make it more affordable."
[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:03.400]   So your move, LG, that sort of thing,
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.720]   I think it's a power move because that OLED...
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:07.800]   Well, LG is behind in the phone world,
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:11.640]   so Samsung definitely has a chance to make that move.
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:12.520]   Absolutely.
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:14.760]   We will be covering the Samsung event live.
[01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:16.120]   I presume you're going to go.
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.240]   It's in San Francisco.
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.320]   We will be covering it live also.
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:19.880]   Of course.
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:22.200]   We'll have dueling streams.
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.760]   Ours begins 11 a.m. Pacific.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:25.960]   That's 2 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.640]   What we're going to do, it's on Wednesdays,
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:30.680]   we're going to start Windows Weekly early at 9 a.m.
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:31.960]   And then right after Windows Weekly,
[01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:35.160]   we'll go into the live coverage of the Samsung Unpacked event,
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.840]   where you will learn absolutely nothing new.
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:39.400]   But it's always fun to watch a Samsung event
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.720]   to see what crazy things they are.
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:44.600]   And you might find out more about something like the folding phone,
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:46.440]   which we don't know more about yet.
[01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:49.320]   We know a little bit, so you might get something kind of interesting.
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:51.400]   Do you think price that's holding it back or technology?
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:52.600]   It looked very thick.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:53.640]   I think it's technology.
[01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:56.600]   I think the one that we saw that was an off-brand at CES
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:58.600]   that we actually played with was the Royal...
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:58.840]   The Royal.
[01:07:58.840 --> 01:07:59.640]   Yeah.
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:03.480]   It was not something you would actually want yet.
[01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:05.400]   Fascinating to see, but not quite ready.
[01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:07.240]   And I think for something like that,
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:08.920]   price may not be important.
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:13.480]   Also, just the sheer sustainability of that on a wrist,
[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:15.320]   how much of a beating can it currently take?
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.400]   What kind of plastic and polar mic.
[01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:19.400]   Now we're talking about snap bracelet again.
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:20.200]   We're back.
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:21.640]   We can't stop talking about it.
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:22.760]   I'm just saying any of that stuff.
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:24.520]   Any foldable phone, anything like that,
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.760]   is going to have that sort of wear and tear issue.
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:28.040]   That needs a couple of generations.
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:29.000]   It's a tickle-shackle.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.160]   Well, one of the core problems with technology, though,
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:34.360]   is how do you make it so it holds up to a life where,
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:36.520]   you know, you aren't either washing dishes or anything.
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.280]   It's not going to hold up to anything.
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:40.760]   Or you're camping or you're rough housing with small plans.
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:43.960]   Well, think about how long that LG rollable television
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:45.400]   took to actually make it to market.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:48.520]   So we saw those foldable screens what three years ago.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:51.880]   And then two years ago, we saw a prototype of the rollable screen,
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:53.240]   but it wasn't for sale.
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:54.680]   This year it's going for sale.
[01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:56.120]   So if we think of this as the first year,
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.240]   we've even seen prototypes,
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:58.440]   eventable phones.
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:08:59.000]   Two years.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:00.920]   Three, I'd say.
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:03.480]   Take a little while.
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:05.480]   And then next year we're all buying one all of us.
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:06.360]   Let's do it.
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:07.240]   Take a pack.
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:07.960]   I mean, it's a cat.
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.160]   I mean, it's a good job.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:11.560]   It's one of those snap bracelets where you just
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.720]   have it like this and then you're done with the call and you go,
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:14.040]   "Quack!"
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.960]   And it's a bracelet and you walk off.
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:16.840]   That I would buy.
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:19.800]   That would be like an excellent way to hang up on somebody in a hut.
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:19.960]   Fuck!
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:21.720]   Oh my god, that would be great in movies.
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:25.480]   Just, "I'm done, Betty. It's over. Whack!"
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:26.680]   Yes, yes, you get me.
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:29.160]   I'm telling you, there's a future in that.
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:31.480]   I don't know if you could do it more than once.
[01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:35.880]   I'm probably breaking it immediately, but it'd be satisfying.
[01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.080]   That's cute.
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:39.400]   I showed it. I brought to you by Wasabi.
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:43.400]   Wasabi's hot cloud storage.
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:47.240]   And I think this is a really interesting company.
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:50.680]   You know that I am a fan of Carbonite had been for years.
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:54.600]   David Friend, a good friend of mine, started it with his buddy, Jeff Flowers.
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:57.880]   In order to make Carbonite work, they actually patented and invented
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:03.000]   a revolutionary process of laying data on disks sequentially.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.760]   Now, your computer doesn't block,
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:09.240]   but doing it sequentially had some real benefits to data density,
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.080]   but also speed and reliability.
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:18.120]   That's the technology that makes Wasabi efficient and affordable and really cool.
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.800]   I know it's a new name to you.
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:24.520]   Everybody lost their job by buying Amazon or Google or Microsoft,
[01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:27.880]   but I've got to tell you, add a fourth name to that list when you go shopping
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:31.160]   for hot cloud storage because Wasabi has some real advantages.
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.720]   We're all moving more and more data to the cloud.
[01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:35.160]   This is businesses, of course.
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:40.040]   In fact, by 2025, and let's say there'll be 163 zeta bites in the cloud.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:42.120]   I don't even know what that's.
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.240]   21 zeros.
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.680]   Crazy.
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:51.240]   Well, Wasabi has a system that will let you store your data in the cloud,
[01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:54.680]   80% less and six times faster than S3.
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:58.840]   It supports the S3 API, so you already know how to use it,
[01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:02.760]   but it's 80% cheaper, six times faster.
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:06.120]   It's HIPAA compliant, FINRA compliant, CJIS compliant.
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:10.520]   Really, nowadays cloud storage is probably more secure than on-premises storage.
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:11.880]   It's really safe up there.
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:15.480]   And to make it even safer, they have a new form of immutable storage.
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.360]   You can designate some data as immutable.
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:22.760]   It can't be changed, protects it from crypto ware, you know, ransom ware,
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:25.160]   from fumble-fingered employees.
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.480]   You can say this data, that's safe.
[01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:28.760]   That data is really safe.
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:31.400]   And man, it is great.
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:35.080]   There's one tier of service, free unlimited egress.
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:37.800]   That makes a big deal when it comes to planning and budgeting,
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:40.920]   because you know it's not going to cost you to egress your data.
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:44.360]   They'll even send you, if you have a lot of data, a Wasabi ball.
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:47.320]   You can migrate petabytes of data, copy to the ball,
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:49.080]   send it to Wasabi, it's up in the cloud.
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:53.400]   I think Wasabi is really impressive, and I want you to take a look at it.
[01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:56.600]   I know it's a new name, you need no more about it.
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:00.040]   But when you go to the boss and you say it's 80% cheaper,
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:04.760]   and it's 600% faster, they're going to listen.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:06.520]   You can experience Wasabi for yourself.
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:12.120]   W-A-S-A-B-I, free unlimited storage for a month.
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:14.920]   You go to wasabi.com, you click the free trial link,
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:18.280]   and under the code TWIT, you're going to get unlimited data for a month.
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:21.720]   A fifth of price, wow, six times faster.
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:24.600]   Wasabi.com, the offer code, is TWIT.
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:28.440]   You'd be crazy not to at least check it out.
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:32.120]   That's all I can say, wasabi.com, offer code.
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:37.240]   Anything else in Mobile World Congress, there's a new ThinQ phone.
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:38.440]   Am I saying that right?
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:39.080]   I think so.
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:39.800]   Or ThinQ.
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:42.520]   I don't know how you say it.
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:43.240]   That's the LG.
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:49.960]   The LG, we were just talking about LG, and they've kind of accepted this backseat.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.320]   Phone.
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:52.840]   Don't get too far in the backseat.
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:54.280]   Remember HTC?
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:56.440]   They got so far in the backseat that we're left behind.
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:59.880]   I know, and so it'll be interesting to see if they can kind of sneak around
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:03.960]   and suggest something that will make that phone more.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.320]   I keep trying these phones.
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:06.120]   I don't get excited.
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.080]   It's a good phone space anymore.
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:07.400]   It's tough.
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:10.520]   Is it really just a two company world now, Samsung and...
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:11.240]   Three.
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:12.520]   An iPhone.
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:13.000]   Google.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:13.480]   And Google.
[01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:14.360]   I guess, I don't know.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.440]   I think Google phone sales don't really.
[01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:17.960]   They've been improving.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:18.280]   Yeah.
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:20.840]   I mean, it's more of a...
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:23.960]   All year they sold fewer phones last year than Apple sold in the months.
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:26.280]   Oh, for sure. But there's just really...
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:30.200]   Fastest growing US smartphone brand, 43% year over year.
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:32.520]   Yeah, but if you're starting from a really small number, 43%.
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:33.160]   Yeah, 43%.
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:35.560]   It's really small, but people still get excited about this one,
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:38.120]   and they don't get excited about other phones, and that's the difference.
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:38.920]   I love my picture.
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:43.080]   Also, you look at how the potential for them to integrate with their smart home technology,
[01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:44.520]   having your phone connected with that.
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.200]   I don't think you can overstate that.
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:51.640]   And I think it's important for Google to stick it out while waiting for whatever the next technology
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:54.440]   is, because at some point in the future, we are not all going to sit around.
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:57.640]   With this and look at it, we'll be using something else.
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:00.040]   So it's really just a matter of making sure that
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:02.600]   that phone manufacturers understand how people use their screens
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:05.080]   and what they're using them for while they're on the go until they...
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:08.280]   Intel HoloLens or whatever takes over.
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:09.320]   It's not...
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.600]   I was going to say it's not the hardware.
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:11.400]   It's the services.
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:14.600]   Every big company has its own version of service.
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:16.440]   I know there's a dashboard of some of the stories,
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:21.880]   and they all seem to connect to proprietary services that would be way better on that manufacturer's device.
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:26.760]   And Google with its camera, the big part of that is the machine learning that you need their app.
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:32.440]   And in a pinch, if you sideload that Google camera app onto another phone and make it work,
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:34.920]   they're still cobbling together your data and pushing that forward.
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:35.800]   So that's still a win.
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:39.480]   So that's when I look at all these different manufacturers pushing ahead with Mobile World
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:44.360]   Congress, I think they all agree, let's just get them in our devices and users' hands and make them
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:48.360]   stick around for more than a year so that we can just hook them into those services.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:54.520]   What I think is interesting about Mobile World Congress this year is that they are no longer
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:58.280]   Mobile World Congress. It's MWC. Kind of like when KFC went to just being MWC.
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:14:59.480]   Oh, or CES?
[01:14:59.480 --> 01:15:00.120]   Went to CES?
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:00.760]   Went to CES.
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:01.160]   Went to CES.
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:02.760]   It's now MWC.
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:04.840]   How about the position system for whatever's post-mobile?
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:05.640]   Exactly.
[01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:08.440]   And I think that this year we're talking about new shapes to phones,
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:11.480]   and there'll be a lot of crazy little shapes, but it's like a bridge here.
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:15.400]   So you have to be in this business if you want to participate in whatever's coming next.
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.400]   You have to have a foot in the business.
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:18.120]   Is that the idea?
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:22.840]   I think you have to understand like we were saying, you have to understand what is done
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:23.960]   with the device.
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.240]   Isn't it though?
[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:29.960]   I mean, we were just talking about how afraid we are of Google spying on us.
[01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:31.800]   Isn't this the perfect spy device?
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:33.320]   In many ways, yeah.
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.840]   But it doesn't seem to phase people.
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:37.320]   Is it just us that are talking about it?
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.720]   No, I think everybody talks about it.
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.080]   Nobody does anything about it.
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:41.400]   Yeah.
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:44.840]   I feel like people trust Google.
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:45.800]   Am I wrong, Sam?
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:51.320]   How many people obsessively watch the tech news to see what Google's been up to in terms of
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:55.960]   trust Google, in terms of the deals they've been making or the way they treat their employees or...
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.960]   Yeah, but they seem unlike Facebook.
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:02.200]   I mean, if you compare Google to Facebook, Google seems to skate a little bit more than Facebook does.
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:02.440]   Really?
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:02.840]   Or not.
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:03.560]   Maybe that's just me.
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:04.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:07.000]   I think Google actually does a better job with the press.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:07.480]   Okay.
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:08.920]   I think they do a better job with the press.
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:09.640]   They're in the West.
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:15.320]   They've sort of the fact that Google is a verb, I think gives them that sort of leeway.
[01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:19.800]   You know, people use Facebook as a verb generally in a negative way as of late, I find.
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:23.800]   So I think that they have been skating by even though there have been anti-trust stories,
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:25.960]   there have been moments of negative press.
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:30.440]   But yeah, I would say absolutely in the public eye, they and Apple are sort of neck and neck in
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:31.160]   that general.
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:32.600]   Well, I like what they've got.
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:34.840]   I love their maps in Google's cases.
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:35.960]   They're the cool tech.
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:40.200]   They're the cool tech because they've managed to spin a perception that they're responsive,
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:41.400]   that they're designed for.
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:44.200]   People want to be associated with the halo effects, I think.
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:44.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:45.560]   I think it's true.
[01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:50.200]   The other thing that all of these phone manufacturers have to do is anticipate what's going to happen
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:56.120]   after 5G, which is why having a phone in the game is so important right now because they
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:17:00.520]   have to understand how consumers are going to perceive 5G, are going to interact with 5G,
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:04.360]   even though we know that 5G is so much more than what's going to happen with your phone.
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:11.560]   But the notion of super high speed internet everywhere you go, is that what makes 5G interesting?
[01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:16.360]   Well, I think what makes 5G interesting is super high speed and the low latency.
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:17.720]   It's really the low latency.
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:18.200]   Interesting.
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:18.760]   So the idea is that-
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:19.720]   How does that change things?
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:26.600]   Well, video everywhere and instantaneously, but not just video consumption, video collaboration.
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:31.560]   So I was talking with somebody on a panel from Samsung actually at CES and he was saying,
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:34.840]   I'm in a band and the rest of my band is in Korea.
[01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:38.280]   And I can play drums with them simultaneously.
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:41.080]   No, notoriously difficult to do over the internet because you're
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:43.160]   hearing them a second later or half second later.
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:46.280]   Exactly. So in theory, it's a workplace changer.
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:49.720]   It changes a lot of how we communicate with each other in ways that I think are going to
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:52.440]   be very hard to appreciate until we actually run there.
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:54.040]   It's not speed as latency, that's the real.
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:54.760]   Yeah, it's a workplace.
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.200]   For gaming, that's a huge deal.
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:59.160]   If you want to play Fortnite with a bunch of other people, you can't have a late-
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:01.080]   The AR economy is going to be based on that too.
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:02.440]   Bog-men in reality, why?
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:03.560]   Well, you two-
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:08.440]   All right, I did a HoloLens demo a while back where I put on the headset and I was
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:13.160]   supposed to repair a pipe. The Microsoft actually walked me into a room with a bunch of broken pipes.
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:19.560]   I was supposed to look at the schematic on the left side of my HoloLens goggles.
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:23.480]   And on the right-hand side, they had a customer service rep who was going to walk me through,
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:25.400]   and then I looked straight ahead at the pipes.
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:28.840]   And the idea was this way the customer service rep could see what I was seeing.
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:31.960]   I could refer to the schematic, I could fix it, I could talk to somebody.
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:37.960]   Interesting experience, but what I noticed was conversations had a lag when I was talking
[01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:43.640]   to a person through the headset. And when I did verbal queries to call up other parts of the
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:48.840]   manual schematic, it took a minute or two. But if you have AR and you want to do things like
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:56.600]   repair an oil rig, or you're on a space station, or you are in a firefighting type situation where
[01:18:56.600 --> 01:19:02.280]   you have to repair equipment in a high-pressure time-sensitive environment, you want to make sure
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:06.120]   that you don't have a lag, that there's no skip out, no communication, things like that.
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:10.920]   And to that point, I would add that it's just the consumer level thing is you want that
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:16.120]   instantaneous access just in that first moment. It was like remember the first time you ever
[01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:19.400]   searched for something using Google, and it just worked, it was just like that.
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:24.840]   That is what other companies want for devices that you strapped to your head that have any sort
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:28.680]   of friction. The less friction there is there in terms of saying, this is going to make you a
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:34.280]   member of the connected world and offer cool, augmented perks, boom. So I think it's less about
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:37.000]   someone out in a space station and more about somebody in their kitchen.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.800]   It's actually about teleconferencing. There's a growing class of devices too, and Google just
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:46.120]   announced one that they're integrating into Google Hangouts. And the idea is that this way,
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:50.520]   you can call them with all your colleagues remotely. And when you don't have the lag and you don't
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:55.240]   have somebody doing that weird jerky thing on the screen when they're talking to you, and all of that,
[01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:58.600]   it's going to really help conversations flow to you. This is what Facebook is holding on for.
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:04.040]   This is the Facebook Oculus investment. And this was probably anticipated many years ago.
[01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:09.560]   Let's just quiet. This is my theory. Let's just quietly develop Oculus in a way that integrates with
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:14.840]   Facebook until the latency is gone. And then people really can feel like-- And then the metaverse is
[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:19.960]   real. Yeah. And then you really are hanging out with your family in Kansas and San Francisco and
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:25.640]   New York simultaneously because you're there with them. I mean, and I think that that is the
[01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:32.200]   positive interpretation of this. We'll see if they can actually kind of survive until that benefit.
[01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:37.400]   Right. There are probably plenty of other benefits. So I ask everybody this question. I know nobody
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:42.440]   really knows the answer, but I'm going to give you guys a chance. When? Is it going to happen?
[01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:47.160]   And then what's wrong? Men in reality? 5G. 2020. It will be broadly-- I'm sorry, I should have
[01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:51.000]   been clear. 5G phones are coming out. There will be many of them announced at Mobile World Congress.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:57.080]   Many 5G phones. Now-- No, no, no, no phones for Google or Apple. Not yet. But there will be
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:02.440]   Samsung. Maybe Samsung. Oh, Samsung is announcing 5G phones, most likely. There's one plus phone.
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:09.480]   No. And so 2019 is going to be the year where a few people have it, a few networks come online.
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:13.800]   2020 is when most of the networks are going to come online and then a lot of people. Yeah.
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:17.080]   And by 2022, you should be able to have a conference call that one into two years. Aren't there
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:20.600]   severe nimby issues though because you have to have so many cell towers for this technology?
[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:24.200]   They're not towers. They're very small and 10. I mean, yes, there will be nimby issues and people
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:27.640]   will be really worried about them. Not in my backyard. You ain't putting that thing in my backyard.
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:31.400]   What is the radiation doing? Am I getting the cancer? Right. And it's basically like a microwave
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:37.480]   oven on every rooftop. Well, that sounds fine. I actually know-- the number of people I know who
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:41.720]   refuse to be in the same room as a microwave because they're worried about it is not zero.
[01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:45.080]   Yeah. It's not zero for sure. Or don't stand in front of it while you're making your popcorn.
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:49.640]   But I feel like that that has kind of died off. And I'm not saying I am not taking a position on
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:53.800]   whether it's healthy or not. But I think that it will happen and they're very small installs.
[01:21:53.800 --> 01:21:56.440]   So it's not like putting one of those giant trees on the side of the road.
[01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:59.960]   But they have to be within 100, 200 feet of each other. There have to be a lot of them.
[01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:03.240]   They have to be an awful lot of them. That's also a massive capital expansion.
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:07.720]   The thing I'm a little concerned about is we've already got big broadband lags in America.
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:15.720]   In terms of how easy and how cheap is your access to high speed internet in several belts of the
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:23.720]   country compared to rural areas, are we going to be broadening that? Or are we going to drive
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:27.880]   across fields of alfalfa and sorghum and just everything? Well, that's what, yeah, that's the same thing.
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:30.680]   I don't understand where are those microwave ovens going to go. Yeah.
[01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:34.680]   It's not even that. It's the expense of putting them in. If there's only five people that are
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:38.040]   going to use them. It's the same reason you don't have broadband in rural areas now.
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:42.760]   Yeah. And that doesn't change the equation. And you've seen it did a fantastic package on rural
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:48.600]   broadband coverage. It was really quite good. And this has been a thing that has been a low level
[01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:53.560]   ongoing issue, actually since like the start of the internet, but it's picked up increasing
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:23:00.040]   urgency, especially as more agriculture becomes dependent on broadband and internet access.
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:04.200]   You've got to have internet that John Deere. Who's going to who's going to underwrite the expense?
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:07.560]   And is it going to be pockets of haves and have knots? Or are we going to get sort of...
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:12.040]   It already is pockets of haves and have knots. Oh, it's terrible. It's terrible. I mean, I grew
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:15.800]   up in a small town and I still spend a lot of time in that small town. And it's difficult.
[01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:20.040]   It's terrible. I hear of all people every day. It's not great. It's not good. Even on the Sonoma
[01:23:20.040 --> 01:23:25.320]   coast. AT&T basically doesn't work. Which is just 20 miles from San Francisco.
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:31.480]   And in a way, I feel like this 5G thing is going to distract from the FCC's broadband plan,
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:35.080]   which as far as I could tell is more abundant. Everybody's just going to defer and say,
[01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:37.800]   oh, no, no, worry about it. 5G's coming. 5G's going to know that doesn't fix it.
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:39.640]   But it doesn't fix it. It's an infrastructure issue.
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:45.400]   Also, I was just going to point out that we have a little ways to go in terms of phone design.
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:51.240]   Qualcomm has come out and said is the number of extra antennas that are going to be needed,
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:57.400]   the kind of design language that is going to be needed to combine a Snapdragon 855 and an X50
[01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:05.560]   modem and the antenna modules and the antenna chips. Forget your headphone jack. That's gone.
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:13.160]   Forget your tiny battery. 5G hats. It's going to be... We'll all be simultaneously receivers and
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:18.920]   senders. It'll be great. The earliest generations of 5G are going to
[01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:24.520]   absolutely compromise in one way or another. And we have to wait to see how designers really
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:28.520]   do that. Or if they're like, that's just going to be a phone we make as a limited design. And it
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:34.440]   could become chicken or egg. If these phones are too bulky or too unwieldy or don't have wireless
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:40.040]   charging or have the kind of can't put your finger on this part of the phone gate, there's a lot
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:45.320]   that could happen there that just sets off an early adoption failure if everyone tries to rush it
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:51.160]   and the phones stink. I still think it'll be 2020 when there's a pretty large amount of adoption
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:55.080]   on phones. That doesn't mean all the infrastructure will be built out. It'll be a couple more years
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:25:00.040]   until it's all fleshed out enough to be able to have that completely virtual experience.
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:04.680]   But I don't know, from what I'm hearing from a variety of phone manufacturers, they are working
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:09.480]   really hard on this part. I'm not worried about the manufacturers. Don't worry about the carriers.
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:13.240]   And the carriers. Because the carriers see this as the future, it is.
[01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:17.320]   Or are they going to do what AT&T did it just label 4G, 5G and move on?
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:21.960]   No, I think that they're going to do it. It's going to take time. But ultimately,
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:27.080]   it might be less for them to maintain because those individual receivers are smaller and a little
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:29.960]   bit, I think, more nimble. And there's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:34.840]   Sure. It's almost like electric cars that way where you have the cars, but the charging stations
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:39.800]   watching those move out of smaller areas, that's still a process that's ongoing.
[01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:45.880]   Well, I'll tell you who will know when the internet doesn't work or does work. They know now
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:49.480]   thousand eyes. Do you know about thousand eyes? This is really an interesting company. They didn't
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:56.280]   invent San Francisco. I hosted a panel for them about a month ago. And because thousand eyes,
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:01.880]   they really should call it million eyes. They've got sensors all over the internet, everywhere,
[01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:07.480]   in every endpoint in the middle, at the edge. And because they've got these sensors everywhere,
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:15.960]   they know what's going on. They did a great study on cloud providers. And it's really interesting
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:21.800]   to see, for instance, that some cloud providers, I won't name names, are hopping or to get to China,
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:26.280]   they're hopping through Turkey. And you don't know this as a user. You might notice, well,
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:31.320]   there's more latency when I do it this way. But in fact, thousand eyes knows exactly what's going on.
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:35.480]   And if you're in the cloud for your business, and you know what, if you're not now, you will be in
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:41.080]   the cloud for your business, it's such a benefit you gain agility. But there's also risk and you're
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:46.920]   losing control. And that's where thousand eyes is amazing. Because when your cloud app or your service
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:54.920]   isn't working 100%, you can find out what's wrong and fix it. Instant visibility down the entire
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:27:01.080]   service delivery path from the cloud to your end user, including all that you don't have,
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:04.760]   doesn't have to be on things you control, thousand eyes sensors are everywhere.
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:13.000]   It's unlike anything you've seen before. Essentially, if you're an IT, if you're an ops,
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.480]   you understand that there's just that's why they draw the cloud like a little puffy cloud,
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:21.400]   but you don't know what's inside it. There's just this mysterious portion of the cloud that
[01:27:21.400 --> 01:27:26.360]   your stuff's going through. And I think most people just kind of go, we'll never know. Why is it
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:31.160]   latent? I don't know. We'll never know. It's the cloud. Now you will know it's like you've been
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:35.800]   blind. It's like you've been looking through a dirty windshield and thousand eyes comes along
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:41.560]   and squeegees it clean. And suddenly you go, wow, I can see it all. I can see it all. And you could
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:47.240]   fix whatever's going wrong. Thousand eyes is cloud based software. It's built to help organizations do
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:53.960]   the cloud right. No one has the eyes that thousand eyes has a massive array of vantage points,
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:59.720]   spanning the global internet cloud providers, even the Wi-Fi and your local coffee shop in private
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:04.760]   and public clouds. This is not your old school IT monitoring, which just kind of sits there in
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:10.040]   your silo and can only see what's going on inside the data center. That's not going to help you in
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:15.800]   the cloud. Thousand eyes, unique path visualization technology extends beyond any boundaries, allowing
[01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:21.000]   you to see, understand, and improve the experience for all your apps, services, and websites.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:27.720]   I don't know how to explain this to you better than just say go to thousand eyes.com/twit. That's
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:36.680]   all spelled out to you. S-A-N-D-E-Y-E-S.com/twit. Top banks, enterprises, SaaS companies, the world's
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:41.800]   largest and fastest growing bank brands rely on thousand eyes software to do the cloud and to do
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:48.600]   it right. You will be so grateful. I promise you, you will be, I will be getting emails
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:56.840]   for people saying, I can't believe I worked without this for so long. Thousandeyes.com/twit

[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:33.400]   Let's see. What else is going on in the world? Apple has, according to John Petchkowski,
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:42.120]   he's the last man standing at BuzzFeed. I feel bad for John. He's so good. He'll find, even if
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:47.720]   they don't keep him. But you know what BuzzFeed did to do is a really great... Buzzfeed's been doing
[01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:52.760]   great work. I know. Great work. And I had a hilarious conversation with my 15-year-old
[01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:58.440]   who was like, wait, what? Because they think it's a viral networking company. They even kids do.
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:03.240]   That's where they made a mistake. My daughter thinks it's a quiz engine. It is, I mean, it is a quiz engine.
[01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:08.200]   But it's a fun engine. And I was shocked. I mean, he was shocked when his mom was like,
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:13.880]   no, actually, BuzzFeed has serious news. Yeah. But it is a universal problem for BuzzFeed.
[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:18.520]   My wife, we were talking about the BuzzFeed story, which I think ended up being proven.
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:23.560]   I don't know. It wasn't maybe the best source story. I don't know. It was a political story.
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:27.960]   Oh, I know which one you're referring to. It was a Trump story, but I can't remember what it was.
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:32.360]   Is it the Mueller investigation? Yeah. Oh, that's right. And then Mueller denied it.
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:35.720]   And it made BuzzFeed look kind of bad on their face, but we still don't know.
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:38.520]   We don't actually know that it was wrong. We don't know that it was wrong.
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:43.080]   Anyway, they had a really strong political. Lisa said, well, it's BuzzFeed. Of course,
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:47.640]   they don't have that scoop. And I said, no, no, they have a, that's the problem, right?
[01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:53.640]   They are one of the few outlets that actually looks at finance and economic stories through
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:58.920]   a lens of people under the age of 40. Right. With great reporters like Petchkowski,
[01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:03.000]   which is vital too, if you want to understand where things are going to be five to 10 years
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.960]   from now in terms of employment and which industries are going to be thriving.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:11.480]   So Mueller has yet to put out a press release denying this, but apparently,
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:16.440]   Courtney Petchkowski, Apple is planning an event for March 25th. Actually, this ties back a little
[01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:22.040]   bit to our conversation because this is going to be apparently a news event. This is, remember,
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:27.800]   about Apple news about Apple news. They bought Texture, which is a magazine subscription service.
[01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:33.480]   We loved it. It was a sponsor here. They have their own Apple news. They've been hiring people
[01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:38.120]   like crazy, including some of our employees to run a news division, but they've been in,
[01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:44.200]   when Nathan disappeared, Nathan, all of our child disappeared to go to Apple. We didn't hear
[01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:48.360]   anything more from them. They've hired a lot of great people. Serenity called out a lot of great
[01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:54.680]   people, Anand, right? Yeah. So they've been very quiet. Chris Breen, John, Chris Breen.
[01:31:55.960 --> 01:31:59.720]   So they've been building up an organization, but it's so we think this is what we're going to hear
[01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:03.880]   about in March. Again, it's just a rumor. Apple hasn't announced anything. We won't get
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:09.000]   in. They won't get invited. What am I saying? We they won't get invites until the first or
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:14.520]   second week in March. Apple is probably going to talk about iPad. I would think going to talk
[01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:18.200]   about iPads and other stuff, but maybe not. Maybe this just doesn't. There's a word on the street.
[01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:23.880]   I mean, there are rumors about new iPad mini. It would in a way make sense because you could read
[01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:28.920]   it on your mini. Yes, reading on your mini. And by the way, and aside, the rumors say that the
[01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:35.160]   mini will still have a headphone jack. Weird. Why the pro didn't and the mini would is kind of
[01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:39.480]   beyond me. But that's an aside. Courage could be just could be the motherboard could be just the
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:43.480]   supplier for the smaller. Maybe the mini isn't a big upgrade. Yeah. That makes a lot of sense
[01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:49.880]   about the motherboard. Anyway, back to the point. It could be involved, but I think it's probably
[01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:54.440]   just going to be about the news and streaming. Yes. Because that's the other service apples
[01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:58.520]   supposedly shopping around. Remember, they've been acquiring like crazy. They have more than a
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:03.000]   billion dollars with a new content. They have been making an increasing percentage of the revenue
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:09.240]   off of services and recurring income. But that's mostly the app store. It's not really.
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:16.040]   Music. Yeah. Maybe Apple music and Apple TV in general. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:21.960]   Apple movies off of Apple. I mean, Apple were to put together a bundled subscription where they're
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:27.000]   like you get two to four movies a month plus access to these publications plus access to Apple.
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:31.960]   Oh, you think it might be all one service. It could be. You know, one of the real concerns that
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:37.160]   people who are launching or maintaining a streaming service are going to have is what is the what
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:42.120]   is the saturation point for consumers? Like how many streaming services do people want to subscribe
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:48.600]   to? And if you are Apple, what you can do is put together a media bundle and then presented as
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:52.360]   we're not asking you to subscribe to a whole lot of things. We're giving you a one stop shop.
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:57.640]   The same way that Amazon positions its prime stuff as a one stop. Although I think that that
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:00.920]   would be really smart. Yeah. I don't think that's what they're going to do. Oh, I can.
[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:05.000]   According to the Wall Street Journal, and this is probably because publishers, including the Wall
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.880]   Street Journal, leaked this. Yeah. Apple has gone to them saying, okay, here's what we're going to do.
[01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:13.480]   It's going to be $10 a month. We're going to keep half the money.
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:20.200]   And then we're going to divide the other half amongst you based on how much time people spend
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:25.080]   looking at your stuff. Oh, my God. And oh, by the way, don't expect to get any of that subscriber
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:31.320]   information. And news publishers, that's a, that subscriber information is hugely valuable.
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:35.080]   They can market to them. The New York target, lots of junk from the New York Times and the Washington
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:42.440]   Post be Apple keeps 50% and gives us kind of an unknown share of the rest.
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:47.720]   The thing that is so weird to me about this is that, okay, let's say that you are in New York Times
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:52.760]   and or Wall Street Journal and or Washington Post subscriber. Maybe this will make sense for you
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:57.560]   if you get other stuff bundled in there and you really like the app. But most people do not pay
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:03.000]   for their news. So the idea that all of this is going to get bundled in something that is convenient,
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.760]   I don't think is enough. I think that Apple is going to, it's going to be harder than Apple
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:10.680]   thinks. Well, it's worse than that for these, for the, let's say the Washington Post or the New
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:15.720]   York Times. So you're not going to get a lot of new people and people like me who pay full freight
[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:19.000]   for the New York Times or Washington Post or Wall Street Journal, I'm going to say, Oh crap,
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.200]   I could just spend 10 bucks a month to get it all. That saves me money.
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:24.920]   And so you're going to lose them. If you're in the Amazon Prime member, you pay practically
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:29.640]   nothing for a Washington Post subscription already. Yeah. So, so that, I mean, that's a case of
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:35.080]   successful media bundling. But Amazon does not want me to dump that to go to Apple. No, no, but
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:41.080]   to get back to my, my, my, my, my, my insane theory about the merits of multimedia bundling,
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:44.600]   you pay for Amazon Prime. Now, indeed, the free shipping. Yay, we're killing the planet. You also
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:50.360]   get access to a huge video library. It's worth it. It's super cheap rate on the Washington Post.
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:54.680]   Apple could in theory put something to give it like that, where I keep getting hung up on is the
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:36:00.920]   whole, Oh, we'll pay you according to user engagement because that is so disconnected from the quality
[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:06.040]   of the editorial product you put out. That's right. Sure. What it just drives is link, it just drives
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:10.600]   link bait, right? Yeah. Yeah. Well, and the difference is that Amazon effectively owns, I mean,
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:16.520]   Amazon doesn't own the Washington Post, but yeah, Bezos owns it effectively. Yeah. It's very closely
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:22.120]   tied. Apple is much more of a third party for most people. Apple's probably trying to work with.
[01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:27.160]   Yeah. Let's say that this is happening. I first, I got with the full disclosure, my employer is
[01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:31.880]   part of the Conde Nast family. Conde Nast has been linked. They were part of texture before.
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:39.000]   And I will just say that subscriptions are sort of the next level for a lot of print media companies,
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:45.800]   in terms of putting paywalls on sites. That's becoming more of a thing. And I could see Apple
[01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:50.200]   going to these companies and saying, we have an idea for how to get you money for people who
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:54.280]   wouldn't otherwise pay in thinking that they're smart when these other companies are trying to
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:59.320]   say, no, no, no, we're trying to sell our version of this. So I think what's going to happen is a
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:03.480]   lot. I have no context on any of that stuff. I'm removed from all of that. But I do believe
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:08.360]   that is a battle that is going to play out for however long it takes for Apple to actually shout
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:12.360]   this out. If it hasn't already been going on for months and why all the hiring happened
[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:18.280]   before a product was released, I also want to point out I was a former contributor to the daily,
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:22.920]   which we may all recall. Oh, this was Murdoch's that I had only magazine.
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:27.640]   Yeah, I subscribed to that. Apple News 4 worked on together where you paid a dollar a week,
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:33.320]   you had to read ads, you could only access that day's content, a total disaster. So Apple was
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:38.520]   closely linked to the beginning of that. There was no way that Apple News as an app, as a service,
[01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:44.440]   as a paid product, will be in any way resembling that. I think you can look at that disaster,
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:49.720]   that burning. How nice newsroom though, didn't you? Oh, I was freelance. I was here in Seattle.
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:56.120]   So you had a really nice newsroom. I visited there once it was lovely. They were throwing
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:38:01.160]   money away. But I do believe, look at what that was. Look at every single mistake it made and expect
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:07.960]   the exact opposite in terms of access, design. Here's Apple's pitch. The world is changing.
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:12.120]   You need digital subscriptions. We know everything there is to know about it. We're going to bring
[01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:16.200]   you a vast audience. We know it's a lucrative audience because they buy our crappy phone for
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:19.960]   twice as much as it's worth. No, they won't say that. But that's... They've spent more of this
[01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:24.200]   here on apps than they did the year before. That's right. They're very engaged audience.
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:28.920]   We can solve your problem. Now, I don't think Apple ended up getting 50%. What if it's 30%?
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:33.800]   Well, I don't know. And here's the other thing that remains to be seen is whether or not people
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:39.000]   who are used to getting Apple News for free. We'll pay. Apple News is worth every penny you pay
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:44.200]   for it right now. But it's the cost of the phone. It's direct. I mean, it isn't good.
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:50.680]   Is it? Do you use it? No. I know. I know a lot of people who do. Let's just see what's on the top.
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:55.400]   Because it's on their phone. You cannot overestimate. I've already moved it.
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:59.800]   I really... It's sitting with the stocks app in the Apple folder. I hate using the my mom metric for
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:04.440]   tech reporting. The same way I hate using it. Oh, my wife pointed this out. The implication that
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:10.440]   your female relatives can't use tech is just exploding. But my mother, who is a eager and
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:16.600]   enthusiastic adopter at 70, got her first iPhone last year and is hooked on Apple News. She's always
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:20.440]   sending me articles that she found through Apple News. My mother too. And actually, I like what you
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:24.360]   said because my mother is the only user of technology in my parents' household. My father...
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:32.600]   My father doesn't have an email address. So, my mother is the adopter and she is an
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:36.520]   eager adopter and she likes Apple News. I would think Apple would know a lot about me.
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:41.640]   I've been using Apple News. I use other Apple products in my top stories. For me,
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:47.480]   I've got a golf story about... I don't even... I don't play golf. I don't follow golf. JB Home
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:52.920]   Slow Play criticized by announcers. I have a popular mechanic story on the Army's next infantry guns.
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:57.720]   I do have a couple of... There's a politics story and a couple of tech stories,
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:04.280]   including why America's new apartment buildings all look alike. My fear when I click this, and I
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:09.800]   bet you this other people have this problem, is that if I fall for any one of these, I'm going to
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:15.240]   get a lot more of the same. Meanwhile, Google, which does also its own news, let's see what
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:18.440]   its top stories are for me. I think it might be a little bit better. I don't know.
[01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:21.400]   I'm looking at my Apple. Now, I'm doing the same thing.
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:23.080]   Trump Politics. Politics.
[01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:27.880]   Man discovers 30-year-old Apple computers still in working order. Okay, you can cross that. It is
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:34.600]   Sunday. VR games, he's huge increase in sales as players confuse it for Apex Legends.
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:39.240]   Okay, that's a good story. I might click on that. Are you playing Apex Legends yet, Sam?
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:42.360]   Oh, yeah. I can tell you all about that if we get into Sam's gaming corner.
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:48.200]   Well, it's a story because it did in two days what Fortnite took two weeks to do,
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:50.360]   get 10 million subscribers. Well, Fortnite said that.
[01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:52.760]   I mean, now everybody knows what it is.
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:54.280]   Yeah, that's right. They didn't have to explain it.
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:59.320]   Yeah. But you made the point I wanted to make, which is that Google's news service,
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:03.320]   which pops up in Google now in another way, is whether you're using Chrome or using an Android
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:06.440]   phone, it's doing it. I mean, I don't want to say more than that for my business.
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:12.600]   It's much better. As a web content creator, I think we all know some information about how
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:17.160]   well Google News does. And so Apple is going to have to, if it's going to jump into this,
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:19.320]   they're going to have to do it the Apple way.
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:21.560]   Which is the expensive way. Yeah.
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:25.800]   It's kind of crazy though, because Google News does it for free. And Google does an amazing job.
[01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:30.680]   This creeps me out actually. But Google does a great job recommending for me new seasons of
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:36.200]   things that I've been watching on Amazon. Google is uncanny when it comes to news at knowing,
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:40.520]   of course, it knows everything and knowing everything I want. It pushes stories at me that
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:45.320]   I will click. There's no reason in the world Apple should be pushing a golf story at me.
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:50.280]   This is maybe because Apple puts privacy first. Maybe this is a consequence of
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:52.520]   not spying on people. So that's what they would say.
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:55.640]   Maybe they're an old guy at Lizzet Petaluma. You must like golf.
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:41:57.400]   I don't know. I don't know what they're doing.
[01:41:57.400 --> 01:42:00.600]   I think there's a, I think their sales pitch may very well go in that direction,
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:06.280]   but it's also got to compete with really Apple News's best shot is Google messing up. Google
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:11.880]   sort of acting like an 800 pound gorilla and saying, gosh, be terrible if you as a news outlet
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:16.200]   lost all these clicks we've been helping you get. And I think that really is the thing that
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:21.080]   because Facebook sort of went up in that direction and that's that has changed the
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:26.440]   looks. What's happening in Europe to Google at the behest of publishers in Europe like Axel
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:30.920]   Springer who think Google is the arch enemy that.
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:35.720]   What I know right now is that when we do our editorial operations, we optimize for Google SEO
[01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:40.280]   and how can we get things more visible on Apple News is not a priority.
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:42.920]   We're asking yet. Maybe it will. Maybe it will be.
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:46.840]   We look at both and they're both important in different ways.
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:49.000]   Do they drive traffic? Apple News. Yeah.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.120]   Oh, absolutely. Yeah.
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:53.560]   Yeah. What is the, I mean, you don't have to tell me if you can't, but what's the biggest
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:56.920]   traffic driver for you at this point? Is it Google search? Is it Facebook? Is it Apple?
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:42:59.640]   Is it? It's Google. Google search. Yeah.
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:02.680]   Yeah. Well, search is search with if you include AMP.
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:05.480]   AMP is an interesting story. Yeah.
[01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:08.520]   That's the 800 pound gorilla thing on their part.
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:15.160]   Yeah. And I'm not fond because yeah, it's a better user experience, but everything else goes through
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:19.160]   Google. Well, that's the thing. I don't know that people prioritize the AMP and their search results.
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:23.080]   You get in that carousel at the top of the page. That's a better place to be than anywhere else.
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:28.120]   I feel like that's a, that's a real power play on Google's part. They pretend it's the open web.
[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:35.800]   It's not. It's, it's, it's, it's a really interesting time in publishing because things are changing
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:40.120]   so quickly. Things are, and it, you know, behooves everybody to be everywhere.
[01:43:40.120 --> 01:43:46.360]   I can remember I was having dinner with a couple PR people in 2006 and 2007 and
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:50.920]   talking about the frustration I had. I pitched a story saying, how is Google changing the way we do
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:55.640]   news? And my editor wasn't biting. And I mentioned this to the PR people and she looked at me blankly.
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:44:00.040]   She said, well, I don't see how Google's affecting the way the media does their job.
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:04.200]   And I think about that conversation like once a week. Wait, when was this? This is like in 2006.
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:09.080]   And again, I think about this conversation about once a week and, and wonder where we've all ended
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:16.120]   up. It's so funny. In 2006, I was working for a weekly paper that was really struggling to get
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:21.800]   on the internet. It was, I was part of the New Times, Village Voice Media, syndicate. And it was,
[01:44:21.800 --> 01:44:26.680]   it was really pulling it teeth to get any sort of daily blog content up. It was about why are we
[01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:32.360]   not focusing on the print product. That was 13 years ago. Sam, you impressed me because if,
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:37.160]   I think I thought you were just like Super Mario Brothers addicted. And you actually have very
[01:44:37.160 --> 01:44:43.080]   deep roots in the, in the real press in the journal. I have been a syndicated published author since
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:48.600]   1996, my friend. I am very impressed. You're older than you look. I'm 75 years old.
[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:53.800]   You know, I have a golf and guns article. You might be interested. It was also tanks.
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:45:00.360]   And it was like, that's all my kind of stuff. And that giant surface tablet thing. Oh, yeah.
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:04.760]   I love this. Can I get all of your this? You want my toys? I got the best toys.
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:06.120]   My colleague Richard Haywood.
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:13.320]   Oh, this is so awesome. It's perfect for hosting a podcast, at least of, or a television show,
[01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:17.160]   because it kind of gets out of the way at 15 degrees. And but it's big. And if I want to show
[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:21.960]   something, I can, you know, I can tell us straight it and I can do this and I can draw pictures on
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:27.320]   stuff and, you know, it's, you know, personally, I just want the next tall lens to let me do that
[01:45:27.320 --> 01:45:31.000]   strap to my face. And I really do hope that's something that gets revealed.
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:34.760]   One week, one week from today, in fact, we'll be covering that as well.
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:40.040]   I am Pacific noon Eastern time on the 24th at Mobile World Congress. It's expected.
[01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:48.200]   Microsoft will release HoloLens. Now, I see some stories to take too, but it really would be three.
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:52.600]   They just never released HoloLens two. I think they're just Holo HoloLens.
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:58.760]   Oh, the next HoloLens. What do we know? What do we, what do we think about this?
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:01.320]   Peter Bright's writing it in ours, Technica. You guys have such great.
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:06.040]   The public information in terms of leaks is very thin. I just depend on my birdies between
[01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:10.280]   people I've heard from in HoloLens and from Magic Leap and other companies. And it's just
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:16.840]   basically a question of what the final decision is on the, on the manufacturing line of a wider
[01:46:16.840 --> 01:46:21.960]   aspect ratio and a faster chip and the amount of battery and how light and fluffy it all feels.
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:26.360]   It's really just going to boil down to which market they're going for, whether it's enterprise
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:31.480]   or whether they're ready for going to that sort of consumer level buy it at best buy kind of thing.
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:34.280]   And I really do believe it'll still be on the enterprise side.
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:37.880]   Because they've hatched their bets. Initially with the HoloLens, they showed games, they showed
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:42.840]   Minecraft, they showed shooting things coming through the walls. Of late, they've really focused
[01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:49.480]   more on the Windows holographic windows, on business applications, air traffic control,
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:52.760]   stuff like that. So you think they're going to double down on that and leave the.
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:56.520]   I think you can look at their events where they've taken things like the surface tablet and some of
[01:46:56.520 --> 01:47:02.280]   these other incredibly nice specialized devices that are for specific kind of users to be their
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:07.880]   best device. And I think they want HoloLens to start out in that similar way so that as that
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:11.960]   trickles down, kind of like how the Surface Pro took them a while to finally nail. And then that
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:16.920]   began to trickle down to a more affordable model where now I feel like anyone I know says,
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:22.200]   what do you think? Go, yes, Surface, solid. And I think they're going to keep on that trajectory.
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:25.960]   They've got that established. And if they can just keep those parts getting cheaper and just,
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:30.920]   it's that field of view for anyone who hasn't used HoloLens, it really does feel like a tiny
[01:47:30.920 --> 01:47:36.280]   little peephole into a virtual world. Have you used them? I have. I've used them both and they're
[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:40.920]   very similar in their aspect ratio, meaning if you're not looking directly at the cuddly bunny
[01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:45.400]   that's magically appeared on your coffee table, it's not there. So if they can just get that
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:50.440]   wide enough to where people can suspend enough belief and have an imaginary desktop,
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:55.400]   because again, that ability, Windows 10 is about to roll out the ability to just take any
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:48:01.400]   desktop window and throw it into your VR Windows holographic space. And that's the stuff that sort
[01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:06.120]   of multi monitor vision to be able to look around and have 20 different website tabs and email
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:08.840]   things if that's the kind of power use you want. I mean,
[01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:09.400]   sounds like heaven.
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:14.360]   Some people love a bunch of monitors. Some people want to keep it really focused, but I love
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:19.560]   that idea of just breaking open the limit. You guys are both using old MacBook ears.
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:23.960]   If you take a look at the Microsoft tea leaves, one of the areas they've been devoting a lot of
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:27.560]   time and attention to over the last two to three years, or they're so called first line workers.
[01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:33.880]   That's people in retail. That's people in healthcare. Those are people who don't have desk jobs.
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:38.920]   And what they're trying to do is establish themselves as the go to services, software,
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:41.720]   and hardware providers. That's where surface fills it fits into.
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:46.200]   Surface fits in there and hollow lens will fit into because if they can make forays into
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:54.920]   architecture, construction, your infrastructure, repair, and rebuilding areas. Again, environmental
[01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:58.920]   challenges, things like that. This is where they perceive growth as opposed to back office.
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:03.320]   I really like the new Microsoft. It's not a be that I like to cover because I'm not an enterprise
[01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:09.320]   guy, but I am so impressed. No, I know. I'm so impressed with what Nadella has done in five years.
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:13.400]   Well, completely pivoting the company. And I think finding some real traction.
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:18.360]   I think that what you're saying is correct broadly, which is that
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:22.840]   Microsoft stands to benefit if they can create something that is really helpful to real people,
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:28.360]   but is also understandable and will be accessible by consumers. And so I wouldn't be surprised if
[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:33.560]   whatever Microsoft releases is something that we can all understand very well. And what's
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:37.400]   interesting is if you go back to the first hollow lens and the reveal of the first hollow lens,
[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:40.680]   I don't know if you guys remember that actual reveal precedent. Yes.
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:45.320]   But what was so impressive about it was that they did such a great job with the video that
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:51.080]   demoed it. And as a journalist, the hardest thing about covering VR or AR is showing the audience
[01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:55.080]   what it's going to look like and helping people appreciate it because you cannot capture the
[01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:59.960]   experience of being inside. Unless they do it as a turn out as a bit of a lie. It was a little bit
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:04.280]   of a lie, but they did a good job. Yeah. And I think that they probably learn from that. So I
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:09.160]   wouldn't be surprised if whatever they do does a good job packaging that again so that people
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:14.040]   can understand it and then back to 5G. That's going to make a difference. When they're going to
[01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:18.920]   buy time, but get out in front of the story enough that they get their name back in the conversation,
[01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:23.240]   leapfrog these other devices that have been out there over the last couple of years.
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:26.840]   Yeah. Make sure you remember hollow lens and the one 5G is here and it will make sense for everybody.
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:30.840]   Sell it to everybody. I think one of the advantages that Microsoft has
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:35.240]   is if you're using it at work, it's nothing for you then to bring home a hollow lens and game with it.
[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:41.160]   Yeah. Or something like that too. Just as, and this is at all loops and I promise,
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:46.200]   Google's apps have had a huge adoption rate, especially among younger adults who are just
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:49.960]   getting out of college. And there are workplaces that are now switching from Microsoft Office over
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:53.800]   to the Google App Suite because that's what their workforce has come up with. That's what they
[01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:58.280]   prefer to use, things like that. And so Microsoft is doubling down on education
[01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:03.960]   because it wants to cut off the Google advantage and it also wants to get back into households.
[01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:07.640]   Apple is trying to do that too. And surprisingly, given the Apple history,
[01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:13.320]   kind of feeling that it's, well, they're pricey. They're too expensive. Every kid I know uses
[01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:18.040]   Chromebooks and that's it. They seem tone deaf, frankly, to the needs of education.
[01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:22.440]   That's why they have commercials with iPads and what's that computer? Right. And even those
[01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:27.000]   are still too expensive. It's too expensive. Even a 329. Yeah, Google tablets are fine.
[01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:32.360]   Yeah. So I've been wearing, and some of you've noticed this black ring for some time now,
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:38.920]   I got it some, I know it's almost, it's about six months ago. It's an Aura. Oh, you are a ring.
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:46.440]   And it is just fantastic. I first met the founder of Aura through Kevin Rose. He is an advisor. He
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:49.480]   said, I'll get you one. He'd been where I said, what's that ring? He said, I'll get you one. You're
[01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:54.920]   not going to believe how cool this is. And then we had our pre on the founder on the new screen
[01:51:54.920 --> 01:52:00.920]   savers. They now advertising the show. I'm very pleased about it. Oh, I just got new ring firmware.
[01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:06.120]   I probably should update, but I won't do that right now. I'll show you. So this ring ties to my
[01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:12.600]   smartphone works with iOS or Android. It is the best fitness device ever has no screen,
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:17.880]   but that means it can be small. It's very lightweight. It's made of titanium very tough.
[01:52:17.880 --> 01:52:22.520]   I can wear it in the shower. I can wear it when I swim. It tracks activity. Yes,
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:28.760]   because it has built in. It has an accelerometer, a gyroscope, but it also has
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:35.080]   infrared optical pulse measurement. That's really cool. And it's on your finger, which is the best
[01:52:35.080 --> 01:52:40.360]   place to measure your pulse much better than the wrist. It has a body temperature sensor,
[01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:45.320]   which means it's recording at all times your body temperature. And as a result, it is the best
[01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:50.440]   sleep monitor, the best exercise monitor I've ever seen. Here's last night's sleep score. I got
[01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:57.160]   a great score. I'm refreshed and ready. I can see movement. I can see when I was awake. I had an
[01:52:57.160 --> 01:53:03.160]   hour and 52 minutes of REM, five hours of light. I had 21 minutes of deep sleep. If I tap on these,
[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:09.080]   I'll get some insights about all this that tells you a lot about what these all mean. For instance,
[01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:14.120]   21 minutes is, you see, it's marked in red. That's a little bit low, and they'll even give you some
[01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:20.520]   suggestions about things you can do to improve that. I also can see things like how long it took me
[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:26.120]   to fall asleep. Four minutes. That's pretty good. I was tired. That's awesome. Sleep latency, they call
[01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:33.000]   it. I can see my resting heart rate. This is really valuable because the only way to test your
[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:37.080]   resting heart rate is when you're resting. And since I don't sit down very often, it's really good
[01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:41.080]   to know that my resting heart rate is actually 55 beats per minute. That's fantastic. It will
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:47.160]   give you a readiness score for every day based on a lot of things, including heart rate variability.
[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:52.920]   It turns out, and they explain this quite well, that the difference in time between the beats of
[01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:57.960]   your heart is heart rate variability and higher variability is better. So you can see in December,
[01:53:57.960 --> 01:54:03.080]   I was struggling a little bit. It had fallen down, but it's coming back now. That tied to things like
[01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:09.640]   my body temperature. And these are really infinitesimal differences, less than a degree in most cases.
[01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:14.360]   My body temperature was down 1.2 degrees. That's probably why I slept so well. That's a very good
[01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:18.520]   indicator. If you're getting the flu, getting a cold, if you have stress or anxiety, it'll start
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:25.640]   to trend up. All of these things are super valuable in quantifying what's going on with your body
[01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:32.200]   and what it means for your day. Today, I am ready. 86 readiness score out of 100. It says,
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:36.120]   "Your readiness is off the chart. Today's a great day to take it to the next level." They
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:40.520]   explain what it all means. They even show you a graph of your readiness score over a period of
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:46.520]   time, which hasn't been all that good. In fact, my readiness score really dipped down in November.
[01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:53.400]   Maybe that's why December was so rough. Aura is amazing. You get sleep insights, bedtime guidance.
[01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:57.400]   That tells you it's time to go to bed now or it's better now. They'll tell you it's time to get a
[01:54:57.400 --> 01:55:02.680]   little exercise right now. You can tie it into your Apple Health. So that means when I get
[01:55:02.680 --> 01:55:08.280]   exercise through my Apple Watch, it gets imported automatically into the Aura. That's really fantastic,
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:16.360]   including any information it knows about it. It's readiness insights, recovery optimization.
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:21.400]   So I know if maybe it's not time to lift weights today or maybe this would be a great time to go
[01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:26.920]   for a run. Resting heart rate, heart rate, variability, body temperature, respiratory rate.
[01:55:27.480 --> 01:55:32.360]   You can have daily activity goals. It'll track activities, steps, calories, inactivity, alerts.
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:40.680]   And this feedback really is the most rich, valuable information I've ever got from any fitness device
[01:55:40.680 --> 01:55:45.560]   I've ever used. It's amazing. That's the good news. The bad news is these are selling out like crazy.
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:50.280]   I feel terrible because this date has been slipping when we first started doing the
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:54.520]   advertisements. I think it was get it by April, right? Or March. Now they're out to me because
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:59.240]   these things are flying off the shelves. One other thing you'll like, read the privacy policy.
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:04.840]   This is a company from Finland. So they're governed by GDPR or is available in eight sizes. In fact,
[01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:09.240]   they'll send you a ring size or if you go to their website, there's two shapes. There's the
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:14.840]   round shape or the balance shape that I'm wearing, which has a little kind of a flat surface on it
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:20.760]   that makes it kind of striking. I love my Aura now. Charging. Last for a week.
[01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:26.360]   So I have a little charger base. Looks kind of like this. It is like this. That's it.
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:32.360]   You put that on your dresser or wherever. All I really do is when I'm showering or I'm going to
[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:38.200]   showering is a good time to do it. Brush my teeth. I'll put it on there. 10 minutes. It keeps
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:44.200]   it charged up. It syncs to your device using Bluetooth L.A. so it's very fast. The memory in the ring
[01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:48.440]   is up to six weeks. So don't feel like you have to pair it or connect it to your phone every day.
[01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:55.240]   It'll take up to six weeks of data. So this thing is basically maintenance-free. You don't even
[01:56:55.240 --> 01:57:00.520]   pay attention to it. It's just recording. Whenever I think of it, I open up the app, copy the data off.
[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:05.320]   The app is free for iOS and Android. And as you saw, the regular updates, in fact, I just got a firmware
[01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:10.120]   update. Track you sleep. Make the most of your day. If you're an athlete, if you just want to know
[01:57:10.120 --> 01:57:14.440]   more about what's going on, why you're feeling great today and not so great the next day,
[01:57:14.440 --> 01:57:20.600]   or a ring.com. Oh, you are a R-I-N-G.com. $50 off if you use the Twitter offer code.
[01:57:20.600 --> 01:57:26.280]   But you have to order now to get it by May. Do it. It's worth it. I know that's kind of you get
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:30.840]   excited about something you want it tomorrow. I waited for a few months to get mine. I'm really
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:38.520]   glad Lisa wears it too. Or a ring.com use the offer code TWIT. Let's see. Last bits of things.
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:43.480]   The BuzzFeed journalist after the layoff are going to unionize. But Bloomberg told me about it
[01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:50.520]   because nobody buzzes reporting on that. Does that scare you, Lindsey, is management at CBS Interactive?
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:58:00.040]   You know, it's not. No. Unions exist for a reason. And I think that publications who
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:09.800]   need them will have that come up. Yep. I'm after. SAG 2. Although nobody's hired me for a movie yet.
[01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:15.240]   I'm ready. You ready? I got my card. You're qualified. I got my say card. I'm just saying.
[01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:20.600]   You're probably then in a position to speak specifically to what unionization does and doesn't
[01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:25.000]   do. And I think that can get lost in a lot of these stories. It's so important. And it's really
[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:31.160]   interesting because ultimately what it's saying for employees, especially in a trade like writing,
[01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:38.200]   is the realities of publishing cannot be changed. But employees underneath the top brass
[01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:46.040]   want a seat at a bargaining table, especially in the case of, well, our decision is we are going to
[01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:50.520]   have a bunch of layoffs. So at least there can then be a conversation for those affected of saying
[01:58:50.520 --> 01:58:55.000]   maybe some people want to take voluntary layoffs. Maybe some people want to have that guarantee of
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:59:00.200]   a 30 or 60 day notice on a certain amount of severance. And I think that's that. That is a
[01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:05.880]   thing. The story that is, I think, becoming more well spoken, but it can still get lost sort of in
[01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:11.480]   either anti union or just confusion about it. So I think all this is a saying is that Buzzfeed
[01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:18.280]   is perhaps the best primed to speak to what they would like at a bargaining table for the case of
[01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:24.120]   future giant wide out of nowhere layoffs. So I have to say for an actor's union like SAG and
[01:59:24.120 --> 01:59:29.400]   after the advantage of having union health insurance when you're in a gig economy is huge.
[01:59:29.400 --> 01:59:33.880]   And that is one very good reason to have a union. If you're going to be in a business where you're
[01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:38.120]   gigging, you know, moving from job to job, you're not going to have consistent benefits. So having
[01:59:38.120 --> 01:59:42.760]   the benefits provided by the union is well, well worth it. Well, did you see there were two stories
[01:59:42.760 --> 01:59:49.480]   that Bloomberg did? I believe a week to a week and a half ago where a 2016 Google memo got released
[01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:54.360]   into the wild among the Google employees. Do you, is the story for you memory of this?
[01:59:54.360 --> 02:00:00.440]   In the first story, it turned out that the meat of the memo was what are ways we can reduce the
[02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:05.720]   expense associated with having employees and contract employees.
[02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:08.840]   No, no, no, you're getting ahead of me here because in the first story,
[02:00:08.840 --> 02:00:14.280]   the two practices that now have employees feeling not very great about Google was they were
[02:00:14.280 --> 02:00:20.200]   proposing slowing down the promotion cycle. And the reasoning was the employees don't realize that
[02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:26.120]   we used to promote on X months. So if we do X plus Y, they won't care and we can stretch out
[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:30.680]   expenses. What this does for employee morale when they've been busting their butt and they don't
[02:00:30.680 --> 02:00:34.440]   see anything relative to earlier coworkers is not addressed. Just don't we can stretch out the
[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:41.000]   expenses. The second thing had to do with bonuses because typically Google managers were awarded,
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:46.760]   were given a pot of money and there and it was please disperse this as bonuses to your employees.
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:51.640]   When they do something bonus worthy as you see fit, there's no schedule. It's highly situational.
[02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:57.480]   And HR had noticed that managers often needed to be reminded they had the pots of money because
[02:00:57.480 --> 02:01:02.280]   they were very busy being Googlers. They didn't know better. And so HR was like,
[02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:08.280]   let's just stop reminding people. I'll just forget. Yeah, exactly. And they'll forget. And so Googlers
[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:13.000]   were a little bit worked up about this because it basically comes down to, oh, our company is now
[02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:20.120]   slowing down our advancement prospects and adding friction to the bonus. The second story that came
[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:25.320]   out was another idea that got floated was why don't we just make everybody a Google a contractor.
[02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:30.520]   And a lot of tech companies do this. And well, there was a piece in Bloomberg again this last
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:34.600]   week talking about Apple's black site, which sounds much more sinister than actually it was.
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:38.920]   It really was lots of Apple employees get to work in the pretty new building. There's another
[02:01:38.920 --> 02:01:43.880]   building nobody talks about the contractors work. And we saw that story at Google where people were
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:47.880]   saying, oh, you're not invited to the lunch because you're a contractor. Yeah, exactly. But it
[02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:52.920]   illustrates the cast systems where employees have protections that contractors do not.
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:57.080]   I actually have a dog in this hunt because I'm both an employer and a union member.
[02:01:57.080 --> 02:02:02.920]   So I understand both honestly, it's difficult these days. It's very difficult to have a business. And
[02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:06.520]   of course, you're always trying to cut costs. But there is nothing more valuable than your
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:10.920]   employees and treating your employees right ultimately is the best form of business treating
[02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:16.680]   customers and employees right. That's like 90% of the game. Sure. In the end, if you're a human
[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:21.480]   who relates to employees as humans, you're in a pretty good spot.
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:25.000]   And sometimes you have to do some pretty inhumane things as a business.
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:28.840]   Well, one of the things I found interesting about the BuzzFeed layoffs,
[02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:31.640]   in addition to the way they were just drawn out like a.
[02:02:31.640 --> 02:02:34.440]   Yeah, that's one thing that's inhumane.
[02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:38.360]   But one of the things that was interesting were how many BuzzFeed employees were taking to social
[02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:43.000]   media to effectively live to eat the story as it was happening, both the ones who were laid off
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:47.080]   and the ones who were left behind, how quickly they organized a directory of alumni who were
[02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:50.760]   going to need work and then how quickly they organized. That's awesome.
[02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:55.240]   All over social media though. But this was usually with layoffs, you see the numbers,
[02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:59.400]   but you don't have people flooding social media to tell you their viscera.
[02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:03.000]   There aren't secrets anymore. And this is another problem. A lot of businesses say,
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:06.680]   the worst thing that could happen to us is if employees started sharing their income,
[02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:11.480]   their salaries, because then people would have negotiating power against us. And I have
[02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:16.040]   feelings on both sides of that fence as well. I think it's actually probably a good thing for
[02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:20.600]   employees. Not such a good thing for employers who often want to pit employees against one another.
[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:23.480]   To that point about social media, that there was a similar
[02:03:23.480 --> 02:03:29.480]   layoff story in the games and tech industry this week with Activision Blizzard laying off nearly
[02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:35.080]   800 just whoosh. And there were people who kind of expected it, who had been given warnings as far
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:39.960]   back as November. But there was also the fact that they said they're not only they're doing a 8%
[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:46.600]   net layoff, but they also said they are hiring 20% more developers, which means more blood
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:51.240]   is going to be shed beyond that initial 800. So that's a story that's going to keep on going.
[02:03:51.240 --> 02:03:57.400]   And the immediate social media reaction was one mobilization for people saying we've got jobs and
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:01.000]   we're hiring in the game design world and all these different proficiencies and cities.
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:05.800]   And number two, a games unionization effort that's just been exploding. There's just been a lot
[02:04:05.800 --> 02:04:11.880]   more people in the independent and corporate ladders all trying to band together and create
[02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:16.200]   that sort of movement. That's been very interesting to watch. Let's go in the Sam corner right now
[02:04:16.200 --> 02:04:22.360]   with a couple of game stories. Pokemon Go, Niantic, which is a Google spin off. They were the Google
[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:27.240]   Maps guys who created Niantic created Ingress in the process. When they created Ingress, they
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:33.320]   created use Google Maps to create augmented reality, imaginary locations on top of real
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:38.760]   locations, like the post office and churches and monuments. Pokemon Go played off those same
[02:04:38.760 --> 02:04:44.440]   maps. They actually use the same locations instead of Niantic's or Ingress locations.
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:50.120]   They're Pokey Stops, Pokey Gems. Well, there was a class action lawsuit against Pokemon Go
[02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:56.360]   from a bunch of homeowners saying that Pokemon Go was leading players to congregate on or near
[02:04:56.360 --> 02:05:04.840]   private property. They sued Pokemon Go creator. Niantic has agreed to become more legally responsible.
[02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:13.160]   This all started in 2016 when Pokemon Go came out and you may remember the mobs that happened.
[02:05:13.160 --> 02:05:18.440]   I think that Niantic is settling now because they're getting ready for a game that will be
[02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:24.760]   even bigger, which is the Harry Potter version of the same game. And you'll have the same locations
[02:05:24.760 --> 02:05:27.240]   because they don't create new locations for the new games.
[02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:30.600]   They've been pulling from Ingress ever since the beginning.
[02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:31.240]   Starting with Ingress.
[02:05:31.240 --> 02:05:36.360]   Essentially the breeding ground for all of that data. That's why Pokemon Go opened up with a
[02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:40.840]   very lively world because it's insane beta testers were all over the United States and
[02:05:40.840 --> 02:05:46.360]   other countries, groking it out. Honestly, I would say it's just as simple as them saying,
[02:05:46.360 --> 02:05:53.160]   "We don't have a case." Because Niantic plus all of the other backing they have could absolutely
[02:05:53.160 --> 02:05:57.400]   lawyer up and fight this and keep all of that stuff. And I think it's just the kind of thing
[02:05:57.400 --> 02:06:01.080]   where they go, "Yeah, we are profiting off of other people's private enterprise."
[02:06:01.080 --> 02:06:03.400]   No, it's kind of the right to do.
[02:06:03.400 --> 02:06:03.400]   It's kind of the way to do.
[02:06:03.400 --> 02:06:09.400]   Wait a minute. I wish I had a Pokey stop outside the front door here. It's not in
[02:06:09.400 --> 02:06:13.080]   somebody's house or on-profit property. It's near private property.
[02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:17.640]   But if you are using the photo of the property and the name of the property,
[02:06:17.640 --> 02:06:22.440]   which all of the bookestops and gyms in my neighborhood typically are the name of the business
[02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:25.240]   somehow involved and a photo of said business.
[02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:28.600]   Now Starbucks pays good money to have every Starbucks gift Pokey stop.
[02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:31.880]   Yep, they're opting into that and probably getting paid as a result.
[02:06:31.880 --> 02:06:32.360]   Absolutely.
[02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:33.240]   I mean, I think there's-
[02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:37.720]   A lot of opt-in. It's interesting. I have some friends who used to be graffiti artists
[02:06:37.720 --> 02:06:40.040]   and they, you know, not legal at all.
[02:06:40.040 --> 02:06:42.120]   They say used to be, but I think they still do.
[02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:47.640]   Not legal at all, but really like there was a code of ethics around what you tag and what you
[02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:48.040]   don't.
[02:06:48.040 --> 02:06:48.760]   Good.
[02:06:48.760 --> 02:06:52.120]   And you can agree with the code of ethics or not, but it was roughly
[02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:55.400]   if it's public property, i.e. paid for by taxpayers, it's fair game.
[02:06:55.400 --> 02:07:00.360]   If it's a private home or a small business, do not do it.
[02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:00.840]   No, tax abuse.
[02:07:00.840 --> 02:07:02.200]   And I think that's kind of like, you know,
[02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:06.040]   or you don't tag somebody's like bakery, right?
[02:07:06.040 --> 02:07:09.800]   And so the idea, that idea is kind of like what's going on with my Medicare.
[02:07:09.800 --> 02:07:12.040]   So, here's an example.
[02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:12.840]   Here's an example.
[02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:14.440]   I want to make someone's grandma.
[02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:19.320]   The residents of the villas of Positano in Oceanfront condo in Hollywood, Florida.
[02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:23.800]   During the height of the Pokemon Go phenomenon would wake up in the early morning hours to
[02:07:23.800 --> 02:07:29.800]   hundreds of players behaving, quote, like zombies, walking around, bumping into things.
[02:07:29.800 --> 02:07:34.440]   We've had to redefine what trespass is in the digital age, literally.
[02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:40.680]   And Pokemon Go, the Niantic folks said that upon complaints of nuisance or trespass,
[02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:43.320]   this you might want to keep this in mind when the Harry Potter game comes out,
[02:07:43.320 --> 02:07:48.120]   upon complaints of nuisance or trespass and demands of the removal of a pokey stopper,
[02:07:48.120 --> 02:07:52.680]   Jim, the company will make commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the complaint
[02:07:52.680 --> 02:07:55.160]   and communicate a resolution within 15 days.
[02:07:55.160 --> 02:07:56.760]   I'm sure they'll take it down, right?
[02:07:56.760 --> 02:08:01.640]   Owners of single family residential properties get rights of removal within 40 meters of their
[02:08:01.640 --> 02:08:02.120]   properties.
[02:08:02.120 --> 02:08:02.760]   It seems fair.
[02:08:02.760 --> 02:08:02.920]   Yeah.
[02:08:02.920 --> 02:08:03.640]   Is this fair to me?
[02:08:03.640 --> 02:08:08.120]   Niantic will maintain a database of complaints in an attempt to avoid poor placement.
[02:08:08.120 --> 02:08:14.200]   When this is my favorite, when Niantic system detects a rate of more than 10 players congregating,
[02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:19.000]   a warning message will appear on their screens, reminding them to be courteous and respectful
[02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:19.880]   of surroundings.
[02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:21.640]   That's just like the one that pops.
[02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:26.360]   There's one that pops up when you're in a car of expensive senses a movement of 15 or more miles
[02:08:26.360 --> 02:08:26.760]   an hour.
[02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:28.520]   It'll say, are you a passenger?
[02:08:28.520 --> 02:08:29.480]   Are you a passenger?
[02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:30.760]   Are you a passenger in the driver?
[02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:31.160]   Just taps.
[02:08:31.160 --> 02:08:31.320]   Yeah.
[02:08:31.320 --> 02:08:31.720]   Okay.
[02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:35.160]   Every time you start Pokemon Go, it says, don't trespass.
[02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:35.560]   It says that.
[02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:39.640]   The restrictions on single family residential properties and the one thing that pop up,
[02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:41.320]   there was a really great story on curbed.
[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:45.080]   I want to say either late last week at the beginning of this week,
[02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:49.560]   curbed is a publication that focuses on real estate, does long-form essays.
[02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:53.080]   And there was one where a woman was talking about how a friend of hers,
[02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:58.040]   who lived in a beautiful house in Savannah, the friend was going through chemotherapy
[02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:00.520]   and was very, very sick.
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:03.240]   And there was an influencer opposing in front of her house.
[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:03.800]   Oh, Jesus.
[02:09:03.800 --> 02:09:05.320]   And the choreants jumping on.
[02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:08.200]   The influencer posts something on her social media all,
[02:09:08.200 --> 02:09:11.080]   I don't know why the owner was so grumpy when I was taking pictures.
[02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:14.120]   She should take advantage of her location and set up a mimosa stand.
[02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:14.680]   Oh, yeah.
[02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:22.120]   But what it points out is the idea that for people who have built up these, these
[02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:26.920]   AR type environments, and I would argue that Instagram at this point is basically AR.
[02:09:26.920 --> 02:09:32.200]   For people, they forget that people live in those houses and those are their private
[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:36.040]   residences and you are interrupting their lives and they are not props in your world
[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:37.080]   building exercise.
[02:09:37.080 --> 02:09:40.680]   I feel that influencers forget that in public places or not.
[02:09:40.680 --> 02:09:44.120]   I mean, I think we just line them all up against the wall and shoot them.
[02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:47.000]   Influencers are not good in any respect whatsoever.
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.160]   That was a great, it's the greatest story ever.
[02:09:49.160 --> 02:09:58.680]   I got a really nasty look in the gym locker room because I walked behind a woman who was
[02:09:58.680 --> 02:10:01.800]   posting, grabbing hair, who was Instagramming in front of the mirror,
[02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:03.400]   which is probably breaking.
[02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:05.960]   My gym bands will phone in the locker room.
[02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:07.480]   You're not allowed to bring them out, which is great.
[02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:07.480]   All gyms too.
[02:10:07.480 --> 02:10:09.000]   It doesn't stop anybody.
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.880]   I was just kind of like a mean woman.
[02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:20.440]   But I think that's going to be one of the things that people who,
[02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:24.600]   especially digital natives and those of us who have become digital natives by default,
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:29.480]   are going to have to remember is just because you have this bubble of information and experience
[02:10:29.480 --> 02:10:33.400]   as you move through your world with your tech, your bubble is going to bump into other
[02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:37.000]   people's bubbles, you're going to overlap and they have just as many rates as you do.
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:39.160]   And you're going to have to remember that.
[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:39.800]   That's a really good one.
[02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:43.240]   Next time you hear Tom Jones, it's not unusual.
[02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:54.200]   And you're tempted to put a cassette in and play that song, grab a candlestick and sing along.
[02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:58.280]   Get ready everybody.
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:10:59.800]   I want you to do the Carlton dance.
[02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:03.240]   It's a love you, you won't say nothing.
[02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:06.920]   Unfortunately, it's not unusual.
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:09.080]   Carlton got bad news this week.
[02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:12.840]   The Carlton dance is not copyrightable.
[02:11:12.840 --> 02:11:17.640]   He was suing Fortnite because you can buy a Carlton dance.
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:19.480]   So they call it the Carlton dance?
[02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:21.080]   They do not call it the Carlton dance.
[02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:26.280]   Well, Carlton himself admits he kind of borrowed it from Bruce Springsteen dancing in the dark
[02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:28.600]   video and other places.
[02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:30.840]   Carlton, of course, has played ball Fonzo Rivera.
[02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:37.080]   I think this is over now because the Copyright Office said you can't,
[02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:39.560]   sorry kid, it's not a choreographed routine.
[02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:41.160]   You can't copyright it.
[02:11:41.160 --> 02:11:50.280]   I don't think his case may be over, but I do believe that the idea of these microtransactions
[02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:54.440]   in games attached to real life, anything is going to continue.
[02:11:54.440 --> 02:12:01.800]   I think people will continue to push whatever public image they have and cultural cache
[02:12:01.800 --> 02:12:08.120]   in order to say, hey, you are profiting off of my likeness or something that is singularly like me
[02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:12.600]   and you are making money and I'm not getting a cut and I was not reached out to for a license.
[02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:15.240]   I think that's not necessary.
[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:17.640]   It may be more clear cut in certain cases than others.
[02:12:17.640 --> 02:12:25.080]   There was just recently a suit filed by a WWE superstar whose likeness seems to be in the latest
[02:12:25.080 --> 02:12:30.200]   Call of Duty game in terms of his just facial structure and hair in general presence
[02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:35.960]   and that he's not in any way being compensated and whether or not he deserves to be paid
[02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:41.480]   when he may just innocently coincidentally resemble because so many works of fiction have that
[02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:44.200]   all similar layer to use are coincidental and blah, blah, blah.
[02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:48.200]   The NBA has been dealing with this for a while too and I think we've got the same kinds of
[02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:51.000]   conversations going on with likenesses of sports figures.
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:52.120]   It's tattoos.
[02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:55.640]   So for instance, the tattoo artist owns the tattoo.
[02:12:55.640 --> 02:13:00.840]   These NBA all-stars are allowed to play games in the NBA with these tattoos.
[02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:05.240]   But when those same all-stars are rendered as a likeness in NBA 2K,
[02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:11.560]   the tattoo artist are saying, wait a minute, that's my copyrighted work in your game.
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:13.000]   That's interesting.
[02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:16.280]   They could eliminate that just by making them not different.
[02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:17.960]   It all has to do with it.
[02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:19.800]   But then I just give it a 6.5 out of 10.
[02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:20.360]   Exactly.
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:22.360]   Sam would say those tattoos are not accurate.
[02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:22.840]   It can't be.
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:24.280]   You could all without the wing.
[02:13:24.280 --> 02:13:29.400]   But I think this is in the digital entertainment world, microtransactions are going to be
[02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:35.480]   only bigger and bigger and bigger, especially as emerging economies are completely linked
[02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:40.680]   into payments through phone currencies, where you are going to a convenience store,
[02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:43.560]   for example, in Japan, which is mostly a cash society.
[02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:47.720]   That's you're going and paying cash to get the card and loading that and buying points
[02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:48.840]   and getting all these little things.
[02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:54.120]   So when you say that this might be the last of it, I 100% disagree that our digital future
[02:13:54.120 --> 02:13:58.280]   includes all of these cute little purchases of cosmetic bits.
[02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:02.040]   And what's more interesting in a cosmetic way than things you recognize?
[02:14:02.040 --> 02:14:05.080]   That's why games like Super Mario Maker, where you make your own levels,
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:09.960]   the most popular things in that game that people create are based on other real life properties.
[02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:14.920]   Like that's just how this weird future of how we pay for things online is going to play out.
[02:14:14.920 --> 02:14:16.440]   And games will be on the forefront of that.
[02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:19.320]   So I think this is going to continue being a big illegal conversation.
[02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:21.160]   Tiny incremental and frictionless.
[02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:22.440]   Tiny incremental frictionless.
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:24.040]   That's the way that's the life.
[02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:26.360]   Oh, I quit.
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:31.800]   That just shut down this conversation entirely.
[02:14:31.800 --> 02:14:33.000]   Oh my god, sorry.
[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:33.800]   Yeah, about the fall suit.
[02:14:33.800 --> 02:14:36.440]   I don't even know what I was going to say.
[02:14:36.440 --> 02:14:38.360]   It's just that we do have a show title.
[02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:41.000]   I am grateful to you for calling that.
[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.320]   So what about, so there are two big games this week.
[02:14:43.320 --> 02:14:46.520]   It's so funny because people hate electronic arts, right, Sam?
[02:14:46.520 --> 02:14:47.480]   They hate it.
[02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:48.120]   They hate it.
[02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:49.240]   It's the devil, the Satan.
[02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:49.800]   It's this.
[02:14:49.800 --> 02:14:50.760]   It's so.
[02:14:50.760 --> 02:14:54.200]   They've had a bad reputation for gobbling up companies and then having those
[02:14:54.200 --> 02:14:56.200]   those companies do different things than they did for the.
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:14:58.120]   People are so pissed off that EA has a hit.
[02:14:58.120 --> 02:15:02.040]   But of course, I disagree about them being EA has a hit.
[02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:03.080]   That is definitely true.
[02:15:03.080 --> 02:15:07.560]   This is Apex Legends just came out as I mentioned earlier already 25 million players.
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:09.720]   It's like five days ago.
[02:15:09.720 --> 02:15:10.760]   They said 25 million.
[02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:12.040]   So I imagine that has only grown.
[02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:12.760]   That's on battle.
[02:15:12.760 --> 02:15:13.560]   It is a game.
[02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:16.120]   A hundred men come in, a hundred people come in.
[02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:19.400]   60 people come in and say, oh, see, it's not like Fortnite.
[02:15:20.200 --> 02:15:20.840]   Yeah.
[02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:21.560]   What stress?
[02:15:21.560 --> 02:15:25.400]   Here's what I think Apex Legends did for all of the people,
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:31.400]   mostly between the ages of like 13 and 18 who don't play Fortnite anymore because it's not cool.
[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:32.520]   And it's for little kids.
[02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:34.280]   They get Fortnite.
[02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:36.760]   They did play it and Apex Legends is cooler.
[02:15:36.760 --> 02:15:38.200]   So they're all in.
[02:15:38.200 --> 02:15:42.360]   It's funny though, it shows you because it looked like we were doing stories two weeks ago that
[02:15:42.360 --> 02:15:44.200]   Fortnite was a future of social media.
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:44.520]   Yeah.
[02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:45.160]   The worst.
[02:15:45.160 --> 02:15:49.080]   I was just thinking that as I was reading all these stories about how Fortnite is the new shopping mall for
[02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:49.480]   teenagers.
[02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:53.880]   Oh, no, but no, no, no, no, because teenagers like they're fickle six months ago.
[02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:55.960]   Actual teenagers were like, that's for 12 girls.
[02:15:55.960 --> 02:15:56.200]   Yeah.
[02:15:56.200 --> 02:15:56.760]   So that's right.
[02:15:56.760 --> 02:15:57.800]   16 girls is that.
[02:15:57.800 --> 02:15:58.280]   Yeah.
[02:15:58.280 --> 02:16:00.360]   Number one, Fortnite is still doing great.
[02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:04.760]   They still have a ton of players and that will eventually end and everyone knows how fads work.
[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:09.160]   I think Epic Games, the people who make Fortnite are absolutely gearing up for that.
[02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:11.160]   And that's why the game changes so much.
[02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:13.240]   That's why it has these seasons.
[02:16:13.240 --> 02:16:18.120]   But Apex Legends, what it did, EA had a pretty smart move.
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:23.880]   They took a bunch of people who go on Twitch and YouTube and stream themselves playing games
[02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:28.440]   and said, we're going to pay you cash to just play this game all at the same time.
[02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:31.880]   And then those people, once that money stopped, kept playing the game and said,
[02:16:31.880 --> 02:16:33.080]   I'm having a pretty good time.
[02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:39.000]   You guys developed a solid game and everyone could kind of see that instead of a year,
[02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:43.400]   two years of hype and expectation and questions because if EA came out,
[02:16:43.400 --> 02:16:47.480]   in fact, some of the people who worked on this game said, if we put out a press release a year ago
[02:16:47.480 --> 02:16:53.160]   and said EA is going to make a game with loot boxes and microtransactions and its battle royale,
[02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:57.800]   it warms and everything that would have been this giant wall of resistance.
[02:16:57.800 --> 02:17:03.000]   So instead, you get this game that just shows up and people playing and saying,
[02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:04.760]   kind of like it, going to keep playing it.
[02:17:04.760 --> 02:17:08.840]   It's free. It's on Xbox. It's on PlayStation. It's on computer.
[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:14.280]   The friction is so low for people to just jump in and it has a really genius thing in the internet
[02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:19.080]   age. It's pinging. The idea is that anywhere you look in the game, you tap a button and it
[02:17:19.080 --> 02:17:24.760]   announces to your friends in the game, here's a thing, a weapon, an item, a path to go to so you
[02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:30.760]   can play without using a microphone. You can mute idiots on the internet and play and have a good time.
[02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:34.040]   Oh my gosh, that is like a value. They should charge extra for that feature.
[02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:39.480]   Every single game I swear to you, every game from here on out that's internet dependent
[02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:44.120]   is going to do this little thing of called pinging, which is a term that we've used in
[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:47.560]   way different ways than in gaming. But it's genius. It was really smoothly done.
[02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:52.040]   EA is kind of incredible in how they pulled this off and they're about to launch a game that's
[02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:57.720]   kind of the utter opposite. That's kind of a mess and a disaster and overhyped and underdelivering.
[02:17:57.720 --> 02:18:04.600]   So what's that? It's called Anthem. And that's made by a company that did games called Mass Effect
[02:18:04.600 --> 02:18:09.240]   and Dragon Age. This is Anthem. People have been very excited about this. You think it's terrible,
[02:18:09.240 --> 02:18:13.400]   huh? I'm working on my review as we speak. I'm basically when I'm not talking to people.
[02:18:13.400 --> 02:18:19.080]   We know where it's going. It's a problem. There's some problems with this. It's a game that has
[02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:24.600]   beautiful ideas. You get to fly around like Iron Man and it feels like you're Iron Man. You get
[02:18:24.600 --> 02:18:30.760]   in a jet pack and you fly over a giant world and that's cool. But the game has nothing but roadblocks.
[02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:35.640]   Apex Legends, you can just jump in for free and it instantly feels cool. This game is the
[02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:40.600]   opposite where you have to pay money and you're waiting and waiting and it's slow and clunky and
[02:18:40.600 --> 02:18:44.760]   it feels old. And it's just interesting that EA said, we're going to put both of these out at
[02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:49.880]   the same time. What's that going to look like? If I worked on Anthem, I would be furious because
[02:18:49.880 --> 02:18:54.840]   I've got this other thing I have to juggle from my corporate parent just bringing me down.
[02:18:54.840 --> 02:18:58.120]   You buried the lead though. Now Tetris has a Battle Royale mode.
[02:18:58.120 --> 02:19:04.600]   Oh, oh, Tetris has a Battle Royale. Did you ever want to play Tetris with 98 other people?
[02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:11.640]   Probably not. But that now exists and it's actually incredibly fun. I wrote up a piece that sort of
[02:19:11.640 --> 02:19:17.240]   analyzed what it does. And I think this is going to trickle down in other games in the future. But
[02:19:17.240 --> 02:19:23.480]   the briefest way to put it is it adds a sort of machine learning difficulty, meaning these other
[02:19:23.480 --> 02:19:27.880]   98 people you're playing against, you don't see them. You're focusing on your own set of Tetris
[02:19:27.880 --> 02:19:32.040]   blocks, which are already doing the random things that make it hard. You know, you get that Z piece
[02:19:32.040 --> 02:19:37.880]   when you want to line that sort of thing. Well, now it's got this sort of automatic challenge
[02:19:37.880 --> 02:19:42.840]   of other people throwing what are known as garbage blocks at you. So you get the sort of extra
[02:19:42.840 --> 02:19:47.880]   little organic spike of challenge if you don't just want to play some chill Tetris by yourself.
[02:19:47.880 --> 02:19:52.600]   And I think for a game as old as Tetris, that's a risk they can take. I don't know that
[02:19:52.600 --> 02:19:58.280]   every other genre should have this, but it's this really brilliant thing. And it's free if you pay
[02:19:58.280 --> 02:20:03.320]   for switches online service, which is $20 a year. And that also comes with a bunch of classic
[02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:08.440]   NES games for free. So Nintendo has come out to fans of games and said, you're getting classic
[02:20:08.440 --> 02:20:14.040]   NES games and you're getting a new trippy Tetris for $20 for a year. And I really do believe that
[02:20:14.040 --> 02:20:19.000]   drove people to say, Oh, hey, Nintendo, you're normally behind on the times with online stuff.
[02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:23.320]   Oh, this is actually kind of sweet and novel and clever. And I'm going to pay that very small
[02:20:23.320 --> 02:20:27.880]   amount of money for classic gaming. So really smooth move on Nintendo's part in all. I've
[02:20:27.880 --> 02:20:32.040]   been playing this Tetris game. It's working. It's not crashing. I'm having a good time.
[02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:35.160]   I'm really good at it. So that helps. Yeah, I was just going to warn people.
[02:20:35.160 --> 02:20:39.400]   Sounds like the way they do weighted grades in law school where there's the curve and like one
[02:20:39.400 --> 02:20:44.200]   of our two people per class gets an A and then it goes down from there and Sam Renske and the A
[02:20:44.200 --> 02:20:50.520]   apparently. Why do you have for Sam read on Tetris 99? I thought I was really good at Tetris.
[02:20:50.520 --> 02:20:55.960]   Like I used to play like crazy a long time ago. And then I played with my daughter on a plane,
[02:20:56.680 --> 02:21:00.440]   like on the seatbacks and we were playing against each other. And it got to the point where I was
[02:21:00.440 --> 02:21:05.880]   like, this isn't fun anymore. I don't like it. And she's like, you want to let you in mom?
[02:21:05.880 --> 02:21:10.840]   I just want to put something out there for the listeners who want to know about a world of an
[02:21:10.840 --> 02:21:16.280]   intense competitive Tetris. There was a 16 year old kid who is currently breaking world records
[02:21:16.280 --> 02:21:23.320]   left and right. His name is Joseph Saly, S-A-E-L-E-E. I encourage you to look him up on YouTube.
[02:21:23.320 --> 02:21:29.080]   He does things with NES Tetris that I never knew were possible. He's got a method called
[02:21:29.080 --> 02:21:32.440]   hyper tapping. Go down that rabbit hole if you want. I swear it is a problem.
[02:21:32.440 --> 02:21:35.960]   I'm pretty sure that my daughter did that because I was like, how do you even know how to do this?
[02:21:35.960 --> 02:21:39.800]   She's been watching YouTube videos. Yes, she goes, oh, I just watched it on YouTube.
[02:21:39.800 --> 02:21:46.840]   Yeah, I'm using a Saly technique. This kid has reached level 33 in NES Tetris with nobody thought
[02:21:46.840 --> 02:21:51.080]   was possible. That just happened like three nights ago. And he's just hanging out in his
[02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:54.520]   little house in his family. This is a new kind of twitch. I got to tell you.
[02:21:54.520 --> 02:21:59.560]   Is this on Twitch? Yeah, he's got the whole screen that he's got set up like adapts the board
[02:21:59.560 --> 02:22:05.800]   so it looks right. I'm obsessed with this kid. He's my... He's not even looking at the screen.
[02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:09.720]   He'll look over at the chat over to the side just to make sure he talks to the Twitch people.
[02:22:09.720 --> 02:22:12.440]   I don't even have to think about it anymore. It just happens. Yeah, look at this.
[02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:18.040]   This is what your daughter's doing. Yeah, she's watching him play and then she's just killing me
[02:22:18.040 --> 02:22:23.400]   on the airplane Tetris. I'm so glad I could talk about Joseph Saly. He's the best. He's a really sweet
[02:22:23.400 --> 02:22:30.840]   kid too. Well, on that note, we will. We just introduced. We're all watching this kid. Just I
[02:22:30.840 --> 02:22:36.920]   can't believe it. I want to see Tetris meets Minecraft. Oh my god. Oh, well, this is this is
[02:22:36.920 --> 02:22:42.280]   you see, this is the thing I have to say Lindsey is that this your kids and this guy, it's not even
[02:22:42.280 --> 02:22:46.520]   the same speech. Watch it. Oh, he didn't do it. He has a tuck method. Sorry. Sorry anyone.
[02:22:46.520 --> 02:22:51.800]   Oh, he needs that tuck method, man. Oh, he's just gone compare. I'm so glad I get to talk like
[02:22:51.800 --> 02:22:56.280]   it slides a piece over into a little hole that's just kind of. Oh, yeah, he can do all these weird.
[02:22:56.280 --> 02:23:01.320]   Yeah, he can do man. He's got some weird teaspoon things and all this. There's not even thinking
[02:23:01.320 --> 02:23:05.160]   about what he's doing. It's just biological at this point. It's just a whole bunch of brain
[02:23:05.160 --> 02:23:09.640]   circuits completely dedicated. He's got to look at this. Not even looking. The spatial.
[02:23:09.640 --> 02:23:14.360]   Looking the spatial intelligence is just off the charts. That's what it is, right? Yeah.
[02:23:14.360 --> 02:23:19.080]   No, I have almost no spatial intelligence whatsoever. So this is this is like pops and whistles and
[02:23:19.080 --> 02:23:26.680]   dolphin noises as far as I'm concerned. Yeah, your video editors should have fast-ordered to the
[02:23:26.680 --> 02:23:30.680]   part where he gets up to the very max, but that could take forever. Oh, I can jump jump ahead.
[02:23:30.680 --> 02:23:34.520]   Is that at the end of the video? I'd say like it. Oh, a little bit back. Go back.
[02:23:34.520 --> 02:23:38.680]   Back. Back. Oh, he just finished. He's clutching his heart on the edge. Okay, here we go. Yes.
[02:23:38.680 --> 02:23:43.000]   This is doing hyper tap. He's hyper tapping. Ladies. I can't believe it. Is it daily doing the
[02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:46.680]   hyper tap? Yes, he is. He's moving in. Watch his tuck man. That's incredible. Oh my God.
[02:23:46.680 --> 02:23:51.880]   It's moving faster than I can even keep track. Oh, that he could do any of that. I mean, the
[02:23:51.880 --> 02:23:57.000]   level is so high. It's in hexadecimal. Oh my God. Thank you for hearing me.
[02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:03.160]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of this very strange journey that we've been on.
[02:24:03.160 --> 02:24:08.520]   But you know what? I wouldn't want to be with any other three people in this fellowship with
[02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:13.400]   the weird. Thank you so much, Sam Maskovich for joining us. Sam writes at Ars Technica. He's
[02:24:13.400 --> 02:24:18.600]   their tech culture editor. He has to run off and write his anthem review. Get to fly off in a jetpack.
[02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:23.960]   Fly off in a jetpack. Sam read on the Twitter and stay away from Sam read on the Tetris because
[02:24:23.960 --> 02:24:31.080]   he's killer killer. Thank you, Sam. Always a pleasure to have you on. Happy to be on with you.
[02:24:31.080 --> 02:24:37.560]   Lindsay Turretine, despite her title of VP of technology content at CBS Interactive
[02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:43.320]   has dained to come into this room and join us and get into the trenches.
[02:24:43.320 --> 02:24:47.640]   Oh, it's so fun to be here. You're a big shot now. I can't even talk to you anymore.
[02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:50.840]   Yeah. Lindsay, it's always a pleasure. Thank you so much for being here.
[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:56.520]   Thanks for having me. What a smart panel. I can't. I am just so thrilled to have all you folks.
[02:24:56.520 --> 02:25:00.760]   Schmeiser. Always a pleasure. Lisa Smyser. Now you're still editor at ITPro today,
[02:25:00.760 --> 02:25:05.640]   but you're focusing on enterprise mostly. Yes. Yes, I am. No more of that Windows secrets crap.
[02:25:05.640 --> 02:25:09.320]   Well, I wouldn't call it crap. We had a lot of really talented writers who did a great job of
[02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:15.000]   ushering into the mobile first. There's no more secrets. I feel like it's no more secrets.
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:20.040]   I'm not going to run down my successor though. Secrets are over. Everything's public now.
[02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:26.840]   That's the problem. So great to have you, Lisa. Itpro today.com. Thank you all for being here.
[02:25:26.840 --> 02:25:31.800]   We had a great studio audience. Thank you for joining us. I know it was a bit of a marathon.
[02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:37.160]   I hope you brought sandwiches. And I did offer you whiskey, I think, right? Okay, good.
[02:25:37.160 --> 02:25:42.120]   They have their Starbucks instead. It's really great to have them from
[02:25:42.120 --> 02:25:46.680]   Michelle and David from Manteca, California, Travis and Beth from Los Angeles.
[02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:50.360]   It's kind of a romantic thing to do on a Sunday afternoon. Come watch Twitch.
[02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:55.080]   Oh boy. It's not reading today. The drive is lovely. Yeah. Thank you for being here. If you want to
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:25:59.320]   join us, all you have to do is email tickets at twit.tv. We'll put a chair out for you. You can also
[02:25:59.320 --> 02:26:05.720]   watch a live stream of everything we do at twit.tv/live. Choose from audio or video.
[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:11.080]   If you can't watch it live, you can always get on-demand audio and video from our website,
[02:26:11.080 --> 02:26:16.680]   twit.tv. Of course, the best thing to do, let Daniel Ek know we exist. Subscribe to the show
[02:26:16.680 --> 02:26:23.400]   and Spotify, please. That won't help. And again, nothing he wants. Or your favorite podcast application.
[02:26:23.400 --> 02:26:29.160]   I don't mind podcast overcast iTunes, Google. There's a lot of great ones. We have the information
[02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:35.000]   at twit.tv/subscribe. Subscribe to our newsletter while you're there too. You'll know ahead of time
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:38.840]   all the great things that are coming to Twitch in the week ahead. Thanks to our producer,
[02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:43.080]   custom Bonnie, our executive producer. Who would like to remind you to plug the survey?
[02:26:43.080 --> 02:26:49.160]   Lisa Kensell, Lisa LaPorte, I married her. That's one way to save money. Google didn't think of that.
[02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:54.360]   Yeah. You just marry your employees and you don't have to pay them anymore. That doesn't work.
[02:26:54.360 --> 02:27:01.400]   It's hard to scale. It does not scale well. I saw a big love. I don't have the sense.
[02:27:01.400 --> 02:27:07.960]   Yeah. You run out after a while of houses. We do have a survey. We do this once a year. We
[02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:12.040]   ask you to take it only because it's the best way. We don't track you. We don't
[02:27:12.040 --> 02:27:16.280]   know anything about you. We don't want to. But we do like to have some information about our
[02:27:16.280 --> 02:27:19.960]   audience. Advertisers like to know as their male, female, what age is, things like that.
[02:27:19.960 --> 02:27:23.720]   So it's very simple demographic questions. We also like to know a little more about what
[02:27:23.720 --> 02:27:27.960]   you're interested in so we can tailor our programming to fit your interests. The survey is quick.
[02:27:27.960 --> 02:27:36.120]   Take you a couple of minutes. Twit.to/surveynosalesmen will call. I'm sorry. Twit.to/survey19.
[02:27:36.120 --> 02:27:41.480]   It's the 2019 version. I know you did this. Did you do the census already? This is much easier
[02:27:41.480 --> 02:27:48.200]   than the census. Twit.to/survey19. We're not collecting any information about you. It's all
[02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:52.840]   an aggregate, but it does help us very much to plan our years. So thank you in advance.
[02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:55.240]   And thank you for being here. We'll see you next week. Another Twit.
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:28:05.320]   Twit.to/surveynosalesmen.
