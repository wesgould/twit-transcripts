[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.260]   This guy is a trained professional who has a box of OS - look what you got me
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.200]   Look at me an OS - because you used to be a fanatic OS - I was a big OS - promoter
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.000]   I wrote a lot good on it. You love warp. Yeah, but the problem was it's
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.880]   One day I just I went cold turkey against this product. Yeah, well, we're gonna you're gonna find out how you feel about windows 8
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.820]   Which is I think the reincarnation of OS - warp well, that's
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:39.240]   We'll talk about it in a second also here. Why am I why am I leaving out Jolio Dell? It's so great to have you back
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:45.040]   Welcome Jolie nice to see you you're writing in fact you're gonna you're off to South by a little a couple of weeks

[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.720]   But no, I gave my notice at venture beat for five years from Monday or so you're stuck there now
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.700]   For the next five years until I retire well, you go always have a job at any time. We love Jolio Dell. It's great to have you
[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.280]   Also here another guy. I'm crazy about mr. Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.880]   Blogged out on Leo. How are you great to see you? I'm well
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.800]   Have to be here virtually happy March
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.360]   What is the weather like in Houston right now? Oh, it's gorgeous. It's San Francisco gorgeous today
[00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.860]   It's it was about 75 degrees as your class
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:35.040]   Cloudless skies. It's beautiful. This is the time to be in Houston not summer not winter right this day pretty much
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.760]   It's actually the winter has been very mild for the very good for the stinging army ants arrive
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.320]   The mosquitoes and the skaters
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:52.760]   Mosquitoes are terrible here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so without a hurricane. This was a massive week for tech news actually
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.760]   This was an amazing week for tech news
[00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.800]   Mobile World Congress going on Barcelona some really interesting announcements there
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:07.320]   Apple dropped the yeshoo on its announcement. They sent out invitations anybody going to that no no no me
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:12.520]   Well you we have I'm not invited you have people but I you're not in you wait a minute
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:20.040]   I'm never invited to get this straight. You probably have the biggest audience for anyone doing this sort of new media period in the
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:26.000]   Business you know about the stuff you've always been friendly with Apple and they have put you on a black list
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.720]   Blacklist didn't you try to live stream something from somebody that he was never told not to he was never told not to
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.320]   No one went up to him said sir sir. We would prefer you not live stream. There's no way to talk about this without sounding
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.840]   Golly this wonders they couldn't come up. I'm letting John do this for me
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.140]   Kid they could they had they have the guts to come up and tap you and just say mr
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.360]   Laport I believe anything and say can you please stop live stream effect the only thing that happened?
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.680]   It was a strike company from what I struck
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.400]   So it was the I original iPad announcement and they weren't streaming and it kind of makes me mad that Apple refuses to stream this
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.840]   They put the video out shortly thereafter. I think they're worried that something might untoward might happen and they can't control it or edit it out
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.320]   In this case although, you know, they've not you know
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.960]   Never happened well remember the big fail when Steve had to kind of yell at people turn off your phones turn off your phone
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.920]   They didn't edit that out of the stream. So there you get so that's
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.800]   Anyways, I'm not sure why they don't stream it
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.680]   I wish they would because they let bloggers in live blog it
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:29.600]   So what we're kind of reduced to doing in fact it really isn't good to be in there because you can't get anything out except to type
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.600]   So what we do is we sit here and Tom Merritt, Sarah Lane, and I
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.560]   Will sit here 930 on Wednesday am Pacific and we'll just watch the live blogs
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.840]   It's almost like one of those baseball games where you go
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:49.400]   And he's running down right we're reenacting 30s. We have to reenact it silly reenact the keynote
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.160]   But in any event it's usually somebody bootleg in it
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:59.280]   That's right, and I was the guy and no, but there's been guys since I'm never going they've never invited me since
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.120]   Yeah, they got the food at past publications. I've worked at we would send a guy and they would sit there with a phone
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.440]   And we'd all be on you listen. Yeah, and we'd that's how we would get out a great number of stories
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.840]   It's great. It's great marketing because it gets people excited about it
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.280]   It increases demand even for the news coming out of it. That's what it's all about, right?
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:28.680]   Yeah, why they do it. Why does a hot dog cost $20 at Disneyland because they can and it's good people people you care so much
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.480]   Right, it makes us care much. I don't believe that that expensive
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.440]   $20 at Disneyland. I don't know
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.280]   Give me
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.440]   How much does a hot dog I was at Disneyland?
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.760]   So Leah why can't you just go and camp out in front of the year of aboying a like you did
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:52.840]   You're not and do and do something from there and not necessarily go in. I don't think anybody could stop no
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.820]   No, no, we could do that. I don't see any advantage to doing that. So what we like man on the street types
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.980]   So we were in there. What's it? So what we do we you know Jason Snell from Mac world for instance will be there
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.780]   I was hope I don't know why Andy and notco didn't get an invitation
[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:10.860]   He's at the Chicago said one thing or looked at him cross-eyed and this is really the story about that is that Apple really controls access
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.040]   And I think only invites people who are gonna give them positive and applause
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.960]   Plawed on you know you don't want me sitting there or anybody sitting there going
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.980]   You know when you go to the Letterman show same thing happens
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.180]   Well, they got to go out in front they have a bunch of guys with clipboards
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.640]   You're waiting in line to get your ticket. He spotted me. He said it was amazing. He knew who I was
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.620]   Unletterman no not to go on Letterman to get in the audience
[00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:34.980]   Oh, yeah
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:40.260]   I mean and it's the day before and he said a before well, no, maybe it was a few hours before it was early
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.440]   He said oh Leo we're gonna give you special seats
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.500]   Way in the back because it's the it's the balcony because they want the rooms
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.180]   Who are gonna be really excited to be there sitting there?
[00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.580]   Media people they put you away in the balcony because they don't want you to say they don't know what I was gonna
[00:07:54.580 --> 00:08:02.100]   Hey look who's here? They there's also distracting and in fact Apple also as you well-known puts in the front row puts Apple employees
[00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.300]   So there's always this
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.540]   Yeah, we're there's
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.380]   Skills they got it down. They know what they're doing
[00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:15.180]   iPad will it be three will it be HD do we we don't even know what it'll be called?
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.900]   There's the presumption iPad three
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:23.540]   But I think it could be called the iPad HD because we will have an a retina display. I'm sure I think with the iPhone 4s
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:29.100]   Have a look at that's great. Look how that looks. I think it's a not prism
[00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.700]   It's not a presumption. It's an assumption to say that anybody really knows no one knows
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:38.940]   I mean you've got digitimes sources and the supply chain saying it's gonna be a seven to eight inch iPad and
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:44.220]   Everyone's talking about the display or the photos or whatever. Can we just say we don't know?
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.660]   But here's a fun game. Let's play
[00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:52.260]   But we don't make money if we say we don't know right money if we say let's play the fun game because we will know in three days
[00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:58.700]   Predict what do you think Apple will announce what let's see? Let's get the scorecards out everybody. Let's write this down
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.980]   I think that they're decided to say the same thing
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:04.900]   They're gonna shutter the company and distribute it to a hundred billion dollars to the shareholders
[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:12.140]   That would be huge the Dell solution just cash in in other words
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.540]   Well, sometimes if you're in a casino, that's a good enough. They're not gonna do that
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:21.740]   I would suspect is gonna be probably not as grandiose as everyone expects. That's the Jolio Del theory
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.860]   It'll be a for us. That's because what they always do
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.500]   They always over promise or they don't over promise
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:32.140]   They let the public over promise and then they under deliver as if they're doing more than you would have expected
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:36.060]   Right and so it'll be an eye, you know, I don't think it's gonna and I think it's gonna be called a iPad 3
[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:41.140]   So they didn't go out of the numbering scheme for the iPhone and they're at up to four. There's no reason
[00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:45.660]   There was the iPhone the iPhone 3G not three
[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.740]   iPhone 3GS then the iPhone
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:55.020]   Fact of four but the number is always in this so it had to be the iPad 3 HD
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.020]   But it's not gonna be the iPad HD
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:57.700]   I
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:02.940]   All right, go ahead. That's good. You're getting to do your predictions. Go ahead. That's it and then they're going to play
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:10.500]   It's gonna be sub retina sub retina, but it's gonna be higher just resolution than this one and it will have
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.940]   Better camera. You have a better camera for sure. Yeah, and it will have a
[00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.740]   Port that will surprise us all
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.020]   A lot more
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:25.660]   Surprise me. I'd sue the sons of it's gonna have a port that nobody expected
[00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:31.980]   Really do you have any idea what this port will be that display thing? Whatever. Oh many display port
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.620]   That would be interesting if they did that maybe we do have video
[00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.180]   This this just out of China
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:41.740]   Let me see if I can put this video up here. This is this is a purportedly
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:45.940]   Direct out of China video of the new
[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.620]   iPad
[00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:54.900]   3 let's take a look look at that. It's edge to edge no bezel. Oh, this is where is this this is a this is something that they phoned
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:11:00.140]   Eat up. No, no, no, this is absolutely real. I like this, but it's the you there's the one that hooks entirely fake
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:04.020]   Yeah, but watch this watch this look at this here it comes the magnet
[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:10.380]   Zip and it makes it one big screen now watch this is even it gets even better not buying turn it sideways turn it sideways
[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.620]   Watch this first of all the magnets hold it. Okay?
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.860]   Beautiful goes sideways. What happens? Let's let's see
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:23.660]   Okay, now we're playing football. This is both fiction and pornography now watch this. Oh my god the controls
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.660]   They're projected at the sides of the screen
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:29.980]   And and people believe this
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.180]   That's what gets nobody believes this is obviously fake, but it's quite good though
[00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:39.460]   This is there this would be yeah, if you they do I'm buying two look at that. It's holographic
[00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.460]   They're actually above the screen
[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:45.140]   Look, there's a goal post and then there's a bowling alley in there
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.660]   I can't put it in your purse with your tiny dog. That's a pretty amazing video there
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:56.540]   They're 3D animators. Obviously that's fake. So what do you think Jolie Odell? What is your prediction?
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.540]   Let's get you on the Oscar ballot
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:06.500]   No, you know, I don't have one. I'm not an apple reporter. I don't use apple products. No, I can't make a prediction
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:13.300]   I don't have my magic eight ball with me. She doesn't care is what she's trying to say. I can't make a prediction
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.660]   I don't know well
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:20.040]   I would like to I mean I I do often make predictions, you know, and I'm it's fun to make
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:25.260]   It's fun to make a prediction as a woman being always right. So if I know I'm probably not gonna be right
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.340]   I would take to make a
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:32.900]   Smart woman. Yes. Why predict if you can't know Dwight Silverman. Go ahead. Let's see how smarter woman Dwight
[00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.900]   Why is not getting a worded edge?
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.580]   You know, I was I when I was in college
[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:43.580]   I was writing I was a music critic for the daily tax and I wrote a column predicting that disco was dead
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:47.780]   And then a few months later Saturday night fever came out. So I'm really good at
[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.380]   Yes, so I
[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.240]   like the the retina display or at least the double display the
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.860]   2048 display and I like
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:06.940]   the faster processor rumor and I like the I was liking the LTE rumor, but I'm kind of feeling less
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:11.340]   Good about that. I don't think there's gonna be LTE in it. I think
[00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:18.740]   We have a store here in Houston a new apple store that's gonna open on the 16th
[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:26.340]   And they moved it up from the 17th and my suspicion is they did that so they could start selling iPad 3s on that day
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.180]   so I think it's gonna go on sale and 60 ought to be it and
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.940]   well, and
[00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.020]   Some sources who are pretty good
[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:41.460]   I think on this one and I would have to say that it is probably I like John's port idea there was a rumor out there about a smaller
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.700]   Mini Doc that the 30-pin dock is kind of so
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:50.820]   Old and clunky technology. I think apples about due to update it
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:56.220]   So I could see that that coming as well. All right. I'm gonna tell you the answer you guys obviously answer
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:01.620]   I do have one and that is if you just follow the money
[00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:04.740]   You will see that Apple is kind of seeing a lot of heat
[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:09.100]   No, I'm pun intended from Kindle fire and all those other sub iPad
[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:15.540]   tablet hybrids I think that they are going to do something to make some sort of iPad cheaper
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:19.620]   I don't know if it's gonna be a smaller one you were just seven inch or no
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:25.500]   Nope, no dumb version of the iPad - I don't even think they have to do that
[00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.500]   I'm going to make something in the
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.660]   Two to three hundred dollar range with that that's too low. I
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:35.660]   Three to four three anything three to four. Yeah, cuz they're Apple. They can charge more
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:39.580]   No, they're not going after the Kindle, but they want to provide something slower cost
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:45.140]   I think they'll take the existing iPad to reduce it to 350 to $400. That's a significant reduction
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:50.160]   I still don't think it would cut into 99 they're not trying to beat the Kindle tonight. It's good price
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:56.400]   That's what Knox guy thinks and I think I think he's right. All right. I'm gonna tell you all like this
[00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:00.660]   - 99 I have I have put on my Steve Jobs thinking cap
[00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:04.900]   There will be a written display it'll be 2048 by 1536
[00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.840]   That's 2x each way and the reason they do that is so it scales well
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:10.880]   That's what they did with the iPhone 4 it's what they'll do with the iPad
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:17.740]   I predicted it'll be called the HD not the three because they want to really emphasize this HD now remember Apple for a long time said
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.560]   It's on a screen that size
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.680]   1024 768 fine 720p fine. That's age
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:28.940]   They're gonna completely reverse that story and say oh no you've got to have 1080p and we've got it
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:33.620]   They're gonna push this HD they will announce a new Apple TV HD as well and
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:39.400]   The availability of 1080p content in the iTunes store across the board that's gonna be a big push for Apple
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:45.200]   So I think they'll call it the iPad HD. I do believe it'll have an 8 megapixel iPhone 4s style camera in it
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.080]   I'm interested to see if they put Siri in it
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.860]   I think they might depends on whether their Siri servers can hold up. They haven't been doing very well lately
[00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:55.520]   They will not do LTE you're absolutely right
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:01.240]   Dwight for several reasons the international market being one is really not well penetrated in the US
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:08.520]   And it really cuts back on battery life and requires a different chip than the cheap and Qualcomm chip that they're using
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:15.840]   So I don't think we'll see LTE this time around except except the one the one the one but on that I know what you're gonna say Verizon
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:20.000]   But Verizon also the fact that if they're gonna have 1080p
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.240]   Content they may want to do LTE in order to deliver that because
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:31.680]   LTE will can give you faster speeds than a lot of home broadband connections that wire the Wi-Fi is connected to a point
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.200]   So they that's one possibility for LTE
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:38.480]   There's also the fact that Verizon said we're not gonna sell any more stuff that doesn't have LTE
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:43.000]   But that might have been a little saber rattling. I don't think they turn away the so how did you combine all these?
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.040]   I'm not done. No extra ports exactly the same some can some speculation. There wouldn't be a home button. That's BS
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:51.040]   There will always be a home button
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.560]   and
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.200]   I predict it will be available for the exact same prices existing iPads
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.360]   They'll cut the iPad to price by about a hundred hundred fifty bucks
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:05.640]   And finally and this is the this is the shocker just by the way as contradicts everyone who says is gonna be jacked up a little bit
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:10.360]   They're wrong and here's the shocker and I hope you're writing this down kids because we'll know on Wednesday
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:14.200]   And I'm gonna be right it will be available Friday March 9th
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.600]   I
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:23.000]   I'm done. I don't think you'll be able to so you just dream this up last night while you're snoring
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.700]   I mean this is something you've been putting together for a while. I've been thinking about it thinking
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:32.040]   So Leah you know, you know, I suspect inside information. I have a little inside of information. No
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:36.520]   That's not a prediction that says it'll be available Friday, which is actually very good news
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.480]   March 9th because that's right. That's like then a couple of days later
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.040]   And there's a good reason for that they don't want to cannibalize sales of the iPad 2 for any longer
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.760]   The reason they're gonna wait for 10 days is because they have to get it into the hands of
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:54.760]   Mossberg and pog already there shills have it already there
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:04.160]   So not yet they don't give them to him till after the talk to the launch announcement
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:10.080]   Then they give it to him. I'd be willing to bet that day and date they will have a review in the Wall Street Journal
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.000]   The New York Times USA Today not in the Houston Chronicle
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.800]   Not on channel devorex.com and definitely not on quit
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:26.400]   All right, that's not important, you know, they everyone makes a big deal about being the first out of the shoot
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:32.560]   I'd rather have a good thorough review than a first review by some guy who's obviously been
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:40.800]   Compromised in the process exactly ours technique. I always wait John Syracuse. It has great reviews online. They're on OS 10
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:47.320]   They're very good. I think in their long form reviews. Andy and Naka will do a very good long form review a week or two later as well
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:52.400]   That's the big story. We're gonna take a break come back because the other big story is of course windows 8
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.760]   At for oddly enough at mobile world Congress
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.280]   Microsoft shipped the consumer preview of windows 8
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:04.920]   Um and I think it's great, but John said it is great
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:10.360]   He's so I only think it's great because I can would you like something or is there a bug in your chowder? Oh, okay?
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:16.240]   There you go. That's a good fiance the bugga. You sure that wasn't from the HP
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.960]   buggy product
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:25.520]   You're a bad man John keep on you smoke them. She got him everybody. I want to say hello to our good friends at carbonite
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:34.360]   Dot com backup done right. What does that mean? I say it all the time? It's very simple in my opinion any backup solution has to be automatic
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.960]   You can't have to think about it
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.840]   It has to happen all the time because if it only backs up once a week on a schedule
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.880]   What happens in the middle of the week when you lose everything you've lost days worth the work?
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.280]   Nope continuous backup
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:48.520]   What else would I want to see I'd want to see it encrypted so nobody can see it?
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:54.680]   Also the transmission should be SSL right yeah should go to the cloud not next to my computer
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.920]   It's good to have it back up next to you Peter
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.640]   But you know if a fire flood somebody breaks and steals everything you can't have it's just sitting there
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.480]   You want it somewhere safe in the cloud?
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:06.520]   That's what carbonite does and the best of all is they do that at a really really low price
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.520]   I don't think anybody can give you a better price in carbonite
[00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:13.520]   Everything on your internal drive for less than five bucks a month 59 dollars a year
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:19.360]   They also have plans for multiple drives external drives multiple computers small businesses
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:23.920]   Visit carbonite comm and take a look and then when you decide you want to give it a try there
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:28.600]   It is right there you see they try the home free of the business free you get it free for 15 days
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.720]   which is usually enough for that first backup and and
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.320]   You don't even need a credit card. You just need the offer code TWIT
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.920]   Right there. What says offer code TW IT just do that 15 days of carbonite
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.920]   I like a company that believes in itself well enoughs to say hey try it free
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.560]   We're not even gonna get your credit card. Just give it a shot
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:52.840]   And if you like it, we know you'll come back besides if you decide to buy after the two-week trial use TWIT again
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:59.200]   You'll get 14 months for the price of 12 that is a very very good deal carbonite. You got to back it up to get it back
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.560]   Do it right
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.360]   carbonite
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.200]   Yeah, as Kane says with a new eco boost engine
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.080]   Kane Kane's got it all mushed together in his mind
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.720]   Windows 8
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:14.560]   first of all I
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.160]   Don't I wish I had it on this machine
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:22.200]   Did you if you installed it on anything I have I put it on my machine in the other room and I have it at home
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.280]   But I don't have it on a machine here
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:28.400]   So I can't show you but if you've seen the metro interface on a windows phone if you've seen the developer preview
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:33.520]   They released a few months ago. It looks pretty much the same big tiles looks the same no start button
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.640]   It's a start screen and you can still find the little thing if you dig around you go to the desktop one
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:42.480]   I still even on the desktop. There's no start button, but you can go down and hover and you can still you know
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.360]   Many of the features that people were used to Windows 7 will
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:50.600]   Probably be able to find there's a there's a still a run command. There's still a command line
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:55.560]   There's the console, you know system management console all those things under the hood
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:01.760]   But really they're focused on this tablet interface the metro interface. I know John's gonna say something
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:05.880]   So let's let's go this way this time and let Dwight start with all right. What do you think?
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:11.960]   Well, it's you're right. It's very much like the developer preview and it's clearly Microsoft
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.240]   Trying to make the tablet
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:22.560]   Environment and the desktop environment cohesive so you could move back and forth between one and the two of them one of the frustrating things
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:28.160]   I found about using it is that it's kind of jarring going back and forth between metro and
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:35.680]   And the traditional desktop, you know your legacy apps have to run on the traditional desktop and they have some some interesting apps
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:41.640]   And metro but and they do this kind of shift thing that looks a lot like the iPad when it changes apps
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.840]   You know things kind of slide in front of each other and it's jarring going back and forth
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.080]   Maybe as you get used to it and you use it more
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.960]   But I you know looking at
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:58.640]   everyday users who are loathe to change and some of them who are just now gotten used to the to the
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.720]   Windows 7 changes for Windows XP I
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:08.200]   Think this is going to be really hard for a lot of everyday users to take initially unless they have a tablet
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.420]   You know the thing is is that it's so tablet oriented
[00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:18.360]   You know I want Microsoft to get us get reviewers tablets with this on it so we could see what that's really light
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.080]   You know
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:23.200]   We actually did a review of windows 8 on a tablet and it was snappy
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:30.880]   It was very responsive beautiful easy to use intuitive and that metro interface is what we've been loving about the new phones from Microsoft
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.560]   It's just gorgeous
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:37.440]   And it but it is very different from any windows experience that's been thrown out so far
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:42.320]   And I'm wondering if your normal consumer is going to be able to handle it, but it's gorgeous
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.520]   Well your windows users
[00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:46.440]   Yeah, well you go to windows 8 when it comes out
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:52.280]   I mean would you if you weren't a journalist you would I will anyhow you would anyway. Yeah, yeah, not known how much it's gonna cost
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.320]   They say this year probably late summer. We don't know for sure
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:00.320]   Although it feels pretty ready. I haven't been able to crash it. I've been using it for several days now
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:03.400]   It's been very as you say speedy snappy reliable
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.400]   It feels done or close to it
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:13.280]   My concern and John I'd love to get your thought but my concern when we we had this conversation when windows 8 developer preview came out
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:18.040]   And I agreed with you I thought you cannot make one interface to rule them all
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.280]   And it's a mistake to take the tablet metaphor and put it on the desktop
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:25.760]   I have to say after having used this consumer preview for a while. I'm gonna have to modify that
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.520]   I think it's not bad. I like it in fact why I
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.720]   a couple of things first of all
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:37.300]   If you're a new user and and a lot of people now are gonna come to computing from their phones, right?
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:43.080]   So for those people I by the way, I dispute that comp you don't think so
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:48.680]   I think people everyone's got a computer and I don't think that somebody's gonna get a smartphone and say gosh
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:53.200]   All these years I haven't been using a computer, but now that I've got this phone
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.840]   I'm gonna get a computer and just think it's saturated
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:01.400]   I don't believe there's a whole generation growing up though there they're they've been raised with the computers
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.760]   They're little kids well they've been and they've been using that you're right
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:11.440]   16 year olds. Yeah, but I mean there's kids three year olds who are using tablets and will be tablet the next generation
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.960]   No be some tab maybe well
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.920]   They're sitting on their parents laps playing with laptops and playing with maybe
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:21.000]   Well, I'm not buying into this idea that we have a bunch of people that are idiots
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.560]   I can I can let that go. I do think that for a lot of people a tablet interface just is a better interface
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:32.160]   I think that the tiles are gonna be very intuitive for a lot of people those of us who use a desktop will be able to get to it
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.160]   I'm not sure I agree with the right that it's confusing
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:41.560]   Jari I think the word the better word is schizophrenic well that was my initial concern
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:45.920]   I feel like it's a little bit more unified than I thought it was gonna be I feel pretty comfortable with it
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.880]   When you hit that I would stay on the desktop
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.880]   I just you know, I never very rarely go to the tiles thing well there you go
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:55.400]   I'm fine gives you that option, but then I'm thinking what do I need this for with these tiles right?
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:26:01.680]   But he the key will be what developers do with it one of the most interesting apps that's available in the in the market
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:05.640]   Which is all free right now look at the USA Today app
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:12.640]   That is a really cool application that takes advantage of the tiles and meshes well with media
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:17.920]   You know, it's very photo oriented you get to you can get to stories
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:22.360]   The difficult thing is when you get to a story you have to scroll sideways to read it
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:27.040]   The text is big and on a traditional monitor. It's kind of it's a little odd, but
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:31.480]   It will depend on what developers and you have to do it. Wait a minute. Let me get this straight
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:36.440]   You have to do side-to-side scrolling. There's a lot of that. There's a lot of that
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:40.880]   But I and I agree on a mouse. It's very weird to do that. I have to say though
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.880]   It's interesting. I was for instance one of the things I don't like and Apple's doing this too is these new full-screen apps
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.120]   But I think for most users
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:53.660]   They don't do the multitasking that we grew up with John with a windows interface with one window open here another window open there
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:58.220]   You know, I'm browsing users are very full-screen focus you yourself
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:07.920]   We're commenting on your probably less than tech massive Jennifer right who you yourself said has millions of windows
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:12.840]   Open and you have to go close her windows, but that wouldn't be an issue if it were all full-screen
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:17.520]   That's maybe she works lots of no no no. She no no it's because she doesn't know their windows
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:25.160]   She doesn't know their apps. She's she's a really good example of of the truth is that I think most users do one thing at a time well
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:33.280]   Generally, yeah, because you can't really do ten things and so why not have a full window open. It's it's less confusing
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:37.720]   It's all there. It's very intuitive very easy to use. I think that's why maybe
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:43.320]   Maybe actually us look at they understand they took a chance. They said we're gonna reimagine windows
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.560]   So they did so the great irony here is no more windows
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:51.920]   I mean this obviously trending in that direction. Yeah full so we go to like a screens that are
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:57.440]   1900 by 1080 most most most massive amount of real estate
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:01.720]   We could ever imagine and it's gonna be full screens all the time. It's gonna look like this
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:06.920]   This is what I do looking it's not idiotic. This is this is actually a very natural way to work
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:10.400]   Really, you know losing your eyesight. I guess it's cool
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:17.360]   Leo can I can I go off on a little tangent? Yes, please. Yeah, so one of my favorite
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:23.160]   devices to use on my Mac is the magic touchpad, you know the oversized
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:28.400]   Apple touchpad that is the guy before though. I'm using it right now
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:32.600]   Oh, I use my magic, but I'm using it my laptop touchpad very much the same way
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:38.440]   So so as I've been playing with windows 8 on a traditional desktop with a mouse
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:44.960]   I've been thinking I would love something like the magic touchpad that large it begs for that fluid
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.760]   But the problem is that no windows
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:57.840]   PC manufacturer has yet made a trackpad this is fluid as apples and if someone can make something that is that is big like this
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.680]   For use and it works as well as the magic touchpad
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.680]   for a
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:11.040]   For a Windows 8 PC. I think they'd have a killer product and it would make windows 8 work really well on a traditional desktop
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:17.320]   Yeah, that's I think you know like in the Microsoft store and whatnot. I'm seeing more people focusing on here
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:21.880]   Let's take a big glossy tablet and just hook that into a keyboard for when you need it
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.960]   And I think that's another word experiences really focused on yeah
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.760]   I think you know there's um we were saying earlier
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:33.400]   I believe it was my friend John noting that or was it you Leo saying that
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:41.080]   Taking the desktop experience to tablets to the phone and making one OS for all is kind of
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:46.040]   Impossible, but it's such a trend. I mean Google is trying to do that with you know
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:50.560]   Yeah, oh what's home and also with ice cream sandwich their new mobile
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:56.840]   System that's supposed to work on TVs and tablets and phones and who knows make laptops. I had severe misgivings
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:00.880]   I thought that's crazy. Why do that? Why not why not create an operation that's easier for development
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:06.300]   natively and you're right it's easier for developers and it may be easier for users who do now go from device to device they
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:09.200]   Use a phone they use a desktop. They might use a television
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:14.120]   Well, and they go from you know the console or gaming console to their mobile gaming device and I think
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:17.560]   Consumers once they get used to the idea that they can do that
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:23.840]   They'll begin to expect that so you need to have the operating system and the browsers and all that stuff ready to sink from device to device
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:28.120]   And the thing that reassures me is that there's always going to be Linux and
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:32.640]   So if for those of us who still live in the command line and want multiple
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:37.400]   The command line operating system is pretty isn't it?
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:44.160]   It can be unfortunately one - is moving the irony is a bunch of Linux is moving towards his tablet in her face as well
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.800]   however
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.800]   Trend there will always be
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:52.280]   Geeky Linux with multiple windows and a command line and I think that that's good
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.000]   There means that for those of us who like that and want it
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.880]   Who will increasingly look like old farts?
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:04.880]   We'll be able to get that but I think the future I hate to say it because yes, but you're saying I was wrong
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.880]   Well, it's a I was wrong
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:12.800]   Between you and the technology you're using and that's you nailed it
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:19.880]   Exactly right exactly right surely now. There's an interesting thing in here the kill switch and John you wrote a little bit
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:23.400]   About this kill switch. What is what is the kill switch?
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:28.680]   I mean, let me find that article and you can talk about by the way new logo. What do you think of that?
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:34.240]   It's idiotic. It looks like the Norwegian flag minus the colors. What is that's a good one? That's a good one
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:40.480]   It's what it looks like the Norwegian flag. What is the story or the Swedish flag Swedish Swedish? Yeah, I think that's Swedish
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:45.640]   So I think the Norwee. I mean look it's very simple. It's very clean. It's not very attractive
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:52.080]   famous design agency called Pensagon and we did a bunch of research on it and I can't for the life of me imagine the design
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.720]   Process and windows or Microsoft or whoever must have thrown so much money at them
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:32:00.040]   And I think it kind of came down to the wire they ran out of pot and they were like, okay guys
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.280]   I'm coming down
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:12.640]   These days is it the Swedish or the Norwegian flag John we use both of them have that they're both they all look very similar
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:18.800]   Yeah, that's the Swedish flag. It's boring. Yeah, it's boring. It looks like the it invokes the original windows
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:24.600]   Logo from windows 1.0. What it looks like that's kind of a sad statement
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:28.880]   Oh, so my theory is that every other version of windows is going to be a piece of crap
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:34.120]   And if you look at it that way for a long time 95 was good 98 actually 98 was pretty good Emmy terrible
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.760]   95
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:42.240]   Okay, then vista terrible 95 was good 98 was good. So there wasn't one skip. That's not true
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:49.760]   They actually pre-announced windows 97 and could not release it it counts because it was so bad
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.520]   No, it was 98. They couldn't get it out the door
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:58.480]   So there was a 97 that was a turkey and 98 came up was good and then Emmy was was was bad
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:05.640]   And then 2000 was good. You're skipping windows. Yeah windows 2000. 2000 was good windows 2000 to me
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:10.880]   So there does seem to be this tiktok cycle and I think that people observe this before this is this is a well-known
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.840]   Observation so windows 7 was very good. I think we all agree. It was the best windows probably since 2000
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:20.000]   I've been happy with it. It's wonderful. I think it's wonderful. Yeah, she's never happy
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.240]   Aaron I just want to air and you know
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:30.680]   The
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:35.600]   97 I didn't you know I didn't think vista was that much of a turkey was just kind was a turkey it was bloated
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.320]   It was it was it was bloated was bloated. It was too big
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:44.680]   But you have on big honking machines is that these little diminutive machines and it's not a big deal irony is seven really is vista
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:51.200]   But stripped down and made fast. That's right, you know, so tell us about the kill switch. What about it? What is it?
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:56.480]   I didn't even know about it. You discovered this. Oh, yeah, no, this has been discovered by somebody else apparently
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:00.880]   This has been floating around this piece of information. It lets Microsoft delete apps from your windows
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:06.160]   If you buy from the app store, yeah, Microsoft has a hook supposedly then they won't deny it
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:10.760]   the question that they really don't want to talk about is can they kiss kill the OS and
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:18.040]   Which is the one that gets where I wrote the column, but they have a kill switch was kill switches are really cool because Google uses them in
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:25.480]   Every mobile device so Microsoft is putting it in so they can pull this day because it could be a dangerous app
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:29.320]   And they don't want to do a big patch, you know patch to they just pull it
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.600]   And so next thing you know your app is missing and that's just you've already
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:37.400]   Your app is missing because it's not assuming they'll give you some kind of notification this sorry
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.820]   We pulled your app because it was gonna. This is our
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:44.360]   On Android and I don't know but I bet you it's already
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:49.440]   It hasn't okay. No, but they can do it. They have the capability can do it
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.000]   But they haven't done it for a Apple they have done it with
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.280]   With Android so when the question of my mind where I wrote this column PC mag.com you can check it out
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:02.800]   The question on my mind is what if they if they decide they really get hardcore
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:06.200]   Which is a term that Microsoft really likes to use about?
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:13.800]   Piracy of the OS and just this and kill it from a distance. They said it look there's no doubt in our minds that this is a bootleg version
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:19.480]   I know they don't want to do this just as a general policy because they're fearful that they're gonna start because they're so
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:25.280]   Incompetent by the way in this level. Oh, yeah, they would kill a bunch of OS is that really good and they get sued remember the
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:30.240]   Windows genuine advantage program and about five they even admitted about five percent of all right was
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.520]   Bo air, you know pirate air piracy messages were bogus were false positives
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:40.000]   Yeah, so so there was a magic 5% killing 5% of legitimate machine you kill one legitimate machine
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   You got a lawsuit so they can well depends on the way the license is written
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:50.080]   But whatever the case is I believe they've got this thing rigged so they can do whatever they want and I who knows what you know
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:53.000]   This could come in handy or not handy or could be a disaster
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.480]   Who knows but I believe there's a kill switch in there
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:36:01.800]   I think what this is symptomatic of is really that these desktop OSes are becoming mobile OSes and all the features of mobile
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:05.800]   OSes are migrating to the desktop including the kill switch well hold up didn't Microsoft and I
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:12.080]   Looked it up just a few months ago. They uh windows or Microsoft was deleting Chrome from users PCs
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:15.160]   Yes
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:33.420]   And there was a Microsoft security essentials update and for around 3000 people it zapped their chrome and then they threw fits and then my
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:38.160]   Remember that you've ever had your Chrome zapped. I think I think it quarantined it. Oh, he didn't make that up
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:43.560]   I think you're right. It was a security essentials bug. Mm-hmm. Oh or false positive
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:45.760]   I
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:50.520]   Think that for instance and I'm pretty sure to correct me if I'm wrong in the chat room. We'll do that
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:53.080]   They do it even when I'm not wrong
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:59.680]   That it looks like the memory management and this is also like a mobile app, you know one of the constraints of a mobile
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:02.440]   Platform is you have less memory you have less CPU
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:08.280]   So if an app but you want to put in multitasking because frankly it's a bad idea but consumers demand it
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:10.280]   so what you do is you have a
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:16.420]   Kind of aging process in which apps that are not used for while just get killed they they're released
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.600]   You don't ever have to quit an app on a smartphone, right?
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.520]   Because they just release them and I think and I might be wrong
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:27.280]   But I think I noticed that happening on my windows 8 I had a camera. That's correct. It does do that doesn't it?
[00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:33.800]   Yes, it knows there's no on a lot of the apps and a lot of the metro apps. There's no obvious no quit exit or quit
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:36.680]   Yeah, I wasn't my imagination. Okay, right, right?
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:42.880]   And so you simply move on to something else and the and windows itself handles when it gets turned off
[00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.400]   See that's for Jennifer too
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.800]   She she doesn't leave windows open because she wants them
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:50.280]   She leaves windows open because she doesn't know how to click the little button in the corner
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:53.680]   She's no, no she does but that doesn't in on a Mac that doesn't even kill the program
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:59.040]   It just closes a window unlike you know, this is one thing that my girl's lack little circle it kills
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:04.160]   No, this is one thing Microsoft did differently than Apple and I think Microsoft got it right if when you close the last
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:09.680]   Window on an app on a Windows machine it closes the app. Yeah, when you close the last window on an app on a Mac
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.680]   Nothing, it's the app still runs
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.680]   And so she's
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:22.760]   Some of them do close some do most of the time at the consistent. Yeah, didn't consist of so I do think that the the whole notion of quitting
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.920]   Is going away notion of windowing is going away?
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:31.760]   I think apps are going to be more and more bought in app stores because that
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:36.640]   In-venience and well the only kind of app you could sell in the app store for Microsoft is a Metro app
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:41.960]   So that means more and more apps will look like Metro apps. This is where we're going. We're going it is a dumbing down
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:47.560]   But I think that's an elitist thing to say I think it's not it's an honest thing to say is dumbing down
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:52.080]   Well, it is but I think it's making it easier to let's giving you less control over your programs
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:55.560]   True, you can't quit them. No, you can't and I don't know
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:00.400]   That's not in an app store
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.760]   Well, that's a very good access to
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.280]   For instance in the Apple
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:13.480]   In the Apple app store you you can't put demos you can't put betas and you can't put open source because it would violate the open source
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:17.720]   License to put it in the app store. So there is no open source in Apple's app store
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:20.840]   I would guess the same thing will be true in Microsoft. Do you know anything about that Dwight?
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.840]   No, I don't I don't think that
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:28.840]   That they allow in the in the Microsoft app store that they allow
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:33.560]   Open source because of for because of the issue of malware
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:38.800]   I think that leaves it open the malware. They're not gonna allow that so you're right. This is really
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:45.000]   Absolutely the opposite in fact, isn't it? I don't I think if you look at the source code
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.800]   You can validate it if you look at the source code you can you can mess with it
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:53.160]   I don't know how to answer that if I say you're not just a girl. That's like you can't win
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:56.880]   It's a non-wiz man. She says it. You're not a girl. You're screwed
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:03.640]   Aaron, I'm just warning you. I'm just telling you she's she's too smart for us
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:07.840]   No, I'm not saying that by the way I consider this group
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:13.800]   This will group here the A team of the Twitch show because this is the only time with everybody writes about tech
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:19.520]   We don't have broadcasters from you know who knows where we don't have celebrities no celebrities
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:26.120]   It's just real people talking about real stuff right about it. We're all writers the really the idea except for me
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:32.680]   I'm a talker. Well, you're a writer too. I'm a talker. Well, you're the ghost. Yeah, so I know I'm not one of the I'm not one of you
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.400]   Yeah, we should get rid of you that's really dynamite
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:37.640]   I
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:43.840]   Reads the commercials this show brought to you by Gazelle dot cop. You know the new iPad 3 is going by hold on a second
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.840]   Are you doing the voice for the Calv?
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.440]   Basketball knows it sound like me
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:55.320]   Dead ringer one of our advertisers. I'm gonna ask your advice mr. Wreck. He's been my career advisor
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:41:02.480]   I have helped him you can see he's been successful one of our you actually he's not joking. He's a great help one of our advertisers says
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:06.840]   I want we want you to read our ads, but you don't say your name. It's not in the first person
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:12.260]   We just want you we just want you to be voice talent. Yeah, but I think my voice is distinctive enough that that's an endorsement
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:17.760]   Yeah, you think yeah, I think I'm total agreement. Okay. Good. Except for this guy who sounds like you
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:23.920]   That's the problem is that maybe it isn't distinct. Maybe I sound just like everybody else avoid there are for you who do have a distinctive voice
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.240]   It's an answer, but yeah, I was trying to pick up
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:30.600]   You have a little little little twangy thing that goes on that I can use it there
[00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.960]   Twangy because even when you do it
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.920]   Twangy and this guy never never delivered it
[00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:41.260]   But I know that you could probably hide it and you could have been this guy. I could oh, that's what I'll do
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:47.160]   When I do really neutral. I'll do the German voice. I do it like this. I am from Hamburg
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:50.480]   I have just won a t-shirt. Are you wearing the t-shirt?
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:55.100]   You see vang it's no no he's gone. He took the t-shirt left
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:58.520]   Well, I guess he's gone back to Hamburg, you know if I have another t-shirt
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.920]   I'm gonna get it for the South Carolina lady you you win Charleston
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:07.560]   She's from Charleston to one of the greatest cities in the world. It's is that where the midnight garden in the midnight and evil
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:10.120]   That's Savannah
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:16.680]   Charleston is not Savannah Charleston Charleston is the capital right Charleston is the most Oh Columbia right in the United States
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:23.360]   Charleston South Carolina not Charleston, North Carolina. There is no Charleston, North Carolina. There's check there's West Virginia
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:29.200]   Oh, I'm thinking of Charlotte Charlotte Charlotte. I've been a Charlotte, but I have never been to Charleston South Carolina
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:35.280]   You gotta go to the South Carolina to go very much to Charleston and do reverse carpet bagger thing
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:39.160]   Yeah, that's right. I'm gonna go down there and with a carpet with a carpet bag
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:43.840]   Let me talk about gazelle because you know if you have an iPad to Tom Merritt asked me this
[00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:50.880]   He said should I what do you think is it is I want I know I'm buying the iPad 3 should I should I gazelle my iPad?
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:53.960]   I said yes because every day you wait it goes down in value
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:43:00.240]   Don't it mean it might be a buck might be ten bucks why wait if you know you're getting a pet 3 so this is one of the reasons
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.280]   Gazelle
[00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:06.920]   Advertisers a lot this week is because they know that this is you know when the new iPhones come out the new iPads come out
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.920]   That's when they aren't the busiest
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:17.280]   Because people use gazelle to finance their upgrade and why not let me see I'm just gonna see what my iPad 2 I
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:23.540]   Have I happen to have the you know the big top of the line actually mines Verizon 64 gig 3g and
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:27.080]   375 this no chill my screen
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:32.160]   Because I'm I'm that's how much that's worth now. Here's the thing
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.600]   That's by the way
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:37.360]   It could be worth a little bit more because that's assuming some scratches or sign of where if it's imperfect
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:42.960]   You even get more what happens is you don't have to take your data off you send it to a gazelle
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:48.960]   They pay the postage effect get a box because you're gonna throw all your old gadgets as long as you're doing this get a bunch of gadgets
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.200]   Throw them in the box
[00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.680]   They pay the postage their data experts remove your data
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:59.480]   They check the course they're checking to make sure it matches the condition that you said and then they will send you a check or a pay
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:01.760]   Pal but this is the one I recommend the Amazon gift card
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.240]   It's as good as cash
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:08.960]   We all buy stuff on Amazon right and you get 5% more you want cash you have cash if you have flawless
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:14.440]   Let's see what this goes to three thirty seven. Okay, even if it's broken. It's worth eighty three bucks
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:19.440]   What do you think they do with that one though? I mean that's
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:26.800]   Anyway, if it is really worthless, they will recycle it appropriately. They use green recycling no landfill no offshore shipping
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:31.040]   Gazelle is fantastic. I just I just think this is such a great thing
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:35.440]   Yeah, sure you could probably put an ad in the paper or go to eBay and sell it yourself
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:38.640]   I have a small dog that I've been wanting to get rid of for some time and
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:41.240]   Brazil
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.680]   Aww
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:49.600]   Aussie says a jolly a yelly gazie Elle. He no, I would never show this dog
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:54.460]   I would only give him to Jolie. Oh really? Yeah, if you promised to take good care of him
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:58.280]   How do you like dogs Aaron? He loves them. He says he doesn't want it
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:06.540]   You know it's funny we had a nun in here earlier in black and white and
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:09.540]   She wanted to pose with a dog cuz he's dressed the same
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:17.220]   This is a terrible joke. It's not a joke. It's actually true sister sister. I might not I'm not Frank Frank
[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:22.300]   Go back me up Frank was here also sister Jody was here and she posed with the dog cuz they're wearing a shame outfit
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:25.060]   That's so cute G a z e l l e
[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:29.160]   Recycled easy way don't sell it cuz sell it really is a great deal
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:33.300]   And I just I just love them and I know you will too. So give him a try today
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:37.180]   You almost lost your spot John the dog was saying some sassy things
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:40.620]   Jumped yes, the dog and I have a having issue
[00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:47.960]   Either that or he likes the smell of your bottom. I don't think so well he might so look at this
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:52.540]   That is what you have to do you do it come on do do do do you know what they call it?
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:57.980]   They call it CW a key. Yeah, it's a Morse code that you ever see the speed keys or you should get a
[00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:03.740]   Yeah, yeah, are you gonna learn Morse code cuz you're a ham many people don't know this but John is a ham as well
[00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:08.180]   Are you gonna learn the Morse? I think I should I think if there's a real because if you're like in jail
[00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:11.180]   You got a tap on the thing and that's you know believe it or not
[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:14.100]   That's the example when they say you should learn Morse code
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:18.300]   They tell the story of some guy was like stuck in a Spanish jail and there was a something
[00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:20.060]   There's a fire something they didn't know he was in there
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:25.180]   Oh, no, maybe it was an earthquake. No, that's what it was was an earthquake and he tapped out on the pipe and they found him
[00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:31.340]   So there you go. So now you're a prince your way ahead of me on this. What's the got one of these? Oh, yeah, absolutely
[00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:37.420]   This one what is your radio emergency service California rescue communications as you know
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:40.880]   Hands are very focused on emergency services. Yeah
[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:46.440]   Hands are very focused on emergency services and we have a really great ham shack here
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:53.420]   So we absolutely are participants and all of that and if there is if the world comes to an end you and Adam should come here
[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:59.020]   No problem. This place is a bomb shelter. You didn't know that but we have reinforced it
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:03.580]   And also it's brick actually do is get across the Golden Gate Bridge, which should be no
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:10.500]   Actually, you you can't well you can't go up and around
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:16.260]   But there's another bridge up there on where to go so I could go out to Rio Vista and
[00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:18.820]   Then all the way around the Delta
[00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:24.780]   I probably take a barge and then come over the other side and then I can come down that black whatever that thing is
[00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:28.420]   The middle of nowhere's and then come up I can make it take about three days
[00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:32.700]   Actually after major disasters those are the kinds of things that happen
[00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:36.860]   I mean people do have to do that and we know there's gonna be a bad earthquake sometimes
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:38.860]   I've always told you from California originally
[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:42.140]   More or less so you're ready for the bad earthquake
[00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:50.100]   Ready. Yeah as ready as you can be. Hey John. Come on here. I get so dark. It's called nighttime. No
[00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:57.700]   What do you mean it gets so dark? Oh, you mean we get emotional start talking about earthquakes and doom
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:02.660]   Is that true really first time I came on we started talking about someone who would just pass oh it was Steve Jobs
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:08.820]   Bless his heart. He had just passed and I came on and you opened with that and I was like well this could only get better
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.500]   What's a big story in tech?
[00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:15.220]   Terry's I'm a natural pessimist
[00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:23.700]   Who says this guy like I'm a natural pessimist 18 t all right this picking of dark this pisses me off
[00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:27.260]   Yeah, the dark empire this is dark so 18 t
[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:30.900]   Promised am I wrong?
[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:34.660]   Promised that they would continue to offer unlimited
[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:42.020]   mobile bandwidth for people who have purchased it with their original off phones and many of us including I have it
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:44.620]   how are still on this plan of unlimited and
[00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:50.900]   First they throttle so we get we talked to this guy last week Matt's back a rally who sued him got
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:55.000]   $850 a small claims court. We talked about it last week. So what's their response?
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.260]   Alright screw you no more unlimited
[00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:02.300]   They pull that's not
[00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.500]   That's not what they said that's not
[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:10.140]   The the wall that Wall Street Journal story kind of cast it probably and not the right way it says 18
[00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:14.740]   This is another bad headline from the journal AT&T ends all you can eat. That's not what they did
[00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:20.420]   That's not what they did because you can what happened was AT&T had been throttling users
[00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:24.100]   who had fallen into the top 5% of
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:28.420]   Of data users which doesn't take doesn't take much effect
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:36.420]   As more people use it that level was coming down so we started hearing from people who were
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:42.940]   Hitting it at two gigabytes right which is less than the three gigabytes that they sell now for 30 bucks
[00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:48.820]   Same price you pay for that so that's still unlimited they argue but it's like through a straw right and
[00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:52.380]   You want and they said of this double bucks
[00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:59.900]   They said it was for network management, but it's clearly trying to drive people to offer that to the tier
[00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:04.060]   They don't have the progressive its passive. Very nice. That's exactly what it is
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:10.780]   And so what they've done now is they've gotten so much heat that they've essentially moved the bar up to three gigabytes
[00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:13.900]   Which is at parity with thirty dollar?
[00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:21.460]   So a dollar tiered amount so they take away the fairness issue and people will not get there as quickly
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:24.980]   So they won't have as much screaming but it's still unlimited
[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:30.820]   But it is unlimited through a soda straw when you get past three and we talked about this last week
[00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:32.340]   I think you were here John
[00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:39.500]   There's ample evidence that the that this kind of throttling does not help you with network congestion
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:46.940]   No, not at all. So it I think it's pretty clear. I mean the evidence is just mean spirited it is it's yeah
[00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:48.380]   They're just
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:52.300]   Bastards there you have it and that's from Leo la Porte
[00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:58.260]   Okay, okay any time a company makes a decision that doesn't seem to make sense
[00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:02.060]   We follow the money. Well, of course, there's money involved
[00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:08.940]   Well, if there is they're going to have to ask people to pay more what makes a company a bastard is when they promise something
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:12.220]   To get your money and then decide
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:15.620]   You can't believe someone that you're giving your money to to keep their promises
[00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:19.940]   You can only count on them to want more money. Yeah. Well, that's not a good
[00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:26.180]   America man welcome to America. She says we're dark. Yeah, really what a negative attitude
[00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:31.420]   So Verizon my motto is if you have nothing nice to say don't say anything at all
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:34.300]   More's code
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:39.100]   All right, so so for rise it in the fight Verizon does throttling right?
[00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:46.900]   They have the same policy. They have a top 5% policy to but what they do is they don't invoke it until you're actually at
[00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:53.460]   Network tower that is congested. I'll you while you're connected to that or while it's congested
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:58.300]   And then when situation normalizes your speed comes back or if you moved to a different tower
[00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:03.420]   That's a good idea. That's how you manage your network not the way AT&T is doing it
[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:07.380]   So but it makes perfect sense and it's so straightforward
[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:14.580]   Well, and it may be that that with the way AT&T is doing it is technologically limited in other words
[00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:18.980]   They can't do what Verizon is doing, but what's interesting is that T-Mobile
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:25.940]   Does almost the exact same thing AT&T does but what they do is they say we'll sell you five gigabytes
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:28.860]   And when you get to five gigabytes, we won't charge you over
[00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:34.100]   But we will throttle you and they say that up front right and it's different when you say it up front and say okay
[00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:37.700]   We're gonna be cool about it AT&T is kind of moving to the T-Mobile
[00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:43.980]   approach where they're staying up front at three your throttle now what about this
[00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:47.540]   I want to call you Angelina Jolie Odell
[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:54.620]   Where's your leg? Oh, she's cute. She's beautiful. So
[00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:59.540]   Get back to the subject
[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:05.540]   All right, so
[00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:09.900]   Here's so this is to me. This is just pure greed
[00:53:10.740 --> 00:53:16.340]   AT&T now says they're going to let some application providers pay for your bandwidth
[00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:19.340]   Mmm, that's so smart. So
[00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:22.540]   They'll will be this class of apps
[00:53:22.540 --> 00:53:30.380]   That you download that it doesn't use any of your bandwidth because Comcast pays for it or whoever that makes so much sense
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:35.540]   So they make they're basically double dipping zinga pays or zinga or whatever. They're double dipping now
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:39.100]   Because they're getting you know, they're I'm paying them
[00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:44.020]   For free and open access to the internet what a fool I was because now
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:47.420]   They're also charging companies to get to me
[00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:51.980]   Disadvantaging people like me because it's never gonna be able to pay for your bandwidth
[00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:54.700]   so you're gonna so if if
[00:53:54.700 --> 00:54:02.500]   Adam Curry says hey me view will pay for your bandwidth. That's it for me. Bye. Bye. You know what they say the rich get richer and the poor get
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:04.900]   Future phones screwed
[00:54:08.900 --> 00:54:10.900]   So
[00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:16.820]   So is this a net neutrality issue? Yes violation of net neutrality because you argue that to the FCC
[00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:24.900]   Oh, are you it's it couldn't be more clear that some if you're if you decide to pay for the bandwidth for your customers
[00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:30.500]   You'll get preferred access won't you in effect and don't you think AT&T will feature you?
[00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:37.500]   Customers are certainly gonna be aware of this if I have a choice between let's say Netflix streaming video that uses my bandwidth and
[00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:41.420]   Amazon streaming video that doesn't what am I gonna use? I'm gonna use Amazon, right?
[00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:47.940]   That's that's what net neutrality is all about that everybody should have free and equal access to customers. So has the I
[00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:57.380]   Don't know the federal communications commission or the FTC or whomever looked into this proposed practice the FCC
[00:54:57.380 --> 00:55:04.580]   Public knowledge is saying it's going to be tough to challenge the plan under the net neutrality rules
[00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:10.020]   Because basically AT&T has been so creative in the phrasing
[00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:15.300]   That the FCC hasn't had says declined to comment according to the Wall Street Journal
[00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:20.780]   But they have been clever in effect because I am I wrong does this not seem like a net neutrality issue?
[00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:24.660]   It seems like they're giving certain businesses and
[00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:31.300]   Competitive advantage of some kind that seems a little bit unfair to other businesses that can't pay that much money
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:35.140]   This has happened before I didn't know this but Metro PCS do this with YouTube day
[00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:37.500]   Huh last year net
[00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:43.420]   Metro PCS offered unlimited YouTube usage if you got a smartphone plan they stop doing that
[00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:49.460]   They stop because of the FCC or did they stop because it was people paying them for that
[00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:56.940]   Somebody said a spokesman I guess from YouTube said that they never paid Metro PT at PCS to subsidize
[00:55:56.940 --> 00:56:01.620]   So Metro PCS was just doing it as a promotion. It's a good promotion. They weren't getting subsidized, right?
[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:08.340]   Okay, so I think does that make a difference? I would think so. I think that this is something regulators would have to take a look at yeah
[00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:15.100]   I hope they do it's comp. Yeah, you're you're obviously a pie eyed optimist
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:22.260]   Comcast I'm sorry comm score. I'm seeing the Comcast state of mind comm score says 50% of
[00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:28.380]   Local mobile searching is now happening in apps. This is why mobile is such an important platform
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:35.100]   Consumers now look for local businesses on their phone on apps. They don't go to their computer
[00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:40.020]   49% of smartphone and tablet owners are using apps to find local information
[00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:46.820]   Makes sense. Yeah, it's probably not even surprised Lee, but it just shows you that you're mocking me. Aren't you?
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:54.300]   No, you're mocking me on to so so does this mean that they're primarily using like the Google Maps app or they talking about things
[00:56:54.300 --> 00:56:57.980]   Yeah, where and yeah, we're sure all of the above
[00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:04.940]   But now you see why Google is so big on local and mobile why Facebook wants to get into this business
[00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:10.460]   Why Apple's being very clever about how they who they support on the on their phones and so forth
[00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:15.940]   Lou MM has just signaled you of with some thoughts and dashes. I hope you can read that I can as a matter of fact
[00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:17.940]   Yes, it's a good way to encrypt
[00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:25.420]   You have another you have another escape from the prison. Yeah, you have another story in your list. We have out smartphones
[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:32.580]   That they're now in the US that more than half of people have smartphones that they've kind of hit the tipping point and gone over
[00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:38.300]   So if you look at that in combination with searching on apps it becomes an even bigger
[00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:44.700]   Market it's growing really fast. In fact. Yeah, this was a survey from the Pew
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:52.660]   What do they call it the American research you internet they have a new American American life?
[00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:57.660]   They interviewed 2,253 adults for as of February
[00:57:57.660 --> 00:58:03.420]   46% said they had smartphones versus 41% with feature phones and
[00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:07.980]   That's grown 11% in the last month. I think I think that nine months
[00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:14.580]   I think that that's that's obviously a trend what it does show. I mean these these they're get obviously because these are not getting any cheaper
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:21.020]   You're making a commitment to spend a thousand dollars a year if you buy a smartphone. I think smartphones are getting cheaper. Are they yes?
[00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:23.420]   Yes, are the data plans going down?
[00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:29.060]   No data plans are the same across the board, but you can buy a feature phone the hardware itself is getting cheaper and cheaper
[00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:34.220]   You could buy a $50 three GS for instance, but you're still gonna be into AT&T for
[00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:40.520]   80 or 90 dollars a month, but you can get other plans on other carriers Metro PCS for example has smart
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:44.500]   I'm just saying you know I hear they have for YouTube who aren't buying AT&T iPhones
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:49.780]   There's why maybe that's it. So maybe that's why because there are more low cost offers
[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:53.700]   I think that and if I may say this without being an Android fan girl
[00:58:53.700 --> 00:59:01.940]   I think that Android and the you call it fragmentation. I call it choice of the Android ecosystem has made this possible
[00:59:01.940 --> 00:59:06.340]   You wouldn't be seeing numbers like this if it weren't I think you're absolutely right because I Apple's not gonna do that
[00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:11.980]   Although 3GS is 50. Well, they don't want to be accessible. What's the name of your Android book? It's an app book Android
[00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:17.780]   Photography photography. Yeah, I am a big fan of this note. Now. This is the no really
[00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:20.500]   This is a stunning revelation
[00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:26.500]   We're trying to make a phone call with that thing. I love it. Do you feel like you didn't answer her question?
[00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:28.500]   Let's go. Let's let's read it. I never
[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:34.180]   I never feel like a goober. Do I look like a goober?
[00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:37.860]   Mom hello Angelina
[00:59:37.860 --> 00:59:45.740]   Yes, see my dog is tiny, but my phone is big and and my heart is huge as the
[00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:50.660]   Material in the spot and I think it's a good choice for what do you use Dwight are using a note?
[00:59:50.660 --> 00:59:52.660]   I'm no I'm using an iPhone
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:55.180]   But I reviewed a note and I really liked it
[00:59:55.180 --> 01:00:01.040]   I was I think it should be Android 4.0 and I think they made a big mistake and not releasing
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.820]   I think all Android phone should be 4.0 at this point
[01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:09.820]   You said yourself Leo that you didn't like 4.0. I don't I prefer it, but this this will go 4.0 in a couple months
[01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:14.620]   Dwight you're gonna want this was announced at mobile world Congress the HTC one
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:17.100]   This is
[01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:22.580]   Cool very sweet. So quad core is amazing. What do you need quad core? No?
[01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:27.340]   For now this isn't quite as big, but it's big. It's 4.7 inches
[01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:32.580]   So it's the biggest phone after the note so how big 4.7 huh? This is fine
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:39.700]   They notice 5 3 and something like the galaxy s2 on sprint is 4 6 so it's I'm sorry for 3 right
[01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:45.220]   4 3 and 4 6 on the sprint one so 4 7 is big
[01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:48.140]   It's it's full HD. It's
[01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:51.380]   10 220 what is it? It's
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:54.500]   Anyway, it's full HD
[01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:59.420]   1920 by 1080 yes, thank you. No, it's not well, then it's not full. What is it?
[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:02.780]   Well, you get your specs tab right let's look yes, it is
[01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:09.860]   720p it's 1280 by 720 so it's HD reasonable yeah, this is same as this but it's in this so in this
[01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:14.740]   That means it's a retina display by the way it is you know a Panasonic that studies on this and when it comes looking at an HD
[01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:18.160]   Movie they say unless the screen size is bigger than 50 inches
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:24.420]   I know you cannot see that there's from a distance from 720 to 1080 I completely agree apple even said that and watch on Wednesday
[01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:29.060]   Apple's gonna all of a sudden say something else 1080p is beautiful on a 9 inch
[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:33.500]   It's much better so this is a Android 4.0. It's ice cream sandwich
[01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:39.100]   I think this is gonna be a very it's interesting is HTC has been kind of lagging behind
[01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:40.980]   I think they're gonna make a big jump forward with this
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:46.020]   I think the battery life will probably last about an hour if you're trying to watch the question
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:53.660]   Are you get the quad core a quad core on LTE with a screen that size battery life is gonna be awful quad core what arm?
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:59.260]   Yeah, I think it probably shut down the cores from for the most AT&T will be dual core
[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:01.540]   But there will be a quad core version of real
[01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:09.780]   You know the thing about getting a bigger phone is you do get better battery life because you have more space for battery
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:12.380]   So this note for instance is very good battery life. So
[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:20.720]   Well, we'll see I this is gonna be a very exciting phone Samsung did not announce their Galaxy 3 which S3 which surprises me
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:25.220]   That is correct. The rumor is April. That's gonna be a another
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:30.620]   You're gonna see Android again outpace the iPhone by several laps
[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:36.180]   I mean the iPhone by coming out once a year apples really starting to miss the boat on innovation a little bit
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:38.180]   Well, also they have one hardware
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:40.140]   Manufacturing
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:42.700]   Right and you only have one group of ideas
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:47.180]   I think you when you have more ideas some of them tend to be better there's a lot of cross-pondylization
[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:49.820]   You really like my dog
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:00.980]   Was that you knows a dog lips didn't even
[01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:07.060]   First I thought it can't be John. I'm looking straight at it must be Dwight, but Dwight wouldn't do that no
[01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:09.060]   I would never do that
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:12.860]   I'm a cat person
[01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:24.820]   Houston's Apple store is opening March 16th. That's what you said. Yeah, that would make sense that that would be the release
[01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:29.820]   What's the deal with the Apple store in Palo Alto when's that gonna open they have a new one don't they that's a different store?
[01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:31.820]   Yeah, they're closed kind of a magic
[01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:35.740]   Apple store they're closing the old one. Yeah, they're closing the old one opening a new one
[01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:41.420]   And this one yeah, and this was gonna be the this is gonna be supposed to be a pewter an experimental store though, right?
[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:44.020]   Yes, yeah
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:49.980]   The one they go in and they drug you the minute you go in they club you okay, so far nothing new
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:54.620]   What else and then they start yelling at you about how great Apple is oh that is new
[01:03:54.620 --> 01:04:01.500]   I thought the one the one here in Houston is gonna be all glass glass front glass back and a glass roof in
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:04.140]   Texas in August
[01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:07.860]   Degrees I'm really looking forward to see how that works
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:11.820]   It's about a mile from the Galleria store
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:19.420]   Which was the first one that opened here and it's in a shopping center that is notorious for having traffic problems and congestion
[01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:24.820]   I think Jolie hit the thing there's a real the real attraction is gonna be the women's restroom
[01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:29.940]   All glass get it joke. I got it all right all right
[01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:38.460]   Wish I didn't I tried I tried it was funny was it a story that Apple had 25 billion downloads this week of apps
[01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:42.740]   No, no onward onward. I don't love stats
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:47.100]   Somebody we don't know who got ten thousand dollars worth of apps
[01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:51.520]   For being the 22nd 20 dollars worth of apps
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:58.420]   We a consumer yeah, so whoever bought the thousand dollars worth of apps apps a lot of apps
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:03.820]   You can also spend it on music, so oh, okay. There you go a ten thousand dollar gift card
[01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:06.700]   I'm a lot of crap music and a lot of terrible apps. Wow
[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:10.980]   Just the I think just the beetle box. They could have given some money
[01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:17.500]   That in 2009 the billionth app was downloaded by a 13 year old Connor McCauley
[01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:23.200]   He nabbed a ten thousand dollar iTunes gift card along with an iPod touch MacBook Pro and a time capsule
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:26.080]   I they're getting cheap now. They're only doing a ten thousand dollar
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:30.700]   Gift card we don't know yet who had the 25th billion download next
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:35.380]   You know the only thing that was funny about it is like well
[01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:39.940]   How would you win this contest where you like just keep buying apps like you they have these teams in Vegas?
[01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:45.100]   You know with these machines and they bring the team in at the last minute when they know the thing is should hit
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:50.060]   It's like there's usually it they they hog all the machines on those you know progressive slot machines
[01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:55.380]   And they start pounding them and then somebody wins and they all split it. Hmm. It's very it's look it up
[01:05:55.380 --> 01:06:00.260]   You can look it on Google. I thought that was fascinating Apple is now
[01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:03.300]   I think they changed this policy, but maybe this is still the case blocking
[01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:05.820]   Books that link to Amazon
[01:06:06.180 --> 01:06:10.100]   Seth Goden just don't want anything. They want programs inside of programs. Yeah
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:14.940]   He wrote a book called stop stealing dreams and stop stealing my book and
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:23.500]   And it has links within the book to Amazon and as a result Apple says we're not gonna sell it. Sorry. I
[01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:28.380]   Mean they have the right to do that it you can't say censorship, but it is a little
[01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:31.300]   Come on a little petty
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:39.020]   That one person chew gum everybody will chew and then the next thing you know every app's gonna have links outside of the apples
[01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:42.980]   environment what a horrible world that would be it would
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:46.580]   of gum
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:50.580]   People walking in the street
[01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:55.340]   I'm gonna write a new song right now as we speak all what a horrible world it would be
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:58.220]   What do you think I think you're gone to something?
[01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:00.860]   I'm encouraging it
[01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:07.060]   Bad people doing bad things companies making money talking about that say to myself
[01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:12.340]   What a crappy world I think making money is the key is the cue
[01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:19.060]   For an ad no, you're do you have to pee? No, I just got a big glass bathrooms down the street
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:24.540]   I'm I'm just wanted to check in on the Cal Stanford basketball game. This is their losing go right ahead
[01:07:24.540 --> 01:07:30.260]   I will be my guess while I talk about audible dot car. Oh, and this is my favorite company
[01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:36.500]   It is it is a great company. They're fantastic. They did what they should have done which is do what they did
[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:41.100]   That's what they should have done. No, I agree. It's interesting because I was an audible
[01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:46.700]   Subscriber back in 2000. It was kind of new. They didn't have a lot of stuff and what they were really missing was sci-fi
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:48.780]   I was very disappointed and they had no Stephen King
[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:54.340]   They like one Stephen King book, but I listened because I was a big book on tape listener and there was a lot more convenient
[01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:56.340]   They need a box of cassettes
[01:07:56.340 --> 01:08:00.540]   And man, I mean the talk about transformation a hundred thousand books now every Stephen King book
[01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:06.620]   Including the new one that just came out. They've just released the number one download right now is an old Stephen King book
[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:10.860]   Which has never been available in audio. I downloaded it the stand is out on audio

[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:52.020]   How about the Lorax? Have you seen that yet? I?
[01:08:52.780 --> 01:08:58.700]   Want to see this I'm a big dr. Seuss fan. It was his hundred eighth birthday two days ago on Friday
[01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:04.220]   So they got kids books and I mentioned they didn't have a lot of sci-fi when I joined man
[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:10.620]   They turned that around and they did it with in a way that I really admire they created an audible frontiers program and started recording on themselves
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:16.380]   They realized that a lot of sci-fi especially early sci-fi, you know, it was pulp pulp publishers
[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:20.660]   They weren't gonna get audiobooks. So they're just gonna have to do it themselves and so
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:24.220]   There's a hundred ninety-eight doctor who titles alone
[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:30.060]   Holy moly
[01:09:30.060 --> 01:09:32.060]   classic sci-fi
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:40.700]   422 classic sci-fi novels including a new edition of George Orwell's 1984 just in time the moon is a harsh mistress by Robert Heinlein
[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:42.700]   That was a great book
[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:45.900]   1259 contemporary titles in sci-fi
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:52.340]   I just finished this one 11 22 63 the Stephen King book. What a great book that was Craig Watson does an amazing job
[01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:54.740]   narrating that
[01:09:54.740 --> 01:10:00.660]   Right now reading clash of kings because of course the game of thrones miniseries is coming back and
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:07.380]   All of the game of thrones books are on here for the song of ice and fire and I really on something like this
[01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:12.380]   I I like to read the book first so I'm almost through with that just in time for HBO's
[01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:17.420]   Returning to the year 37 hours on that one. So look there's a lot of good choices in here
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:22.500]   I encourage you to give it a try audible books playback on almost any device. They've got a great Android app
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:29.420]   That's what I use to listen your whole library anything you've ever purchased from audible is on that app you download it and listen
[01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:35.420]   It's just fantastic. They have an iPhone app as well. They're also available on of course on your desktop
[01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:42.020]   Even like GPS devices kindles if they have audio capabilities they can play audible books audible.com
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:46.460]   Slash Twitter give it a try. I think you will like it. Do you listen to you as an audio books?
[01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:51.700]   Me no, I read books you read your reader you like paper. I'm you buy hardcover books
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:58.420]   I do I buy them I buy them from Amazon, but then I read them in hardcover. Yeah, what and what and what do you what are you reading right now?
[01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:03.980]   What do you like well right now? I'm reading Baratunde Thurston's book how to be black that's on audible and it's funny
[01:11:03.980 --> 01:11:05.980]   He narrates it. He does shut up
[01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:12.300]   Because I will listen to Baratunde Oh, and he's good. Well, let me play a little bit of this. He's I should I
[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:20.540]   Apologize Baratunde. Why am I not plugging your book for crying out loud? I love it when the authors themselves read their own books
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:26.580]   That's just that's that's the best. It's good when some authors. Yeah, I wouldn't say generally some authors are not
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:34.940]   Lucky I guess but for example, you got to read Tina Fey doing. Oh, yes, you can fantastic. Yes fantastic and there's a
[01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:38.020]   There's a book. Oh
[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:43.420]   Well, I can't remember. Oh well, we give we do my smart out of our ownable recommendations are kind of blurred
[01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:49.300]   Here's here's Baratunde reading how to be black just a table of American opportunity could be satisfied either
[01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:53.580]   Through a comprehensive program of economic and political empowerment
[01:11:53.580 --> 01:12:01.180]   She's smiling here his voice by extending the buying season for postage stamps featuring noteworthy black Americans by a factor of four
[01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:04.620]   Since the establishment of black history a month
[01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:08.740]   It's funny because here's a guy he could be angry right? I mean this is you know, he's talking
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:13.740]   He's it's political and he's such a sweetheart. He just feels you smile. Yeah. Yeah, well, I mean
[01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:19.940]   I think his humor is his way of getting I've seen him do very angry and impassioned
[01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:25.220]   Activist type videos when things are really you know a little too far gone to be funny
[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:27.900]   He's great, but he is one of the funniest dudes in the world
[01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:33.660]   Love baratunde well, we anytime he's out here. We have him on the show. Have you been on the show with him?
[01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:38.260]   No, I have not next time he's here. Okay. I'll dump this guy and we'll get there. Hey
[01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:47.020]   All right, John and Baratunde, how about that for a big shoe. I would make for a good tickle fight

[01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:12.720]   Fun of me
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:17.720]   Question yes, but I forgot what it was
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:22.920]   I have to feel for anybody who planned in the day on March 7th
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:30.400]   This is why you made a fuss about me saying he's not here to get me in the mindset to set me up with this bogus
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:34.160]   Situation you are so paranoid. Huh? I don't feel bogus
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:37.920]   Bogadins the new word
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:43.680]   But don't you feel bad for anybody who said oh March 7th? That'll be a great day will do the launch festival or whatever
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:47.720]   Yeah, like why combinator aren't they also doing their demo days on the 7 demo days?
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:53.680]   There's a number of product announcements, and it's like well, not everyone cares about Apple not everyone is invited
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:55.680]   But you're not gonna get any bit of the news
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:03.240]   Everyone's gonna get we are but you're never gonna get a bit of the news cycle that is owned by Apple for that entire day
[01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:09.520]   No, no, yeah, there are many many people I would even say the majority of people don't care
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:14.920]   How many inches of venture beat will be devoted to an iPad through several? Yes, I would say so
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:20.440]   I don't know we don't do inches. We do pixels inches and the pixels several several pixels
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:24.200]   This story. I don't know what what to make this from venture beat
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:28.520]   Maybe you can help us out Jolie Ben Popper writing apples tough talk backfires in
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:31.680]   negotiations for new streaming TV service
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:36.580]   You know if when it comes to content and internet smart TV
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:42.040]   Apple can talk as tough as they want to the content providers
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:48.280]   Still will love them more than Google because they are on the opposite side of the table from Google when it comes to things like
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:52.480]   Things like piracy and soba and Apple is still their best friend in the tech world
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:58.640]   Thanks to you know their early work on iTunes getting people to pay for digital music in the form of mp3s
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:06.480]   And that's my two cents about that the New York Post says Apple will or hopes to launch its streaming TV service a Netflix style
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:12.000]   I guess TV service by Christmas, but the problem is that they're really throwing their weight around
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:18.600]   Apple's negotiating stance according to the post is we decide the price we decide what content
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:24.320]   One media executive the media executives are coming out of these meetings pissed and that's how come there's a story about this
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:31.240]   They want everything for nothing says another media executive echoing similar tense negotiations Apple has had in the past
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:34.400]   Apple is look a little like Steve Jobs and some
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:39.200]   Maybe maybe maybe there's a little something it's the you know
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:44.480]   It's the it's the short cropped gray hair these people are used to holding all the chips when they're talking to
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:49.560]   Media or digital media types when they're talking to Hulu when they're talking to Roku when they're talking to Netflix
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:53.360]   They're the big guys in the room Apple is equally used to being the big guys in the room
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:58.360]   So I'm not surprised that everyone's leaving these negotiations pissed and feeling like they're not gonna get what they want
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:00.360]   You have to get all posturing anyway
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:06.640]   You really is you have to kiss Brian using the media you have to kiss Brian Roberts ass if you want Comcast to come along for the ride
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:13.160]   He's used to everybody kissing the ring, but me that Apple is also used to everybody kissing the ring. It's basically, you know two Titans
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:15.120]   fighting
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:19.840]   Apple's trying to get cable operators to work with it to improve their accessibility in the look of video services
[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:23.760]   You got to admit the cable guides the cable DVRs are awful
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:30.920]   They're terrible. Mm-hmm. And of course Apple's trying to improve these things. No wait when they say they're trying to improve it
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:34.480]   Does that mean they're trying to get more cable network content onto?
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:41.880]   No, they they want they want them to dump the cable boxes and and ship sleek Apple devices in their place
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:45.680]   That's not that's not gonna never this is a quote from the post they wanted
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:50.200]   They want to create the interface and they want to work with the cable guys to manage the bandwidth
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:56.360]   They'd like that right across the TV and broadband pipeline instead cable executives pretty much shut the door
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:00.600]   Referring to keep an apple at a safe distance from the lucrative
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:05.000]   150 billion dollar pay TV business. They're trying to protect it of course course
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:10.280]   So Comcast is launching its own streaming service, right
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:16.080]   Is it like HBO go I was actually I just know it's an hour this week and talk to the Roku CEO
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:18.400]   So I'm all on fire about what's going on with the cable
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:22.040]   I'm not been meeting wanting to meet with that guy and I keep he has a great story
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:27.480]   He just is a wonderful fellow to talk to you should talk with me. I'm gonna go down there. They're smart. Well, this yeah
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:34.920]   Normal they realize that normal people will pay $50 for a box that they can get shows on they won't pay for an Apple
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:40.600]   I've got Comcast I've got on demand and they've got this new thing stream picks and it's just exactly like Amazon stream
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:43.200]   In fact, it's pretty much all they all have the same movies Netflix Amazon
[01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:45.000]   Is it a is it pay per view or a subscription?
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.880]   It's a subscription so I go and they then they put it in the VOD and you go and you click it
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:51.080]   Oh, I want to watch that movie says no you have to subscribe
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:57.640]   And I just think that you're already giving this much money to Comcast and they now come back and say oh yeah
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:00.280]   That'll be more well. That's what HBO go is it's oh, yeah
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:05.540]   You can play this content on your internet TV if you've got a Comcast if you subscribe to HBO which is
[01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:07.760]   thinking but
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:12.560]   It's not as bad as what it was a couple years ago and it's not as good as it's gonna be a few years from now
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:18.640]   But we're in pain because we're evolving so so March 1st Google's new privacy policy launched
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:23.040]   Yeah, and the world came to an end sure did
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:30.520]   Not not I turned off my web history and that was all there was to that so I'm gonna I
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:33.200]   Don't even want to start this conversation
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:36.800]   I'm just gonna say it and you can all yell at me and tell me I'm okay. You're full of it
[01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:39.880]   Thank you. Well crap. Good. We just we can just move on
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:47.400]   I just you have a obscure opinion about this. Well, I think it's a contrarian opinion about it. I think Google
[01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:53.600]   Their new policy mainly said look we've got all these services. We've got YouTube Google Docs gmail Picasso
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:59.360]   We've got a bunch of stuff you guys are using in the past. We have an aggregated data from all those services starting March 1st
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:00.320]   We're gonna
[01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:06.360]   Here's the privacy policy. Please we beg of you read the damn privacy policy see what we do with our stuff
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:08.360]   And if you don't like it opt out
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:13.560]   They give you an opt out in fact more than that they give you a dashboard
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:15.740]   Here's what they say they're gonna do we use the information
[01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:23.080]   We collect from all of our services to provide maintain and improve them make sense to develop new services make sense
[01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:25.600]   I'm not sure what to protect Google and our users means
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:29.640]   But I think that's a back-hat and way of saying and if law enforcement asks we'll give it to them
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:31.680]   Yeah, and they do they have to
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:34.680]   America
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:40.020]   Everyone must turn their information to the police. It's the law. Okay. This is the this is the sentence it matters
[01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:44.360]   We also use this information to offer you tailored content
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:49.820]   Like giving you more relevant search results and ads that's it relevant. That's a nice
[01:20:49.820 --> 01:20:55.240]   Targeted ads and targeted search and search results with social. That's it
[01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:58.240]   They give you they all accurate
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:05.640]   Accurate well if you if you turn off the web, I don't know if you've noticed Jolie after you've turned off your web history
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:12.480]   But when you type something in Google and you get the pre the suggested web things it won't be as accurate
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:15.640]   One of the things it does here is if I search for
[01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:17.040]   Dolce Vita
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:22.200]   There's a restaurant here called Dolce Vita and one of the first things that pop up is Dolce Vita Houston
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:25.840]   If I turn off the web history and I unplug from my connection
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:30.680]   I don't get that type of that type of perfectly information. We don't collect the data
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:33.620]   You don't get the better search result, but they give you the option
[01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:38.920]   They give you google.com/dashboard they show you everything they know they give you a button to delete it
[01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:45.640]   To me, this is eminently fair and we've had this conversation before - do you how much a month do you pay for Google?
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:49.320]   Web search and Gmail and YouTube listen exactly someone has to pay for it
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:52.080]   It's the advertisers who need the data and okay
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:56.240]   Here's my question and this is not I'm not yelling anybody's an honest question I
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:02.400]   Bristle at the idea that people are looking at my information, but I'm using all these services for free
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.240]   I've put the information out there
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:06.240]   What really happens to me?
[01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:12.760]   When this data is used in an aggregated anonymized form. How does it actually hurt me other than ideologically?
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:18.720]   It's purely ideological or paranoid as far as I can tell because all it's doing is giving you targeted ads
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:24.520]   Which presumably you'd prefer to see the ads that have nothing to do with anything you're interested in most people tune out ads
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:29.600]   Anyhow, right most people there's some question whether targeted ads work any better than regular ads
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:36.800]   But if that's what they want us, I think it's bogus. I think this whole thing about Google has been I've another column you can check it out
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:39.320]   I
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:45.400]   Think this thing was just a lot of publicity about oh Google this Google that oh let's complain about Google and all the while
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:51.480]   Google has a subtext message that yeah, we're getting all this cool information and data about people behind their backs
[01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:54.640]   So they make more money. Yeah, and they really don't know shit. Yeah
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:23:04.120]   Hold up though y'all because we had another story on the sheet about oh how Google Plus is doing so poorly
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:10.160]   This okay this guess who is this guess who this is from by the way. It's the Wall Street Journal
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:12.160]   Which has been slamming Google from day one
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:19.520]   God bless them look I sit across the table from these people and I know what they're doing they are unifying all of Google the privacy
[01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:22.640]   Policies the social experiences all of it to make it more
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:28.000]   lucrative for them Google Plus is only part of that the privacy policy is part of that and
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:35.280]   And why is it so hard for people to realize that Google Plus isn't a social network and privacy policies have nothing to do with your personal information
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:37.640]   Google is making their money and really I mean
[01:23:37.640 --> 01:23:43.960]   I think Google's doing less with the information than Facebook is Facebook in fact does sell aggregated information to
[01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:47.160]   To I think Google would like to be able to do more with the information
[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:50.120]   But first they have a full lead it from all their different web services
[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:52.640]   Hence Google Plus hence the price you know
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:58.000]   I I'm not buying any of this because I all I know is you look up something like
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:05.680]   You know you need to get a microphone stand and for the next six months you're getting ads from Microsoft run stands
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:07.680]   Which aren't you already bought it either
[01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:14.080]   I was an accident right but beside the point they don't know anything they just know that I look for a microphone stand one
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:20.560]   So let's just time Amazon's worse when you go to the grocery store you get coupons based on what you buy and what people?
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:23.760]   Who bought what you bought will buy yes, you know in addition
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:28.400]   It was for example if you buy tampons and cat food and romance novels not say anything about my life
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:32.720]   But then you know and enough people do that and you go and buy cat food
[01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:37.000]   They'll give you a coupon for tampons, you know I was wrong with that you might want that I talked out
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.800]   What's wrong? Here's one interesting thing I talked to one of the guy
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:41.600]   This was like 15 years ago
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:46.000]   I talked to one of the guys who invented that little thing that used to kick out a coupon now
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.160]   They put print them on the back of it, but he says they first they sold coke on the idea
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:56.840]   So anyone walking through buying Pepsi would get a Coke thing and then they took that over to Pepsi says look what we're doing for coke
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:25:00.000]   Now if anyone buys coke, we'll give him a coupon for Pepsi
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.120]   So he's like playing both sides of the fence. He thought it was hilarious
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:08.480]   So really what you're what your position is and I think you're actually right for a change your position
[01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:14.000]   What your position is is that Google laugh is I know I go for everyone of them
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:19.200]   What Google's really doing is trying to cover up the fact that these targeted ads in fact are useless
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:22.000]   They're no better off than anybody else
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.640]   And so the whole thing is really a smoke screen
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:28.240]   I'm saying that we're gonna have another dot-com type bust
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:30.240]   Oh, we're gonna have one anyway
[01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:32.720]   These advertisers need to believe that these ads are effective
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:36.880]   We always do is put a dead pool out there. I guarantee within the next two or three years
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:43.280]   This is great. I need to keep my job, but I will tell you that we and we don't need to use targeting all we do is we have very narrow
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:50.080]   Focus with our content. Well, you're different because you have our ads are targeted and you have a different model than the typical website
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:54.080]   And if I know it works, so we wouldn't have these when all hell breaks loose
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:59.040]   I'll be here with my dog less shows and Angelina Jolie Odell
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:02.000]   So this is the one guy who has the right to sue
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:08.800]   He was uh taken he's a guy in france who was suing google for taking a picture of him peeing in his car
[01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:10.800]   Oh, yeah, I love this story. It's your story
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:18.720]   It's a valuable public resource. I say and I say it's great to know if this guy's peeing in his in his in his yard
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:22.400]   And you're have to visit him. You should know to stay on this on the stone step
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:28.480]   So you don't don't worry about stepping and pee his face valuable information is the google street view
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:34.480]   As car was going by at the very moment. He was relieving himself in his in his garden. You can't go into the backyard
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:37.040]   His face was blurred
[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:42.960]   Uh, they blurred his face, but they showed him peeing the town he lives in is small. So according to his lawyer. He became
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:45.680]   And of jane de liddicune
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:54.560]   Yeah, apparently he's been right righted as it were he's been outed by his neighbors give him crap
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:57.600]   You are
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:00.480]   I saw you on the googers
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:05.360]   Oh, I'm not eating your vegetables anymore. He's there
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:08.720]   No, thank you for the zucchini
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:13.920]   25 us anonymous members arrested internationally the hacker group retaliates
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:20.160]   By attempting to bring down sites and then giving up and going home, you know, uh, one of our
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:24.080]   Hacker writers was at our essay the security conference this week
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:30.640]   Where she heard and agreed with the idea that these guys shouldn't be arrested. They should be hired and rehabilitated
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:34.160]   There we go. What do you think of that?
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:40.400]   I think it's a terrible idea really to hire a hacker. No, I think that's what happens
[01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:43.600]   That's why you become a hacker because you're trying to get a job in security
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:45.920]   That's a good job. No
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:50.480]   I think that's you leo i'd look at it. I think just fits me somehow
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:57.440]   Well, then didn't didn't anonymous declare war on the united states. Yes, they're gonna bring the internet down at the end of the month
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:03.200]   Yeah, I shouldn't mock them because we're easier to bring down on the internet. They
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:09.760]   Down for a week when you're beginning phone calls from your uh advertisers saying hey leo, you know
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:13.680]   Are you still there? I'm with you men. I'm with you gentlemen
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:16.480]   Okay, just saying i'm wearing the mask
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:22.960]   I should do one of these videos you're mocking them. Where they uh, uh, electronic your voice and uh
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:26.160]   Uh, some kind of vague threat. So i'll pedal them
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:28.320]   our war
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:30.320]   The water infrastructure
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:31.760]   pedal
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:32.640]   Or
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:36.480]   All the turn off from friday from four to five p.m
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:40.240]   I have spoken
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:46.880]   So this is any idiot can buy one of these on amazon by the way for a buck 50 and make a video
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:50.720]   So that's the point is if you're anonymous, how do they know who you are?
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:57.200]   Because you're anonymous you're anonymous. That's right. It was nice knowing you leo says half the chat room
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:01.040]   Last time I did this we got hacked i admit
[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:03.840]   Uh, let's see
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:08.000]   Defense department wants more control over the internet. Okay. I'm moving on
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:12.320]   Uh, here's a good one from jolly o'del. I wrote something this week
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:15.840]   How roku is kicking the cable industry's butthox
[01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:19.360]   I put a headline that was my big
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:25.120]   That's a big deal. I peaked too soon really, but no, um, yeah, so as I said, but in the headline
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:30.000]   Yep, I got I got my kicks. So, uh, no, yeah, I did sit down with the roku ceo
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:34.240]   Lovely guy. We talked about uh, anthony would is that him?
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:41.520]   He's wearing suspenders. He wasn't when I spoke with him, but he does. I I assume he will what happened when you were speaking
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:43.840]   No, that was his thing. Sorry. Well
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:48.480]   A smile and an outfit that didn't include suspenders
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:55.680]   So, you know, we talked about his favorite shows and how his family watches tv. It looks like zero
[01:29:55.680 --> 01:30:04.240]   Look pretty good. That's a good hat for you. Yeah, a pilgrim with a short hat. Anyway, what is what is roku's plan?
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:06.960]   Because
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:13.760]   Ultimately, you know, she has a story to tell. I'm asking her question. I told it in 2020 words. I think
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:21.760]   What is that long? I mean I look at netflix for instance, which is really gonna be challenged going forward because the moose movie industry wants to kill
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:24.560]   Them everybody wants to kill them. Oh, I don't think they want to kill them
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:31.600]   I think they want to use them to continue making money in an era of rampant piracy and
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:37.600]   Rapidly changing consumption patterns. So the movie industry likes him, but Comcast wants to kill him. Amazon wants to kill him
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:46.880]   I don't know. Amazon wants to compete with them. Sure. I don't think Comcast wants to kill them because get this Comcast makes a higher profit margin by selling you internet service
[01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:52.480]   What? Use more of when you use Netflix than they make from cable. Oh, yeah. Yeah, man. Totally
[01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:55.440]   And I see that's something I didn't look for all the content on cable
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:31:01.200]   They have to pay for licensing that the boxes they they pay for most of the hardware and kind of sell it at cost
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:05.360]   They make the most money from internet. So they should what are them? Why are they why are they
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:11.440]   They are coming to the caps on they are coming to the table slowly because they're elderly
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:13.520]   Uh
[01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:15.520]   The Comcast come be there in a minute
[01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:19.680]   You're by the way, jolly. You're the only person on this panel who can say that word
[01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:24.480]   The elder leader you are with the elderly right now
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:32.960]   The institution is a little bit more entrenched and incumbent and it's harder for them to say oh, yeah, sure man
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:34.960]   We'll get with the times. We'll be here if you like that. So
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:39.920]   Uh, it's all changing. It's changing not as slowly as we like to complain
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:47.920]   But um, I think you know some of those pain points that were there when we started digitizing music are there when we're digitizing film and television
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:50.480]   Actually, if you think about a roku is best situated
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:56.960]   Because they don't care what the content is they just provide you basically their their business is we connect your tv to the
[01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:01.840]   internet their business I found out is rev sharing with the content creators
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:09.360]   Um, they're giving the content creators access. Yeah. Yeah, and it's working really well for everybody what they're focusing on next is smart tv's
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:16.320]   And how to create roku smart tv packet see that's the challenge because I have this samsung tv in here now
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:19.760]   With if I have that or a blu-ray player. I don't really need
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:25.440]   Uh roku, right because it's already iR&EM connected to the internet and all new tv's will be connected
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:31.520]   roku's product is better than than the smart tv on sam song or any of the others. I mean, it's I agree
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:37.120]   Sam's son is familiar. Yeah, it's uh, it's more reliable. I don't I don't know about yours, but my smart tv
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:42.400]   You know drops connection and sometimes doesn't have it's uh, you can't find the router
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:49.520]   And like roku though, you have to think about all the people who don't have smart tv's and who will pay $50 for
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:51.280]   I agree
[01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:54.960]   More more than what i'm saying, you know, what about people who have feature tv's?
[01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:59.280]   Well, these are the poor people with the dumb tv's they can just the feature phone said
[01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:04.800]   Yeah, no, I love roku. I've been recommending roku for years. This is an interesting website. You gave
[01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:08.400]   Way some roku's as gifts some years back two years ago
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:12.640]   We gave every host you got one every host of roku when we started putting a twit on roku
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:15.120]   by the way, we have now taken over the
[01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:19.680]   uh, hls stream for the roku the twit app and the roku we got to
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.680]   Houdini seven in our chat room, uh, krag millaney to rewrite the roku app
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:28.000]   It's fantastic and we have our own stream that we pay for now
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:33.840]   So I think our live stream on roku is in fact the best twit experience there is on the big screen. It's really fantastic
[01:33:33.840 --> 01:33:39.120]   Look at this. This is a third party database roku dash channels.com
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:42.960]   Of roku of things you can do on roku that you never knew
[01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:49.600]   There are a ton of you said what 4,000 there are 400 400 this has 654 pages
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:53.440]   Of private channels so it's far more
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:34:01.520]   Uh, there are all sorts of weird things on here. Did I say where did you get this playboy joustin tv playboy?
[01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:07.360]   Justin oh just and he's a 17 year old in de morn, Iowa. He's gonna show him something
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:13.120]   This is great if you have a roku this roku dash channels.com because some of these you have to know the magic
[01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:19.280]   Keyword or whatever there is what is 400 what this is this is roku dash channels like a third party
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:22.320]   Some of them are free some of them are private some of them are private
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:30.160]   Yep, so they stream. Oh, so all of this you can get via going into this channel 596 the sex channel free
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:36.000]   Free sex channel. Yeah, let's check it out. I wish I had a roku what could go wrong
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:42.560]   So these are all on roku people don't know about him roku does not publish these in their channel store
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:49.600]   You have to know the magic code to get there. I've got and this list 654 channels
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:52.160]   Is that amazing?
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:54.160]   I bet your suspender guy didn't tell you about that
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:57.440]   He wasn't wearing the no, he didn't he didn't
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:01.600]   She didn't go back. I think it's very interesting the roku's supporting all of these
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:06.560]   I mean that you you go through roku to do this. I think you're right. This is they there is something going on here
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:10.320]   And I don't know if you know there's something going on. Mr. Jones
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:13.360]   Uh, yahoo's
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:16.560]   Yahoo started its first season of scripted comedy programming
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:18.400]   Am I reading?
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:22.640]   I believe that this is a program about breast pumps. It must be the new ceo
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:28.000]   Um, yeah, yucking it up on yahoo. Oh, there's nothing funnier than breast pumps
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:33.520]   Ashley praiser and ricky lindholm was created by lindsey crystal
[01:35:33.520 --> 01:35:40.400]   Um, it's everybody's gonna do this. Uh, unfortunately it looks like yahoo's doing as bad a job with this as they do with everything else
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:43.200]   You know, there's a lot of these independent little seven eight minute programs
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:49.040]   There's like, I don't know dozens of them all producing hollywood by professionals who just don't happen to be working right now
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:55.680]   And some of this stuff is quite credible and very good. I love the guild the guild is one of my favorite things to watch on my computer
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:36:00.240]   I mean that doesn't who doesn't yeah felicia day's gonna be a guest on game on a couple of weeks. I think
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:05.520]   Yeah, if you see her will you tell her I love her. Oh, we tell I tell her that I said joe every time I see her
[01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:07.120]   I said joe Lee loves you
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:08.720]   Does she ever say anything back?
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:13.280]   She loves you too. No, she's great. Isn't she she's an inspiration. Yeah
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:20.880]   Uh, there are quite a few stars that are doing these little seven and absolutely very limn ratskob the woman who played cloey on
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:22.960]   24 has her own show
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:29.280]   The thing is I think people don't understand well produced when you work in hollywood. There's a lot of downtime
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:35.840]   Yeah, you work and you have the skill set to produce sky quality professional stuff even though it's on the internet and the truth is
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:40.880]   You know, you're making enough money. You probably don't need to work in that downtime that you know, but it's it's something that they do
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:44.320]   That's fun. Most of them don't make that much money a lot of them need to do it, but a lot of them don't
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:48.480]   Yeah, and it's just fun and it's a difference. I've talked to a few people who are in that
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:52.000]   You know, okay, I do the big screen and now i'm going to do the internet screen
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:58.320]   And they have so much more fun and it's a completely different structure and it all happens so fast and they just they really love the change of pace
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:36:59.840]   I think it's uh
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:04.800]   We're in a brave new world. Well, you know people also like to work with breast pumps though. I don't understand
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:09.680]   Well, it's funny. It's a hot subject. Yeah, I know I
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:11.920]   Bested humorous. I agree
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:14.720]   But that's because maybe we're not the target audience cringy
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:22.400]   People I want to thank what john. I said that's are you we done? We're done. Wow. I read I run through the entire
[01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:25.840]   You only did three commercials. You didn't do the fourth. We don't do four. Huh?
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:30.400]   We are not greedy contrary to what some would say about capitalist enterprises
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:36.160]   I do not go for the gold. I go for the silver. Well, the calberkeley bears lost
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:39.840]   They don't still be in the nc double a tournament, but now they won't be the top
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:43.440]   You know, it was a great. I know how how much the calberts mean to you and i really appreciate it
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:46.080]   I'm not i'm being sincere here. It was a great sacrifice to be here
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:49.680]   So I thank you for doing that. What is it sacrifice? Normally they play on saturday though, right?
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:51.680]   That's why you can normally be here
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:56.880]   Is that isn't college football? This is a basketball not football. Okay, never mind
[01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:00.480]   Sorry, i'm not following the ola pore sports show
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:02.800]   We won't see any this weekend sports
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:06.960]   Work is basketball on sundays. Yeah, they bounce the ball. I know i'm
[01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:13.600]   Dribbling. Yeah, I know about it. I've been doing it for years. So, uh, this is basketball all the time
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:20.400]   Yeah, 20 so every day every day of the year all year round is basketball because i understand college football was
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:22.240]   pronounced back a ball
[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:25.920]   Eggable it was easy with college football because it was saturday's but now this is confusing
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:29.040]   So it's all so we it's gonna be here miss whether we can get you in here
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:32.560]   You don't want me coming is that what you're saying brian wilson called he wants to
