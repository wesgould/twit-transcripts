[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080]   It's time for Twit this weekend tech. We have an amazing panel here. Brianna Wu, Phil
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.160]   Lib and Larry Maggot. We have so much to talk about. Of course, Apple's September 12th
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:17.320]   event, whether the new iPhone is worth something north of a thousand dollars, the new CEO at
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.900]   Uber, and how to run for Congress without lying. It's all coming up next.

[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.940]   It's time for Twit this weekend tech. Show where you cover the week's tech news. I like
[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:15.500]   to get together a diverse group, an interesting group of people, tech journalists, entrepreneurs,
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.980]   candidates for Congress. Every week we talk about stuff. Brianna Woe is back. It's great
[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.740]   to have her. She is both an entrepreneur, a founder of a giant space cat, which is of
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.340]   course an online as a gaming company. But running for Congress in the Massachusetts,
[00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.180]   I always get this wrong, which district? It's district.
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.580]   It's district eight. It's like an L from South Station over.
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.620]   BriannaWoe.2018.com. She's told us she also has 2022, 2020.
[00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.580]   Got a run for reelection. In fact, that's one of the problems. As soon as you get to Congress,
[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.580]   you're going to spend the rest of your time running to get in again.
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.980]   Yeah, the philosophy I'm going to have is I'm going to go there and I'm going to do the
[00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:08.980]   best job I can for the people I'm representing. I'm just going to go for broke. If I get
[00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.940]   reelected, I will. But I'm not going to go there and play this game where you think
[00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.460]   three times about everything you do. If it's going to help you get reelected, I just don't
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:21.900]   think you can do that with integrity.
[00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.100]   You're recording this, right, Leo? Yes.
[00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.100]   Okay.
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.900]   That's the journalist, Larry Magad from CBS News, right?
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.900]   I told you to that, Brianna. No, I made it. I absolutely made it.
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.900]   Yeah.
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.740]   And with us, the entrepreneur, the founder, the guy who put together Evernote, Phil Libben,
[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.820]   it's always great to see you. His new company, All Turtles is an incubator. What do you call
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.220]   it? Or a studio.
[00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.220]   Studio.
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.220]   An AI studio.
[00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.860]   For artificial intelligence applications. Coolio.
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.860]   Right, good.
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.100]   And you may not recognize Phil because he used to look like Mitch Miller with a black
[00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.060]   goatee and a few extra pounds. You look like 20 years. You look great.
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.460]   Thank you. You look great too.
[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.460]   Yeah.
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.220]   He's a good suck up.
[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.060]   So, yeah, no, I lost a little weight. I did because I'm doing what you did, which is
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.620]   fasting, intermittent fasting and...
[00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:13.620]   Oh, you're fasting.
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.620]   Intermittent fasting.
[00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.620]   I guess got back in time.
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.620]   I get to get back in time.
[00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.220]   You know what? I tell people I'm skipping meals.
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.220]   All fasting is intermittent.
[00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.220]   I'm skipping carbs.
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.220]   Unless you're dead.
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.780]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.660]   No, it's official.
[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.020]   And I want to pull the panel. Apple sent out invitations this week.
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.180]   Uncharacteristically early. Usually they wait until exactly a week before the event, but
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.860]   they announced on end of August that they would have an event. September 12th, 10 a.m.
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.900]   there's Jim Dowrymple's post course, Jim from the loop was invited. There's his invite.
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.180]   And if you read the invite, it says, what does it say? Let's meet at our place. And
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.100]   I think that's even the bigger story. And the only reason I want to go to this one is
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.860]   not the 10th anniversary iPhone. It's going to be the first event at the new Apple Park
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.380]   in the new Steve Jobs Theater.
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.100]   And we were speculating whether they'd be ready in time. Pretty exciting.
[00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.100]   Yep.
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.220]   At this spaceship, it's going to be this amazing structure.
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.420]   And in fact, if you look at the Steve Jobs Theater is separate, but it's kind of echoes.
[00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:16.140]   It's a circle of glass with the world's largest carbon fiber roof on top of it. But the event
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:24.780]   is actually, it's almost like an evil genius lab underground. So you go in this big circle
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.100]   and then there's two escalators there and then you go down into the Steve Jobs Theater,
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.660]   a thousand seat theater. Presumably this is where Apple was.
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.220]   Which is actually a smaller venue than they often use when they were.
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.460]   The built-in ram auditorium is about 50% bigger.
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.100]   But I think a thousand is enough. Remember, they want to have room not only for the press,
[00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.100]   but for Apple employees.
[00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.980]   Sure, because there's always a lot of applause. Press typically don't applaud.
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.060]   So you've been to every Apple event?
[00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.020]   Almost, almost everyone since 1984 or something.
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.740]   Do you sit on your hands during these things?
[00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.860]   I don't applaud. No. That what you mean? Do I applaud?
[00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.860]   No. I'm pressed.
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.220]   I don't have to sit on your hands.
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.220]   You just don't applaud.
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.900]   I would have to sit on my hands.
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.060]   I don't know where your position began.
[00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.060]   You applaud.
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.540]   Well, you're not a journalist.
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.540]   No.
[00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.220]   So in a way that's kind of freedom, I have to admit, I think, and I don't remember, but
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:20.660]   I'm guessing that in the original iPhone announcement 10 years ago, which was held at the big Muscone
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.660]   Web site.
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:22.660]   Yes, I would have seen.
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.860]   I wouldn't guess that I leapt to my feet when he announced that.
[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.860]   Because he was excited.
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.860]   It was pretty exciting.
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.860]   Wow.
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.860]   I wouldn't show applaud as president.
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.540]   Because it's just, it's like you're taking a side.
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.980]   If you're endorsing the person speaking as opposed to being there and being objective
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:34.980]   and just why.
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:35.980]   Because why you just don't know.
[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:36.980]   I just didn't know.
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.180]   It's just a tradition.
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.180]   Presto.
[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.580]   I mean, wait, there are exceptions.
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.460]   Sometimes you will applaud to be polite, not so much burning out.
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.220]   Like when Steve Jobs came on after the event.
[00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:46.300]   And he was definitely ill.
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.300]   I applaud him.
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.300]   He applauded.
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.300]   Then, of course.
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.300]   And everybody in the theater was their feet to work.
[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.940]   PVR, you know, so there's certain times he would applaud, but you wouldn't applaud an
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:56.500]   announcement because that would be, I don't know.
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.980]   You just, I'm not sure whether you're just starting.
[00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.660]   You're not, no, it's because you're objective.
[00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.660]   You should not applaud.
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.660]   You're there to take notes.
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:02.660]   Right.
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:03.660]   You're not there to cheer.
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.660]   Right.
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.420]   But, but not applauding is not being objective either.
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.420]   Because then you're visibly.
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.540]   They're not making any reaction at all.
[00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.180]   You're just simply taking notes, getting the information.
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.180]   Well, fine.
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.180]   So you're not throwing tomatoes either.
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.180]   No, you're not.
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:19.500]   Well, there's an interesting point there because in fact you are attending an Apple event.
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.660]   And you're signaling that you're not happy about it.
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:22.660]   You're interested in it.
[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.660]   No, it could be there.
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.860]   But when the camera like pans across the audience and there's a bunch of people not
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.700]   applauding, no one is like, oh, that's the press section.
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:30.260]   They're like, those people don't like it.
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.180]   I think Steve started this tradition probably in 1984 where they made a big to do about
[00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.180]   the release of the Macintosh.
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.180]   Remember he was in his boat time.
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.380]   Yeah, he pulled the Mac out of the bag.
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.380]   It's a hell-o.
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.380]   It's good to be out of this bag.
[00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:47.580]   And after I think Apple, primarily because Steve Jobs was a brilliant showman.
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.060]   Apple made a lot of this.
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:54.460]   But prior to that, I don't think companies had, they would be at Comdex.
[00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.780]   Bill Gates would give a keynote.
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.420]   They might mention new products.
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.420]   But they did not.
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:03.580]   This whole idea of a dog and pony circus started with Apple.
[00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:04.580]   Started with Apple.
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.580]   Started with Apple.
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.580]   Started with Steve.
[00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.580]   Yeah.
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.780]   And I remember I was at that event in 1984 showing my age here.
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.940]   And most of it, I remember the next event.
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.340]   You know, when next computer, when he introduced it next, and he just had this amazing way.
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.980]   I have, here's what I will say.
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.540]   Almost every time I'd walk out of a Steve Jobs keynote, I would walk out saying, "I've
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.980]   got to have that product."
[00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.980]   I can't wait to get my hands on that product.
[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:27.580]   And often I was disappointed.
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:28.580]   Often the product was not that great.
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.580]   They call it the reality distortion.
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.580]   I always thought my gut.
[00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.060]   And it was very real.
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:33.460]   It was very effective.
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.340]   And so when they would interview me immediately afterwards, because typically what I will
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:40.260]   do with these things, they'll do a radio or television interview immediately afterwards,
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.340]   I am always enthused, because I just heard this amazingly in through the astute speech.
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.340]   Yeah.
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:50.180]   And I have to work very hard at trying not to sound enthused, because Steve had that ability
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.660]   to get people to, and that's not true anymore.
[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.380]   I mean, Tim Cook's a great guy.
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.380]   He's not actually not.
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:56.380]   But he does not.
[00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.380]   He's not a leap to your feet and not sheer kind of.
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.380]   Not at all.
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.380]   Yeah.
[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:00.380]   You like him.
[00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.380]   Very likable.
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.180]   I met Steve Jobs for five minutes once at one of the events, and he pretended to know who
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.780]   I was, and it was like the greatest moment of my life.
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.580]   I know he didn't really know who I was.
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.180]   I have a far worse Steve Jobs story, but I'll let Brianna.
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:15.700]   If only had War Brianna, we should mention that we are in studio, the three guys, and
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:20.140]   War Brianna has to sit here on Skype, which is putting you at a disadvantage, and I apologize.
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:24.180]   So please don't hesitate to step all over us, and I will stop.
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.180]   All right.
[00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.180]   Yeah.
[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.180]   Yeah.
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.180]   No, I'm super excited about this.
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.020]   You know, this one, like I think the prototypes have come out for the, you know, the iPhone,
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.340]   I guess we're going to call it the eight.
[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.340]   I think we're going to bet.
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.340]   It's calling the eight.
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.340]   Everybody's saying?
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.340]   It's calling the eight.
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:38.340]   Everybody's 58.
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:39.940]   The prototypes just look amazing.
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:45.900]   I'm a little skeptical about getting rid of the home button, and the reason is this
[00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:50.860]   is terrible, but I measure what normal people are going to think about new technology by
[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.100]   watching my husband.
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.340]   He's a brilliant guy.
[00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:55.660]   He has a PhD in bacterial genetics.
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.020]   He's had a VIP for a major biotech company.
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:09:59.020]   But he's normal.
[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.020]   He cannot figure out tech at all.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.580]   He cannot update his iPhone.
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.420]   And I just, you know, you read about some of the things they've found in the, you know,
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.740]   the beta for swiping up to get to the home screen.
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:17.140]   And even the supposed feature about like, you know, scanning your face with like a connect
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:23.180]   technology to unlock it, I'm really skeptical about how normal people are going to react
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:24.180]   to that.
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.460]   I mean, we're not going to have any problems, but you know, you're getting rid of the major
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.420]   interface paradigm of the iPhone.
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.780]   But to be fair, most Android phones don't have home buttons.
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:34.780]   Not physical ones.
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:35.780]   They may have your search.
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:36.780]   Sam's very true.
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:41.780]   And so Eric's not undoable, but it does feel a little bit like getting rid of the headphone
[00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:42.780]   jack.
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.020]   It's a little more courage.
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.020]   Apple hates holes.
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.020]   Apple hates buttons.
[00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.500]   Like this has been clear for years.
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.740]   It's all moving in the same direction.
[00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:50.740]   Yes.
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.660]   Even system mouse should only have one button despite every bit of evidence.
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.100]   Otherwise, it's going to be great.
[00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:58.220]   Steve also didn't like on off with you to write.
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:10:59.220]   Yeah.
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.220]   He just wanted to work.
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.220]   Yeah.
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:02.220]   Me neither.
[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.020]   And also means you lose touch ID, the fingerprint sensor.
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.020]   Yeah.
[00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.020]   Although you could do this.
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.860]   What Google does is it puts them in the back.
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.900]   I mean, they're not going to do that.
[00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:11.900]   It's right there.
[00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:12.900]   They're not.
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:13.900]   Yeah.
[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:14.900]   I love it in my Nexus.
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:15.900]   It looks great.
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:16.900]   Very professional.
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:17.900]   So it's much better.
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:18.900]   I actually actually like it on the back.
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.540]   The only negative is on the table you have to put it on the table.
[00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.540]   Right.
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.100]   Or you know, when I drive, I velcro it to the dashboard.
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.340]   You can't reach the finger.
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:27.340]   I can't reach the back.
[00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.340]   Yeah, that's a problem.
[00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:29.900]   What are you worried about, Brianna?
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:33.740]   You know, like if it's in the dark, like, you know, they're going to change over the
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:38.700]   secure enclave chip to, you know, supposedly work with the front facing camera.
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.500]   And I just worry about how awkward that's going to be.
[00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.020]   Like if you're in a meeting, you know, you can kind of do it under the table.
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.020]   Here's my guess.
[00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.020]   Yeah.
[00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.020]   Hide it like that.
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.020]   Yeah.
[00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.020]   And this is based on rumor.
[00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:53.860]   Of course, we won't know really anything for sure until the 12th.
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.420]   But the, but the rumor is that this face recognition will work at any angle.
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:03.620]   So it's my guess that Apple wouldn't do this unless the face recognition was so good that
[00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.580]   it basically knows you're there.
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.580]   Yeah.
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.580]   So if it's under the table, it still sees you.
[00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:11.420]   If it's on the table, if you can see the phone, it can see you, right?
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:16.020]   And if the facial recognition is fast, it will unlock the minute it sees you.
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.420]   So my guess is that this, that's how this will.
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.180]   I turned it off on this laptop.
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.180]   This is a laptop window.
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.940]   But that's so bad.
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.580]   It actually, I just turned it off.
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.060]   It's the most faster to type in my phone.
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:29.500]   Also a question of how long before somebody breaks it cracks it.
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.940]   We mean with a photograph or something.
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:31.940]   Yeah.
[00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:36.660]   I mean, the Samsung Galaxy S8 face recognition was defeated by the Chaos Computer Club.
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.540]   They showed how you could take a picture of somebody, not with a telephoto.
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:43.500]   And what they did, which was interesting is they put, they projected the picture onto
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:50.860]   a curved piece of paper to give it the Z axis to give it three dimensionality.
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:51.860]   And that fooled the S8.
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.620]   Why can't it look for a blink or some kind of movement?
[00:12:54.620 --> 00:13:01.680]   But don't you think Apple would not abandon the touch ID, which by the way, it's not merely
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.900]   unlocking the phone.
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.900]   Their Apple pay relies on this for security.
[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.160]   Their secure enclave needs to be unlocked by this.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.620]   This is a big deal to the point where if you get a third party to fix your iPhone in it,
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:16.780]   they immediately disable the touch ID because they say, well, we can't be sure it's still
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:17.780]   secure.
[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:22.540]   So I don't think they replace this unless they have something that they feel very confident
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:27.940]   is as fast, if not faster, and for that reason, I'm confident that it will recognize you as
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.940]   soon as you can see the phone, it will see you.
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.740]   But then what about that issue if it's dark?
[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.780]   I mean, it will have a red.
[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:38.020]   Yeah, it'll have a, we know that.
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.500]   We think we know that theoretically possible that it could still do touch ID at some point
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.500]   through the screen.
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.500]   Yeah.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.700]   Yeah, the rumor was Apple was the kind to get that to work and never did get it to work
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:47.700]   effectively.
[00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:48.700]   It's very, if you think about it, very difficult.
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.100]   I couldn't the camera do it.
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.100]   It's too touch ID.
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.460]   Theoretically possible, they could still have something like that.
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:59.860]   But I think, yeah, I doubt they would release it unless it's actually a pretty good experience.
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.220]   Here's Apple's bet is you will like face recognition so much.
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:07.340]   It will be so good and so convenient that you will never again say, where's the fingerprint
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:08.340]   reader?
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:12.780]   And it will make every other phone, including apparently there's 7S and there's 7S plus
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:13.780]   obsolete immediately.
[00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:14.780]   Yeah.
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:15.780]   That's the thing.
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.780]   I'm going to spend $1,200 or whatever the thing's going to cost.
[00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:19.780]   Fingerprint readers have been around.
[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.980]   It also makes a lot of sense with ARKit.
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:28.340]   I was really amazed with how little press this got coming out of the State of Union at WWDC
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.340]   this year.
[00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:34.140]   If Apple, we're going to talk about it later in the show, but they have some really, really
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:39.540]   fascinating ARKit demonstrations, like things like virtual tape measures you can just move
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:40.540]   around.
[00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:46.860]   So, like Apple's iPhone having infrared built into it to specifically sense depth, that
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:51.660]   makes a lot of sense with ARKit because that's the problem.
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:57.620]   You could see it in the demo and the little Lego Batman mobile would stutter a little bit
[00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:02.020]   because it couldn't quite detect the depth as fast as it was moving.
[00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:06.100]   So it makes sense as a bigger move with Apple.
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:11.260]   And I agree with you that I don't think they would bring it to their flagship product if
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.460]   it didn't work.
[00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:16.980]   I just, you know, it's one of the things where we need to see it to evaluate it before we
[00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:17.980]   really believe in it.
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.620]   Well, Phil, you were saying fingerprint has been around for a long time.
[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:25.940]   It's been around since the 90s and it always sucked until it came out and whatever the iPhone
[00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:26.940]   is.
[00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:27.940]   It's a good one, that's a good one.
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:28.940]   And then everybody followed.
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:29.940]   I mean, it's very good now on everything.
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:30.940]   Yeah.
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:32.980]   Face recognition has been around since the 90s and it's always sucked.
[00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:36.140]   I had it on a think pad back when that was still IBM.
[00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.860]   It was terrible.
[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.980]   And with Apple releases it, it's going to be the first time that it's going to be good.
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.860]   And then it'll be good everywhere.
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.740]   That was always this, you know, the kind of the story about Apple.
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.100]   Yeah, that story is still true.
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.100]   Yeah.
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:52.100]   That they're still going to be, if they do it, it'll be great.
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:57.020]   I think on like a mainstream product, it doesn't mean that they won't release like other products
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.220]   that may still not be great.
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.300]   You don't miss your head phone, Jack.
[00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.260]   No, I do.
[00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.540]   But I haven't had fun.
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.460]   I hear from a lot of people who miss.
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.660]   I am not convinced that was a good idea.
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.180]   Apple sold more iPhone 7 than any other iPhone.
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:14.620]   The AirPods are pretty great.
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:15.620]   Those headphones.
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.460]   Yeah, but they're 159 bucks.
[00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:18.460]   They're hard to get.
[00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.460]   You can lose them.
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:20.460]   You can lose them.
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:24.380]   And I mean, it's not a substitute for wired headphones.
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:28.020]   The AirPods are going to seem like a bargain when you wind up paying $1,200 to the phone.
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.420]   Oh, will it be that expensive?
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:31.420]   Can it be that expensive?
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.420]   Yeah, that's crazy.
[00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:35.420]   I mean, I'm not saying they won't do it, but it seems crazy right now.
[00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:39.540]   It wouldn't be a bad thing to give themselves a freedom to have a really high priced item.
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:43.980]   It's not high priced because of gold or ceramic or something stupid, but actually high priced
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:44.980]   components.
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:45.980]   That's what I've been saying.
[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:46.980]   I would like to see them in 7.
[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:47.980]   That's why they do 7S.
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:52.580]   That's what I've been saying Apple should do is say, look, price isn't even a consideration.
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:56.060]   We're just going to make the best phone we can make.
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.460]   And we'll charge you a fair price for it based on what it costs.
[00:16:58.460 --> 00:16:59.460]   It's a Tesla strategy.
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.460]   Yeah.
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.460]   It's a Tesla master plan.
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.460]   Yeah, it's actually the Mac strategy.
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:04.700]   That's what Steve Jobs said when the Mac came out.
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.900]   You know, people could have said, in fact, wasn't it was the Mac or somebody?
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.860]   No, it was a Jeff Raskin who was the late Jeff Raskin criticized.
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:12.860]   He wanted to make it the Mac.
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:13.860]   He could cheat richly.
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:14.860]   He's not the average.
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:15.860]   A people's company.
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:19.580]   And I remember Jobs saying, look, you know, we have BMWs and Mercedes, and then we got
[00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:23.620]   Pinto's and Novas and in their different market segments.
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:25.380]   He wanted to be in the BMW business.
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.740]   I actually think this is different.
[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:27.740]   This is Tesla.
[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.740]   It's like Mercedes is a luxury brand.
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:30.740]   Yeah.
[00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:35.500]   The Tesla explicit world domination plan is you're going to make something expensive because
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:40.460]   that's where that's how you get the freedom to put in the technology that you want.
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:43.940]   And then you relentlessly going to make new products using those technologies that drive
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:45.940]   the price down increasing the experience.
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.340]   So Model 3 is probably a better car than the Model S at one third of the price.
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:55.100]   Speaking of that, I went to my Tesla dealer the other day to ask when my Model 3 was
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.100]   going to be ready.
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.100]   He didn't know.
[00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:58.100]   And he tried to sell me a Model S.
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.100]   Really?
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.100]   He really was pushing it.
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.460]   I'm thinking, wow, first of all, why are you pushing it?
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.460]   I'm thinking, why?
[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:04.820]   Why are you talking to a Tesla dealer?
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.140]   The whole point is you don't have to ever drive the humans.
[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.140]   I was curious.
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.140]   There's one in my neighborhood.
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.220]   I was curious if he knew when my Model 3 would be ready.
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.220]   That's your mistake.
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.900]   Anyway, the point with these ends, he did this hard sell.
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.660]   And they said, you know, if you lease it, it's actually going to be cheaper to lease
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.180]   to Model S in the Model 3.
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.940]   And he did this whole hard sell.
[00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:19.940]   Which means--
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.940]   I would just ignore anything coming out of a car dealer person.
[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:23.340]   Well, no.
[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.780]   I want the Model S. I'd rather have a Model 3 than a Model S.
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.500]   I know that sounds weird because the Model S is going to be higher luxury.
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.500]   Yeah.
[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.980]   But there'll be something cool about being one of the first people to have a Model 3.
[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.220]   The gold Apple watch was stupid luxury.
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.980]   That was expensive because it was old.
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:37.980]   That was dumb.
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:38.980]   If they come out with a new phone--
[00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:42.700]   I have a ceramic Apple watch, which is slightly less dumb.
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:43.700]   Still dumb.
[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:44.700]   Thank you very much.
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:45.700]   I wanted to show you.
[00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:48.860]   I wanted it because I wanted this ceramic, but you're right, it's $1,200.
[00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.420]   This is the current edition.
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.700]   But if the iPhone 8 is really 1,000 bucks or 1,200 bucks, not because of like fancy
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:57.380]   materials, but because that's the Model S. That's the first version that's expensive
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:01.900]   so they can try new technology so that a year later it becomes $600.
[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:02.900]   That's great.
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:03.900]   Right.
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:04.900]   It's a virtual ring.
[00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:05.900]   I think that--
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:06.900]   Go ahead.
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.900]   Sorry, go ahead.
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:08.900]   I was just going to ask you how much your husband would pay.
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:10.900]   My husband would pay nothing.
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:15.340]   He keeps the same phone until he drops it or breaks it or it runs out of his face and
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:16.860]   he needs a new one.
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:17.860]   He's not.
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:22.100]   He's-- Frank takes out the garbage and I take care of our techniques.
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:25.020]   So how much would you pay?
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.020]   I'm going to get the best Model.
[00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:31.860]   You know, something for me is I have the six--
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:38.620]   the seven plus and you know, I use it as my main campaign device and it's found so much
[00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:44.420]   time resting on my finger, you know, this pinky finger down there that you do end up
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:47.140]   getting like hand cramps from using it that much.
[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:52.500]   So if it's a fraction of a, you know, an ounce lighter, that's something that's really
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.420]   going to increase usability for me.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:59.140]   Yeah, I was also really interested in the jet black iPhone.
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:03.660]   It didn't bother me that it scratched a bit because I think that's the life of a phone.
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:07.020]   Yeah, I really love that material and the shine.
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:13.020]   So I personally don't have a problem paying more for it, but it's hard to not have a bit
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:19.860]   of a cynical attitude about it because Apple's best quarter really hasn't been repeated since,
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:25.260]   you know, they released the iPhone in China and really had that just explosion in sales.
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:29.820]   And I think they've got to find a place where they can get a lot of profitability again.
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:34.180]   You know, in almost every product line, there is this love, this marginal return.
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:38.260]   So I'm a bicycle guy and I know that I haven't bought a bike lately.
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.740]   Now I think they're like Calist 10 grand for the really good bikes.
[00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:45.940]   But the last time I bought a bike, you could buy a crappy bike for $200, the decent bike
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:51.140]   for $500, the good bike for $1,000 and then at about $1,500 you could buy a really good
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.140]   bike.
[00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:53.660]   It's still not a great, great, great bike.
[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.460]   And so I went towards, I think I spent $1,500 in back.
[00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.020]   That's probably about a $3,000 bike today.
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:05.420]   But my point is that what you get for that is marginally better than what you get for
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.020]   the one that's quite a bit less expensive.
[00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:10.780]   And that's true with almost cameras, it's true with cars, almost every product line.
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:15.660]   But I could easily see why somebody like Brianna who is using that iPhone, it's her lifeline.
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:22.100]   I mean, when you think about one of your getting over a period of two years, for something
[00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:24.300]   that you're using many hours a day.
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:30.100]   And let's not forget, you spend more than that over a year on cell phone connectivity.
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:31.100]   Oh, much than $1,000.
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.100]   You're easy.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.100]   Yeah.
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:34.100]   Yeah.
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:35.100]   Yeah.
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.620]   But and yet it's, I think I certainly do with size too.
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:42.740]   If you spend $2,000 on a desktop computer that doesn't feel outrageous, but you spend $2,000
[00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:46.580]   or something this small, it's like, what?
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.500]   That seems a little expensive, but it isn't.
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.100]   If you think about it, I don't think I agree with you, Brianna.
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.100]   I got the jet black and I'm a sucker.
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:57.620]   I feel a little bit like a sucker though.
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:01.180]   The iPhone is the product that I use most period.
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.620]   It is your number one computer.
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:03.620]   Absolutely.
[00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:04.620]   Not just computer.
[00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.620]   It's everything.
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:06.620]   The thing I use more than anything else.
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:07.620]   That's true.
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:08.620]   Period.
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:13.260]   In a way, that's what we're seeing is the realization among consumers that this is the
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.340]   most important product, tech product you're going to buy and maybe product.
[00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.340]   But it's also true.
[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.980]   So it's worth $1,200.
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:19.980]   How much more could it be?
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:20.980]   About $1,500?
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.580]   I mean, here's a different way of thinking about it.
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:25.820]   What if it was $5,000?
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.300]   But it wasn't too much.
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:28.740]   But it was just too much.
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.240]   But what if it was $5,000?
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.300]   But it was the kind of product where somebody who wanted to pay $5,000 would be amazingly
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:38.020]   happy to have.
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:41.100]   Then they can work down that same functionality and they could work it in subsequent months
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.420]   and subsequent years into more accessible products.
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:46.260]   It's not going to be $5,000 or $1,200.
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:53.060]   But this idea that let's make something that lets us innovate, that actually is at a price
[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:57.300]   point where you can work on technology, and the people who are happy to pay it pay it,
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.140]   I think that's great.
[00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.500]   The cell phone industry has been kind of in a rut with hardware.
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.100]   There's been only incremental improvements.
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.660]   I think it would really help the entire industry if Apple were to take a pretty big job,
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:10.780]   say this is $1,000, just $1,200, a lot of people are going to complain.
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:11.780]   That's fine.
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:12.780]   That's not the only phone they have.
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:17.700]   But actually make a product that people who can't afford to pay it are happy to do it
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.180]   and then have everyone benefit in the subject here.
[00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:22.860]   The other thing is that all of these Chinese Android makers are going to look at whatever
[00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:26.700]   it is and they're going to do their best to get something that's as close as possible
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:30.380]   in quality at a price that people can't afford because that's their market.
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:31.380]   I think this is a Tesla strategy.
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:36.260]   I think the world is much improved because Elon came out with a Model S. The world is
[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:37.980]   better because the Model S came out.
[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:42.100]   Well, if it weren't for Leo and others spending a lot of money on Model S as a Model S,
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:45.700]   he wouldn't be buying a car that I can afford.
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:47.900]   That was Elon's explicit strategy.
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.060]   Explicit, never exactly.
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.460]   I think that's a thing to be proud of.
[00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:53.540]   It's like a good strategy.
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.300]   So what is...
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:59.500]   I mean, remembering, of course, there are many, many people for whom a $500 phone is
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.500]   to expensive.
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.740]   I talk to people all the time when I say, "I want a $200 smartphone."
[00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.340]   And you can actually get a very good Motorola G or E.
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:06.340]   Absolutely.
[00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:08.340]   Let's find a free smartphone or anything.
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.340]   Or even free.
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:10.340]   You get an iPhone for free if you sign up for it.
[00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:11.900]   But I'm subsidized.
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.940]   You can buy a pretty decent Android phone.
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:14.940]   Yeah, outright.
[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:15.940]   And they're going to work just fine.
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:20.500]   So this is already acknowledging that this is for a different kind of person.
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.860]   Somebody for whom, A, they have enough money to do this.
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:26.060]   And B, technology is so important in their lives that they want.
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.260]   They're willing to spend a significant amount of money for it.
[00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:32.660]   And for professional tools, like, you know, these microphones are not the cheapest microphones
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:33.660]   you could have bought.
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:34.660]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.660]   Yeah.
[00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:36.960]   And if it's important, it actually would be foolish for me to choose the microphone based
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:37.960]   on price.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:38.960]   Right.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.720]   And for years, it's kind of a big part of the overall product.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:43.720]   Right.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:44.720]   Yeah.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.720]   So yeah, you're right.
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.400]   And people buy Adobe Photoshop for $800.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.400]   It's just bits.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.840]   But because they use it, this is what--
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.920]   There's also the prestige factor for some people having seen among the first to have the
[00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.360]   coolest iPhone people pay attention to that.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.800]   So what is the most Apple could read?
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.720]   I think remembering, by the way, that there's a starting price, which is the price they'll
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.720]   quote.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.280]   But that will be for the 64 gig or the lowest memory.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.440]   I guess the number is what--
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:13.480]   It'll be 64, 256, and 512, something like that.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:17.440]   You could presume that they're going to-- for 400 bucks more than the starting price would
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:20.440]   be the top of the line, which some of you people will buy.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.560]   I mean, I pay top of the line MacBook.
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.080]   I forget which one I have.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.800]   But I think I probably spent about 3K on it.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.080]   I kind of got to load it up MacBook.
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:34.320]   I call them the-- a friend of mine and I have this thing-- we call it the hot dog version.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.320]   It's one with everything.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.320]   So when the new MacBook came out--
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.320]   I said it.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.960]   And one of their-- it's about $3,000.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:43.440]   I used my MacBook three or four times a week.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.840]   I used my iPhone 30 times a day.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.320]   I'd pay as much for a really great iPhone as I would for a MacBook.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.320]   Yeah, it would.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.320]   Like if there was a product that they would sell me--
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.320]   Oh, I don't have enough money.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.320]   I would pay it.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.320]   Now, it would have to be worth it.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.320]   It would have to have whole graphic sections.
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.080]   I do think a difference is--
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.200]   I don't know what it would have to have.
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.680]   But if they came out with something, I would pay it that much.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:08.560]   I think a difference is your MacBook, like, you know, I'm the exact same way.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:13.600]   Like I spent for my 2012 MacBook, I bought top of the line, $3,500.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.600]   Don't regret it at all.
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.040]   It's been a great video machine.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:17.400]   I've done 3D work on it.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.680]   I've done Unreal.
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.680]   It's amazing.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:25.080]   But the difference is, you know, if that MacBook gets a little scratched up on the outside,
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.360]   it doesn't affect its use.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:33.440]   I don't think I'm the only person that can't go like more than a year tops without getting
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.400]   a scratch in my phone screen.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.040]   So I think that that's a really big difference.
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:44.200]   So if it's charged that much more, you know, I don't have a problem with it.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:50.480]   And I definitely-- this last time, I tried getting the version with the most, you know,
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.680]   storage possible.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:55.840]   And I really, really enjoyed that freedom and I'm going to do it again.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:01.520]   But I think the difference is, if you really use an iPhone day to day, I don't think they
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:06.120]   can last like more than a year or two tops before they get damaged.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.320]   So you have to figure that out.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.320]   But I want to put it--
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.320]   That's right.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.320]   So I have a lot of Apple products.
[00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:13.560]   I've got an iPhone, I've got a MacBook Air.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:18.200]   But at the moment, I have with me, and these are the things I carry out with my Android
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.680]   phone and my Hewlett Packard laptop, because I really like them.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.400]   These new and you look back at the laptops, it's a new company.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.800]   And try doing this year, Mac Pack, you know, try doing that.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:27.800]   I don't agree with that.
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:28.800]   Don't.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:29.800]   Don't do that at home, kids.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.800]   But if you're listening, you just bent this.
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:32.800]   You just bent it, yeah.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:33.800]   You just bent it, yeah.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:34.800]   But the screen all the way around.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:35.800]   But you know, I'll try using yours.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:40.280]   But I mean, my point is that Apple-- now, two years ago, I wouldn't be caught dead with
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.720]   a Windows laptop because they were pretty crappy.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.360]   There were no good ones.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.360]   Now there are phenomenons.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:50.960]   But you know if Apple says $1,200 starting price, there will be a howl of rage, right?
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.960]   Well, you know, if Apple--
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:52.960]   If Apple companies--
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:53.960]   It's not a tax increase.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:54.960]   So they don't have to buy one.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:55.960]   They can do whatever they want.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:56.960]   You know?
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:58.560]   Obviously, they could charge $2,000.
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.160]   But remember what people said with the gold Apple watch?
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.080]   It would be a howl of rage with people who can't buy it.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.720]   Oh, the gold app can't get it into it.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.560]   You know what I loved about the gold app watch?
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:10.280]   As a radio guy, I could go on the radio and say, can you imagine some people are going
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.280]   to say, how much was it?
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.280]   $17,000.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:16.440]   $17,000 on a piece of technology that can be obsolete within a year.
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:22.400]   I mean, it was so great to make fun of it because it was just absurd.
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.400]   But--
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:27.160]   But you do have to ask yourself, what kind of company would make a product like that?
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.840]   A technology company, obviously, a Swiss watchmaker would.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:30.840]   Sure.
[00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:31.840]   Well, they wouldn't be obsolete in the year.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:34.840]   The gold Apple watch was, for me, like the weirdest misstep.
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:35.840]   I don't get it.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:36.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:37.840]   How many did they sell?
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:38.840]   I don't know.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:39.840]   Probably a lot.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.840]   But it's the only Apple product in a recent memory where I just like--
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.960]   Well, if I saw somebody wearing one, I would have--
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.280]   My impression of them would have gone down because why would you--
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:48.920]   Not because they bought an expensive watch.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.160]   If they had a Rolex, it cost $20,000, fine.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.160]   Because that's going to be a lifetime investment.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.160]   But why would you invest $18,000 on something like that?
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.800]   I know some people that wear the gold Apple watch.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.800]   And yeah, I kind of giggle.
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:01.800]   Let me see it.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.800]   You know what's different, though?
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:09.920]   If you could buy an iPhone that did everything this new imaginary Godphone could do for $20
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.280]   as you can with a watch, by the way.
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.280]   You could buy a Timex.
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.280]   And it works just fine.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.280]   So that would be a big deal then.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:20.360]   Then you'd say Apple's charging a premium because of the brand, because of the name, because
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.160]   of styling, not because of product.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:28.440]   But this is technology, and it remains to be seen, but presumably technologically going
[00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.760]   to be in advance.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:34.960]   It's hard to imagine what kind of advance you could do in this era of peak smartphone.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.400]   And it would be that much better, though.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:38.760]   Maybe is it a camera?
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.480]   Is it augmented reality?
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:44.320]   Is it-- I mean, is it going to be that much better?
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.400]   And there will be plenty of people very happily buying iPhone 7s.
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.840]   No, by the way, and that was, I think, very true with the last several iPhones.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.520]   And when I looked at the iPhone 7, I said, OK, this is nice.
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.520]   It's very incremental.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.280]   It'll take six to success to seven.
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.880]   It'll take them two weeks to create a catch up.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.360]   I mean, nothing blew me away.
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.360]   Oh, look at what's saying.
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.880]   They went from the S8 to the Note 8 with tiny differences.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.880]   Right.
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:07.880]   And $100.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:10.200]   Oh, the Note is actually not necessarily an upgrade.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.360]   It's a different type of phone.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.360]   It's got a pen.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.360]   It's got different cameras.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.360]   It's got a little bit bigger.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.360]   It's got six point.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.360]   It doesn't explode as often.
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.360]   It doesn't explode as often.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.360]   That's true.
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:24.840]   I think what people really want to see from Apple is a battery that will charge faster.
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:30.440]   I think it's so interesting what Anker is doing with their battery products.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:35.280]   I bought a host of them lately, and you can plug your iPhone into their official-- they've
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:40.880]   got some name for it, IQ3 or whatever, but it does charge much faster because they figured
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:45.000]   out that the charging-- they can't change batteries because you can't cram more electrons
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.880]   in there, but they can make it charge faster.
[00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:52.000]   I think that's the biggest pain point that everyone has right now.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.600]   The screen is solid.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:54.600]   It's fast enough.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.000]   The camera is amazing.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.600]   I love the depth for my iPhone 7 Plus.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.120]   I think that's amazing.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:07.120]   What I want to see them do is to really solve this battery charging thing.
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.840]   You can do it from two ways.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:13.080]   I've seen experimental materials at MIT.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:17.720]   They're both superconductive and super capacitive at the same time.
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:23.400]   If you can make the battery charge instantly, then you can get by with not having as large
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.400]   a reservoir.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:30.080]   But I think if you're really asking what the average consumer wants, I think that's it.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.440]   Apple doesn't make products for the average consumer, though.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.440]   That's true.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:37.200]   However, I have to say the iPhone is the best battery life of any of the flagship phones
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.200]   out of every iPhone.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:44.040]   But the iPhones are-- especially some of the less expensive models you see kids with them.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.040]   You see average folks with iPhones.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.480]   At the point-- What was the study?
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.600]   We just saw 75% of teenagers have iPhones.
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.600]   75%.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:54.600]   They may have made it.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:55.600]   There's SEs.
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:56.960]   There's less expensive iPhones out there.
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.600]   But Apple really owns Mindshare, if nothing else.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.120]   No, I think the iPhone has become a consumer.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.120]   At least in the US.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.360]   By the way, that's unique to the US.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.360]   I think you're right.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.040]   And remember, the pixels are $600 and $1.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:10.680]   So the Apple's up there on the Samsung.
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:16.000]   Remember the holy hell that was raised when Google dared to charge?
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.040]   Going rates for its flagship phone?
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.880]   Because the Nexus used to be cheaper.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:20.880]   Right.
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.880]   Because they used to be really a reference design.
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.200]   They were there to stimulate other companies.
[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.200]   Price?
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:30.560]   I think what you're-- everything you've said so far, all of you, is logical.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.800]   But something about price is a hot button.
[00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:36.040]   It's very visceral for people.
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:37.200]   It's very emotional.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.840]   And people will get angry about this price I guarantee you.
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:42.440]   I think what people need is something to get angry about.
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:44.440]   You actually have to pull it.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.440]   Instead of everyone.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.440]   That's human.
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.440]   Instead of yelling at our politicians, we yell at Apple.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.440]   You're going to yell at Apple about something?
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.440]   Maybe it's getting rid of the headphone jack.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:53.440]   Maybe it's surprise.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.440]   There's got to be something that people are going to get angry about.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.440]   Prices can be in.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:01.320]   Well, as Leo and I have both experienced being tech journalists, people get incredibly emotional
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.640]   about their technology.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:07.320]   I have gotten literally hate mail from people because they thought I didn't like their
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.000]   favorite operating system.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.360]   Whether it was Windows or IBM OS2 or Mac OS.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.520]   The fact is I'm actually fairly ambendosterous.
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.680]   I actually don't really care.
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:21.240]   I'm critical and supportive of all operating systems.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:24.340]   But there are people who think I'm in Apple's camp and others who think I'm in Windows
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:25.340]   camp.
[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:26.340]   And they send me hate mail.
[00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.360]   It's a little religious.
[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.480]   Segment Freud, quite a term for it.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.480]   Did you know this?
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:38.200]   The narcissism of small differences.
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:42.800]   Really that communities with adjoining territories and close relationships that engage in constant
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:48.760]   feuds and mutual ridicule because to hypersensitivity of details of differentiation.
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.760]   This is a human condition.
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:51.760]   This is a human condition.
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:52.840]   And it is always true.
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:56.160]   The most bitter battles are fought over the smallest differences.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.160]   No, I'm serious.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.000]   I've gotten death threats over minor changes.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   Never know.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   Death threats.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   All the time.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   Death threats.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   Like handwritten and delivered on paper like to my house.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Wow.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   Wow.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   Super creepy.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.280]   Either one passionate customer is right, but not that passionate.
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.880]   You hope that that's just, they don't act on it.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:17.460]   They're just thinking these things.
[00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:18.460]   Yeah.
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:19.460]   Well, it's creepy.
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:20.760]   And yeah, it's small stuff.
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.760]   Yeah.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.760]   The smaller the potatoes, the bigger the french fries.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:23.760]   Yeah.
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:28.840]   But remember the bumper sticker thing with the Windows 2000 is equals Mac 94 or something like that.
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:29.840]   Bumper's not.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.600]   We've been watching this for decades.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:36.440]   But in the answers, I think there's at least two dimensions of what it means to make
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.280]   technology for the normal person, for the average person.
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.280]   We've been focusing on price.
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.680]   But there's a much more important one, which is usability.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:43.680]   Yes.
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:48.320]   Like Apple, Apple has really been ahead of the curve on usability on making stuff for
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.320]   the average person in terms of usability.
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:51.320]   Absolutely.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.320]   I just agree with you.
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:53.320]   Come on.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.120]   Compare like any of the iPhones with any of the Android phones.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.920]   Maybe it's just my brain, but I feel like the Android phones infinitely.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:58.920]   You know what I like?
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.520]   For instance, it's so trivial.
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.240]   And this is where Apple used to be.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.240]   I'll agree with you.
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.560]   In 1984 when they came out with the Mac.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:10.440]   And because of Jeff Raskin, they had a very well defined philosophy of user interface
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.880]   that informed everything.
[00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.720]   And they told every developer, "This is how you do it."
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.720]   They published a book of it.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.800]   I would completely disagree.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:21.760]   In the iPhone case, every app has a different UI.
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:22.960]   Where are the settings in an app?
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:23.960]   It could be anywhere.
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:24.960]   Where's the back button?
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:26.480]   There is none.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:32.600]   How often do you exit an app on an iPhone app by pressing the home button because you
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.320]   can't figure out how the hell to get back to the previous page?
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.320]   You know what drives me crazy?
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.320]   That was me every day.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.320]   Add to that.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.320]   It's terrible user interface.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:42.480]   The one thing the Android does, if you swipe up from the bottom on Android, all of your
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.680]   apps are alphabetical.
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:47.280]   You can put them on the screens wherever you want, but they're lifted alphabetically by
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.280]   swiping up.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.280]   There's an iPhone.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.120]   I think they're trying to figure out where the heck is my iPhone.
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.120]   They added folders.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.120]   That was the one difference.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:57.440]   I'm not saying that Apple's usability is perfect.
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.440]   Thank you.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:01.160]   I'm saying that it's better than anyone else's.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:02.160]   I remember...
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.720]   I'm not sure that's true.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.720]   I remember this example.
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.760]   I remember the first time that I got a modern MacBook.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:10.320]   It's probably, I don't know, 10 years ago.
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.800]   I plugged some USB thing into it.
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.880]   Like a presentation remote or something.
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:18.160]   I plugged some USB thing into it.
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.800]   I had this experience where it didn't do anything.
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:24.120]   I was like, "Wait, it's not doing anything."
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.720]   Then I actually used it and it worked.
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:31.840]   I had this shocking revelation that the Apple design philosophy was like, when you plug
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:34.640]   something into the USB port, it's supposed to just work.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:39.000]   If you plug something into a Windows computer's USB port, especially like eight, nine years
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.360]   ago when this happened, you would get a whole...
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:44.160]   Even when it worked, it would be like, "I detected that you plugged into something in
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.160]   the USB port.
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.160]   Now I'm a Sony driver.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:49.400]   That was eight or nine years ago."
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.560]   With that philosophy is carried through.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:55.960]   Look at the AirPods right now compared to any other wireless headset.
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:57.920]   It's just good usability.
[00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.880]   I think that's generally true.
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:00.880]   I think that...
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.800]   I had a really interesting experience.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:07.440]   My company, back before I was running for Congress, this is about a year ago, we were
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:11.400]   really, really sitting down prototyping AR and VR apps.
[00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.400]   We were trying to make emotional sensing APIs.
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.400]   Interesting.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.400]   Really cool stuff.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:21.200]   Figuring out what your voice intonations were.
[00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:25.360]   We're trying to signal to people where you looked, what that was trying to signal.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.880]   Tons of interesting research out there for it.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:29.880]   I had the experience.
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:35.440]   I had not built a Windows machine since the '90s when I was in high school.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.600]   We built it.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:40.520]   We started working with Windows 10.
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.920]   I rocket on relay.
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.200]   We are all Apple fans.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.200]   I love Apple.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.200]   I mostly use Apple.
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.040]   That's Brianna's podcast on relay with a wonderful...
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:54.400]   With Christina Warren and Simone DeRosh 4.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.400]   DeRosh 4?
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.520]   She said that French by DeRosh 4.
[00:37:58.520 --> 00:37:59.520]   She does.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.520]   She's great.
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.720]   It's a wonderful, wonderful show.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.880]   I think Christina really carries it forward.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:06.080]   And Christina also is an...
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.080]   Yeah, you're all three of you.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.080]   A big app of fans.
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.080]   Yeah.
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.080]   Yeah.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.080]   Yeah.
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:15.280]   But my point is, I think that if you're really in the Apple ecosystem, you kind of don't
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:21.360]   notice that when you start a new iPhone from scratch, that now it has 20 modal dial
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:28.360]   locks that you have to go through instead of like...
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.360]   Yes.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.360]   You've got 10 on your password.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.360]   A hundred times.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.360]   Over and over.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:43.360]   And I do think that it's better than anyone else, but I think it's closer than I think us Apple fans like to give credit for sometimes, in my opinion.
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.360]   I think they used to be absolutely premiering.
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.360]   Yeah.
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.360]   No, yeah.
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.360]   It did used to be the computer for the rest of us.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.360]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:50.360]   It has not been the computer or the phone for the rest of us in some time.
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.360]   It's in between a Mac and a Windows.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.360]   Windows is horrible.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.360]   But what am I sitting on?
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.360]   What are you sitting on?
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:55.360]   I love this one.
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:57.000]   This is a Surface studio.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.360]   My desktop computer at home is a Mac, and I like it.
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.360]   It's fine.
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.360]   But I just...
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.360]   You know what I use now?
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.360]   I go back and forth.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:09.000]   Because I got so frustrated with the lack of hardware on the Mac and touch.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.280]   And I've never really been a fan of Windows.
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:16.000]   And Windows 10, which is admittedly the best Windows in a long time.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.360]   I just use Linux everywhere.
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:20.120]   And actually, I buy a Windows machine and I put Linux on it.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.120]   And I'm happy.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.200]   Well, I shouldn't.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.880]   People are going to think I'm insane if I say this.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:27.520]   But I do think Linux is the easiest to use.
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.200]   So there, I said it.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.920]   And actually, what that only proves, Phil, is that you think whatever you use day in day
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.600]   out is the easiest to use.
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:36.600]   Right.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:37.600]   Really.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:38.600]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:39.600]   None of it's...
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.600]   Technology is not easy to use.
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.600]   Well, if you ask in day out, if you think...
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:45.760]   Technology is not easy to use, right?
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.080]   Frank's about there emptying the trash.
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.080]   He says, "I forget it.
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.040]   I don't want to have anything to do."
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:52.040]   He's pounding on the door right now.
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:56.920]   But even buying a car today, it took me about a week to really get used to buying new car.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:00.440]   Because if the pedals are all the same, the steering wheels are the same.
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:05.000]   Yeah, but then there's the autopilot and the blind spot monitoring technology.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.800]   I still haven't figured out the GPS on my car.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.640]   I just use my phone because I don't bother with a car.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.920]   Nobody's got a blinking 12 on their VCR.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.400]   Times have improved.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.400]   Things have improved.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.960]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:17.960]   That's a great panel.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.280]   Brianna Wu is here.
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:24.260]   Going for Congress in the Massachusetts 8th, Brianna Wu 2018.com co-founder of Giant Space
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:25.260]   Cat.
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:29.320]   And now we know her secret superpower is that great podcast.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.320]   That's it.
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.320]   That's how you're going to win.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.760]   You kind of like being the apprentice.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.400]   That helped Donald Trump.
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:38.400]   You know what?
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.400]   The star.
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.720]   You know, after Reagan got elected, I thought, "Oh, that's it.
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.320]   You have to be a movie star and you can get elected."
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:47.600]   And that didn't pan out that way, but I was a little worried.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.960]   Now you have to be a podcast star and you'll get elected.
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:50.960]   Right, Brianna?
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:51.960]   It's automatic.
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:55.160]   I think it's a really good skill to develop.
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:58.960]   Like talking about things and explaining it clearly to people.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:03.160]   I think it's a very relevant skill for anyone.
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:07.160]   I think the other really big skills, I think we need engineers in Congress.
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:13.240]   I think we need people that will think about problems holistically, will not treat it like
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:17.560]   you're arguing for a side and will just look at all the options on the table.
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:22.520]   Anyone that's worked on a dev team knows that you have to really think outside the box
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.280]   sometimes to ship a product.
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:27.120]   And I just think we need that mindset in Congress.
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:30.280]   Also here, a guy who really knows what he's talking about.
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:33.040]   From Evernote, former chairman, CEO of Evernote.
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:39.520]   He now is CEO at All Turtles, which is all about creating amazing artificial intelligence
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:41.040]   applications for all of us.
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.040]   All dash turtles.
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:43.040]   I'm Phil Liben.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.040]   It's great to have you.
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.040]   Nice to be here.
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:52.080]   Traditionally, I try to get tech journalists on.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:56.680]   Usually, I avoid the entrepreneurs and the CEOs.
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:57.680]   Me too.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:00.920]   Because most of them are mealy mouth, especially when they're running a company.
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.360]   The last thing you're going to ask them is, "You're not going to go to a CEO and say,
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.360]   'Well, tell us about your company.
[00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.200]   We'll not get an ad."
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.840]   But you're great.
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:14.120]   And because of all your experience with product design, I think your insights are very much
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:15.120]   appreciated.
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.120]   Thank you.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.120]   It's very kind of you.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.120]   Thank you.
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:19.680]   Also, Larry Maggot, who, like me, is an inked, stained, rich.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:20.680]   Right.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:21.680]   Now I'm nervous.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:22.680]   We don't know anything.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:23.680]   We just report on it.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.680]   Exactly.
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:25.680]   We don't have to know anything.
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:29.120]   It's like you say, "Those who can do, those who can't teach and those who can't teach
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:31.920]   teachers, well, I'm a former professor of education."
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:32.920]   There you go.
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:33.920]   From CBS News Radio.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:34.920]   That's the new name.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:35.920]   News to be new.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:36.920]   The new name.
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:37.920]   News to be CBS Radio News.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:38.920]   But then they got a consultant.
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:41.120]   They've never explained to me why they changed it.
[00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:45.200]   And don't forget his site where he is the CEO of Connects safely.org, but that's a nonprofit.
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.200]   That's a nonprofit.
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:48.440]   And we do internet safety, privacy security.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.240]   I'm good at not making a profit myself.
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.240]   Well, we started out not to make a profit.
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:53.240]   We succeeded.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.240]   We're doing well.
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.240]   Brilliant.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:43:00.240]   Our show today brought to you and literally brought to you by Sonic, we are connected to
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:04.680]   the world via 10 gigabit symmetric fiber.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:05.680]   Ooh.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.680]   Ooh.
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:08.720]   And when I say that, I want that.
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:10.360]   Geeks go, "Ooh."
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:13.520]   You know, the funny thing is there's nothing in the place that goes faster than a gigabit.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.040]   You know, all our gig.
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:18.480]   So I can get a gigabit, but we got 10 total.
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.480]   And actually that's awesome.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.200]   Did they run a cable for you or how did you get there?
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.200]   No, they just fiber to the companies.
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.960]   Can I get that at my house where I live?
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:24.960]   Maybe?
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.360]   You can get Sonic at your house.
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.520]   If you live in San Francisco.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:28.520]   I don't.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:29.520]   No.
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.520]   East Bay, North Bay.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:33.000]   Sonic is the best internet service provider.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   Not because you're going to get 10 gigabit, but they do offer.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   What did I tell you?
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.040]   Gigabit internet that includes 15 email accounts, 15.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:44.120]   A gigabyte, by the way, properly configured email accounts.
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:49.040]   A gigabyte of storage, you get a new domain name and personal web hosting, you get fax
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:52.960]   line service, you get home phone service, you can port your phone number to because it's
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:57.080]   real phone service, unlimited, local and long distance.
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:01.280]   You get all of that for $40 a month.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.400]   But one of the reasons I love, now I know most of you listening can't get this, so it's
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.400]   just making you crazy.
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:10.600]   One of the reasons I love this and I love to talk about it is it shows that what these
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:17.160]   other guys are charging you for service that's not as good is really a rip off.
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:22.240]   It is possible to have it be a profitable company to give you this kind of service.
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:26.080]   To stand up for your rights, there are no bandwidth caps.
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:29.760]   They fight government subpoenas and orders.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:36.240]   They provide local support, private, browsing, friendly support, uncapped bandwidth and a
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.040]   great price and they make a profit.
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.040]   So it is possible.
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:45.920]   And I think that this is really, if you go to EFF's ratings of internet service providers,
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:48.560]   go green checkboxes all the way across.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:49.960]   It's one of the few.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:55.080]   Here's what you do, go to sonic.com, SONIC.com/twit and enter your address, see if you can get
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:56.080]   it.
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:45:01.320]   Get your first month free and phone service plus bundle it with this.
[00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:03.400]   You'll get $120 on your sonic bill.
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.160]   S-O-N-I-C sonic.com/twit.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:09.600]   I know for most of you going there is going to be depressing.
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.840]   You're checking me right now.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:14.560]   But they are rolling it out.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:18.240]   We actually interviewed Dane Jasper, their CEO who's a friend of mine, been friend for
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.600]   20 years.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:22.800]   He has his license plate, says Linux by the way.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.800]   I don't like him for that.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.680]   He said, "We can make a profit.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:30.480]   We have to get one in five houses to subscribe."
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.480]   That's it.
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:35.360]   When I moved into my new place, the neighborhood has sonic but my building didn't.
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:36.840]   I got to check again.
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:37.840]   It's been like two years.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:38.840]   I got to check again.
[00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:39.840]   I bet they do.
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:40.840]   They really roll it.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:41.840]   And I tell you.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:42.840]   Wow, it's available.
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:43.840]   I don't know if that's the type of thing.
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.880]   Oh, no, that'll be their ADSL product or the ADSL product.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:46.880]   50 megabits.
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:47.880]   Not bad.
[00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:48.880]   That's a pretty good price.
[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:49.880]   They do this fusion ADSL.
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:50.880]   How do they do 50 megabits?
[00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:51.880]   They do fusion.
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:52.880]   They do two lines.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:57.040]   Over an APNIP IP network with up to two fiber to the new.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:58.320]   This is weird.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:59.320]   Well, check it out.
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:01.320]   It's still actually a pretty good price.
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:02.320]   It's a great price.
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:04.440]   But I get 100 megabits caps.
[00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:08.560]   And they fight the federal request for information.
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.600]   I'm a big fan.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:12.520]   Well, we are talking.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:13.800]   Let's see what can we talk about now.
[00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:14.800]   We did the iPhone.
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:19.040]   By the way, we should mention that September 12th, it will not just be three new iPhones.
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:26.840]   Apple will finally announce a 4K Apple TV in all likelihood with UHD.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.560]   This is there like the last company Roku.
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.400]   Everybody makes 4K now.
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.720]   Googles, Chromecast does 4K.
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:35.680]   Tvodas 4K.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:38.120]   My Android TV, my Nvidia Shield.
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.480]   Everybody does 4K.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:44.120]   Apple was one of the last remaining devices, but they had to, I don't know, they had to
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:45.120]   get it working.
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.120]   I don't know what the...
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:49.000]   I pretty much switched all of my TV stuff to my PS4 Pro.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000]   It's 4K.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   I kind of use that for everything.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   It's good.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.760]   And do you use their views service?
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.760]   I use the view service, which is a little...
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:56.760]   Little record cutter.
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:58.760]   You don't have cable.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:00.560]   No, I mean, I still have Comcast for Internet.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.560]   You have to have Internet.
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:02.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:05.680]   But yeah, I use view and then all the apps in the PS4.
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:06.680]   It's pretty good.
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:09.120]   I'll try the new Apple TV when it comes out.
[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.560]   This is so typical of Apple because this will come out and then everybody will say,
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:15.800]   "Oh, Apple invented 4K HDR."
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:16.800]   Right.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:17.800]   Every time.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:19.800]   That's all right.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:20.800]   I'm just glad to have along the ride.
[00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:25.000]   They are apparently going to announce a new series 3 Apple Watch.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.400]   It was a bunch of new 4K movie content because they just saw that Voodoo just started doing
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.400]   4K.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:33.200]   I've been using Voodoo's, they call it UDX, I think.
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:34.200]   UHD or something.
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.200]   I've been using theirs for a long time.
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.200]   It's good.
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:42.200]   And I have to say, bigger, more importantly than the resolution is HDR high dynamic.
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:44.200]   That you'll see more of.
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:48.200]   Because if you're at more than a few feet away from a 4K TV, it's not going to look
[00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:49.200]   that different.
[00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:52.960]   It's not because you can't see the dots either way with HD or UHD.
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:57.720]   But you will definitely notice the broader dynamic range of HDR.
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:59.200]   So if you can get it, do.
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.200]   That is...
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:03.600]   I remember at CES if you hear the gothony was showing off when 4K was first coming out and
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:06.480]   they had a 4K set right by a 1080p set.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.280]   And my colleague and I were standing there.
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:09.280]   We couldn't tell them.
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:10.280]   No, you have to get right up.
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:11.280]   You could not tell the difference.
[00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.280]   You could put your nose.
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.280]   Any reason or distance.
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:15.280]   That was always been healthy for HDR.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:17.280]   I'm like you.
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.280]   I have my PlayStation.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:20.200]   I use it whenever I can.
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:23.360]   The problem is the controller is drained so quickly.
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:27.320]   I like my Apple TV because I'm also a cord cutter.
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:34.040]   But I can't help but feel like we were talking about Apple's kind of the lessening of usability
[00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.720]   as a priority in the products they ship.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:43.240]   I think Apple TV is a really great example of Apple kind of not thinking about the
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.240]   mouse market.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.240]   The controller.
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:47.240]   I hate that remote.
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:48.240]   I hate the Apple TV remote remote.
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:49.240]   Not just the remote.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.240]   I hate the remote.
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.240]   It's just a grid of icons.
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:53.240]   They haven't updated that in ages.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.240]   I hate that remote.
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:55.240]   What do you do?
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:56.240]   It's terrible.
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:57.240]   How are you getting your television news?
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:58.240]   That's a really...
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:00.240]   We have it in my campaign headquarters so I get it there.
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.240]   She goes to work like the rest of us.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.240]   I'm off the clock.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:07.240]   So you don't watch MSNBC or CNN at home.
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:08.240]   I don't.
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:09.240]   I have to admit.
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:10.240]   I'm back in 2000.
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:12.240]   I mean you can do that now with course.
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:14.600]   It just depends on what market you're in.
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:16.240]   But if you have locals, right?
[00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:17.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:19.240]   I think I get everything.
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:20.880]   You can do it now, finally.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:25.400]   I use YouTube TV, which actually I really like the interface of YouTube TV.
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:30.520]   So this is the grid of stations and it does include MSNBC, Fox News.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:32.120]   I don't think CNN is on here.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:33.120]   I think if you...
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.120]   I sort of need to have CNN, Fox and MSNBC.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:36.920]   You have to have all three of them.
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:38.920]   They're just moments when I kind of feel like I do.
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:39.920]   I probably don't have to.
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:42.920]   I love this.
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:45.920]   It goes live.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:47.920]   So this is what a channel guy should do.
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:48.920]   That's actually cool.
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:49.920]   This is what a channel guy should do.
[00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.920]   Can you do this on a television set?
[00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:54.920]   No, they don't have an Apple TV app.
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.920]   They don't have an app for any of those devices.
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:57.920]   Let me go to my...
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.920]   It's a built-in DVR.
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:02.920]   And this is a really cool thing.
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:06.920]   So if I go to the news section, all four of these are live.
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:07.920]   So is the sports.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:12.520]   So if I'm trying to figure out what I want to watch, if I'm watching live channels, they'll
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:13.520]   actually show it live.
[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:14.520]   That's pretty cool.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:15.520]   That's cool.
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:16.520]   YouTube.
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:19.440]   This is the best UI I've seen for TV.
[00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:23.840]   But if you're not in the right markets, there's a limited number of markets that have live
[00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:25.400]   and locals and all of that stuff.
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:26.920]   It also has a DVR built-in.
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:31.280]   And you can have multiple users with independent DVRs on the same account.
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.920]   So I can record different shows than Phil.
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:37.280]   Because Phil does all those cartoon land stuff.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.280]   He does.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:39.280]   He loves that.
[00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:40.280]   It's true.
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:41.280]   So I'll have Rick and Morty all the time.
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:42.280]   I know.
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:43.280]   I do.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.280]   I love it.
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:46.200]   I want to talk about the Apple Watch.
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:48.400]   I think this is a really interesting problem.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:52.400]   And I'm very interested to see how Apple is going to solve it.
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.600]   The first one, I think it's a good product.
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:51:01.320]   But the only thing I use it for now, what two years later, is for working out.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:07.240]   It's a really, really good workout gadget to give you heart rate and feedback information.
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:12.920]   But it's like the interface on it is just this big rat's nest of apps.
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:17.640]   And you're trying to find it on with the apps.
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:20.400]   Not fully the apps fault though.
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.400]   It's very limited capability in this.
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:24.400]   It's very slow back and forth.
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.400]   I think the look of it is a very thick product.
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:32.360]   I used to wear my Apple Watch when I would do TV this weekend tech.
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:36.720]   I don't these days because I think the fashion of it is kind of not the best.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:42.240]   So the thing is the rumors are saying they're going to add an LTE radio to it.
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:48.000]   And what I can't figure out is how terrible the battery life in it already is.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.720]   And why do you need to?
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:53.280]   There's one rumor which I don't actually think it's true for this year, unfortunately.
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:57.080]   But I hope they get to it at some point, which would be absolutely world changing, which
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.720]   is if they manage to get the glucose monitor in.
[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:00.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:04.800]   Like if that would be actually crack a glucose monitor that you can wear.
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:05.800]   Without it.
[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:07.600]   It's a trillion dollar thing that will change the world.
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:13.680]   This rumor comes from the fact that Tim Cook was talking to a college group in Texas and
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.880]   said I'm wearing a glucose monitor right now.
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:19.920]   Though if you read it carefully, it didn't look like it was by Apple.
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:20.960]   I mean, I was wearing a third.
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:21.960]   I was wearing a third.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:22.960]   Last time I was on this show.
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:23.960]   But it was the third party.
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:24.960]   There already are glucose.
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:25.960]   In fact, I...
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:28.760]   Not continuous penetration lists, right?
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:29.760]   Not yet.
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:30.760]   They have an administration.
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:31.760]   Yeah, they're invasive.
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:34.920]   And this is what apparently is being promised is a non-invasive...
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:35.920]   That could be amazing.
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:38.800]   Glucose monitoring is going to completely change the world as soon as someone has real
[00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:39.800]   time non-invasive.
[00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:40.800]   It's like I will start...
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:45.000]   You think people who are not diabetical by it just to prevent diabetes to make sure...
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   For so much more stuff.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.840]   It's like it's key to everything.
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:50.800]   Everybody in this country over 40 is pre-diabetic if they're not yet diagnosed.
[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:51.800]   It's more than just that.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:52.800]   It's actually...
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:57.480]   It's key for mood, for mental concentration, for physical energy.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:59.640]   Like this is the new giant revolution.
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:03.240]   Well, if you're faster, one of the things you absolutely want to monitor is your glucose.
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:04.240]   Well, I mean, I...
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.240]   I used to monitor it real time.
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:08.840]   I don't anymore because it basically doesn't change for me because I'm fasting, so it's
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:09.840]   fine.
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:10.840]   But for normal people, it's...
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:11.840]   Were you in type 2 diabetic?
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:12.840]   I was pre-diabetic.
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:15.840]   I was still at one point.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:17.480]   My metabolic syndrome.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:19.280]   Yeah, I had syndrome excellent point.
[00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:23.940]   I can't stress enough how important it would be if somebody actually released a mainstream
[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:24.940]   wearable non-invasive...
[00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:27.200]   I'm type 2 diabetic and I do prick my finger.
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.960]   You do okay, except for you and me.
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:29.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:30.960]   Heaster.
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:33.040]   I was wearing the continuous one on my arm from Abbott that you still can't get in the
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:34.640]   US, if you can get him in Europe.
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:36.000]   I remember you talked about that last time.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.640]   Did that sandpaper your arm?
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:38.640]   How did it get there?
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:39.640]   No, it was like a little needle that you just...
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:40.640]   It did prick you.
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.440]   Yeah, yeah, it was fine.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:45.920]   But the difference, I think in general of adoption rate between a product that requires
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:48.440]   you to stick yourself with a needle in a product that doesn't is...
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:49.440]   It should be like 1,000 X?
[00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:51.760]   Yeah, it is a giant market.
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:53.640]   I don't remember the last time I saw the numbers.
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:54.640]   It was tens of millions.
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:55.640]   You can't turn on...
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:57.320]   It's a much television set without seeing ads for diabetes.
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:58.680]   It's much bigger than people think.
[00:53:58.680 --> 00:53:59.680]   It's not just diabetes.
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:00.680]   It's literally everyone.
[00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:04.720]   There's 7 billion people on this planet that ought to be doing continuous glucose monitoring.
[00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:06.920]   In other words, there's a very strong financial incentive.
[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:08.960]   So you're saying like when you're working...
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:09.960]   Like I bicycle ride.
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:14.040]   So if I had a way of knowing that it was time for a candy bar or a break...
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:15.600]   It's never time for a candy bar, it turns out.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:16.600]   Or whatever.
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:17.600]   Some form of...
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:19.160]   It's always time for a candy bar.
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:20.160]   What do you...
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:21.160]   Yeah.
[00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:23.160]   Actually, that's why you don't want to monitor your glucose.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:24.160]   Exactly.
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.160]   You don't want to see those spikes.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:28.200]   Well, actually, there are times when you need instant energy.
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.200]   Maybe you need something real quick.
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:32.160]   You carry those little packets of goo around the day.
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:33.160]   Would I bike?
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:35.080]   That is the worst stuff for you.
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:36.080]   I do.
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.080]   It turns out I'm not actually a doctor.
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:38.080]   Oh, you carry that stuff around.
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:39.080]   I do.
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:40.720]   I run seven miles a day.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:41.720]   Wow.
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:42.720]   Wow.
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:43.720]   Ew.
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:44.720]   Yeah.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:45.720]   What do they call that?
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:48.760]   I'm told by the advertising industry that it's called bonking.
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:51.360]   Well, there's a product called Boncues.
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:54.720]   So what I carry is peanut M&M because I like the combination of...
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:55.720]   Set on the exercise.
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:56.720]   And sugar all together.
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:57.720]   So unless you have a...
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:58.720]   You can have...
[00:54:58.720 --> 00:54:59.720]   So you don't need to know about stuff.
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:02.200]   No, no, no, no, peanut M&M's have real peanuts in them.
[00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:05.840]   And so if you're biking and you need some energy, you're also getting a little fat
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:06.840]   and calories.
[00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:07.840]   You don't know what calories are in one.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:08.840]   Well, you don't need to get a juicer in it.
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:10.840]   How many calories you burn when you're riding your bike up hills?
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:11.840]   I mean, sure you burn up.
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:12.840]   So it doesn't really have much to do with calories.
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:16.560]   It's more to do with your insulin resistance, which you're completely killing yourself by
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:18.040]   doing but eating those things.
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:19.040]   Okay.
[00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:20.040]   So yeah, best, better not to.
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:24.240]   So what do you eat when you're exercising really strenuously and you need some energy?
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:25.240]   Fat.
[00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:26.240]   Nothing.
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:27.240]   Yeah, my own fat.
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.240]   Okay, nothing.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:31.200]   The new science on this is actually pretty compelling.
[00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:32.200]   You don't need the carbs.
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:35.200]   You only need them for the first few weeks.
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.720]   And the key to it is real time glucose monitoring.
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:42.320]   The insights that I got for wearing a real time glucose monitor for a couple of months,
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:43.320]   life changing and staggering.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:45.160]   Like I've lost 90 pounds.
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:46.160]   Wow.
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:47.160]   Everything is like infinitely better.
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:51.360]   Give us some of the insights that you learned.
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:56.080]   I know from my own finger prick, the morning is the worst they call it the dawn syndrome
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:59.080]   because you ramp up your liver excretes.
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:03.440]   Yeah, I mean, it's there's so that's my highest stuff.
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.280]   But you eat it goes up.
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.480]   Depends on what and depends on when.
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:07.960]   You guys can go down.
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:12.600]   Yeah, there's a lot of there's a lot of variability, but it's it's pretty important and not just
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:15.480]   for diabetes stuff like also, honestly, just for mood.
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:17.000]   My mood is much better than it ever was.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   Yeah, I get cranky.
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   I get concentration.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   Well, I actually hangry.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   That's when I eat his snickers.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.740]   I had abdominal surgery a couple of years ago and I didn't eat much for weeks after
[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:26.740]   every word.
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:27.740]   And I actually felt euphoric.
[00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:28.740]   Much of the time.
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:29.740]   Definitely.
[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:30.740]   And I couldn't quite figure out what it's called fasting.
[00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:33.480]   Yeah, mild euphoria is very common.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:34.480]   You feel great.
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:35.480]   I feel great.
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:36.480]   I mean, I feel great now.
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:37.720]   But did that last that sustain itself?
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:39.720]   Yeah, okay.
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:41.560]   As long as you don't eat, but the problem is not eating doesn't sustain itself.
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:42.560]   Yeah, it does.
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:43.560]   Eventually you have to eat.
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:44.560]   Well, eventually.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:46.520]   How was your long you told us it was like 11 days, right?
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:47.520]   Your longest fast, something like that.
[00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:50.960]   I don't think I've got more than eight, but it's it's it's just based on the calendar.
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:53.080]   Like I just a total fast to just water.
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:54.080]   No, no juices.
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:55.080]   No calories.
[00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.080]   No coffee.
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:59.060]   It's easy to do after the first day the first day is hard.
[00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:01.140]   And then your body goes, I'm fine.
[00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:02.140]   Hard compared to what?
[00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:03.140]   I mean, yeah, it's not that hard.
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:06.340]   You're eating black, drinking black coffee in an empty stomach.
[00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:07.340]   Yeah.
[00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:08.340]   How's your death?
[00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:09.340]   Great.
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:10.340]   Awesome.
[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:11.340]   I'm even doing it now.
[00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:12.340]   It's great.
[00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:13.340]   Dr. Fung says you could put a little heavy cream in it if you want.
[00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:14.340]   Dr. Fung.
[00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:15.340]   Yeah.
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:16.340]   That's my guy.
[00:57:16.340 --> 00:57:17.340]   This week in health.
[00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:18.340]   Yeah.
[00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:22.740]   All that aside, seriously, glucose monitoring when someone nails that in a consumer device
[00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:23.740]   that's non-invasive.
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:24.740]   I agree.
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:25.740]   That's huge.
[00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:28.840]   So do you think Apple actually may do that this year?
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:29.840]   Well, I hope so.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:31.000]   Can I point out it?
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.920]   This has been the Holy Grail for a decade.
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:34.920]   Yeah.
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:35.920]   But so is lots of other stuff.
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:36.920]   Yeah.
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:40.640]   But I think Apple and many other companies are well aware of the potential economic gains
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:41.720]   from making one of these.
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:43.040]   It's hard.
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:44.040]   I would love to see it.
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:47.960]   I doubt it'll happen this year, but only because like it would just be so amazing if
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:48.960]   it was.
[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:52.040]   I'm just skeptical, but I hope you get to it pretty soon.
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:53.040]   There's two things.
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:56.140]   That's a big idea that makes sense for Apple.
[00:57:56.140 --> 00:58:00.140]   Like that is something that I could really see, you know, selling the Apple watch.
[00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:05.500]   I think the question is, you know, this year for this event, what can they do to really,
[00:58:05.500 --> 00:58:09.740]   you know, get excitement in this product again?
[00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:14.860]   I mean, you know, as far as being an exercise device, I think they did as good a job has
[00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:17.460]   been done, you know, in the smart watch sector.
[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:20.900]   I have an Android watch that does an adequate job as well for that, you know.
[00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:21.900]   Okay.
[00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:22.900]   Sure.
[00:58:22.900 --> 00:58:27.960]   I think that's the point to do like, you know, pan personal access to get you into your building.
[00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:30.620]   I'm not really sold that the security is there on that.
[00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:36.020]   We've seen some really scary stories come out lately about, you know, Apple home compatible,
[00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:39.260]   you know, locks and, you know, how vulnerable they can be.
[00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:45.320]   I don't, I want to see Apple really knock a home run in this category, but it's hard
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:50.260]   to imagine that an LTE, you know, radio in it is, you know, what we need.
[00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:52.860]   When you get into Congress, are you going to be regular?
[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:53.860]   Yeah.
[00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:55.660]   Are you going to be regulating these, these watches?
[00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:57.740]   I mean, you start to, it strikes me.
[00:58:57.740 --> 00:58:59.660]   It's, well, I'll let her finish.
[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:00.660]   Yeah.
[00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:01.660]   I'm sorry.
[00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:02.660]   That's a good question.
[00:59:02.660 --> 00:59:07.060]   Like, Leah, when you're talking about, you know, this, my first thing is, well, I bet
[00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:10.660]   the medical devices are very, very, very heavily regular.
[00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:11.660]   Yeah.
[00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:16.180]   And it's like, I would imagine that that would be a real, you know, blockade to Apple really
[00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:18.140]   innovating in this project category.
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:21.740]   And non-invasive glucose monitor, there's, there's, there's already carve outs for it.
[00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:22.740]   It wouldn't be that hard.
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:26.420]   If they can demonstrate that it worked, it wouldn't, like, yeah, I've looked into that.
[00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:30.020]   I know that with, with things like blood pressure, things like that, there are certain
[00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:33.420]   things you have to, like that's another thing is to be able to have blood pressure bond
[00:59:33.420 --> 00:59:34.420]   that are in real time.
[00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:35.420]   Yeah.
[00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:36.420]   I mean, that's great.
[00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:37.420]   Less important, but yeah.
[00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:41.100]   This is the article I've referred to this before from a, or may of this year, Rachel Becker
[00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:47.020]   writing in the Verge about how hard it is to do non-invasive, or she calls it needleless
[00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:48.020]   blood sugar monitoring.
[00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:51.060]   There are companies who have tried and failed.
[00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:56.220]   There's a book called the pursuit of non-invasive glucose hunting the deceitful turkey.
[00:59:56.220 --> 01:00:01.540]   But there's, there's, there's a, it was hard to, you know, send up a rocket and I was
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:02.540]   mad back down.
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:03.540]   I agree.
[01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:04.540]   But I agree.
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:09.420]   At some point, like it's, there's two, there's two major consumer hardware platforms that
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:14.020]   are going to be new that are going to each cause trillions of dollars of new opportunity.
[01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:17.980]   It's when someone actually gets AR in a form factor that's not much bigger than glass
[01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:18.980]   is.
[01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:20.780]   So like, actually, very hard to do.
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:21.780]   Yeah.
[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:22.780]   That's going to be amazing.
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:26.460]   And non-invasive real time glucose hunting, like those two things are, are world changing.
[01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:28.980]   And I really think both are going to happen in the next five years.
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:29.980]   Why don't you think maybe in the next two?
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:32.500]   Why, why wouldn't blood pressure be very important?
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:33.500]   It's good to know.
[01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:34.500]   Yeah.
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:35.500]   That one's actually easier.
[01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:39.660]   In fact, your air, but your ear buds are in, because they're in the ear, are capable
[01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:46.340]   of monitoring blood oxygen levels, heart rate as well as blood pressure.
[01:00:46.340 --> 01:00:51.380]   I think that is actually, I can see, I can imagine Apple doing a, some sort of medical
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:52.380]   device for the ear.
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:53.380]   You've got in a watch.
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:55.140]   You actually could do a blood pressure thing on a watch.
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:56.140]   Wouldn't be that.
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:00:57.140]   Yeah.
[01:00:57.140 --> 01:00:58.140]   Maybe you could.
[01:00:58.140 --> 01:00:59.140]   I don't know.
[01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:00.140]   I'm not, we're not doctors.
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:01.140]   But we play them on TV.
[01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:02.140]   We are trying.
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:03.140]   We are trying.
[01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:04.140]   Yeah.
[01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:08.620]   Was that it for Apple TV, Apple Watch with LTE?
[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:12.780]   You know, I think Phil, I gotta say the reason Apple's doing that is because merely because
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:15.340]   they want you to stream Apple music on your watch.
[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:16.340]   Seriously.
[01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:20.140]   A lot of what Apple does is about boosting Apple music.
[01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:24.700]   I mean, why is Apple spending a billion dollars on original content, original television
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:25.700]   content?
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:26.700]   It could be.
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:27.700]   Because it will boost Apple music.
[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:30.980]   I went out of my way to figure out how to turn off streaming music on my watch.
[01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:31.980]   It was annoying.
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:33.980]   Every time I play music, my phone was coming to my watch.
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:34.980]   Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.
[01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:35.980]   Yeah.
[01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:37.460]   You gotta get earpods.
[01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:38.780]   That's what you need.
[01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:41.180]   And that's another product Apple would love you to get.
[01:01:41.180 --> 01:01:44.300]   They are number one in Bluetooth headphones because of the purchase of Be Sure.
[01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:48.020]   Sort of glucose monitoring, the thing that would make me wear an Apple watch again.
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:53.220]   And I'm not wearing one now, would be a radically different screen and better performance.
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:55.980]   So that the screen was actually on all the time so I could use it as a watch.
[01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:56.980]   Yeah.
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:57.980]   And it feels like that basic.
[01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:58.980]   Yeah.
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:01:59.980]   It's not a good watch.
[01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:00.980]   It's not a good watch.
[01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:03.300]   How many things are we willing to charge every night?
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:04.820]   I mean, we all charge a phone to be.
[01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:05.820]   Oh, I don't mind.
[01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:07.620]   You're like, it bugs me to have to think about.
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:10.420]   In fact, it's easier because you just plug everything.
[01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:12.100]   Including my car, by the way.
[01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:13.100]   It's serious.
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:14.100]   Oh, it gets plugged in.
[01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:16.460]   By the way, did you charge your car during the heat wave?
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:19.300]   Because I heard some people were saying not to charge your car.
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:20.300]   You're not.
[01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:21.940]   Lithium ion batteries hate heat.
[01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:22.940]   Oh, is that right?
[01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:27.380]   In fact, a lot of what the Tesla is engaged in is keeping the pool yesterday when it was
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:29.380]   170 degrees, 170.
[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:35.580]   When it was 170 degrees yesterday, I went out after the show and my car fans were all
[01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:36.580]   on max.
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:40.300]   The Tesla was trying to desperately to keep the temperature of those lithium ion.
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:41.900]   So my Prius was getting lower.
[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:44.100]   I have a Prius that was getting lower gas mileage.
[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:45.100]   People get about 50.
[01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:46.100]   It's bad for the chemistry.
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:47.100]   Yesterday I was getting like 50.
[01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.100]   Is that why?
[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:49.500]   That's bad for the chemistry.
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:51.900]   My Uber driver was kind of nasty too.
[01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:53.700]   So yeah, they get so cranky.
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:55.100]   They get so cranky.
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:56.100]   Yeah.
[01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:58.420]   Did you have an Uber driver driving an electric car?
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:02:59.420]   Why don't they?
[01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:00.420]   It wasn't they in the attention.
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:01.420]   Yeah.
[01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:02.420]   Oh, gosh.
[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:03.420]   Yeah.
[01:03:03.420 --> 01:03:06.180]   I was driving a Porsche Cayman yesterday looking at my lot of phones.
[01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:07.180]   Oh, nice.
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:08.180]   So I'm a bad environmentalist.
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:09.180]   Oh, nice.
[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:11.700]   No, I think you have to drive a Prius.
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.300]   I think that's the rule if you're in Congress.
[01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:14.300]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:15.900]   You know, I feel like I've earned this.
[01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:17.500]   I feel like I'm gonna sell.
[01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:18.500]   Good for you.
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:21.100]   I haven't touched my car in like a year.
[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:22.100]   Wow.
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:23.100]   Isn't that a nice feeling?
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:26.740]   Yeah, well, except I went to start it like a month ago and it didn't even like it didn't
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:27.980]   even pretend to respond.
[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:29.900]   It didn't even like you anymore.
[01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:31.700]   No, it didn't like there was no fake little light.
[01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:33.300]   There was no like like little wine.
[01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:34.300]   There's like nothing.
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:35.300]   It was like a statue of a car.
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:36.300]   Wow.
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:39.700]   So you do Uber everywhere you go or what do you I walk a lot.
[01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:40.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.500]   And truthfully, Uber is probably cheaper than owning.
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:44.500]   Probably.
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:46.860]   Yeah, no, if I mean, I would not buy a new car.
[01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:47.860]   Yeah.
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:48.860]   So I own this car at some point.
[01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:51.700]   I have to figure out how to get it removed from my garage.
[01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:52.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:53.700]   But a couple more Apple stories.
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:54.700]   I'll never buy a car.
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:55.700]   And then we will move on.
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:04:03.340]   New boss in the Siri division, which is thank God Eddie Q, who has been in charge of Siri,
[01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:06.780]   is being replaced by Craig Federighi of the, he of the beautiful hairdo.
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:09.380]   Why thank God I like Eddie.
[01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:12.180]   Oh, Eddie's also in charge of iTunes.
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:14.660]   Another blight on the Apple.
[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:15.660]   A scutcheon.
[01:04:15.660 --> 01:04:17.660]   Are you still around?
[01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:20.340]   I feel like Eddie's probably a great guy.
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:23.740]   He's certainly a, you know, kind of a fun guy.
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:26.740]   But I don't know how good he is like running a software division.
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:33.160]   Craig, who of course is in charge, he's a software SVP in charge of iOS and Mac OS, seems
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:37.340]   like he be the right person to be running the Siri division as opposed to the guy who's
[01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:42.260]   trying to sell music and the Hollywood for Apple, right?
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:44.820]   I mean, I have a lot of respect from both of them.
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:46.460]   You know, I don't know either one of them.
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:47.380]   You know them, obviously.
[01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:49.500]   So you think Eddie is a good technical guy?
[01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:50.500]   I do.
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:51.500]   Okay.
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:52.500]   All right.
[01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:53.500]   I take it back then.
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:54.500]   You speak from knowledge.
[01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.660]   I speak from ignorance.
[01:04:56.660 --> 01:05:03.540]   However, I personally, I for one am glad to see Craig taking over Siri.
[01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:08.500]   We only know this from Apple's executive page, but.
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:12.900]   I think it's a fair critique of Siri and I use it all the time on my phone.
[01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:13.900]   Do you?
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:14.900]   I do.
[01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:15.900]   I'm one of these people.
[01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:21.340]   I'm the one use case of somebody that uses Siri every single day dozens of times.
[01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:23.340]   What do you do with it?
[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:24.340]   I'm sorry?
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:25.740]   What do you do with it?
[01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:31.740]   Scheduling appointments, calling people, bringing music up, doing Google searches, primarily
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:36.180]   the calendar, but for even just asking how the Red Sox game is going.
[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:37.180]   I'm sorry.
[01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:41.220]   If you're making a phone call while you're driving, you have to use a hand three, at least
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:44.380]   in California by law and showed by 50.
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:45.380]   Yeah.
[01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:46.380]   Yeah.
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:50.820]   It's built into my Audi TT right now, but I mean, my point is I think if you look at
[01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:56.940]   Siri and where it was when it came out, I really would have thought that it would be
[01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:59.260]   more involved by this point.
[01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:02.420]   I don't think it's as intelligent as we need it to be.
[01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:08.780]   I think that it still goofs up questions a lot more than it should to truly be usable.
[01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:10.420]   I was thinking about this the other day.
[01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:16.740]   I've never once used Siri on my Mac and that was one of the really big features for this
[01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:19.500]   last release of Mac OS.
[01:06:19.500 --> 01:06:23.020]   I do think that maybe it's time for some new leadership there.
[01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:25.180]   I mean, Siri's a good product.
[01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:29.120]   I don't use Siri on my Mac and I don't use Windows Hello on my PC, mainly because
[01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:33.900]   these have good keyboards and I'm always sitting, I'm not driving or walking while I'm using
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:34.900]   them.
[01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:40.580]   But while I'm walking or driving or even trying to type on a tiny little screen, the more I
[01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.740]   can use my voice, the happier I am.
[01:06:42.740 --> 01:06:44.180]   And none of these are really great.
[01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:47.300]   I mean, okay, the little glue is okay.
[01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:51.340]   Siri's got a long way to go, but at some point, these are going to be great.
[01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:56.540]   I think, yeah, I'm annoyed every time I accidentally pop up Siri on my Mac because I hit the touch
[01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:57.540]   bar.
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:58.540]   Yeah, I do see it.
[01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:02.240]   I don't use it much on my phone because I don't drive mostly anymore, but I think I
[01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:05.120]   would if I drove at home, I use it for everything.
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:06.120]   Me too.
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:07.120]   Great.
[01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:09.280]   In fact, I can't like, by the way, you just said the word everybody.
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.280]   I know.
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.280]   Sorry.
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:12.280]   It's right.
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.280]   Yeah.
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:15.580]   I don't think I don't think the way I said it would have triggered it because it wasn't
[01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:18.920]   the start of the sentence.
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:23.200]   But I kind of want, I'm waiting, hopefully sometime this year for everything in my house
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.680]   to just be based on Echo TV.
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:27.280]   It may not be waiting.
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.280]   Yeah.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:31.760]   Siri will be the topic of conversation on September 12th because Apple will probably
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:35.780]   talk a little bit about its home pod, its speaker, which is Siri controlled.
[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:38.740]   That'll be out later this year, but I imagine Apple will talk a little bit about it.
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:43.900]   And by the way, this week, Apple and I'm sorry, Microsoft and Amazon announced a relationship.
[01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:44.900]   Isn't that weird?
[01:07:44.900 --> 01:07:45.900]   It's very interesting.
[01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:49.960]   Jeff Bezos said, you're going to put Cortana in Echo, right?
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.660]   Or Echo and they're going to work together.
[01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:52.660]   Or they'll do.
[01:07:52.660 --> 01:07:53.660]   Yeah, go both ways.
[01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:54.660]   Which is very smart.
[01:07:54.660 --> 01:08:00.360]   Because, you know, thesis was, we will all have many assistants.
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:01.520]   Just like you have many friends.
[01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:06.080]   And just as I would say, if I'm going to ask Phil, if I wanted to know about glucose,
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:07.080]   I'd ask Phil.
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:12.920]   And if I want to know about missing kids, I'd ask Larry that you would ask different
[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:13.920]   questions of different systems.
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:15.440]   It's not what I want by the way.
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:18.080]   Sometimes I say the wrong word like I'm talking to Mike.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.640]   I feel like you could like mention your girlfriend.
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:24.280]   I want one assistant and it should know who to ask.
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:27.900]   But I want to have it respond to one word, whatever word that is.
[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:29.140]   Because I want to be able to tell them.
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:31.500]   The other thing is I have two, I have two echoes.
[01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:32.500]   Amanda.
[01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:33.500]   I have an echo in my...
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.500]   I have an echo...
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:35.500]   Sedrin.
[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:36.500]   I have echoes in...
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:37.500]   I can't get in the way.
[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.500]   That's what I do, Phil.
[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:39.500]   Leo, stop.
[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:40.500]   That's what I tell.
[01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:41.500]   That's what I tell.
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:42.500]   That's what I tell.
[01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:43.500]   It works.
[01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:44.500]   It works.
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:45.660]   It works.
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:49.500]   I have an echo in my kitchen and echo in my living room and there's no real wall between
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:50.500]   them.
[01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:51.500]   They both respond.
[01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:54.080]   So one of them responds to a different word to Amazon.
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:55.080]   I'll say Amazon.
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.080]   Because everybody.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.040]   And the other one responds to that other word that I won't say.
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:02.040]   I had my echo respond to a computer for a while but I realized I say that word a lot.
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:03.600]   So it was triggering all of the time.
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:04.600]   Can you do that?
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:05.840]   I thought you only had the choices of the two.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:09.360]   No, Amazon, the computer, echo and the A word.
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:11.760]   So I want to take a break because I want to...
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:16.040]   Actually, there's a really big story out there about Google.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:21.000]   Kashmir Hill wrote a scathing article and I want to know what your guys take on this
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.620]   because this is quite an accusation that Kashmir Hill made.
[01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:31.940]   And it's on the heels of another accusation about Google quashing ideas and stories it
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:32.940]   doesn't like.
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:36.140]   But before we do that, let's talk a little bit about stamps.com.
[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:38.020]   You got to start using your time more effectively.
[01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:42.300]   If you're going to the post office, if you're finding parking and getting in line to do
[01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:48.020]   simple things like buy stamps or charge up a postage meter or drop off packages, stop
[01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:49.020]   it.
[01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:51.600]   In mail, you need stamps.com.
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:57.800]   It brings all the services of the US Postal Service to your desk and you'll never need
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.160]   to go to the post office again.
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:03.640]   You could buy and print US postage for any letter, any package, any class of mail.
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:05.940]   You don't need a meter at all.
[01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:08.400]   Your computer and your printer, that's all you need.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:09.600]   It'll print right on envelopes.
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:12.040]   It'll print your logo and your return address.
[01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:15.120]   It'll automatically get the recipients address from the website.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:19.460]   If you're an eBay or Etsy or Amazon seller, you're going to love this.
[01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:23.580]   Plus it just makes your mail look more professional and it saves you money because you never have
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:24.740]   to guess on the post office.
[01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:26.820]   We're going to get you a USB scale.
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:28.300]   Stamps.com will use that.
[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:31.100]   It'll recommend a way to save, but say, is this media mail?
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:32.260]   You could save money.
[01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:33.860]   It'll fill out all the forms.
[01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:37.980]   If you have customs forms or express mail forms, it does that all.
[01:10:37.980 --> 01:10:38.980]   It's easy.
[01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:41.820]   You can create your stamps.com account in minutes.
[01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:43.420]   There is no equipment to lease.
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:45.380]   There's no long-term commitment.
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:46.900]   You get the scale.
[01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:48.900]   We're going to actually arrange for you to get more than that.
[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:52.300]   We're going to give you $55 in postage credits.
[01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:57.300]   Go to stamps.com, click the microphone in the upper right-hand corner, and fill in
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:59.700]   "Twit" as the offer code for this.
[01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:00.700]   It's $110 offer.
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:06.460]   It includes a month free of stamps.com, but also that scale, a supplies kit, and $55 in
[01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:08.060]   postage.
[01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:11.720]   If you are going, yeah, you actually should do this, Brian, because you're going to be doing
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:13.020]   a lot of mail-in soon.
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:18.300]   I have not sent a letter in years, and ever since I started running, you have to send
[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:23.300]   out, like, "Thank you letters to donors," or "If you meet with people, constituents,
[01:11:23.300 --> 01:11:25.060]   I'm constantly writing a letter."
[01:11:25.060 --> 01:11:26.060]   I'm not joking.
[01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:28.300]   I will do this as soon as I get off the show.
[01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:31.300]   We have actually two accounts because we were fighting over the scale.
[01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:36.540]   Go to stamps.com, click the link up in the right-hand corner, and it says, "Podcast or
[01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:37.540]   radio listeners."
[01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:38.540]   It's a little microphone.
[01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:47.620]   Then use the offer code "Twit" for a great deal.
[01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:48.620]   Stamps.com.
[01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:52.980]   There's a monthly subscription fee, so you'd have to figure out.
[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:55.740]   I come to work and print my stamps.
[01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:56.740]   Then I have all the stamps.
[01:11:56.740 --> 01:12:01.700]   You can print them on Avery's stamp stuff that's got pre-stickied and all that.
[01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:02.700]   It's not like a postage period.
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:04.460]   They have the date on it, or they're just like literally...
[01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:05.580]   No, in fact, they do.
[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:08.700]   This is actually something the US government started a long time ago.
[01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:10.100]   It's called Indicia.
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:12.860]   It's a QR code.
[01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:18.100]   One of the reasons this is Postal Service loves this because all your mail is automatically
[01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.900]   machine sorted.
[01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:20.900]   Everything is...
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:22.380]   They've got a barcode under the address.
[01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:24.660]   It's all done automatically by machines.
[01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:26.940]   They don't have to have humans, so it saves them money.
[01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:29.980]   The Indicia has your account information in it.
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:35.260]   So for instance, if you go to the post office...
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:39.900]   If I tried to mail a package more than a pound from a box, they'd send it...
[01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:42.780]   No, you can't because it could be a bomb or something.
[01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:46.420]   But since 9/11, you have to bring it in and show your face, but not with stamps.com because
[01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:49.100]   of the Indicia, they know who you are.
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:51.780]   They basically bill you based on...
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:52.780]   You don't pay for the postage you pay.
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:53.780]   You pay, I think...
[01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:54.780]   You know what?
[01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:55.780]   That's a good question.
[01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:56.780]   I think you pay ahead.
[01:12:56.780 --> 01:12:57.780]   No, they don't bill you.
[01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:58.780]   You buy...
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:12:59.780]   I mean, I had a Pitney Bowels postage meter.
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:01.420]   Pitney Bowels sloped like that without that crap.
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:02.900]   This moves to speed of paper.
[01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:03.900]   That was a slogan.
[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:05.900]   It's a decade, right?
[01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:06.900]   They smartly bad at it.
[01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:07.900]   What a stupid slogan!
[01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:08.900]   It's a great slogan in the 70s.
[01:13:08.900 --> 01:13:10.540]   At the speed of paper.
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:11.540]   That was their slogan.
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:12.980]   What does that even mean?
[01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:14.780]   I don't know.
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:15.780]   That was their slogan.
[01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:19.180]   That's so business move because everybody communicated on paper, right?
[01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:20.180]   The speed of paper.
[01:13:20.180 --> 01:13:21.180]   That was their slogan.
[01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:22.180]   Look it up.
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:23.740]   That's our title for the show, I think.
[01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:26.340]   Moving at the speed of paper.
[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:27.580]   Stand back.
[01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:28.580]   But you have some time.
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:29.580]   You don't have to stand back right away.
[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:32.380]   You have a minute or two before.
[01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:33.380]   All right.
[01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:37.180]   So I think it was last week we talked about the story.
[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:40.780]   I think maybe hard to know the truth of it.
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:45.380]   New York Times had a story about a foundation that Eric Schmidt had given a lot of money
[01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:50.300]   to Google and given a lot of money to the foundation created a report that criticized...
[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:55.100]   That actually supported the EU's many monopoly claims against Google.
[01:13:55.100 --> 01:14:02.700]   At some point for reasons unknown, the foundation decided to sever its ties with the guy who
[01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:06.380]   created that report and his group.
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:08.620]   And now, this is the article.
[01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:09.620]   I criticized Google.
[01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:10.620]   It got me fired.
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:12.540]   Here's how corporate power works.
[01:14:12.540 --> 01:14:17.980]   Cashmere Hill, a little bit of a pile on, tells a story that frankly is even a little
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:19.980]   more scary in her gizmo-to article.
[01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:22.900]   Yes, Google uses his power to quash ideas it doesn't like.
[01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:26.100]   I know because it happened to me.
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:30.220]   So this is kind of following on the heels of the New America Foundation story.
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:31.540]   She wrote a story.
[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:33.620]   She was working for Forbes.
[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:36.020]   She says, "I was new at my job.
[01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:38.100]   I ran social media."
[01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:41.740]   So because I was not only a reporter, but ran social media, I pulled into a meeting with
[01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:46.420]   the Google salespeople about Google+, this is when it was just starting out.
[01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:49.900]   The salespeople were trying to get Forbes to add a plus one button.
[01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:56.620]   You know there's a Facebook like button and there's a plus one button to their articles
[01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:59.060]   alongside the Facebook like and the Reddit share button.
[01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:00.500]   They said, "You had to do this.
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:05.860]   It's important to do because the plus recommendations would be a factor in search results, a crucial
[01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:08.580]   source of traffic to publishers."
[01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:10.540]   So she's wearing two hats.
[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:12.900]   Maybe this is part of the problem.
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:17.020]   She said, "This sounded like a news story to me that in fact Google was saying your search
[01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:21.260]   results will be better if you use our plus one button," which is a news story.
[01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:23.500]   So she asked the Google people, "Did I hear correctly?
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:27.660]   If a publisher doesn't put a plus one on the page, search results will suffer."
[01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:31.740]   The salespeople in the meeting said, "Yes, but they're salespeople."
[01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:32.740]   So she did the right thing.
[01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:34.380]   She went to public relations.
[01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:36.500]   She said, "I'm a reporter.
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:38.100]   Here's what I heard in a meeting.
[01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:39.140]   Did I understand correctly?
[01:15:39.140 --> 01:15:41.180]   The press office confirmed it.
[01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:47.060]   They preferred to say the plus button, "influences the ranking, but they did not deny what the
[01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:48.060]   salespeople told me.
[01:15:48.060 --> 01:15:52.220]   If you don't feature the plus one button, your stories will be harder to find on Google."
[01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:57.460]   So she published a story, "Stick Google plus buttons on your pages or your search traffic
[01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:00.180]   suffers."
[01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:02.180]   She got called in the carpet.
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:03.180]   Her boss said, "Wait a minute.
[01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:04.500]   That was an NDA meeting.
[01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:05.860]   You're not allowed to write about it."
[01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:08.140]   Her boss at Forbes?
[01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:09.700]   Or her boss?
[01:16:09.700 --> 01:16:10.700]   People flipped out.
[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:12.500]   This was in 2011.
[01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:16.340]   They didn't challenge the accuracy of the reporting, but they called and said, "You have to unpublish
[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:19.420]   the story because the meeting was confidential."
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:22.180]   The information discussed there had been subject to a non-disclosure.
[01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:23.460]   She hadn't signed the meeting.
[01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:24.980]   They had an NDA.
[01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:26.980]   She hadn't been told the meeting was confidential.
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:30.140]   She at the meeting said, "I'm a reporter."
[01:16:30.140 --> 01:16:36.060]   She said, "I was told," and this is the point you were asking, "I was told by my higher-ups
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:39.340]   at Forbes that Google representatives called them saying the article was problematic and
[01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:41.820]   had to come down.
[01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:46.340]   It might have consequences for Forbes."
[01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:49.500]   She said, "I thought it was an important story, but I didn't want to cause problems for Forbes."
[01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:53.380]   I think, by the way, her boss is coming to her is in effect putting pressure on her,
[01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:56.340]   whether they said, "Take it down or not."
[01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:57.340]   That's putting pressure.
[01:16:57.340 --> 01:17:00.940]   It's going to hurt us.
[01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:04.860]   Given that I've gone to the PR team and it was already out in the world, I felt it made
[01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:06.540]   more sense to keep the story up.
[01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:11.340]   But after continued pressure for my bosses, I took the piece down, Kashmir Hill, who's
[01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:15.500]   very respected, said, "A decision I will always regret.
[01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:16.900]   Forbes declined comment about this."
[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:21.020]   I presume currently when she contacted them.
[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:25.820]   The most disturbing part of the experience, what came next, that story disappeared from
[01:17:25.820 --> 01:17:30.900]   Google's search results.
[01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:32.180]   You couldn't find that story.
[01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:33.980]   If you search for it today, you won't find it.
[01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:35.420]   The story came down.
[01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:39.660]   The story came down, but more importantly, Google scrubbed the search results.
[01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:41.340]   Why wouldn't they find the picture?
[01:17:41.340 --> 01:17:42.340]   No, no, no.
[01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:46.140]   You should still have a reference to that, even if the story isn't there anymore, right?
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:47.140]   Well, not a page.
[01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:48.140]   It doesn't exist.
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:50.140]   Now, you might refer to the art discussions about it.
[01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:54.740]   But the article goes on to say it had been mirrored on other sites and it wasn't found
[01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:55.740]   there.
[01:17:55.740 --> 01:17:58.940]   She says it was unusual websites captured by Google's crawl into a not-ten-a-vanish.
[01:17:58.940 --> 01:17:59.940]   Yeah, it was mirrored.
[01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:01.940]   Yeah, they didn't know she didn't not pick that.
[01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:06.580]   And then, so deliberate, she felt that that was evidence that they had, I don't know if
[01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:10.700]   it's probative or not, but that was evidence that Google manipulated search results to eliminate
[01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:12.700]   references to a story.
[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:17.540]   To me, that's not so much the issue as Google saying, "Take that story down."
[01:18:17.540 --> 01:18:21.940]   Well, part of the question also, I mean, if she was in a meeting, it should have been
[01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:24.700]   clear one way or the other if she was under a non-disclosure.
[01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:30.260]   I mean, that, by the way, I will disclose right now, Google supports my nonprofit and
[01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:31.260]   I write for Forbes.
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:32.940]   I'm in a funny position on this one.
[01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:37.700]   But so I go into meetings all the time with Google under NDA, but I always make it very
[01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:39.940]   clear, "Am I under NDA?
[01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:40.940]   And if I am, I am if I'm not--"
[01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:41.940]   This is always challenging.
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:47.020]   In fact, I refuse to sign NDAs or embargoes of any kind because, partly because I have
[01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:49.660]   a leaky memory and I'm talking a lot.
[01:18:49.660 --> 01:18:50.660]   It's hard to remember.
[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:53.100]   So I prefer not to be happy encumbered by that.
[01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:58.300]   But if I went to a meeting unwittingly that there was an NDA on and then was then asked
[01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:00.780]   to not report it, that would be a problem.
[01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:04.820]   If they didn't tell you with an ND, especially a sales meeting, I assume that anything in
[01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:05.820]   a single--
[01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:08.020]   Well, that's also why I try not to go to sales meetings, right?
[01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:11.780]   You write anything they say in a sales call is to the aim of selling something.
[01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:12.780]   I would think that--
[01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:14.780]   I think NDAs is not the big issue here.
[01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:16.420]   We get to unpack the issue.
[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:20.620]   So there's the issue of whether or not it's a good thing or not or legal or not.
[01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:24.340]   If it's literally true that adding the plus one button, that not adding it would hurt
[01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:25.340]   your social results, right?
[01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:27.940]   There's the actual facts of the story and whether or not that's problematic.
[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:30.060]   And I'm not sure whether it is or not.
[01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:34.180]   Then there's a sort of general nonsense about NDAs, which if you go to a meeting at almost
[01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:37.180]   any of these companies offices, you're signing NDAs just to get in the building.
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:39.180]   Most of those sign in into NDAs.
[01:19:39.180 --> 01:19:40.180]   Yeah, right.
[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:41.180]   And the journal is for that meaningless thing.
[01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:42.180]   It's all meaningless.
[01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:46.340]   NDAs in general are bullish.
[01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:51.700]   But the story is, is it OK for Google, which is a private company, to say, hey, we're rolling
[01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:54.540]   out this product and using it is going to help your search results.
[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:58.580]   There's a second piece, which is it OK for a reporter to write that in the negative.
[01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:01.900]   There's a third piece, which is, is it OK for her to be pressured to remove it?
[01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:03.700]   I mean, those are all the topics.
[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:05.700]   The NDAs are the least interesting part of this for me.
[01:20:05.700 --> 01:20:10.180]   Well, the only part that I find interesting is whether or not this discrepancy, whether
[01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:12.060]   she thought she was under NDAs was.
[01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:13.060]   Well, you're right.
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:14.740]   I mean, other issues are just as trouble.
[01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:16.100]   She did get a communication.
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:20.740]   This was added to the article after the fact from Google's Vice President of Global Communications,
[01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:24.860]   Rob Shilkin, who said very clearly, we had nothing to do with removing the article from
[01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:25.860]   the cache.
[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:27.300]   That did not happen.
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:29.580]   And there's no evidence that that did happen.
[01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:33.340]   Just anecdotal reporting that it might have happened.
[01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:34.700]   And I thought he wrote a good article.
[01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:39.180]   He said, from our perspective, or rather, a good note to Kashmir, in which he said, we've
[01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:40.860]   enjoyed working respectfully with you.
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:44.740]   And they're sad to hear you've carried this since 2011, which I think is a good, good
[01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:45.740]   way to start.
[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:51.660]   From our perspective, this was a disagreement over whether the meeting was held under non-disclosure.
[01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:55.580]   We thought you had been told that had we known you hadn't been told that we would, of
[01:20:55.580 --> 01:21:00.180]   course, have mentioned that because, like most of our client meetings that discuss new
[01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:03.260]   features, this is a non-disclosure.
[01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:04.740]   We don't want reporters to hear this.
[01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:05.740]   This is a client meeting.
[01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:07.140]   Makes sense.
[01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:10.940]   Your editor, Grady, told our PR rep the articles being removed because it involved reporting
[01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:15.060]   on an NDA meeting.
[01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:18.900]   He says, as for the Google cache, it's easy for a website or owner to request the cache
[01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:19.900]   be cleared.
[01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:23.500]   It's very possible that the editor merely put in a request that is automated, by the
[01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:26.100]   way, on the Google tools, Webmaster tools.
[01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:29.020]   But he said, we had nothing to do with removing it.
[01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:31.500]   Maybe your editor did.
[01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:36.860]   And so this was actually a very conciliatory letter from Rob.
[01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:43.100]   I have to say, just like the previous story from New York Times, there's no smoking gun.
[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:47.740]   It's very much circumstantial that something might have happened.
[01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:48.740]   So the headline...
[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:53.900]   I feel like she was very clear in her piece, too, saying, "Look, I can't definitively
[01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:54.900]   know this.
[01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:57.420]   This is what I can find from what I know."
[01:21:57.420 --> 01:22:04.700]   So I think rather than get into what exactly the situation was, Leo, you've run an independent
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:06.100]   media company.
[01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:12.140]   And I think that you probably have very strong feelings about there essentially being a duopoly
[01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:16.820]   on how news articles get spread in 2017.
[01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:20.420]   You have Facebook, and you have Google results.
[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:27.460]   And that is such a critical component of any media organization getting things out there
[01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:30.980]   that I think that's really worth thinking about.
[01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:31.980]   I also...
[01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:35.460]   I know so many Google engineers.
[01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:37.420]   I know...
[01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:41.700]   The Google engineers, I know, are genuinely socially conscious.
[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:46.420]   They are genuinely people that want to make the world better with the tools that they have.
[01:22:46.420 --> 01:22:48.420]   And I kind of...
[01:22:48.420 --> 01:22:55.260]   My gut goes off a little bit with insinuating that the work that they're doing is evil.
[01:22:55.260 --> 01:23:02.380]   Tim Cook, even last week, came out with a very thoughtful piece from a reporter that
[01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:03.980]   ran into him over breakfast.
[01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:10.300]   And Tim Cook was talking about how a government being able to tackle fewer and fewer things
[01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:16.140]   from his perspective, like corporate leaders, had more of a role to step up and help serve
[01:23:16.140 --> 01:23:17.140]   the public good.
[01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:24.780]   You think there are a lot of people at Google that genuinely think like that and want to
[01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:26.460]   do the right thing.
[01:23:26.460 --> 01:23:31.980]   But I do think it's very concerning when you essentially have two media companies having
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:35.700]   a duopoly on how news is spread.
[01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:42.340]   And for me, I think if I had to write companies down to good guys and bad guys, I think overall,
[01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:45.220]   Google would be probably my good guy category.
[01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:47.740]   I think they do a lot of really important work.
[01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:54.300]   But I do think this is something we should really think carefully about as a society.
[01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:56.300]   The power issue is concerning me, right?
[01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:59.180]   So I mean, as I mentioned before, Google is a supporter of my nonprofit.
[01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:00.940]   And I will tell you, they've been good.
[01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:02.420]   And I don't agree with them on everything.
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:04.340]   I've criticized them publicly.
[01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:06.380]   I do worry about the amount of power that Google has.
[01:24:06.380 --> 01:24:08.700]   I worry about the amount of information they have.
[01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:12.620]   Not so much that they're going to do evil with it right now, but the fact that this information
[01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:13.860]   is being warehoused.
[01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:18.220]   I worry about a future leader in our country, a government, whether it's ours or someone
[01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:23.500]   else's getting into that data, whether legally or illegally and abusing it.
[01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:30.700]   But at the same time, Google has been very good about funding my nonprofit and not getting
[01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:33.460]   all upset every time I say something critical and same thing with Facebook.
[01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:35.700]   And it's really hard because I like you.
[01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:37.580]   You take ads from some of these companies, right?
[01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:41.980]   Well, we try not to take ads from a couple of them.
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:44.940]   Microsoft, Apple and Google.
[01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:46.180]   Do you think I've read them to the lecture?
[01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:47.660]   Yeah, it would be difficult.
[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:51.420]   But at the same time, we also have to assert, we take ads from a lot of companies we cover
[01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:55.260]   and we have to assert that there is a wall-between editorial and advertising.
[01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:57.220]   And have you ever gotten pressure?
[01:24:57.220 --> 01:24:58.220]   No.
[01:24:58.220 --> 01:24:59.220]   Never.
[01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:00.220]   I may think.
[01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:01.220]   No, I don't think so.
[01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:02.220]   People have complained.
[01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:03.980]   People have been mad at me, but I don't care about that.
[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:05.620]   I mean, this is straightforward.
[01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:09.460]   I think unambiguously, the world is better off because Google exists in it.
[01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:10.460]   Absolutely.
[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:14.140]   Something that is a perfect company doesn't mean that there's not examples of it, of people
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:16.300]   in Google or even the company is self-acting poorly.
[01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:21.060]   But to me, there's not even close to a difficult decision.
[01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:26.100]   Like, of course, the world is much better right now because Google is in it and because
[01:25:26.100 --> 01:25:30.020]   Apple is in it and because Facebook is in it for all the flows of the companies.
[01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:35.060]   But wouldn't the world be a better place if Google just stuck to search and didn't have
[01:25:35.060 --> 01:25:39.660]   a content arm with YouTube and didn't have a shopping arm and didn't.
[01:25:39.660 --> 01:25:41.620]   In other words, I would love Google.
[01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:42.620]   I've always thought this.
[01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:43.860]   Google, I look, I agree.
[01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:44.860]   I have friends at Google.
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:47.940]   I am very impressed by Google ethics.
[01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:50.020]   But I think they do believe don't be evil.
[01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:54.060]   But I think Google would, we would be better off if Google didn't have its fingers in so
[01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:55.060]   many ways.
[01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:56.060]   Well, on the other hand.
[01:25:56.060 --> 01:25:59.140]   If they were just a search engine and did everything they could to be the best search
[01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:03.540]   engine possible, we would still get the benefit, all that benefit that you're talking about
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:05.580]   without these concerns.
[01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:06.580]   What about Android?
[01:26:06.580 --> 01:26:07.580]   Yeah.
[01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:08.580]   Right.
[01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:09.580]   Android is.
[01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:10.580]   It's separate.
[01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:12.100]   YouTube, because well, YouTube is awesome.
[01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:14.900]   And I'm glad I think the world is better off because we have YouTube.
[01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:16.180]   But I don't think it should be owned by Google.
[01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:19.940]   And second of all, that money that they make with search is helping to fund Waymo, which
[01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:24.660]   is their automatic driverless car company, which is going to save lives.
[01:26:24.660 --> 01:26:27.780]   Well, first of all, I don't get a vote and what Google answer doesn't know.
[01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:28.780]   Right.
[01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:29.780]   But I'm just saying.
[01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:32.980]   I'm pointing out that some of the problems we run into with Google come from the fact
[01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:35.900]   that it does have so many fingers and so many pies.
[01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:41.940]   And as a result, the power, the awesome power of its search engine, there's a huge risk
[01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:42.940]   here.
[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:45.780]   It can be misused because of these other businesses.
[01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:49.020]   So that's, and look, they're going to do what they're going to do, which is maximize
[01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:50.020]   profit.
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:52.740]   That's what all American corporations do.
[01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:54.500]   And that means owning YouTube.
[01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:56.940]   Look, I think the Android start in Waymo.
[01:26:56.940 --> 01:27:00.340]   My good friend, Walt Mossberg, who many of you know, right, Eastern, right, the world's
[01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:01.980]   general, is always making fun of me.
[01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:02.980]   He's an Android phone.
[01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:06.980]   He thinks that I'm basically giving away my privacy and somehow thinks that because he
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:08.300]   owns an iPhone, he's not.
[01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:09.780]   And there may be some truth to that.
[01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:11.940]   Apple and Google have a different business model.
[01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:15.740]   But that does give me some cause of concern, right?
[01:27:15.740 --> 01:27:16.740]   Me too.
[01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:20.100]   The amount of information that one company has simply because I walk around with this
[01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:21.100]   thing.
[01:27:21.100 --> 01:27:23.100]   So that's another reason why we need to be concerned.
[01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:25.540]   There's no accident that these two articles appeared this week.
[01:27:25.540 --> 01:27:30.780]   I think people are more and more aware of the fact that Google, because it has tendrils
[01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:32.580]   in everything we do.
[01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:40.660]   Partly because it's so vastly useful, knows a whole lot about us, has a massive database.
[01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:43.220]   And we're starting to understand what big data can mean.
[01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:45.100]   But the articles did appear, right?
[01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:46.940]   And everyone's talking about them.
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:47.940]   I know that's good.
[01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:48.940]   Right.
[01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:49.940]   And like this is the check.
[01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:50.940]   It isn't, it's just not.
[01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:51.940]   There needs to be a check.
[01:27:51.940 --> 01:27:56.780]   Off the top 20 problems or dangers in the world, Google potentially suppressing search
[01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:59.460]   results, which they probably didn't do about.
[01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:01.500]   No, but it's a symptom.
[01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:02.820]   And I agree.
[01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:03.820]   I agree with you.
[01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:07.260]   It's not a massive moral risk.
[01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:13.460]   However, there is a massive moral risk because of this database, because of what Google knows.
[01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:17.100]   At some point that it could be vast, really misused.
[01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:18.100]   This is the least of it.
[01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:21.180]   Preasuring journalists not to run articles is the least of it.
[01:28:21.180 --> 01:28:27.540]   But the point is the articles, especially this foundation study, are really about this
[01:28:27.540 --> 01:28:28.540]   monopoly.
[01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:33.580]   I think that there's probably some evidence whether conscious or unconscious Google would
[01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:37.620]   like to suppress the conversation about, are you too powerful?
[01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:38.620]   Right?
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:41.500]   I mean, that's what's happening in the U and it's got to be scary for them.
[01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:43.420]   Facebook has the same issue.
[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:46.100]   Frankly, Amazon is going to have this issue any day now.
[01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:51.420]   If it isn't already, it's got its fingers in every economic transaction we make practically.
[01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:53.660]   The new monopoly is definitely data.
[01:28:53.660 --> 01:28:54.660]   Yeah.
[01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:55.820]   So it's access to data, access to API.
[01:28:55.820 --> 01:28:57.620]   My point is definitely the new monopoly.
[01:28:57.620 --> 01:29:01.620]   And the way to cure it is to democratize access.
[01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:06.980]   It's a completely already lost game to try to limit the data.
[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:08.620]   You're never going to be able to keep things secret.
[01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:12.260]   You're never going to be able to prevent everyone from finding out about stuff.
[01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:16.420]   The only thing we can do is make sure that no company has a monopoly on it, that the
[01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:18.420]   data is as freely available as possible.
[01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:20.580]   Does Google not have an effective monopoly?
[01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:23.380]   No, I don't think so.
[01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:24.380]   I don't think of it.
[01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:25.380]   Oh, I do.
[01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:26.540]   I do.
[01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:32.300]   I think they definitely have some advantages.
[01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:37.460]   But I think that there's tons of startups, there's tons of companies that can do meaningful
[01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:42.780]   things, that can create good products, that can put pressure on Google and Facebook and
[01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:46.140]   all the other companies that have a lot of data to make that accessible.
[01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:52.140]   I think the next generation in anti-monopoly legislation, when you get to Congress, the
[01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:57.260]   next version of anti-monopoly, antitrust legislation should have nothing to do with the ownership
[01:29:57.260 --> 01:29:59.060]   of companies.
[01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:01.300]   Companies in general are increasingly archaic.
[01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:03.060]   It has to do with access to data.
[01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:06.300]   So we'll see anti-trust laws that guarantee data access.
[01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:07.300]   We should.
[01:30:07.300 --> 01:30:08.300]   I would agree with that.
[01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:12.900]   But you're talking out like a check on the power here.
[01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:15.620]   For me, I'm on this show today.
[01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:18.740]   You're talking about Sonic as an ISP provider.
[01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:24.420]   Leo Handigott, I'm seeing her going, can I talk about Verizon and how much money they
[01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:30.740]   give to members of Congress to basically buy certain policies on these committees.
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:35.460]   So if you want to talk about a check and a balance, it is factual.
[01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:40.340]   If you look at the 15 people on the House Subcommittee, they effectively set technology
[01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:42.980]   policy in the United States.
[01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:46.460]   The big telecom companies give them a lot of money.
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:48.300]   That is just a mathematical fact.
[01:30:48.300 --> 01:30:50.900]   I think that weakens that check.
[01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:52.860]   So I agree with you.
[01:30:52.860 --> 01:31:00.100]   And I think that if Google, we made a decision with AT&T when I was a teenager to allow other
[01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:06.500]   people access to that infrastructure if they paid for it, I think that it overall, I think
[01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:07.820]   it was a good move.
[01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:13.060]   I can see us doing something like that with Google to democratize this information.
[01:31:13.060 --> 01:31:20.220]   But my concern is right now you have some very powerful technology companies that have
[01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:23.700]   basically bought the legislation that they want.
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:28.260]   And I don't believe our current representation in Congress is able to provide a competent
[01:31:28.260 --> 01:31:30.260]   check on these business practices.
[01:31:30.260 --> 01:31:32.420]   Yeah, it's not just Google.
[01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:35.140]   That's the problem with our nutshell.
[01:31:35.140 --> 01:31:41.860]   But that nutshell is because our government is so useless, not because our companies are
[01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:42.860]   doing anything wrong.
[01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:48.380]   That's because Congress hasn't done a single useful thing in the past decade or two.
[01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:50.220]   I would disagree with that.
[01:31:50.220 --> 01:31:58.340]   But I do think there's a serious concern that the power of money in Congress is corrupting.
[01:31:58.340 --> 01:32:02.540]   And everything else, just the general incompetence and low quality of the vast majority people
[01:32:02.540 --> 01:32:03.540]   in Congress.
[01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:08.380]   Let's face it, all government has ever been going back to 1776 is to preserve the interests
[01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:09.900]   of the elites and the landowners.
[01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:12.820]   I mean, that's all it's ever been.
[01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:17.820]   But Congress government never represents the poorest people of the country.
[01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:18.820]   They try to.
[01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:20.020]   And I think there's some altruists.
[01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:23.700]   And I know Brianna will be one of them in Congress that will think about that a little
[01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:24.700]   bit.
[01:32:24.700 --> 01:32:28.580]   But there are ultimately, regardless of the influence of money in politics, that's what
[01:32:28.580 --> 01:32:30.540]   government is about is preserving the-
[01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:34.540]   The United States is almost unique in the amount of money that politicians have to spend
[01:32:34.540 --> 01:32:35.540]   to get elected.
[01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:36.540]   Oh, it's outrageous.
[01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:37.540]   It's absolutely outrageous.
[01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:38.820]   And also how long the campaigns go on.
[01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:42.180]   I honestly think nothing will ever happen until we have a campaign finance review.
[01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:43.180]   Even the period.
[01:32:43.180 --> 01:32:44.180]   And very elastic.
[01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:45.180]   That's what he ran.
[01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:47.180]   I was his campaign platform single point.
[01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:48.180]   Why?
[01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:51.300]   In fact, he'll tell you if you had my job, yeah, if you had my job and you actually had
[01:32:51.300 --> 01:32:55.500]   to go out there raising money, it is so much worse than you can know until you've actually
[01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:56.500]   done this job.
[01:32:56.500 --> 01:33:00.900]   And ultimately, if somebody comes to you from a telecom and says, "Here's a $10,000
[01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:06.020]   check," it's, you know, look, I spend most of my time fending off public relations,
[01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:10.180]   people funding off companies that want to send us products, people, you know, I mean,
[01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:14.980]   my job is to try to maintain as much as possible an objectivity about the cup, stuff I cover.
[01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:19.020]   I can't even imagine what it would be like to be a member of Congress and have this huge
[01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:20.780]   burden of campaign financing.
[01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:22.940]   No one's forcing you to do it.
[01:33:22.940 --> 01:33:23.940]   Right?
[01:33:23.940 --> 01:33:26.860]   Like, it's a crappy job with a bunch of locality people.
[01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:27.860]   Like, okay.
[01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:28.860]   Well, actually, I don't understand.
[01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:31.460]   You said, "You're telling Brianna that she's nuts to run for comments?"
[01:33:31.460 --> 01:33:34.540]   I think you're taking a big step down going from, you know, a podcast or an engineer to
[01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:35.540]   have been a business, yeah.
[01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:36.540]   I disagree.
[01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:37.540]   I disagree.
[01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:38.540]   I think it's a...
[01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:41.500]   Yeah, there's somebody who wants to make a difference.
[01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:42.500]   Teachers have a calling.
[01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:44.060]   I think public service is a calling.
[01:33:44.060 --> 01:33:45.060]   Absolutely.
[01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:46.060]   And they do.
[01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:50.700]   And, you know, the way we got to this point with a do-nothing Congress is because the worst
[01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:54.340]   people are the ones out there engaging in the system.
[01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:56.060]   So I think you're right.
[01:33:56.060 --> 01:34:01.540]   And something I ask myself every single day doing this is how the frack I can do this
[01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:05.940]   job and keep my integrity and keep like the cool work of who I am.
[01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:06.940]   Because it's...
[01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:12.900]   I tell you, until you do this, until you spend the entire day on the phone fundraising,
[01:34:12.900 --> 01:34:16.700]   until you have like powerful business interests calling you, it's...
[01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:19.060]   Well, so don't...
[01:34:19.060 --> 01:34:20.060]   It's...
[01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:21.660]   Don't spend the entire day on the phone fundraising.
[01:34:21.660 --> 01:34:22.660]   Don't buy into the non-sensational...
[01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:23.660]   You have to raise money.
[01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:30.500]   You have to raise money because you have to have the staff and it's very expensive to
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:31.500]   have the staff.
[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:32.500]   But you're right.
[01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.940]   I'm not going to be able to raise as much money as my opponent.
[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:35.940]   Yeah.
[01:34:35.940 --> 01:34:39.620]   I kind of think that there's really very little evidence that the amount of money raises directly
[01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:40.620]   correlated to the success.
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:41.620]   I think there's been a lot of...
[01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:42.620]   Oh, it's been a lot of...
[01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:45.620]   Yeah, it was a great expensive elections lost.
[01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:47.420]   I think this is just like...
[01:34:47.420 --> 01:34:51.580]   I don't know exactly why you need that much money, what you would spend it on.
[01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:55.700]   I think having a good message using the current platforms to make sure that everyone hears
[01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:57.500]   it, connecting at a level like...
[01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:01.940]   Yeah, maybe there's an opportunity now thanks to the Internet.
[01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:02.940]   Thanks to these companies, which are...
[01:35:02.940 --> 01:35:03.940]   It's a good to communicate directly to users.
[01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:05.940]   It's thanks to Google and Facebook.
[01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:10.380]   That's why I keep saying the world is better off than it's ever been largely because of
[01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:11.620]   these companies.
[01:35:11.620 --> 01:35:16.020]   The last thing I want to do is tie their level of innovation and improvement to the world
[01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:19.020]   to the lowest common denominator, which is our government.
[01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:20.380]   No, I agree 100%.
[01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:23.620]   Just because current Congress can't do anything doesn't mean that we should get companies
[01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:25.180]   to stop actually including the world.
[01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:30.260]   I grew up at a time when politicians, lawyers and journalists were actually respected.
[01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:31.260]   And...
[01:35:31.260 --> 01:35:32.260]   I have no memory of that.
[01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:33.260]   That's never happened.
[01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:35.580]   At some point, I remember...
[01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:39.140]   Maybe I was a lawyer and I had tremendous respect for the profession.
[01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:40.140]   And by the way...
[01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:42.140]   There's a lot more disrespect than there used to be an audience.
[01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:43.620]   If you need a lawyer, I'll call your dad.
[01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:44.620]   I'll call your dad.
[01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:45.620]   Yeah, I'll leave dad.
[01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:46.620]   Oh, well, I...
[01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:48.620]   That's not the kind of representation I'll be getting.
[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:49.620]   Right.
[01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:50.620]   But no, I mean, I...
[01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:55.260]   So I don't know if all of our members of Congress or most of them are low quality people
[01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:58.780]   or not, or if they're just in a profession which is so burdened by...
[01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:00.580]   Well, there's an ability to get anything done.
[01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:01.580]   The other big story...
[01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:02.580]   The other big story...
[01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:06.900]   The other large story is not a text story, but gerrymandering is a huge problem in this
[01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:07.900]   country.
[01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:12.380]   I'm very curious what your experience is going to be, Branna, when you do get elected.
[01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:13.900]   You have what experience now.
[01:36:13.900 --> 01:36:15.980]   Wait till you go into Congress.
[01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:19.820]   And you're dealing with those members of Congress in gerrymandered districts that are locked
[01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:25.900]   for them as long as they can beat the lowest common denominator in the primary.
[01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:28.180]   And that changes the equation 100%.
[01:36:28.180 --> 01:36:32.620]   And I think that's one of the reasons we have such a terrible Congress is that Congress
[01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:37.220]   got to decide the electoral districts.
[01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:38.940]   They were the ones who got to...
[01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:39.940]   That's insane.
[01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:41.980]   It's the states that do that.
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:42.980]   I mean, the state...
[01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:45.180]   Well, it's legislators and parties, essentially.
[01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:47.380]   Yeah, let's be honest.
[01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:50.100]   Both parties and both parties are guilty of this.
[01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:52.300]   Like they keep us yelling at each other.
[01:36:52.300 --> 01:36:56.540]   Both parties have like separated up the country into their little systems.
[01:36:56.540 --> 01:37:02.900]   And only if I'm remembering correctly, it's 5% to 10% of races are classified as competitive
[01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:04.820]   in any given election.
[01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:06.260]   That is a broken system.
[01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:07.620]   We are all in technology.
[01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:09.020]   We believe in competition.
[01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:11.260]   We believe in the best idea of winning.
[01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:13.140]   They've ranked the game.
[01:37:13.140 --> 01:37:14.500]   And I think you're dead on.
[01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:18.720]   We've got to have campaign financial reform, or nothing is going to substantively get better
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:20.660]   with our technology policy.
[01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:25.340]   And yet, and yet with all of this, world's still better in almost every measurable way
[01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:26.340]   than it's ever been.
[01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:28.980]   And it's not because the government has done stuff about technology.
[01:37:28.980 --> 01:37:31.060]   It's because of technology, because of the companies.
[01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:35.140]   We've also lived in a funny time when the companies are more progressive than many people
[01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:36.140]   in government.
[01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:39.580]   I mean, the LGBT issue, even Walmart came out on the right side of the issue.
[01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:42.340]   That's why that's Tim Cook interview is very interesting.
[01:37:42.340 --> 01:37:43.820]   I agree with you, Phil.
[01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:51.860]   I think it's absolutely the case that the risk of overreacting to the kinds of pressures
[01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:58.100]   Google can offer or the privacy invasions that Google can offer is that we will eschew
[01:37:58.100 --> 01:37:59.100]   technology.
[01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:02.980]   We'll go backwards out of Jeff Jarvis calls it techno panic.
[01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:04.300]   Yeah, to a worse place.
[01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:05.300]   To a worse place.
[01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:06.300]   So I agree with you.
[01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:07.700]   This is a balance.
[01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:11.360]   We do want some controls on this stuff, but we don't want to do it to the point when people
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:15.700]   say, "Oh, don't use Android because it's not safe."
[01:38:15.700 --> 01:38:19.660]   My reaction is, "Well, I don't want to step backwards in technology just because of some
[01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:23.020]   imagined harm that could be occurring."
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:28.260]   I think that that's really always a risk as well as people overreact and hold us back.
[01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:33.460]   There's a general well understood cognitive bias, which is that you sound smarter when
[01:38:33.460 --> 01:38:34.460]   you're negative.
[01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:35.860]   You sound smarter when you criticize something.
[01:38:35.860 --> 01:38:37.740]   You sound smarter when you raise the alarm.
[01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:41.940]   It's hard to actually be in favor of something, to be positive and sound as smart as someone
[01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:42.940]   who's criticizing you.
[01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:44.940]   Donald Trump must be the smartest man in the world.
[01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:47.180]   He's got a sound like him right now.
[01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:50.700]   Actually, I think Devorak figured that rule out very early.
[01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:56.100]   But his strategy was, "Whatever it is, I don't like it.
[01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:57.100]   I'm against it."
[01:38:57.100 --> 01:38:59.100]   I think that's right.
[01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:01.020]   But you generally win with that by the way.
[01:39:01.020 --> 01:39:03.180]   It's technology because most stuff is going to be scrapped.
[01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:07.580]   This is the biggest source of poor, ultimately poor decisions is just the negativity bias.
[01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:13.620]   Because it's harder to be rigorously optimistic than to be finding small examples, taking
[01:39:13.620 --> 01:39:18.700]   a lot of context or at least out of proportion and being negative about it.
[01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:21.260]   It feels good to sit around and whine about things.
[01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:22.260]   It just does.
[01:39:22.260 --> 01:39:27.020]   I do think that part of Donald Trump's success during the campaign was the fact that he complained
[01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:31.860]   and belittled so many things that were happening, some of which probably needed belittling,
[01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:33.460]   but a lot of it didn't need belittling.
[01:39:33.460 --> 01:39:39.140]   Somebody in the chat room just asked, "What happened to the vast election fraud?"
[01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:43.540]   He belittled the entire electoral system and yet was able to game it.
[01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:47.620]   I think there's an experience that I think almost all smart people have.
[01:39:47.620 --> 01:39:50.620]   I'm sure pretty much everyone here has had this at some point.
[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:52.220]   You guys probably remember when you first had it.
[01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:56.940]   There's this experience that I think I remember I had it probably in college where I call
[01:39:56.940 --> 01:39:59.180]   it the "There are no adults" realization.
[01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:06.180]   At some point you realize, "You go from thinking, "Well, I'm just a kid."
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:09.180]   And there's all these other magical beings called adults and they know what they're doing
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:10.500]   and they're taking care of things.
[01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:14.060]   And then at some point you say, "Wow, no one knows what they're doing."
[01:40:14.060 --> 01:40:15.340]   It's just people like us.
[01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:16.340]   There are no adults.
[01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:17.340]   It's a great state of jobs.
[01:40:17.340 --> 01:40:18.740]   That's what the world is going through right now.
[01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:22.680]   I wish I could remember it word for word, but in which he basically said at one point
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:27.460]   he realized that the world, everything in the world was made up by somebody not any
[01:40:27.460 --> 01:40:29.220]   smarter than he was.
[01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:34.500]   So there was nothing holding him back from doing whatever he wanted to do.
[01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:37.180]   But this is a healthy realization.
[01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:41.020]   This is happening at a national level.
[01:40:41.020 --> 01:40:42.220]   It's just happening all over the world.
[01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:46.020]   The best thing to come out of the Trump presidency is going to be this realization that there
[01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:47.660]   are no adults.
[01:40:47.660 --> 01:40:51.020]   Obama is not around to magically do stuff for everyone.
[01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:52.220]   You have to do it yourself.
[01:40:52.220 --> 01:40:56.620]   That means for companies, for voters, for individuals, for politicians, regardless of
[01:40:56.620 --> 01:41:00.420]   what your political affiliation is, this is the no adults realization that the entire
[01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:02.420]   world is going through.
[01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:06.420]   And it's a little bit unsettling, but I think ultimately it's a really positive thing.
[01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:09.500]   We're looking for a daddy.
[01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:10.500]   And there's no daddy.
[01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:11.500]   It's just us.
[01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:13.660]   I just look here and look at the light of me.
[01:41:13.660 --> 01:41:15.300]   That's a good start.
[01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:16.300]   We do promise.
[01:41:16.300 --> 01:41:19.820]   Can you name one politician who hasn't lied to you?
[01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:21.140]   I don't know.
[01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:22.140]   George Washington.
[01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:23.140]   Right?
[01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:24.860]   I mean, Rana Wu won't lie to you.
[01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:25.860]   I mean, that is horrible.
[01:41:25.860 --> 01:41:27.340]   I don't think I've ever lied to you, Larry.
[01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:29.740]   Not to me, but I'm not your constituency.
[01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:30.740]   No, but I'm serious.
[01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:35.740]   The idea that you can't trust what comes out of a leader's mouth is just horrendous to
[01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:36.740]   me.
[01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:38.220]   And it's both parties.
[01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:43.340]   I'm not blaming it on one particular individual party, but I believe everything Kim Jong Un
[01:41:43.340 --> 01:41:44.340]   says.
[01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:45.340]   I believe it all.
[01:41:45.340 --> 01:41:47.340]   Everything he says.
[01:41:47.340 --> 01:41:48.340]   That's true.
[01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:53.220]   The thing is though, because it's so hard sometimes to have an adult conversation when
[01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:54.220]   you're running for Congress.
[01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:55.580]   I'll give you an example.
[01:41:55.580 --> 01:42:00.700]   Today, a story came out with Harvey that Texas has $20 billion in the bank and they
[01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:05.700]   are passing on funding any of their own reconstruction, which means states like Massage
[01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:10.380]   Jesus in California and New York are going to pay to rebuild the state that's pretty
[01:42:10.380 --> 01:42:11.460]   well off.
[01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:14.980]   I feel like that is a little bit hypocritical.
[01:42:14.980 --> 01:42:19.780]   I was trying to talk about that on Twitter and you just get chewed out if you try to
[01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:23.260]   have a nuanced adult conversation.
[01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:29.660]   And you know, it's incredibly challenging because you want to be genuine to yourself
[01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:31.780]   and to your constituents.
[01:42:31.780 --> 01:42:37.740]   But I feel like it's hard in this climate that it's harder than it's ever been to have
[01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:40.620]   an honest discussion about problems.
[01:42:40.620 --> 01:42:45.960]   Because as someone running for office, I can't have as honest a discussion with the public
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:50.860]   sometimes as I can with say, you know, my engineering team about memory constraints
[01:42:50.860 --> 01:42:51.620]   with you know,
[01:42:51.620 --> 01:42:52.620]   That's true.
[01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:53.620]   Engineers.
[01:42:53.620 --> 01:42:55.140]   For every engineers, there's true and false.
[01:42:55.140 --> 01:42:56.140]   There's fact or fiction.
[01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:59.220]   And if you're an engineer, you have to deal in truths.
[01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:00.860]   Otherwise the bridge will fall down.
[01:43:00.860 --> 01:43:03.180]   There's just no middle ground.
[01:43:03.180 --> 01:43:07.980]   And yet people, I think we can't really blame politicians for lying to us because we beg
[01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:09.540]   them to lie to us.
[01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:11.060]   We want them to lie to us.
[01:43:11.060 --> 01:43:15.220]   And if you're a politician and I'd be very interested to Brianna and what ends up happening,
[01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:22.540]   there is intense pressure, I'm sure, to misrepresent or at least to oversimplify the challenges.
[01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:23.540]   Over simplify hugely.
[01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:24.540]   Huge.
[01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:25.540]   Yes, absolutely.
[01:43:25.540 --> 01:43:29.220]   We're going to take a break.
[01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:32.980]   We're watching this week in tech with a great panel, a very philosophical panel.
[01:43:32.980 --> 01:43:33.980]   I like it.
[01:43:33.980 --> 01:43:37.380]   Larry Maggot from CBS news radio and connect safely.org.
[01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:39.100]   Phil Libben founder of ever note.
[01:43:39.100 --> 01:43:42.540]   He's now running a AI incubator.
[01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:44.540]   No, what's the word you used?
[01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:46.100]   Studio studio studio.
[01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:47.100]   I like it.
[01:43:47.100 --> 01:43:48.100]   All turtles.
[01:43:48.100 --> 01:43:52.780]   Should people who have an AI idea come to you and say I want to what would you offer
[01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:53.780]   them?
[01:43:53.780 --> 01:43:56.940]   I really don't need more people.
[01:43:56.940 --> 01:43:59.940]   Go away.
[01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:02.500]   All dash turtles.com to find out what it is.
[01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:05.420]   When you Google all turtles you, in addition to getting a link to your site, you see a bunch
[01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:06.980]   of pretty turtles in the top of the story.
[01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:07.980]   A lot of good.
[01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:09.580]   There's like a turtle sanctuary that someone runs.
[01:44:09.580 --> 01:44:10.580]   Yeah, that's great.
[01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:11.580]   Yeah.
[01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:12.580]   No idea.
[01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:14.500]   Are turtles the best animal ever?
[01:44:14.500 --> 01:44:16.420]   They're protectionists though.
[01:44:16.420 --> 01:44:17.740]   Are you a turtle lover?
[01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:18.740]   Is that where?
[01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:20.580]   I know it comes from turtles all the way down.
[01:44:20.580 --> 01:44:21.580]   I know that.
[01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:23.140]   But who doesn't love turtles?
[01:44:23.140 --> 01:44:24.140]   I do like turtles.
[01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:25.140]   Yeah.
[01:44:25.140 --> 01:44:26.140]   There's something about them.
[01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:28.340]   All their head in.
[01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:32.060]   Also with this Brianna Wu, she is a space cat gal.
[01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:36.900]   She found a giant space cat game studio and is running as you probably gathered running
[01:44:36.900 --> 01:44:39.860]   for Congress Brianna Wu 2018.com.
[01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:42.940]   Someone pointed out the pandas are the best that I think they're right.
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:43.940]   Pandas are pretty good.
[01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:45.740]   Pandas are the best.
[01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:46.740]   Can't knock the panda.
[01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:48.100]   Yeah, I also hit chogs.
[01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:51.020]   They got bad breath though because all I do is eat eucalyptus all day.
[01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:52.740]   It's very stinky.
[01:44:52.740 --> 01:44:54.060]   Actually, no, is that the koala?
[01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:55.060]   Maybe that's the koala.
[01:44:55.060 --> 01:44:56.980]   Pandas eat bamboo.
[01:44:56.980 --> 01:44:57.980]   Bamboo.
[01:44:57.980 --> 01:44:58.980]   Bamboo.
[01:44:58.980 --> 01:45:00.340]   Have you ever held a koala?
[01:45:00.340 --> 01:45:01.340]   No.
[01:45:01.340 --> 01:45:02.340]   Man, they're potent.
[01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:07.100]   I'm not kidding yet.
[01:45:07.100 --> 01:45:08.500]   They're very aromatic.
[01:45:08.500 --> 01:45:12.620]   Maybe it would be the right word for that.
[01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:17.060]   We had a great week this week on Twitch and we've created a special enjoyable minute
[01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:20.060]   long video to celebrate it.
[01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:21.060]   Watch.
[01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:22.060]   Previously on Twitch.
[01:45:22.060 --> 01:45:23.740]   Normally it would be Steve Gibson.
[01:45:23.740 --> 01:45:26.340]   But I know somebody else is sitting in for Steve.
[01:45:26.340 --> 01:45:28.180]   I'm not changing my voice at all.
[01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:29.660]   There is something a little different.
[01:45:29.660 --> 01:45:33.500]   We're going to call you babyface from now on.
[01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:34.500]   Tech news today.
[01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:38.660]   Samika, you recently wrote about your favorite Amazon Echo skills are the best Amazon Echo
[01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:39.660]   skills.
[01:45:39.660 --> 01:45:41.380]   The tide stain remover skill.
[01:45:41.380 --> 01:45:44.660]   I can ask how to basically get rid of that that stain.
[01:45:44.660 --> 01:45:46.620]   Echo, open tide.
[01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:48.740]   What type of stain would you like to remove?
[01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:49.740]   Blood.
[01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:50.740]   Oh no.
[01:45:50.740 --> 01:45:51.740]   Blood stain.
[01:45:51.740 --> 01:45:52.740]   Let's clean that up.
[01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:55.100]   Okay, so do you think now I'm put on this list?
[01:45:55.100 --> 01:45:57.900]   Like she's removing blood from us?
[01:45:57.900 --> 01:45:58.900]   This week in Google.
[01:45:58.900 --> 01:46:05.420]   ASMR, the internet subculture of sounds that feel good is going mainstream.
[01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:09.420]   If I talk like this, you're a very soothing way.
[01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:11.620]   I'd like it a little bit.
[01:46:11.620 --> 01:46:12.620]   You're too.
[01:46:12.620 --> 01:46:14.900]   This week in low Irish talking.
[01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:15.900]   Twit.
[01:46:15.900 --> 01:46:16.900]   Twit.
[01:46:16.900 --> 01:46:18.980]   The happiest place on earth.
[01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:19.980]   They all have an idea.
[01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:20.980]   What?
[01:46:20.980 --> 01:46:21.980]   Let's cover this.
[01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:22.980]   Showery show.
[01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:27.100]   Let's shout every music we say.
[01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:29.340]   There's a few shows based on that, I think.
[01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:30.340]   I think so.
[01:46:30.340 --> 01:46:31.740]   Are you all right?
[01:46:31.740 --> 01:46:34.340]   Are you sure they brought you by WordPress.com?
[01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:36.580]   I've been a WordPress fanatic for years.
[01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:42.260]   I've set up my first WordPress site on my own server, mind you, in the 2000s and ran
[01:46:42.260 --> 01:46:43.260]   it for a long time.
[01:46:43.260 --> 01:46:46.820]   I found that it was a lot of work to keep my WordPress site running.
[01:46:46.820 --> 01:46:48.460]   That's when I went to WordPress.com.
[01:46:48.460 --> 01:46:50.100]   Let them do the hosting.
[01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:52.140]   Let them do the updates.
[01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:53.340]   Man, I love it.
[01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:55.780]   WordPress.com runs the same software.
[01:46:55.780 --> 01:47:00.700]   Some of the same guys who gave you WordPress, which runs 28% of all the websites in the
[01:47:00.700 --> 01:47:01.700]   world.
[01:47:01.700 --> 01:47:06.540]   In fact, WordPress.com VIP program has some of the best publications in the world.
[01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:08.140]   Quartz is built on WordPress.
[01:47:08.140 --> 01:47:10.620]   It's really amazing what you can do with WordPress.
[01:47:10.620 --> 01:47:15.620]   If you're a business and you don't have a website, do you really want Yelp to be the
[01:47:15.620 --> 01:47:18.300]   first thing people find when they Google your company's name?
[01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:19.300]   I don't think so.
[01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:20.300]   That's a bad idea.
[01:47:20.300 --> 01:47:22.380]   That's why you ought to make your own website.
[01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:25.340]   I know why you didn't because you don't want to be a webmaster.
[01:47:25.340 --> 01:47:26.740]   You don't want to get in all that.
[01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:27.740]   But this is easy.
[01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:32.020]   All you do is you go to WordPress.com, pick a template, hundreds of designs to choose from,
[01:47:32.020 --> 01:47:33.420]   and start typing.
[01:47:33.420 --> 01:47:35.420]   You'll get built-in search engine optimization.
[01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:37.260]   You'll get social sharing.
[01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:39.580]   The WordPress.com community is vast.
[01:47:39.580 --> 01:47:43.060]   You'll get a lot of favorites and likes from there and a lot of publicity.
[01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:46.300]   Plus, of course, expert-friendly support available seven days a week.
[01:47:46.300 --> 01:47:47.780]   They are the best.
[01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:52.260]   You see why 28% of all the websites in the world want to WordPress the most popular and
[01:47:52.260 --> 01:47:55.660]   most powerful site building platform.
[01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:57.740]   Go visit my site, leoloport.com.
[01:47:57.740 --> 01:48:01.260]   I'm not a WordPress master or anything, but I love it.
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:02.740]   100% of my sites run on WordPress.
[01:48:02.740 --> 01:48:03.740]   It's so easy.
[01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:04.740]   It's a powerful thing.
[01:48:04.740 --> 01:48:08.340]   It's been around for so long.
[01:48:08.340 --> 01:48:15.740]   It's such a standard that desktop tools that are available, the support, the programmers
[01:48:15.740 --> 01:48:19.060]   and the coders and the designers that can work with WordPress.
[01:48:19.060 --> 01:48:21.980]   It's a wonderful group of people.
[01:48:21.980 --> 01:48:22.980]   WordPress.com.
[01:48:22.980 --> 01:48:23.980]   Actually, we got a deal for you.
[01:48:23.980 --> 01:48:29.820]   If you go to WordPress.com/twit, you can get 15% off your brand new website.
[01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:30.820]   That's a very good deal.
[01:48:30.820 --> 01:48:31.820]   15% off.
[01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:36.740]   All you have to do is go to WordPress.com/twit.
[01:48:36.740 --> 01:48:39.900]   We are really happy to have WordPress as a sponsor.
[01:48:39.900 --> 01:48:40.900]   WordPress.com/twit.
[01:48:40.900 --> 01:48:47.060]   Oh, there's so many stories today and you guys are so great.
[01:48:47.060 --> 01:48:53.860]   I feel like I should give only the heavy-duty challenging stories to you.
[01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:58.660]   Let's talk about Uber's new CEO, shall we?
[01:48:58.660 --> 01:49:03.180]   This was something we were actually last week if you watched Twitch.
[01:49:03.180 --> 01:49:05.180]   We knew the board was meeting.
[01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:12.420]   We knew the candidates were Jeff M.L.T., former CEO of GE, Meg Whitman, former actually current
[01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:15.300]   CEO of HP, former CEO of EBA.
[01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:16.300]   HP Enterprise.
[01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:17.300]   HP Enterprise.
[01:49:17.300 --> 01:49:19.940]   A third, according to Cara Swisher, unnamed source.
[01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:20.940]   Well, guess who won?
[01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:27.700]   The third unnamed CEO who turns out to be, I think by all accounts, exactly the right
[01:49:27.700 --> 01:49:28.700]   person for the job.
[01:49:28.700 --> 01:49:31.580]   His name is Derek Koswashahi.
[01:49:31.580 --> 01:49:33.660]   He was at Expedia.
[01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:38.980]   If you read Ben Thompson's really excellent analysis on Stratecary, what he did at Expedia,
[01:49:38.980 --> 01:49:43.020]   which has essentially turned the company around from the ground up, not just adding a slap
[01:49:43.020 --> 01:49:47.260]   of code of paint on it, but really redesigning its business model.
[01:49:47.260 --> 01:49:48.460]   Do you have any experience of Dara?
[01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:49.460]   Do you know Dara film?
[01:49:49.460 --> 01:49:50.460]   I do know Dara.
[01:49:50.460 --> 01:49:53.460]   Yeah, not super well, but have met him a few times.
[01:49:53.460 --> 01:49:54.460]   What do you think?
[01:49:54.460 --> 01:49:55.460]   It's great.
[01:49:55.460 --> 01:49:56.620]   It's a really good candidate.
[01:49:56.620 --> 01:50:02.300]   I'm hopeful that anything Uber is one of the most important companies in the world and
[01:50:02.300 --> 01:50:04.820]   I'm hoping that this means that things turn around for them.
[01:50:04.820 --> 01:50:05.820]   We also know Travis.
[01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:06.820]   Yeah.
[01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:10.620]   So in all fairness, I know both of them.
[01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:11.620]   Yeah.
[01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:14.700]   And of course, there's a lawsuit still going on and there's all I mean, it's still kind
[01:50:14.700 --> 01:50:17.060]   of a mess.
[01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:19.220]   Some people are blaming the board at Uber.
[01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:23.860]   Now you've dealt with the board.
[01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:27.180]   Tell us first of all a little bit about the responsibility of a board of directors for
[01:50:27.180 --> 01:50:31.700]   a company, not a public company, but a soon to be public company like Uber.
[01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:33.500]   And certainly a unicorn like Uber.
[01:50:33.500 --> 01:50:34.900]   What is their job?
[01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:37.540]   The responsibility doesn't really change that much if you're private or public.
[01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:43.420]   It's to oversee the governance of the company to make sure that you boss the boss.
[01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:44.820]   You decide where the boss should be.
[01:50:44.820 --> 01:50:45.820]   Yeah.
[01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:49.340]   I think ultimately the only real job of the board is to figure out who's running the
[01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:50.340]   company.
[01:50:50.340 --> 01:50:51.740]   Everything else is sort of...
[01:50:51.740 --> 01:50:54.620]   If you advise the CEO?
[01:50:54.620 --> 01:50:55.620]   That's sort of a secondary thing.
[01:50:55.620 --> 01:50:59.140]   So I think the first thing is you decide where the CEO should be and then it's a secondary
[01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:01.460]   thing you advise to the accepted...
[01:51:01.460 --> 01:51:02.460]   That's necessary.
[01:51:02.460 --> 01:51:03.460]   You don't control...
[01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:04.460]   One of the things...
[01:51:04.460 --> 01:51:08.780]   Christopher Shahi did apparently in his deck that he presented the board with was said,
[01:51:08.780 --> 01:51:09.940]   "Don't call me.
[01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:11.980]   I'll call you."
[01:51:11.980 --> 01:51:15.060]   The sense I got was, "Don't tell me what to do.
[01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:16.820]   If I need your advice, I'll ask."
[01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:21.340]   Yeah, I think that's good general CEO advice.
[01:51:21.340 --> 01:51:22.580]   You should keep your board busy.
[01:51:22.580 --> 01:51:23.580]   You should give them work to do.
[01:51:23.580 --> 01:51:26.980]   If you don't keep your board busy, they will try to figure out how to be helpful.
[01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:32.980]   It's a tough board because you've got some big institutional investors like...
[01:51:32.980 --> 01:51:33.980]   Benchmark.
[01:51:33.980 --> 01:51:34.980]   Benchmark.
[01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:40.620]   You've got some kind of activist investors who were kind of...
[01:51:40.620 --> 01:51:43.260]   Benchmark said, "Travis has got to go for one thing, right?"
[01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:45.660]   Yeah, I mean, I don't want to get in the middle of any of that.
[01:51:45.660 --> 01:51:50.860]   I know most of the people involved and for the most part, all good people.
[01:51:50.860 --> 01:51:51.860]   It's a super complicated company.
[01:51:51.860 --> 01:51:57.900]   One thing we should point out is the Uber situation right now is probably the most game of thrones
[01:51:57.900 --> 01:51:59.380]   like board dynamic that exists.
[01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:00.380]   There you go.
[01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:02.940]   This is not what normal boards or companies are like.
[01:52:02.940 --> 01:52:03.940]   It's not typical at all.
[01:52:03.940 --> 01:52:04.940]   No, not at all.
[01:52:04.940 --> 01:52:07.820]   But Uber is a fundamentally important company.
[01:52:07.820 --> 01:52:09.380]   You said a couple of things.
[01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:11.380]   Why is Uber a fundamentally important company?
[01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:12.620]   It's just a ride-sharing company.
[01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:14.260]   It's a replacement for taxis.
[01:52:14.260 --> 01:52:16.540]   What makes it so important?
[01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:20.820]   I think it ushered into a large extent, the gig economy, which is probably the most important
[01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:23.980]   economic force for the next couple of decades.
[01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:27.980]   I think it's more influential to changing what the idea of car ownership should be than
[01:52:27.980 --> 01:52:28.980]   even Tesla.
[01:52:28.980 --> 01:52:33.300]   I basically think the two most important companies in the world right now are Amazon and Uber
[01:52:33.300 --> 01:52:39.540]   in terms of their ability to influence the lives of billions of people.
[01:52:39.540 --> 01:52:45.940]   For good or bad, and I think more on balance good, but I'm an optimist.
[01:52:45.940 --> 01:52:47.100]   All right.
[01:52:47.100 --> 01:52:50.420]   If it's that important and it's that challenging, if it's a game of thrones, it's a game of
[01:52:50.420 --> 01:52:57.700]   thrones board, what does Dara need to do as he moves into leadership there?
[01:52:57.700 --> 01:52:58.700]   Just run the business.
[01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:00.340]   I mean, I'm not going to give Dara advice.
[01:53:00.340 --> 01:53:01.340]   Focus on the business.
[01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:03.260]   Yeah, focus on the business.
[01:53:03.260 --> 01:53:04.260]   Make sure that the...
[01:53:04.260 --> 01:53:06.260]   Should he replace the tutorial?
[01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:08.620]   Does he need to bring it on board?
[01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:10.740]   Well, that's not usually up to the CEO.
[01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:12.580]   That's up to the shareholders and the board.
[01:53:12.580 --> 01:53:13.580]   Right.
[01:53:13.580 --> 01:53:15.060]   But he could go to the shareholders and say...
[01:53:15.060 --> 01:53:16.060]   He could.
[01:53:16.060 --> 01:53:19.700]   I think he should probably get that figured out before he accepts.
[01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:20.700]   To him, sort of...
[01:53:20.700 --> 01:53:22.740]   Uber needs to minimize drama for the next couple of years.
[01:53:22.740 --> 01:53:23.740]   Yeah.
[01:53:23.740 --> 01:53:24.740]   If at all possible.
[01:53:24.740 --> 01:53:25.740]   Supposedly that was...
[01:53:25.740 --> 01:53:27.500]   I have to give you a little bit of pushback on that.
[01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:30.860]   What Susan Fowler wrote about wasn't drama.
[01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:38.900]   She really brought some extremely concerning allegations forward about culture.
[01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:39.900]   Absolutely.
[01:53:39.900 --> 01:53:43.020]   I just don't want us to roller skate past that.
[01:53:43.020 --> 01:53:49.860]   She is women in tech have groups where women in tech talk honestly about what companies
[01:53:49.860 --> 01:53:53.300]   to go to and what companies to avoid.
[01:53:53.300 --> 01:53:59.300]   And from everything I personally have heard, Uber is a fundamentally...
[01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:02.980]   I'm trying to think of the right word.
[01:54:02.980 --> 01:54:08.300]   A fundamentally damaged place for women to go work.
[01:54:08.300 --> 01:54:12.140]   I feel like I need to say that.
[01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:19.740]   But the gender issue aside and the employment issue aside, to me, I think Uber's longest
[01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:27.580]   term challenge is the fact that writers only pay for a fraction of what a rideshare actually
[01:54:27.580 --> 01:54:31.700]   costs and the rest of it is venture capital.
[01:54:31.700 --> 01:54:33.700]   I'm very much for this model.
[01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:36.900]   I think it's much more convenient for consumer.
[01:54:36.900 --> 01:54:41.260]   But I don't see how it's sustainable 10 years from now.
[01:54:41.260 --> 01:54:44.420]   I don't know how you recoup these costs enough.
[01:54:44.420 --> 01:54:49.500]   Even if you go to an automatic AI model for driving.
[01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:50.500]   I don't want to...
[01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:53.740]   When I say that I think Uber is one of the most important companies in the world, I don't
[01:54:53.740 --> 01:54:57.700]   at all mean that it's a very good company.
[01:54:57.700 --> 01:54:59.460]   It's a different thing to say.
[01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:02.460]   There's been tremendous problems at Uber that I think are very serious.
[01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:05.660]   I know a lot of people there at every level.
[01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:08.500]   And it is both a great place and in many ways a terrible place.
[01:55:08.500 --> 01:55:10.140]   And it's done terrible things.
[01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:11.860]   It's not merely the sexism.
[01:55:11.860 --> 01:55:15.860]   It's also the God mode, some of the illegalities.
[01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:19.620]   They're now being accused of bribing officials in other countries.
[01:55:19.620 --> 01:55:21.060]   There's a violation of US law.
[01:55:21.060 --> 01:55:22.060]   There's a lot of problems.
[01:55:22.060 --> 01:55:23.060]   There's a lot of problems.
[01:55:23.060 --> 01:55:24.060]   There's a lot of problems.
[01:55:24.060 --> 01:55:25.060]   It's a difficult culture.
[01:55:25.060 --> 01:55:29.300]   Dara really needs to as much as possible shine as much sunlight as possible onto it.
[01:55:29.300 --> 01:55:30.300]   Get her all out in the open.
[01:55:30.300 --> 01:55:31.300]   But that's what you mean by "notent".
[01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:32.300]   Get rid of the drama which is...
[01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:33.300]   Yeah.
[01:55:33.300 --> 01:55:34.300]   I'm not trying to paper over it at all.
[01:55:34.300 --> 01:55:37.020]   There's fundamental issues that need to be tackled.
[01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:38.100]   But I think that's worth tackling.
[01:55:38.100 --> 01:55:40.780]   The question is, is Uber worth saving?
[01:55:40.780 --> 01:55:42.500]   And I think it absolutely is.
[01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:43.660]   But it's a difficult job to do it.
[01:55:43.660 --> 01:55:45.660]   So if we just look at the...
[01:55:45.660 --> 01:55:50.300]   I mean, if we backseat all those other issues which are not insignificant and enough to
[01:55:50.300 --> 01:55:54.300]   bring a better company to its knees, there is...
[01:55:54.300 --> 01:55:58.900]   To me, it strikes me a fundamental financial challenge which is Uber lost $3 billion last
[01:55:58.900 --> 01:55:59.900]   year.
[01:55:59.900 --> 01:56:01.940]   It's on track to lose the same amount this year.
[01:56:01.940 --> 01:56:05.300]   That's a lot of money to lose.
[01:56:05.300 --> 01:56:12.220]   In order to become profitable, need to somehow make more money on the rides.
[01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:17.980]   One thought when you mentioned it, of course, Brianna is replace the drivers with automated
[01:56:17.980 --> 01:56:18.980]   vehicles.
[01:56:18.980 --> 01:56:21.180]   But that seems to me a long way off.
[01:56:21.180 --> 01:56:24.380]   How much runway does a company like Uber have?
[01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:28.940]   And will Janet go back to its investors who have now valued it at $70 billion and say,
[01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:31.420]   "Hey, we'd like to be worth a little more?"
[01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:32.900]   And they get more money out of these guys?
[01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:34.780]   Well, they don't need to be worth more to get more money.
[01:56:34.780 --> 01:56:36.900]   Okay, but they need to get more money, right?
[01:56:36.900 --> 01:56:39.060]   They'll need to get more money, yeah.
[01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:40.300]   They don't have enough...
[01:56:40.300 --> 01:56:42.860]   I don't know what their runway is, but it can't be more than a few years.
[01:56:42.860 --> 01:56:46.620]   We're more than a few years off from self-driving, you know, from driverless vehicles.
[01:56:46.620 --> 01:56:50.260]   I don't think they're looking for necessarily for self-driving to be the only way they become
[01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:51.260]   self-sustainable.
[01:56:51.260 --> 01:56:52.260]   What else can they do?
[01:56:52.260 --> 01:56:58.300]   And look, when Uber was getting started, I remember the early investor meetings.
[01:56:58.300 --> 01:57:03.140]   And I remember people investors saying, "Well, yeah, like, okay, so let's say they've become
[01:57:03.140 --> 01:57:06.940]   the world's largest taxi company and they own 10% of the taxi market.
[01:57:06.940 --> 01:57:08.700]   What would it be worth?"
[01:57:08.700 --> 01:57:10.220]   Not $70 billion, I'm canceling.
[01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:13.260]   But I also remember Travis saying, "We're not going to own 10% of the taxi market.
[01:57:13.260 --> 01:57:15.460]   We're going to own 10,000% of the taxi market."
[01:57:15.460 --> 01:57:16.460]   Ah, interesting.
[01:57:16.460 --> 01:57:17.460]   And that's a good point.
[01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:20.900]   We're going to replace owner's car ownership with...
[01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:21.900]   And we were just talking about that.
[01:57:21.900 --> 01:57:24.820]   It's cheaper to go buy Uber than to have a car.
[01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:26.660]   On the other hand, that's because Uber's subsidized.
[01:57:26.660 --> 01:57:28.580]   That's 59% of the ride.
[01:57:28.580 --> 01:57:32.540]   So the question is how long are investors willing to subsidize it?
[01:57:32.540 --> 01:57:37.060]   And that's based entirely on how good is their story for long-term fundamental profitability.
[01:57:37.060 --> 01:57:38.060]   And I don't know.
[01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:39.060]   I haven't seen the decks.
[01:57:39.060 --> 01:57:42.460]   Well, the other question is how much are consumers willing to pay to ride Uber?
[01:57:42.460 --> 01:57:46.500]   So I take Uber to places that I would never have taken a taxi.
[01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:49.740]   It's like 125 bucks to take a taxi from my house to FFO.
[01:57:49.740 --> 01:57:50.740]   I wouldn't do it.
[01:57:50.740 --> 01:57:51.740]   I wouldn't leave.
[01:57:51.740 --> 01:57:52.740]   I'll take an Uber for 30, 40 bucks.
[01:57:52.740 --> 01:57:55.260]   I would not be living in San Francisco if it wasn't for Uber.
[01:57:55.260 --> 01:57:56.260]   Right.
[01:57:56.260 --> 01:57:57.260]   But what if we had the charge?
[01:57:57.260 --> 01:58:01.300]   Well, yeah, you can say thank you, Uber, for giving all of us a $3 billion subsidy.
[01:58:01.300 --> 01:58:02.300]   Right.
[01:58:02.300 --> 01:58:03.300]   So what a business.
[01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:04.300]   What a bunch of people.
[01:58:04.300 --> 01:58:05.300]   Yeah, we love them.
[01:58:05.300 --> 01:58:09.220]   What if my trip to the airport became $75 and now I'm going to be taking a super shuttle
[01:58:09.220 --> 01:58:10.980]   instead or a front drive me?
[01:58:10.980 --> 01:58:11.980]   It is a business.
[01:58:11.980 --> 01:58:12.980]   It's infrastructure.
[01:58:12.980 --> 01:58:13.980]   Right.
[01:58:13.980 --> 01:58:17.300]   It's in the same way that airports don't get paid off in the first two or three years
[01:58:17.300 --> 01:58:21.140]   and neither do like highways and neither do high-speed rails and neither will Hyperloop
[01:58:21.140 --> 01:58:23.100]   1 and neither will SpaceX.
[01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:27.780]   Like Uber and Lyft and others are making fundamental infrastructure and the payback
[01:58:27.780 --> 01:58:29.260]   period on those is long.
[01:58:29.260 --> 01:58:33.500]   Wait, wait, the infrastructure as opposed to paying the drivers, I mean, airports are
[01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:34.500]   huge, right?
[01:58:34.500 --> 01:58:37.020]   There's a lot of concrete that goes into airports and then land.
[01:58:37.020 --> 01:58:40.180]   On demand, like cars as a service is fundamental infrastructure.
[01:58:40.180 --> 01:58:41.180]   But Uber has a nice year of--
[01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:42.180]   But Uber has a nice year of--
[01:58:42.180 --> 01:58:44.900]   Uber doesn't right now under the current model with drivers.
[01:58:44.900 --> 01:58:45.900]   Uber doesn't own the car.
[01:58:45.900 --> 01:58:47.900]   The drivers own the cars.
[01:58:47.900 --> 01:58:52.660]   The concept of ownership I think is also like companies increasingly archaic and get
[01:58:52.660 --> 01:58:53.660]   sliced and diced and different.
[01:58:53.660 --> 01:58:54.660]   So what's the path to profit?
[01:58:54.660 --> 01:58:57.100]   It's a vastly increased market, basically.
[01:58:57.100 --> 01:58:58.100]   It's a big market.
[01:58:58.100 --> 01:58:59.100]   It's--
[01:58:59.100 --> 01:59:00.100]   You're going to make it up and volume.
[01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:03.100]   Losing money on every sale and make it up and volume.
[01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:06.740]   I mean, it's charging people slightly more than it costs to sell your product.
[01:59:06.740 --> 01:59:08.220]   The question is when.
[01:59:08.220 --> 01:59:09.220]   That's a lot more.
[01:59:09.220 --> 01:59:10.220]   That's the question.
[01:59:10.220 --> 01:59:12.860]   And will people pay slightly more than it costs and sell the product?
[01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:15.020]   And I'm not saying that Uber stock is a good buy at this point.
[01:59:15.020 --> 01:59:16.180]   I'm not saying that it's not.
[01:59:16.180 --> 01:59:17.940]   It's like, I honestly don't know.
[01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:22.460]   It has, according to your times, $6.6 billion in cash.
[01:59:22.460 --> 01:59:26.980]   At the run rate right now, that's a couple of years, maybe three years.
[01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:28.220]   That's the runway.
[01:59:28.220 --> 01:59:30.940]   That's a pretty quick turnaround unless they get more cash.
[01:59:30.940 --> 01:59:33.580]   And already, many investors are saying it's not worth what they pay for it.
[01:59:33.580 --> 01:59:34.580]   How is Lyft doing?
[01:59:34.580 --> 01:59:35.580]   Did anybody have the data on Lyft?
[01:59:35.580 --> 01:59:38.300]   Lyft seems to be fumbling a massively great opportunity.
[01:59:38.300 --> 01:59:42.580]   I don't know why Lyft isn't jumping on this one all over the place.
[01:59:42.580 --> 01:59:43.580]   Go ahead.
[01:59:43.580 --> 01:59:44.580]   I'm sorry, Brianna.
[01:59:44.580 --> 01:59:45.580]   I cut you off.
[01:59:45.580 --> 01:59:46.580]   No, no, no.
[01:59:46.580 --> 01:59:48.500]   I was just going to say, I had a meeting today.
[01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:53.700]   Boston has some of the worst public transportation systems in the United States.
[01:59:53.700 --> 01:59:54.700]   The T is in the--
[01:59:54.700 --> 01:59:55.700]   None of them in San Francisco.
[01:59:55.700 --> 02:00:00.380]   And San Francisco, which is doing the same thing I'm about to say, which is working with
[02:00:00.380 --> 02:00:06.820]   partners like Uber and Lyft to subsidize the fact that we can't build our own infrastructure
[02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:07.820]   there.
[02:00:07.820 --> 02:00:14.220]   So maybe long term, the Department of Transportation pays X number of dollars to keep Amtrak running
[02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:20.500]   and the T running, maybe the answer there is there's a public component going to these
[02:00:20.500 --> 02:00:21.500]   private companies.
[02:00:21.500 --> 02:00:23.900]   I think that's easily arguable.
[02:00:23.900 --> 02:00:32.620]   But the fact is, I travel all over this country because I speak a lot.
[02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:38.340]   And if you want to know what an area is going through, you talk to the Uber drivers out
[02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:42.580]   there because they're the ones trying to make a living doing it.
[02:00:42.580 --> 02:00:47.420]   What I hear from people is they're already not really making enough to make that job
[02:00:47.420 --> 02:00:49.180]   worth it.
[02:00:49.180 --> 02:00:54.540]   I suspect that as they're trying to recoup these losses, it is going to come at the expense
[02:00:54.540 --> 02:00:56.180]   of their workforce.
[02:00:56.180 --> 02:00:58.580]   And that really concerns me.
[02:00:58.580 --> 02:01:03.700]   But you would say it sounds like Phil that it would be good for us if we could manage
[02:01:03.700 --> 02:01:05.260]   to make Uber survive.
[02:01:05.260 --> 02:01:09.940]   If Uber's going to bring us something of real value if it can manage to survive.
[02:01:09.940 --> 02:01:11.740]   Yeah, I absolutely believe that.
[02:01:11.740 --> 02:01:12.740]   I think that--
[02:01:12.740 --> 02:01:15.860]   We should be concerned about an Uber that's financially troubled.
[02:01:15.860 --> 02:01:21.180]   Well, I don't have insight into the current economics or into the current business plan.
[02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:22.980]   I think there's some very smart people at Uber.
[02:01:22.980 --> 02:01:27.660]   I hope they can make it a sustainable business in the next few years.
[02:01:27.660 --> 02:01:30.780]   And I think they're taking a long time frame to do it.
[02:01:30.780 --> 02:01:34.180]   Brianna, I'm going to presume that you do not use Uber.
[02:01:34.180 --> 02:01:38.780]   Yeah, I actually do because of the best product I do.
[02:01:38.780 --> 02:01:44.860]   So the delete Uber movement, I briefly deleted it.
[02:01:44.860 --> 02:01:49.220]   But like you, you have more reason not to use it than I do.
[02:01:49.220 --> 02:01:51.900]   But yeah, but this is the best solution.
[02:01:51.900 --> 02:01:52.900]   I'd rather fix it.
[02:01:52.900 --> 02:01:53.900]   You know.
[02:01:53.900 --> 02:01:55.700]   Yeah, I would rather fix it.
[02:01:55.700 --> 02:02:02.020]   And honestly, I don't think that punishing the people that drive for that service is really
[02:02:02.020 --> 02:02:03.020]   helping anyone.
[02:02:03.020 --> 02:02:04.020]   I love Uber.
[02:02:04.020 --> 02:02:06.980]   So I guess so much heat though.
[02:02:06.980 --> 02:02:08.540]   Yeah, it's a great service.
[02:02:08.540 --> 02:02:09.540]   But everything I do--
[02:02:09.540 --> 02:02:10.540]   And like, I'm very real on.
[02:02:10.540 --> 02:02:11.540]   I'm going to peel it.
[02:02:11.540 --> 02:02:12.540]   We want to fix it.
[02:02:12.540 --> 02:02:13.540]   OK, let's fix it like Obama here.
[02:02:13.540 --> 02:02:14.540]   Yeah.
[02:02:14.540 --> 02:02:17.980]   My mom recently-- I've been trying to get my mom to use Uber.
[02:02:17.980 --> 02:02:18.900]   I set it up for--
[02:02:18.900 --> 02:02:19.900]   She's 84.
[02:02:19.900 --> 02:02:20.900]   She doesn't drive.
[02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:21.900]   Yeah, how does she do it?
[02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:23.780]   And I set it up for her in an app and I put my credit card in it.
[02:02:23.780 --> 02:02:25.460]   I said, it won't cost you anything.
[02:02:25.460 --> 02:02:26.460]   She lives on the east of the--
[02:02:26.460 --> 02:02:27.460]   Is she a smartphone?
[02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:28.460]   She does.
[02:02:28.460 --> 02:02:30.780]   I gave her an iPhone.
[02:02:30.780 --> 02:02:32.740]   And she said, I don't going to use it.
[02:02:32.740 --> 02:02:34.460]   They're rapists.
[02:02:34.460 --> 02:02:39.060]   And which is, I think, a very common misconception about Uber is that it's dangerous.
[02:02:39.060 --> 02:02:40.980]   I said, mom, you take a cab.
[02:02:40.980 --> 02:02:42.340]   How is it more dangerous than that?
[02:02:42.340 --> 02:02:44.460]   She said, well, I hear things.
[02:02:44.460 --> 02:02:47.580]   And so I finally convinced her she loved it.
[02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:49.740]   And she took it to the doctor and she loved it.
[02:02:49.740 --> 02:02:52.220]   And I'm saying, just keep-- it's safe.
[02:02:52.220 --> 02:02:53.300]   It's OK.
[02:02:53.300 --> 02:02:54.780]   Keep using it.
[02:02:54.780 --> 02:02:56.740]   Tell me-- she said they came in five minutes.
[02:02:56.740 --> 02:02:57.900]   He was very nice.
[02:02:57.900 --> 02:02:59.380]   He drove me right there.
[02:02:59.380 --> 02:03:05.100]   When I have to take cabs now, when I'm traveling to places, usually in the US, where--
[02:03:05.100 --> 02:03:08.820]   there are some places where you still need to take cabs or Uber doesn't quite work,
[02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:10.980]   it's a shockingly worse experience, right?
[02:03:10.980 --> 02:03:14.140]   I almost forgot how much better we're
[02:03:14.140 --> 02:03:14.980]   experiencing this.
[02:03:14.980 --> 02:03:18.500]   I hate having to reach into my wallet at the end of the trip and deal with the money.
[02:03:18.500 --> 02:03:19.020]   All of it.
[02:03:19.020 --> 02:03:20.900]   I mean, I'm happy to pay through the app.
[02:03:20.900 --> 02:03:23.260]   But I hate the process of having to pay for it.
[02:03:23.260 --> 02:03:25.780]   Well, to be fair, many cabs now will let you pay.
[02:03:25.780 --> 02:03:27.260]   If you have the right-- the problem is--
[02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:28.060]   You have to have their app.
[02:03:28.060 --> 02:03:32.940]   When I got to Guadalajara, I wouldn't have had an app for whatever the cab company was
[02:03:32.940 --> 02:03:34.340]   there, but I had a newber app.
[02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:34.860]   Yeah.
[02:03:34.860 --> 02:03:37.500]   That's another, by the way, smart move on Uber's part.
[02:03:37.500 --> 02:03:40.820]   As they become global, they become the choice for people who are traveling.
[02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:41.580]   Because you know them.
[02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:42.220]   You trust them.
[02:03:42.220 --> 02:03:44.380]   You don't even have to speak to the language.
[02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:47.500]   Even if you can't speak to the driver, the fact the driver knows where you're going through
[02:03:47.500 --> 02:03:48.500]   the app.
[02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:50.140]   All right, I'm going to agree with you.
[02:03:50.140 --> 02:03:52.540]   Dara, Koswara, how do you say his name?
[02:03:52.540 --> 02:03:53.260]   I don't know.
[02:03:53.260 --> 02:03:53.940]   OK.
[02:03:53.940 --> 02:03:57.100]   Dara, Koswishahi, I think that's my best guess.
[02:03:57.100 --> 02:03:59.260]   Dara, Sae-woober, we need Uber.
[02:03:59.260 --> 02:04:00.540]   The world is a better place.
[02:04:00.540 --> 02:04:02.340]   Like, he's going to have the iconic first name.
[02:04:02.340 --> 02:04:03.700]   There's not that many other CEO's named Dara.
[02:04:03.700 --> 02:04:04.180]   It's going to be the Dara.
[02:04:04.180 --> 02:04:05.620]   It's like Elvis.
[02:04:05.620 --> 02:04:05.620]   It's like Elvis.
[02:04:05.620 --> 02:04:06.780]   We're going to call him Dara.
[02:04:06.780 --> 02:04:07.340]   Yeah.
[02:04:07.340 --> 02:04:12.060]   I actually took pride in spending many hours practicing his name just so I'd get it right.
[02:04:12.060 --> 02:04:13.060]   I still have a little bit.
[02:04:13.060 --> 02:04:14.060]   Dara, I've got it.
[02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:15.060]   I've got it.
[02:04:15.060 --> 02:04:16.060]   Dao is strong.
[02:04:16.060 --> 02:04:17.060]   He took me well to get that one right.
[02:04:17.060 --> 02:04:18.060]   All right, one more break.
[02:04:18.060 --> 02:04:19.060]   We're almost done.
[02:04:19.060 --> 02:04:20.060]   Great, pal.
[02:04:20.060 --> 02:04:21.060]   Really fun today.
[02:04:21.060 --> 02:04:23.060]   Larry Maggid, he's from CBS News Radio.
[02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:24.060]   He has News Radio.
[02:04:24.060 --> 02:04:25.060]   News Radio.
[02:04:25.060 --> 02:04:28.260]   Connects safely.org @LarryMaggid on Twitter.
[02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:30.500]   Liben, you know him from Evernote.
[02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:32.180]   One of the great companies of all time.
[02:04:32.180 --> 02:04:36.940]   He's now CEO of all turtles at all-turtles.com.
[02:04:36.940 --> 02:04:37.940]   Do you have a Twitter handle?
[02:04:37.940 --> 02:04:38.940]   Do you use the Twitter?
[02:04:38.940 --> 02:04:39.940]   I do.
[02:04:39.940 --> 02:04:40.940]   I'm @plibbin.
[02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:41.940]   Liben.
[02:04:41.940 --> 02:04:44.620]   Make sure you use that.
[02:04:44.620 --> 02:04:45.900]   Do you speak Russian anymore?
[02:04:45.900 --> 02:04:47.540]   Do you forget all your Russian?
[02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:48.860]   I do speak Russian.
[02:04:48.860 --> 02:04:51.060]   Do you have occasion to speak it or is it just in your head?
[02:04:51.060 --> 02:04:53.180]   I speak Russian mostly to my parents.
[02:04:53.180 --> 02:04:54.180]   Okay.
[02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:55.180]   How about a very crazy...
[02:04:55.180 --> 02:04:56.180]   Are they still in Russia or are they in the US?
[02:04:56.180 --> 02:04:57.180]   No, they're in New York.
[02:04:57.180 --> 02:04:58.180]   New York.
[02:04:58.180 --> 02:04:59.180]   Yeah.
[02:04:59.180 --> 02:05:00.180]   For past 30 something years.
[02:05:00.180 --> 02:05:02.060]   So you have a child's grasp of the language?
[02:05:02.060 --> 02:05:03.060]   Yeah, I speak Russian.
[02:05:03.060 --> 02:05:06.380]   I was eight years old when we came to this country and so I still speak Russian like a
[02:05:06.380 --> 02:05:10.780]   very polite, well-mannered eight-year-old boy.
[02:05:10.780 --> 02:05:12.540]   What a great way to speak a language.
[02:05:12.540 --> 02:05:13.540]   I love it.
[02:05:13.540 --> 02:05:14.540]   Brianna Wu is also here.
[02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:16.540]   That's how my husband speaks Chinese.
[02:05:16.540 --> 02:05:17.540]   Nice.
[02:05:17.540 --> 02:05:23.820]   He's like, he's as American as you get, but he's a bear alert member.
[02:05:23.820 --> 02:05:25.780]   Co-founder of Giant Space Cat.
[02:05:25.780 --> 02:05:29.180]   She's Space Cat Gal on the Twitter and don't forget she's running for Congress in the
[02:05:29.180 --> 02:05:33.540]   Massachusetts 8th Brianna Wu 2018.com.
[02:05:33.540 --> 02:05:36.900]   I show today brought to you by my mattress.
[02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:39.540]   There's a new mattress.
[02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:40.540]   Casper time.
[02:05:40.540 --> 02:05:41.540]   You have a Casper?
[02:05:41.540 --> 02:05:42.540]   I heard it.
[02:05:42.540 --> 02:05:43.540]   Ooh.
[02:05:43.540 --> 02:05:44.540]   I have a Casper pillow.
[02:05:44.540 --> 02:05:45.540]   Yeah, they sponsor Rocket.
[02:05:45.540 --> 02:05:46.540]   It's just a little.
[02:05:46.540 --> 02:05:47.540]   Oh, we love Casper.
[02:05:47.540 --> 02:05:54.060]   You guys, Simone does such a good job with her funny voices and she is quite a character.
[02:05:54.060 --> 02:05:55.500]   Anyway, yes, that's right.
[02:05:55.500 --> 02:05:57.860]   You guys love your Caspers.
[02:05:57.860 --> 02:06:01.420]   The Casper team, I love it, is a bunch of engineering nerds and that's what's really
[02:06:01.420 --> 02:06:02.420]   cool about them.
[02:06:02.420 --> 02:06:04.700]   So they took, they took all the research.
[02:06:04.700 --> 02:06:09.500]   They did, but they built hundreds of prototypes trying to find a perfect mattress.
[02:06:09.500 --> 02:06:12.260]   Their supposition was, and I kind of agree with this.
[02:06:12.260 --> 02:06:19.020]   What you want is something that gives so that your bony parts sink in, but is firm so that
[02:06:19.020 --> 02:06:20.420]   your back doesn't hurt in the morning.
[02:06:20.420 --> 02:06:22.780]   It's got to give you, it's an impossible dream.
[02:06:22.780 --> 02:06:31.620]   An impossible dream, a supple, pressure relieving mattress that gives you firm support, but
[02:06:31.620 --> 02:06:32.620]   they did it.
[02:06:32.620 --> 02:06:33.380]   I don't know how they did it.
[02:06:33.380 --> 02:06:35.460]   They did it.
[02:06:35.460 --> 02:06:40.380]   With this breathable open cell layer, it is for a hot night like last night, man.
[02:06:40.380 --> 02:06:42.140]   I was so glad it just breathes.
[02:06:42.140 --> 02:06:43.140]   It's cool.
[02:06:43.140 --> 02:06:44.140]   You have the older one or the new one?
[02:06:44.140 --> 02:06:46.660]   I have the old one, but they are sending us and I can't wait to try it.
[02:06:46.660 --> 02:06:47.660]   This is the new one.
[02:06:47.660 --> 02:06:50.220]   By the way, fast company's most innovative brand of 2017.
[02:06:50.220 --> 02:06:51.220]   That means they don't sit on their laurels.
[02:06:51.220 --> 02:06:54.460]   They might sit on the bed, but they don't sit on their laurels.
[02:06:54.460 --> 02:06:57.460]   They introduce the Casper Wave mattress.
[02:06:57.460 --> 02:06:58.460]   What are laurels?
[02:06:58.460 --> 02:07:03.940]   I think it's the laurel leaves that the victors in, why would you sit on?
[02:07:03.940 --> 02:07:04.940]   It would hurt.
[02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:06.940]   Don't rest on your laurels.
[02:07:06.940 --> 02:07:07.940]   Don't rest on your laurels.
[02:07:07.940 --> 02:07:08.940]   No, right.
[02:07:08.940 --> 02:07:09.940]   Rest on your laurels.
[02:07:09.940 --> 02:07:10.940]   It's not literally sitting.
[02:07:10.940 --> 02:07:11.940]   Got it.
[02:07:11.940 --> 02:07:13.940]   You can rest on your Casper.
[02:07:13.940 --> 02:07:15.860]   In fact, it's the best rest you've ever had.
[02:07:15.860 --> 02:07:17.900]   The new Casper Wave mattress, I haven't tried it.
[02:07:17.900 --> 02:07:19.220]   I'm getting one.
[02:07:19.220 --> 02:07:23.940]   It features, they say, natural geometry support system, a new top layer, but you get your
[02:07:23.940 --> 02:07:24.940]   choice.
[02:07:24.940 --> 02:07:29.460]   They still offer the Casper Classic, I'm going to call it, which is, I don't know.
[02:07:29.460 --> 02:07:31.060]   It's pretty close to perfect.
[02:07:31.060 --> 02:07:34.900]   One of the things you may say is, "Well, I'm not going to try this unless I can try
[02:07:34.900 --> 02:07:35.900]   it."
[02:07:35.900 --> 02:07:39.900]   Well, you can because when you buy a Casper mattress, you have 100 nights to return it.
[02:07:39.900 --> 02:07:42.620]   That's a 100-day trial period.
[02:07:42.620 --> 02:07:47.420]   If at any time in the first 100 nights, you say, "Yeah, it's nice, but I don't like it."
[02:07:47.420 --> 02:07:48.420]   Call them.
[02:07:48.420 --> 02:07:49.580]   They will come get it.
[02:07:49.580 --> 02:07:50.740]   They literally come and get it.
[02:07:50.740 --> 02:07:51.740]   Take it out of your house.
[02:07:51.740 --> 02:07:53.420]   Give you every penny back.
[02:07:53.420 --> 02:07:56.460]   No risk to you, but I don't think this is going to happen.
[02:07:56.460 --> 02:07:57.460]   I think you're going to really-
[02:07:57.460 --> 02:07:59.580]   Maybe with your ole mattress.
[02:07:59.580 --> 02:08:03.740]   If you are at all unsure about your Casper, I'd skip your old mattress in the garage or
[02:08:03.740 --> 02:08:06.500]   something because then you could just go back to it.
[02:08:06.500 --> 02:08:07.500]   I didn't.
[02:08:07.500 --> 02:08:08.500]   I said, "Take the old mattress."
[02:08:08.500 --> 02:08:10.300]   I mean, I'm going to call it for you.
[02:08:10.300 --> 02:08:11.500]   Good will comes and they take it.
[02:08:11.500 --> 02:08:12.500]   Good will comes.
[02:08:12.500 --> 02:08:13.500]   Oh, of course.
[02:08:13.500 --> 02:08:14.500]   All right.
[02:08:14.500 --> 02:08:15.860]   Yeah, you donate it.
[02:08:15.860 --> 02:08:18.660]   One of the things about the Casper, when it comes, it does come in a very compact box.
[02:08:18.660 --> 02:08:20.660]   You open it up and go, "Shh."
[02:08:20.660 --> 02:08:21.660]   This is another thing.
[02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:24.900]   I have had other mattresses that smell for weeks.
[02:08:24.900 --> 02:08:26.860]   They smell like rubber for weeks.
[02:08:26.860 --> 02:08:27.860]   I don't know how they do it.
[02:08:27.860 --> 02:08:33.700]   Casper has some, I don't know, older extraction technology because there's no order at all.
[02:08:33.700 --> 02:08:37.020]   You sleep on it immediately and it's wonderful.
[02:08:37.020 --> 02:08:41.660]   If you want to know more, dive into the science behind the perfect mattress and get $50 towards
[02:08:41.660 --> 02:08:45.020]   any mattress purchased by going to Casper.com/twit.
[02:08:45.020 --> 02:08:51.860]   Use the promo code "twit" terms and conditions apply Casper.com/twit.
[02:08:51.860 --> 02:08:53.700]   Technology you can feel.
[02:08:53.700 --> 02:08:56.980]   The real innovation, I think, the product is great.
[02:08:56.980 --> 02:08:59.660]   The real innovation is mattresses.
[02:08:59.660 --> 02:09:03.020]   Mattresses as a business used to be really predatory and slight.
[02:09:03.020 --> 02:09:04.020]   They cleaned it up.
[02:09:04.020 --> 02:09:07.900]   They were the first ones to see that, "Wow, why does buying a mattress feel like you're
[02:09:07.900 --> 02:09:09.820]   constantly getting ripped off?"
[02:09:09.820 --> 02:09:10.820]   That's a really good point.
[02:09:10.820 --> 02:09:14.900]   I mean, if this is the same market, I've heard about that.
[02:09:14.900 --> 02:09:19.220]   Apparently, there's mattresses you could put literally $98,000 for.
[02:09:19.220 --> 02:09:20.540]   The test showed that they're not...
[02:09:20.540 --> 02:09:21.540]   What?
[02:09:21.540 --> 02:09:22.540]   No, there are.
[02:09:22.540 --> 02:09:23.540]   It turns out that there isn't a big difference between...
[02:09:23.540 --> 02:09:25.340]   You think you're getting a better night.
[02:09:25.340 --> 02:09:27.180]   I also like it was dishonest.
[02:09:27.180 --> 02:09:28.180]   It's intense.
[02:09:28.180 --> 02:09:32.180]   A lot of it is what Tesla did with buying cars.
[02:09:32.180 --> 02:09:35.420]   Like this idea that I've been calling it "beneficence."
[02:09:35.420 --> 02:09:40.100]   Any business you run, you should run "beneficently," which means you make every single decision
[02:09:40.100 --> 02:09:44.740]   based on solely what's in the best interest of the end user or the customer.
[02:09:44.740 --> 02:09:48.660]   When you look at it that way, there's so many industries that deserve to be completely
[02:09:48.660 --> 02:09:49.660]   destroyed and re-read.
[02:09:49.660 --> 02:09:51.500]   The taxi industry was a good start.
[02:09:51.500 --> 02:09:53.660]   All the financial services.
[02:09:53.660 --> 02:09:54.660]   Oh, yeah.
[02:09:54.660 --> 02:09:55.660]   Oh, yeah.
[02:09:55.660 --> 02:09:56.660]   All the financial services.
[02:09:56.660 --> 02:09:57.660]   We've seen that happening, aren't we?
[02:09:57.660 --> 02:09:58.660]   With the Robo...
[02:09:58.660 --> 02:10:00.500]   All of insurance, all of financial services.
[02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:02.500]   Like, many...
[02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:03.500]   Insurance has yet to be designated.
[02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:04.980]   Well, some are doing really well.
[02:10:04.980 --> 02:10:05.980]   There's a lot of companies...
[02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:07.980]   The health insurance is like Oscar that's doing it.
[02:10:07.980 --> 02:10:12.060]   Oscar is one of our investments at General Catalyst and they're definitely doing this.
[02:10:12.060 --> 02:10:13.060]   I like Oscar a lot, yeah.
[02:10:13.060 --> 02:10:15.580]   There's several good lemonade as another one.
[02:10:15.580 --> 02:10:19.740]   This idea that you take industries that were fundamentally predatory because they made
[02:10:19.740 --> 02:10:24.900]   money, their business model was they're going to take advantage of asymmetries of information
[02:10:24.900 --> 02:10:25.900]   to screw their customers.
[02:10:25.900 --> 02:10:26.900]   Right.
[02:10:26.900 --> 02:10:27.900]   And now...
[02:10:27.900 --> 02:10:30.700]   What fundamentally is leveling the playing field of information.
[02:10:30.700 --> 02:10:33.500]   This is what I'm saying about the world being fundamentally better.
[02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:34.500]   Yeah, I agree.
[02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:39.500]   You get rid of information asymmetries and now you can destroy all of the predatory businesses
[02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:41.780]   and replace them with ones that actually are beneficent.
[02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:42.780]   That's interesting.
[02:10:42.780 --> 02:10:43.780]   That's interesting.
[02:10:43.780 --> 02:10:45.940]   Casper just did that for mattresses, which is like who knew that mattresses were this
[02:10:45.940 --> 02:10:48.260]   weird, slimy predatory business.
[02:10:48.260 --> 02:10:49.260]   Right.
[02:10:49.260 --> 02:10:50.260]   But they were.
[02:10:50.260 --> 02:10:51.260]   And now it's not just Casper now.
[02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:52.620]   Oh, there's a dozen of these.
[02:10:52.620 --> 02:10:55.580]   But some of them are from the big mattress brands that are like...
[02:10:55.580 --> 02:10:56.580]   Oh, that's interesting.
[02:10:56.580 --> 02:10:57.580]   Of course.
[02:10:57.580 --> 02:10:58.580]   It is.
[02:10:58.580 --> 02:10:59.580]   Right?
[02:10:59.580 --> 02:11:00.580]   Everything needs to go this way.
[02:11:00.580 --> 02:11:01.580]   But it's like florists need to...
[02:11:01.580 --> 02:11:04.300]   Well, look at the low cost failure companies.
[02:11:04.300 --> 02:11:08.780]   A lot of them are owned by the Verizon, then the Sprint and the AT&T's.
[02:11:08.780 --> 02:11:10.780]   I mean, that's common.
[02:11:10.780 --> 02:11:12.780]   But there should be no business left.
[02:11:12.780 --> 02:11:16.180]   How many jobs will we lose if we put all mattress stores out of business and should
[02:11:16.180 --> 02:11:17.180]   we care?
[02:11:17.180 --> 02:11:19.500]   Or will those jobs be replaced?
[02:11:19.500 --> 02:11:26.100]   So I think if you try to protect existing jobs, you wind up making all sorts of weird
[02:11:26.100 --> 02:11:27.100]   decisions.
[02:11:27.100 --> 02:11:28.740]   I think this is more of a generational thing.
[02:11:28.740 --> 02:11:29.740]   You get claim call.
[02:11:29.740 --> 02:11:35.180]   Well, I think this is where both parties really screw this up, this conversation up.
[02:11:35.180 --> 02:11:37.020]   It's really about generational change.
[02:11:37.020 --> 02:11:38.020]   I think the government...
[02:11:38.020 --> 02:11:41.980]   This is an example of something though, that if you're a politician, you do not want to
[02:11:41.980 --> 02:11:44.060]   say out loud to your constituency.
[02:11:44.060 --> 02:11:45.060]   Yeah, I think...
[02:11:45.060 --> 02:11:47.540]   Well, it's already clicked and it's a hard truth.
[02:11:47.540 --> 02:11:49.260]   It's true, but it's a hard truth.
[02:11:49.260 --> 02:11:50.900]   Hillary Clinton got in trouble for talking about the authority.
[02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:52.620]   Is there a way to say it that doesn't sound scary?
[02:11:52.620 --> 02:11:53.700]   Yeah, there is.
[02:11:53.700 --> 02:11:57.380]   And it's not lying to the voters like Hillary did and it's not lying to the voters like
[02:11:57.380 --> 02:11:58.380]   Trump did.
[02:11:58.380 --> 02:11:59.380]   Right?
[02:11:59.380 --> 02:12:00.380]   Because they both...
[02:12:00.380 --> 02:12:01.380]   They knew that both sides were lying to them and they...
[02:12:01.380 --> 02:12:02.380]   Right.
[02:12:02.380 --> 02:12:04.660]   Given that both sides were lying to them, they preferred the lie that was less condescending,
[02:12:04.660 --> 02:12:05.660]   which is we're going to get your jobs done.
[02:12:05.660 --> 02:12:06.660]   That's right.
[02:12:06.660 --> 02:12:07.660]   I think that's really interesting.
[02:12:07.660 --> 02:12:08.660]   Yeah.
[02:12:08.660 --> 02:12:11.420]   So like the 45-year-old coal workers are not going to get retrained installing solar panels,
[02:12:11.420 --> 02:12:12.420]   which was a democratic line.
[02:12:12.420 --> 02:12:13.420]   That's not going to happen.
[02:12:13.420 --> 02:12:14.420]   Right.
[02:12:14.420 --> 02:12:15.420]   They're also not getting their jobs back.
[02:12:15.420 --> 02:12:16.420]   That's not going to happen.
[02:12:16.420 --> 02:12:19.300]   But if those are the only two choices, they're just going to take the lie that feels less condescending
[02:12:19.300 --> 02:12:20.300]   to them.
[02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:22.500]   The truth is, it's really about their kids.
[02:12:22.500 --> 02:12:24.260]   The government has enough money to support.
[02:12:24.260 --> 02:12:28.580]   If you're 45, you've been a coal miner in any industry, we should just be able to support
[02:12:28.580 --> 02:12:31.820]   you in your current lifestyle until you would have retired.
[02:12:31.820 --> 02:12:34.060]   But none of your kids will be coal miners.
[02:12:34.060 --> 02:12:35.780]   Like that's the truth of it.
[02:12:35.780 --> 02:12:36.780]   That's right.
[02:12:36.780 --> 02:12:42.580]   The truth of it, this is a generational problem, not a problem within the lifetime of the middle
[02:12:42.580 --> 02:12:44.220]   age people currently employed.
[02:12:44.220 --> 02:12:45.220]   No one said that.
[02:12:45.220 --> 02:12:48.020]   But I think you can do that with charisma and truthfulness and get elected.
[02:12:48.020 --> 02:12:49.020]   Maybe.
[02:12:49.020 --> 02:12:51.860]   But that's what I was saying, where we're begging them the lie to us.
[02:12:51.860 --> 02:12:56.260]   Somebody who's actually wanted to be older than 45 and still works and loves working
[02:12:56.260 --> 02:13:00.860]   and has no intention of retiring, even though I could afford to, it's not simply about losing
[02:13:00.860 --> 02:13:01.860]   money.
[02:13:01.860 --> 02:13:02.860]   It's not about losing your sense of being useful.
[02:13:02.860 --> 02:13:03.860]   You are.
[02:13:03.860 --> 02:13:04.860]   You need the meaning.
[02:13:04.860 --> 02:13:08.460]   The future of work is the future of meaning.
[02:13:08.460 --> 02:13:12.780]   The hardest question right now is, how do we give meaning at scale?
[02:13:12.780 --> 02:13:14.820]   There's some ideas about that, but that's a big one.
[02:13:14.820 --> 02:13:17.140]   Because it's not universal basic income and all of that stuff.
[02:13:17.140 --> 02:13:18.540]   It's solving the easy problem.
[02:13:18.540 --> 02:13:19.540]   That's just math.
[02:13:19.540 --> 02:13:21.220]   It's really what is the future of meaning.
[02:13:21.220 --> 02:13:24.260]   In terms of what can you tell electors, voters, you tell them the truth.
[02:13:24.260 --> 02:13:25.860]   They're like, this is about your kids.
[02:13:25.860 --> 02:13:27.540]   It would be such a bold thing for you.
[02:13:27.540 --> 02:13:33.020]   I've always wanted to see this, a candidate to just to do that and see what happens.
[02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:34.940]   Maybe you'd just die immediately.
[02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:36.980]   Brianna, I think you're going to do that.
[02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:37.980]   You would do great.
[02:13:37.980 --> 02:13:38.980]   Maybe.
[02:13:38.980 --> 02:13:39.980]   I think you would.
[02:13:39.980 --> 02:13:40.980]   I agree with everything you're saying.
[02:13:40.980 --> 02:13:46.580]   I do want to point out here on this show, like Leo, you've got a Tesla, we've got two
[02:13:46.580 --> 02:13:52.420]   Tesla owners, somebody that doesn't even drive, and somebody that's looking and buying a Porsche
[02:13:52.420 --> 02:13:53.420]   diamond.
[02:13:53.420 --> 02:13:55.060]   We come into this conversation.
[02:13:55.060 --> 02:13:56.060]   Are we 1% or?
[02:13:56.060 --> 02:13:59.860]   I can see a seller who's made by a candidate.
[02:13:59.860 --> 02:14:05.140]   I just want to tell you, I talk to people literally every day that are out there.
[02:14:05.140 --> 02:14:06.940]   They're really struggling to get by.
[02:14:06.940 --> 02:14:09.020]   I agree with your points.
[02:14:09.020 --> 02:14:14.500]   I just want to acknowledge that it's a lot easier for us to talk about theoretically
[02:14:14.500 --> 02:14:20.580]   than it is to really be opening up a room of your house on the weekend to Airbnb so
[02:14:20.580 --> 02:14:22.780]   you can afford to pay your mortgage.
[02:14:22.780 --> 02:14:24.740]   I agree.
[02:14:24.740 --> 02:14:26.900]   We've got to look at universal basic income.
[02:14:26.900 --> 02:14:28.220]   You're so right.
[02:14:28.220 --> 02:14:32.620]   At the base of it, humans need meaning in our lives.
[02:14:32.620 --> 02:14:38.500]   We want to work in a future where more of us can be journalists, where more of us can
[02:14:38.500 --> 02:14:44.020]   be musicians, where more of us can make things that's really, really exciting to me.
[02:14:44.020 --> 02:14:47.820]   I think you're really right that it's going to look different 20 years from now.
[02:14:47.820 --> 02:14:55.940]   I think there's a sense of treating people with agency, which most politicians just haven't
[02:14:55.940 --> 02:14:57.660]   done, have no experience in doing.
[02:14:57.660 --> 02:15:01.380]   A friend of mine runs this company, he has called Groups.
[02:15:01.380 --> 02:15:05.700]   It's a series of heroin addiction, opioid addiction centers.
[02:15:05.700 --> 02:15:07.140]   She's opened up like 50 of them.
[02:15:07.140 --> 02:15:10.660]   They've got this new process that makes it much more efficient.
[02:15:10.660 --> 02:15:15.900]   She was telling me this idea, who I named Joy, son, she was telling me this idea a couple
[02:15:15.900 --> 02:15:16.900]   of years ago when she was getting started.
[02:15:16.900 --> 02:15:18.580]   She was like, "Yeah, I'm going to run these centers."
[02:15:18.580 --> 02:15:21.060]   They're meant to be sustainable and they're for profit.
[02:15:21.060 --> 02:15:22.740]   They're not connected to insurance.
[02:15:22.740 --> 02:15:25.500]   We've got this new way to treat opioid addiction, which is really effective.
[02:15:25.500 --> 02:15:27.740]   I said, "Who's going to pay you?"
[02:15:27.740 --> 02:15:29.900]   She said, "Well, the heroin addict is going to pay us."
[02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:30.900]   I was like, "Really?
[02:15:30.900 --> 02:15:32.300]   You're going to get money from heroin addicts?"
[02:15:32.300 --> 02:15:33.660]   That seems like a bad idea.
[02:15:33.660 --> 02:15:36.260]   She looked at me and she said, "They've got money for heroin.
[02:15:36.260 --> 02:15:37.860]   They've got money for heroin treatment."
[02:15:37.860 --> 02:15:38.860]   Interesting.
[02:15:38.860 --> 02:15:41.860]   Just assuming that these are all people that are losers that have no agency, but that's
[02:15:41.860 --> 02:15:42.860]   not true.
[02:15:42.860 --> 02:15:46.540]   Some of them are, but there's many of them that actually have the motivation that aren't
[02:15:46.540 --> 02:15:47.940]   they're not stupid.
[02:15:47.940 --> 02:15:50.860]   They have the motivation to actually change something and they've got the money to buy
[02:15:50.860 --> 02:15:51.860]   heroin.
[02:15:51.860 --> 02:15:54.220]   Therefore, they have the money to buy heroin treatment.
[02:15:54.220 --> 02:15:57.780]   She's just opened up 50 of these centers and it's super effective.
[02:15:57.780 --> 02:16:04.660]   This idea that people need to be lied to because they have no agency because they're
[02:16:04.660 --> 02:16:05.660]   children.
[02:16:05.660 --> 02:16:06.660]   Yeah, I wonder if one is not the right idea.
[02:16:06.660 --> 02:16:08.580]   They have skin in the game.
[02:16:08.580 --> 02:16:10.500]   If they're paying for the service, it's that crazy.
[02:16:10.500 --> 02:16:16.180]   I think someone talking to the voters who have jobs that are struggling and just being
[02:16:16.180 --> 02:16:19.700]   honest with them, I think that's literally never been tried.
[02:16:19.700 --> 02:16:21.180]   I'd love to see somebody try it.
[02:16:21.180 --> 02:16:26.060]   I'm not convinced that you're right that it would work because it would totally work.
[02:16:26.060 --> 02:16:27.060]   I think a lot of...
[02:16:27.060 --> 02:16:28.060]   Interesting idea.
[02:16:28.060 --> 02:16:31.060]   I think it's still someone for all.
[02:16:31.060 --> 02:16:32.060]   I can't be president.
[02:16:32.060 --> 02:16:34.900]   I can't be president.
[02:16:34.900 --> 02:16:38.180]   Honestly, Congress has been with me.
[02:16:38.180 --> 02:16:42.820]   It's that attitude that's going to keep the good people out of government.
[02:16:42.820 --> 02:16:46.620]   You've got to dig in.
[02:16:46.620 --> 02:16:50.060]   I'll just be more selective about which Congress people I buy.
[02:16:50.060 --> 02:16:53.260]   Oh, Lord.
[02:16:53.260 --> 02:16:54.860]   I feel like there might be some truth in that.
[02:16:54.860 --> 02:16:55.860]   I'm not going to dig any deeper.
[02:16:55.860 --> 02:16:56.860]   It's funny because it's true.
[02:16:56.860 --> 02:17:00.700]   We could talk about you, Sarah, but I think we should just wrap this up.
[02:17:00.700 --> 02:17:01.700]   Larry Maggot, great to have you.
[02:17:01.700 --> 02:17:02.700]   Really appreciate it.
[02:17:02.700 --> 02:17:04.300]   Well, this is actually...
[02:17:04.300 --> 02:17:08.180]   I love all your twits, but this was one of the funnest ones I've ever done.
[02:17:08.180 --> 02:17:09.180]   I really enjoyed it.
[02:17:09.180 --> 02:17:12.100]   Sometimes you get a panel together and you get some topics that we can...
[02:17:12.100 --> 02:17:13.340]   I want to hang out with you, guys.
[02:17:13.340 --> 02:17:14.340]   I know.
[02:17:14.340 --> 02:17:15.340]   Yeah.
[02:17:15.340 --> 02:17:18.540]   That's really all Twitter ever was meant to be is just a hangout, a place where you'd
[02:17:18.540 --> 02:17:23.780]   be like the fourth person at the table sitting here with us or fifth person at the table.
[02:17:23.780 --> 02:17:24.780]   Thank you, Larry, for being here.
[02:17:24.780 --> 02:17:25.780]   I appreciate it.
[02:17:25.780 --> 02:17:26.780]   Always a pleasure.
[02:17:26.780 --> 02:17:29.480]   Connects safely.org if you want to know more about protecting people, your kids and others
[02:17:29.480 --> 02:17:30.480]   online.
[02:17:30.480 --> 02:17:35.640]   We're about to come out with next week our LGBT Cyberbullying Guide, which is a huge issue.
[02:17:35.640 --> 02:17:36.640]   Oh.
[02:17:36.640 --> 02:17:37.640]   So we're finally...
[02:17:37.640 --> 02:17:38.740]   How not to be bullied.
[02:17:38.740 --> 02:17:42.440]   How not to be bullied and what to do if you are bullied or your kids are bullied or your
[02:17:42.440 --> 02:17:43.440]   students are bullied.
[02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:44.440]   Oh, that sounds great.
[02:17:44.440 --> 02:17:45.440]   That'll be available online.
[02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:48.240]   Yeah, we'll have to work some time next week, end of the week.
[02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:54.000]   It's designed not just for parents and teachers, but also for LGBT youth themselves, some
[02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:55.520]   of the strategies they can use.
[02:17:55.520 --> 02:17:56.840]   Obviously, I didn't write it.
[02:17:56.840 --> 02:18:01.040]   I brought in an expert who is himself an LGBT activist and an author.
[02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:03.040]   It's great that you're doing all of this.
[02:18:03.040 --> 02:18:04.040]   Connects safely.org.
[02:18:04.040 --> 02:18:06.200]   Very pleased to be able to do that.
[02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:07.760]   Phil Liben, it's a pleasure.
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:11.120]   Your insights and brilliance are without equal.
[02:18:11.120 --> 02:18:14.840]   I am going to give you some laurels so you can sit on them tonight.
[02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:17.120]   I really, really a pleasure to have you.
[02:18:17.120 --> 02:18:24.640]   As always, Phil, we know from Evernote, but he is now at all-tirtles.com and AI studio,
[02:18:24.640 --> 02:18:26.360]   startup studio.
[02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:27.560]   Don't bother writing him.
[02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:28.560]   He's full up.
[02:18:28.560 --> 02:18:30.880]   Thank you for inviting me back.
[02:18:30.880 --> 02:18:31.880]   No room at the end.
[02:18:31.880 --> 02:18:32.880]   You're always welcome.
[02:18:32.880 --> 02:18:33.880]   It's great to have you.
[02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:34.880]   I'm in front of you.
[02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:35.880]   I'm in front of you with an answer with email.
[02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:39.560]   Yeah, well, he's got 109,000 emails in his inbox.
[02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:40.560]   Would you answer them with that, man?
[02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:41.560]   109,000 on red.
[02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:42.560]   Who knows when I'm in red?
[02:18:42.560 --> 02:18:43.560]   Total.
[02:18:43.560 --> 02:18:44.560]   Wow.
[02:18:44.560 --> 02:18:45.560]   No email them.
[02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:47.480]   That's for sure.
[02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:49.000]   But you can do one thing.
[02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:52.760]   You can vote for Brianna Wu if you're in Massachusetts, 8th.
[02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:53.760]   When's the primary?
[02:18:53.760 --> 02:18:54.920]   It's not soon.
[02:18:54.920 --> 02:18:55.920]   Good.
[02:18:55.920 --> 02:19:00.880]   So the guy I'm writing gets this really never even so rarely had a primary challenger.
[02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:02.760]   The Democratic Party will have to schedule it.
[02:19:02.760 --> 02:19:03.760]   But we assume-
[02:19:03.760 --> 02:19:04.760]   They haven't scheduled it.
[02:19:04.760 --> 02:19:05.760]   Who is he?
[02:19:05.760 --> 02:19:06.760]   Oh, no.
[02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:07.760]   Yeah.
[02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:10.120]   His name is Steven Lynch.
[02:19:10.120 --> 02:19:14.000]   So he's kind of old school Massachusetts politicians.
[02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:15.560]   So just think of that stereotype.
[02:19:15.560 --> 02:19:16.560]   Good luck.
[02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:17.560]   Good luck.
[02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:18.560]   Thank you very much.
[02:19:18.560 --> 02:19:19.560]   Thank you very much.
[02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:21.320]   If you're a campaign, how long do you take to run for Congress?
[02:19:21.320 --> 02:19:27.120]   So for me, when I started my game studio, it took me honestly about a year to figure
[02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:28.440]   out what I was doing.
[02:19:28.440 --> 02:19:34.000]   So we announced this this year, and it's just been trying to figure out how do you build
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:35.160]   an infrastructure?
[02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:36.880]   How do you hire a team?
[02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:40.480]   How do you go out there and make inroads with the local party?
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:44.720]   So for me, it's just been nonstop since January.
[02:19:44.720 --> 02:19:46.160]   I like this slogan.
[02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:48.400]   It's time for a Boulder Democratic Party.
[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:50.320]   I kind of agree with you on that.
[02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:53.680]   We need some people that will fight not for a development in that forum.
[02:19:53.680 --> 02:19:57.200]   @spacacow on the Twitter and of course, BriannaWoo2018.com.
[02:19:57.200 --> 02:19:59.200]   Hey, thank you all for being here.
[02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:05.560]   We had a great audience from all over the world, from the UK, from Mexico, from Sebastopol.
[02:20:05.560 --> 02:20:08.400]   All over the world.
[02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:10.760]   And it's so great to have you all here.
[02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:13.360]   If you'd like to be in our live studio audience, we welcome you.
[02:20:13.360 --> 02:20:15.720]   All you have to do is email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:20:15.720 --> 02:20:17.640]   We'll put a chair out for you.
[02:20:17.640 --> 02:20:19.800]   We have pretty good-sized space.
[02:20:19.800 --> 02:20:21.720]   We have enough room for about 20 or 30 people.
[02:20:21.720 --> 02:20:25.680]   I don't think we've ever run out of space, but do email us just to make sure.
[02:20:25.680 --> 02:20:29.640]   You can also watch live online at twit.tv/live.
[02:20:29.640 --> 02:20:32.320]   We have YouTube Live, we have Twitch, we have Ustream.
[02:20:32.320 --> 02:20:34.960]   We also have many audio streams, so you can listen live.
[02:20:34.960 --> 02:20:37.280]   In fact, if you have an echo, people ask me a lot.
[02:20:37.280 --> 02:20:38.440]   Can I listen an echo?
[02:20:38.440 --> 02:20:39.600]   Absolutely.
[02:20:39.600 --> 02:20:44.480]   If you want to listen to the audio, just say to your echo, listen to Twit Live.
[02:20:44.480 --> 02:20:47.400]   If you want to do the live stream, listen to Twit Live on TuneIn.
[02:20:47.400 --> 02:20:48.400]   That's the key word.
[02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:49.400]   TuneIn.
[02:20:49.400 --> 02:20:52.760]   It's a tuning internet radio that has at least that stream.
[02:20:52.760 --> 02:20:56.480]   But you can also say listen to Twit on TuneIn or listen to Macbreak Weekly on TuneIn and
[02:20:56.480 --> 02:20:57.480]   you'll hear the current-
[02:20:57.480 --> 02:20:59.840]   They're going to do a video version for the show.
[02:20:59.840 --> 02:21:01.440]   We, in fact, it's already there.
[02:21:01.440 --> 02:21:03.800]   You can watch on the show and that's via YouTube.
[02:21:03.800 --> 02:21:09.040]   So you would say if you have an echo show with the screen, watch Twit Live on YouTube
[02:21:09.040 --> 02:21:13.440]   or watch Twit on YouTube or watch this week in Tech on YouTube or watch Macbreak Weekly
[02:21:13.440 --> 02:21:14.440]   on YouTube.
[02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:15.440]   It will pop up.
[02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:16.440]   It's awesome.
[02:21:16.440 --> 02:21:17.440]   You can watch it.
[02:21:17.440 --> 02:21:19.280]   You can watch a live or you can watch the podcast.
[02:21:19.280 --> 02:21:20.280]   That's the point.
[02:21:20.280 --> 02:21:24.720]   We do this live every Sunday, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern Time, 2200 UTC.
[02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:28.640]   But many people can't be here and be in the chatroom at irc.twit.tv.
[02:21:28.640 --> 02:21:32.400]   So we do make on-demand versions of everything available on YouTube and wherever you get
[02:21:32.400 --> 02:21:34.880]   your podcasts, you can get audio or video.
[02:21:34.880 --> 02:21:38.040]   You can even download it from Twit.tv, our website.
[02:21:38.040 --> 02:21:43.480]   My suggestion, my request, in fact, is if you've got a podcast, favorite podcast client,
[02:21:43.480 --> 02:21:48.280]   an app on your phone or whatever, Stitcher, Slacker, Overcast, Pocketcast, iTunes, whatever
[02:21:48.280 --> 02:21:50.040]   it is you use, subscribe.
[02:21:50.040 --> 02:21:54.040]   Almost all of them will offer a way for you to subscribe, which means you'll get every
[02:21:54.040 --> 02:21:55.200]   episode automatically.
[02:21:55.200 --> 02:22:01.200]   It helps us to kind of smooth out the highs and lows so we can predict with some reliability
[02:22:01.200 --> 02:22:02.920]   how many people are going to be listening.
[02:22:02.920 --> 02:22:04.200]   So if you would, subscribe.
[02:22:04.200 --> 02:22:05.200]   We'd appreciate it.
[02:22:05.200 --> 02:22:06.600]   That way you don't miss anything.
[02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:08.400]   Thanks for joining us and we'll see you next week.
[02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:10.400]   Another Twit is in the can.
[02:22:10.400 --> 02:22:11.400]   Bye-bye.
[02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:12.400]   Happy Labor Day, everybody.
[02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:20.640]   [MUSIC]
