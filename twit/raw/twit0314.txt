[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.480]   than our first guest, Ralph Needleman.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.080]   He was waiting.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.880]   He was hoping.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.960]   He was praying that I wasn't talking about him.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.720]   Best intro I've ever gotten.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.120]   Thank you.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.560]   I can't believe--
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.640]   You live with my wife, and yet you've never been on Twit.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.760]   That's correct.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.480]   That's correct, because she's been keeping me off it.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.960]   Yeah, that's so California.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.320]   She, Jennifer, was a roommate.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.240]   Was one of a race roommate many years ago.
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.240]   1986.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.760]   Long time ago.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.280]   Yes.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.880]   And I've known Ray for a long time.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.600]   And I just-- I don't know.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.240]   It's an oversight.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.880]   Maybe because you work for CNET, I don't know.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.280]   They won't let me-- I mean, I had to slip out the side.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.620]   Did you?
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.120]   Yeah, I did.
[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.080]   Well, it's great to have you.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.800]   Welcome back.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.320]   Welcome.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.840]   It's good to be here.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.320]   Not back.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.240]   Welcome.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.280]   And maybe you'll come back.
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.120]   What do you do at CNET?
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.200]   Well, I have a blog called Race Radar, where I cover startups.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.480]   I do a podcast called Reporters Roundtable,
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.160]   which is like this, but shorter.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.040]   Nothing is longer than Twit.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.320]   I got to tell you right now.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.480]   And we just did a show with Michael Miller and Dr. David
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.720]   Bradley, who was the inventor of control, delete.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.680]   I had hit my mic now.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.680]   Yes.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.280]   That was fun.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.040]   Yeah, he's fun.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.000]   Well, and that gets to what our top story,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.480]   but I'm going to introduce the rest of the panel,
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.840]   and we'll talk about that.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.000]   Kara Swisher is back from All Things D.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   It's great to have you.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Yeah, and your family is touring Petaluma.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   It's Kara.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   They are.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.400]   The lightful lunch at Hollies Diner, which I love.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.240]   Isn't Hollies great?
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.080]   I love that place.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.080]   Yeah, great potato pancakes.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.800]   Cornmeal.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.400]   Cornmeal?
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.400]   The cornmeal pancakes.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.840]   Yeah, but they have potato pancakes as well.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.720]   But I like the cornmeal.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.160]   They're excellent.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.400]   We had a great time.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.600]   We took the dog, and they're wandering around town.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.320]   Thank you for being here.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.120]   You love Petaluma.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.440]   My buddy, Patrick Norton, back for the second time.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.880]   In three weeks, it's good to have you.
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.600]   How exciting.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.680]   Well, I had to carry somebody up here.
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.040]   No, it's not why you're here, though.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.960]   I actually said, can we get Patrick back soon?
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.720]   Well, thank you.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.440]   Patrick is, of course, the host of "Techzilla"
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.880]   on revision three in my old compadre
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.360]   from the "Screen Savers."
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.560]   I have a "Screen Savers" t-shirt.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.720]   Let me see if I can find it for you.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.720]   It's a scary thought.
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.080]   You know, if it's 2XL, I can wear it.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.680]   I might have the programmer size.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.920]   You want to get those cupcakes away from you?
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.400]   It smells so sweet.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.520]   I just said cornmeal pancakes.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.040]   Let's just move those cupcakes a little farther away.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.960]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.600]   Not too far away.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.160]   Sam made--
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160]   Quick, somebody put on Google+, or Twitter,
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.960]   that Leo's trying to kill co-hosts.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:51.600]   Exactly.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.960]   That'll spike the numbers.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.960]   When I was gone mad, it's trying to kill people.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.960]   Sam was in a cup.
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.800]   His husband is in a hurry.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.960]   It's made some delicious--
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.960]   I'm getting diabetes, just saying.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.480]   OK, John, would you free us of the tyranny
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.680]   and Twitter cupcakes?
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.680]   Cupcake gring on--
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.680]   They have coffee.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.680]   They have coffee in them.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.680]   They look delicious.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.840]   They not only look delicious, I've eaten half of one
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.840]   and they are delicious.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.480]   Also here, Om Malek, and that's really
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.040]   the guy we're trying to torture from giga-om.com.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.240]   This is the first time in studio.
[00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.960]   Yes, it is.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:18.480]   Welcome.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.160]   And that's how I get greeted.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.600]   Cupcake.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.600]   Upstage, we have cupcakes.
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   There's M&M.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.240]   John, OK, great.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.520]   Thanks for great to be here.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.400]   This is going to be one of our best shows ever.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.600]   We've been really, really lucky.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.520]   Since the studio opened, we've had live panels every week.
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.480]   And every time-- I keep saying this is the best show,
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.640]   and then the next one is the better.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.640]   It's just been great.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.120]   Terrific.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.440]   Just seeing people impersonating.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.360]   Sure, it's much better.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.360]   It makes such a better difference.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.000]   So what is it about August?
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.360]   There's something-- so first of all,
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.320]   the 30th anniversary on Friday of the IBM PC.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.640]   The week before was the 20th anniversary
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.760]   of the first public worldwide web pages.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.040]   Next week is the anniversary ninth anniversary of IE,
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.640]   of Internet Explorer.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.520]   And there's another anniversary this month.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.360]   I can't remember what it is.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.160]   But this is like-- is this one--
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.000]   it seems like August is usually the silly season,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.600]   the slow season for news.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.720]   But maybe that's-- oh, Linux!
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.680]   20th anniversary of Linux is this week.
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.760]   It's actually 20th anniversary of Walt's column, too.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.160]   Personal technology, which is--
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.680]   See, you picked a good time to start doing a column.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.320]   Fourth anniversary of Techzilla.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.320]   Is it really?
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.320]   Yeah, we've got a lot of interviews.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.560]   Why do things launch in August?
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.560]   What is it about August?
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.040]   We were fifth anniversary of all things D
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.480]   and the 10th anniversary of D Conference.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.000]   I don't know.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.560]   It's getting in place before the school year.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.560]   Right.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.080]   Exactly.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.200]   I'm going to do something before my kids drive me nuts.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.520]   Let's start a new website.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.920]   Traditionally, August is like the slow time for news.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.080]   It actually-- news is huge.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.280]   It's not anniversaries.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.720]   But there's tons of news.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.160]   I was just astonished how much news we've had in the past.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.760]   For--
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.260]   Technies.
[00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.040]   It's crazy, it's really--
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.960]   There you go.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.720]   There you go.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.960]   Let's talk about some of these things.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.720]   It's the 16th anniversary of Internet Explorer, not the 9th.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.400]   Although Internet Explorer really wasn't
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.440]   significant in the first few versions.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.560]   I'm thinking as opposed to now.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.240]   Now?
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.400]   It's so important.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.800]   Well, actually, it's on the other side of its success,
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.560]   basically.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.120]   But I also remember people in the office at Windows--
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.680]   it's funny we were talking about Windows sources.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.400]   I've talked more about Windows sources in the last two
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.240]   hours, last year.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.720]   Last year.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.720]   Last year.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.800]   OK, but people were like left.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.280]   Internet Explorer, ha, ha, ha.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.600]   And like three years later, Internet Explorer hits version
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.240]   3.0.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.440]   Destroyes.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.600]   What was that company?
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.800]   How much was it valued at?
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.560]   And it was 3.0.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.520]   And really changed it.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.560]   And they did destroy it intentionally, which was a
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:31.040]   beautiful thing.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.720]   It was one of the greatest business moves in history.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.320]   They gave away IE.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.320]   Netscape was a paid product.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.080]   Let's give away IE.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.600]   We'll cut off their air supply.
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.360]   And they did.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.320]   I think this one way of looking at it is that Netscape
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.120]   killed itself.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.640]   I don't think Internet Explorer killed it.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.640]   They had the lead position.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.080]   And they could have done the free Internet Explorer.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.240]   They could have done free--
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.080]   Free Netscape, you mean?
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.800]   Free Netscape.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.400]   And they could have done a lighter, cleaner, easier to
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.480]   use product.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.680]   And they didn't do it.
[00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.160]   And they went out and did all sorts of other crazy things.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.120]   I was there.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.400]   That company was a disaster.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.200]   Is there a lesson for Firefox for the Mozilla
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:11.800]   organization?
[00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.840]   We're seeing a repeat of that.
[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.880]   Same thing's happening, isn't it?
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:14.720]   Yeah, well, it's different.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.720]   I mean, they were--
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.800]   They were just a different logic.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.480]   They were at the top of the companies in Silicon Valley.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.080]   Mark Andreessen and Jim Barksdale.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.480]   I also come from the Wall Street Journal.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.880]   And it was just a very heady time for them.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.200]   And I think the combination of the attack from Microsoft
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.840]   and their own inability to focus their business was both.
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.160]   It didn't help that Microsoft was coming in with a completely
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.440]   free product.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.040]   They could have theoretically done a free product.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.120]   But they didn't have the genes for it.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.480]   I mean, they just raised all this money.
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.920]   And they were trying to show that they could be a new software
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.600]   company and make money selling the product.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.320]   Not a lot of software was given away in 1996.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:50.800]   Exactly.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.880]   It was a totally different era.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.880]   And there wasn't the business model that there is now with
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.280]   Firefox.
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.840]   I mean, Firefox is free, but they bank it up on the back end
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.720]   with the Google deal.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.240]   That didn't exist.
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.040]   So would they have survived otherwise?
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.080]   They were going into the servers, mail servers, all
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.480]   those kind of things.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:09.360]   They had all the other products with the enterprise-related
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.720]   products.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.640]   I think managing people's internet access at that time was a
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.800]   big deal for companies.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.200]   They lacked the vision that if we control the internet--
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.400]   Microsoft had this vision.
[00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.560]   He who controls the internet.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.040]   He who controls the spice.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:24.560]   Exactly.
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.840]   Makes the money.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.880]   But Microsoft hasn't held up on the Explorer, too.
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.480]   So it's good to have all this competition in the browser
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.280]   business for one.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.760]   And technically AOL killed the Netscape browser.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.400]   I mean, they bought it later and then didn't do much with it.
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.880]   In the interview years when Chrome jumped up, all kinds of
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.680]   things jumped up, so they certainly could have stayed in
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.040]   the game.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:43.960]   They just didn't.
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.080]   There's a little modern irony because Microsoft and
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.080]   others accuse Google of doing the same thing with Android,
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:53.760]   of giving away Android for the same reason to undercut iPhone
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.840]   and Windows Phone and Blackberry and Nokia.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.000]   There are some metaphors.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.520]   Yes, there are.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:08:59.360]   And it works.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.680]   It's working, to an extent.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.200]   Well, to an extent.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.160]   Is it reprehensible?
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.080]   Is it bad for consumers?
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.840]   They've got some issues around patent issues, though.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.240]   So it's not the same thing.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.720]   Well, that's how it's fun to read about.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.560]   But is that why that attacks going on?
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.280]   Because that's the only way that they can stop this Google
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:12.720]   giveaway?
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.440]   Is it bad for consumers?
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.920]   You can get a smartphone for like 90 bucks now.
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:18.720]   Here's the theory about it.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.520]   It's great for consumers.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.320]   Here's the theory about it.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.720]   You give it away until you'll dominate and then you stick it
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.200]   to them.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.840]   And then somebody else comes along and gives something else
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.080]   away.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.240]   Wait, are we talking about AT&T or Android?
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:29.960]   But that's the idea.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.840]   AT&T has never given us anything.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.080]   Yeah, for free.
[00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.440]   This is a family podcast, so I can't really speak.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.680]   That's not quite true.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.920]   AT&T funded Bell Labs, which gave us the chip.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.120]   And thousands and thousands of them.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.400]   That's a very good point.
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.880]   Let's not go there.
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.880]   That's a company which does a lot of stupid things.
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.320]   But back in the day, they also were responsible.
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.520]   I believe there were like three or four
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.000]   divestitures between Bell Labs and AT&T wireless
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.480]   as we know it today.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.920]   Just because they have the name AT&T
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.120]   doesn't mean they're really that AT&T.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.120]   It's a different company.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:02.920]   It's a different company.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.760]   These Android patents are very serious.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.000]   They're not just to get Android.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.960]   They seriously have borrowed--
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.520]   I'm going to say it nicely until they get correctly sued.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.680]   But they've borrowed some patents that they don't have rights
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:14.920]   to.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.920]   Google has.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.920]   And that's why they tried to buy the Nortell patents.
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.120]   And that's why that ridiculous diatribe from David Drum
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.560]   and a couple weeks ago, I guess it was two weeks ago,
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.360]   where he just sort of whined about Apple and everything else.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.120]   The one where he said that they're
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.280]   trying to stifle us by buying out the patents.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.880]   Because they can't compete with us for real.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.920]   And then all of a sudden--
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:37.420]   Oops.
[00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:37.920]   I'm afraid.
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.440]   No, right?
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:38.940]   No.
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.600]   Now all of a sudden then Microsoft released emails
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.680]   where they were trying to--
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.180]   Yeah.
[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.320]   Were they like, do you want to bid with us on these patents?
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.200]   And yeah, Microsoft's like, hey, you
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.160]   should talk to some of the other counsel inside of your building
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.080]   since obviously.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.480]   Yeah, obviously.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:56.160]   But it's been interesting watching the blogosphere reactions,
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.400]   columnist reactions, where it's polarizing
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.400]   to watch the argument back and forth,
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.880]   whether or not Google is doing all of the things
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.600]   that Google claims to despise with Android.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.840]   And I think it's interesting.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:10.800]   It's like, is Google sitting here basically like, OK,
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.880]   instead of spending $4 billion buying the patents,
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.840]   maybe we'll spend $4 billion on lawyers
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.400]   and try to figure out and lobbying in Washington
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.560]   to try to see if we can crack patent law as we know it.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.960]   This patent issue is going to be a big deal.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.960]   And it's somewhat stifling to innovation all of it.
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.480]   OK, I've tried to explain to my staff.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.840]   You see that wardrobe over Cara's shoulder?
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.240]   If you just close that door, it's driving me crazy.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.640]   You can't see anything new?
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:36.840]   Yeah, you can.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.440]   It's in care of the single.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.640]   And it just drives me crazy.
[00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:39.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:41.240]   I didn't mean to interrupt everybody.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.320]   He's like the feelings, anger of us.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.680]   I've been trying to signal--
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.560]   Get on with me.
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.600]   Just turn off that light.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.040]   That's it.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:47.960]   Thank you very much.
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.000]   That's a pure talent.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.720]   This is his pretty new studio.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.360]   We must have it--
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.680]   Don't show the wardrobe.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.560]   All right, thank you.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:54.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.480]   Go ahead.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.320]   We were stifling competition and ruining technology.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.000]   I wonder how much of the lawsuits
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.120]   are not just about Android, but about Linux somewhat.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.280]   I think Linux has protected a lot better than Android.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.800]   Microsoft indemnifies.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.880]   Microsoft indemnifies its customers
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.280]   against Linux lawsuits.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.920]   And the message from Microsoft, which is involved heavily
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.800]   in these Android lawsuits, the message from Microsoft
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.360]   about Linux is, if you're a Microsoft customer,
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:23.760]   go ahead.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.200]   Don't worry.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:24.960]   We'll take care of it.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.120]   But everybody else, you could get sued like crazy if you use Linux.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.680]   I have a feeling it's not just Android.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.680]   And even if there are problems with Android,
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:34.080]   it's all about Linux, too, isn't it?
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.480]   I think the entire thing is going
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.280]   to be, I think, one of the most important stories
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.200]   around these patents.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.040]   And I think a lot of, including myself,
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.600]   don't have as much patent law background.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.160]   Nellie Patel has been very--
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:44.160]   Absolutely.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.160]   --I think he's done a good job.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.600]   He's an attorney by training.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.800]   He writes, of course, for this is my next.com.
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.200]   And he's done a number of articles
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.520]   about software patents.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:53.960]   It's funny.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.080]   I would think that of all people,
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.200]   he'd be the one who's saying abandon them entirely.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.000]   No, I don't think he does.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.480]   But he doesn't.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.280]   Yeah, no.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.720]   He's trying to fix the system.
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.640]   Is it fixable?
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.800]   Well, we had--
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.840]   years ago, we had Nathan Merevold,
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.520]   who had started that company that was buying a patent
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:06.560]   company--
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.520]   Intellectual Adventures.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.600]   I mean, he's a patent troll, we have to say now, yes.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.280]   Yes, yes.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.360]   Well, that's what they-- he denied it, of course,
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.720]   and it went back and forth.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.800]   But it's a very interesting time for these things.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.920]   And there should be a way to protect your intellectual
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.440]   property.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.560]   And at the same time, use it to stifle innovation of others.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.200]   So it's a new--
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.880]   That's the question is, how do you protect it?
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.600]   Do you need patents to protect it?
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.640]   Right.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.080]   Or is there-- or trademarks and copyrights efficient?
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.320]   Or do you not need it for software?
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.400]   Because it's not hardware.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.760]   Well, it's not just software also.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.160]   I mean, you look at--
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.320]   it seems like you look at Disney's
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.720]   trying to protect the mouse.
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.400]   So Disney completely destroys public domain
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.920]   in their efforts to protect the mouse.
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.560]   And then realize that, oh, the lawyer's like,
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.800]   you know, we should have just trademarked it,
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.440]   because we can sit on trademarks forever.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.200]   So we're going to trademark all of our characters,
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.800]   and then we can protect them legally.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.080]   And by the way, we're really sorry about public domain.
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:54.880]   Actually, they're not.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:55.400]   They don't care.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.720]   They forgot about it as soon as you stop--
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.720]   They don't care in the least.
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.280]   --the people's defense, right?
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:00.040]   But as a result, you end up--
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.040]   it's a mess, you know?
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:02.880]   Are patents important?
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:03.440]   I think so.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.480]   People should be rewarded for innovating.
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.720]   People should be rewarded for putting--
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.160]   I just don't think patents are the solution for software.
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.640]   I think there must be other ways to protect.
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:10.960]   Why not?
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.520]   I mean, if I invent a method for something,
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.000]   whether it's to make cotton or to run a spreadsheet,
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.120]   what philosophically is the difference?
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.760]   I mean, yes, the legal system with patents right now
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.520]   is a disaster.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:25.040]   But--
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.040]   Well, perhaps there's a way if you, for instance--
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.760]   the problem is, of course, that people are patenting
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:33.960]   all sorts of generic processes, methods.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:34.480]   And--
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.440]   Method for patenting?
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.680]   Basically, when you want to--
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.520]   They never implement it.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.400]   They just patent it.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.200]   Or they patent things that don't exist yet.
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.200]   Or they patent things that have existed for years,
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.720]   for example, sort of algorithms.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.000]   Right.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.040]   Then nobody bothered to patent because it was commonly
[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.240]   taught in universities for 30 years.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.280]   And so you end up with this.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.000]   And you, partially, it's like, hey,
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.160]   what if we actually funded the patent office
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.560]   and funded the patent office to the point
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.640]   where they could hire experts that could actually decide
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.000]   or something?
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.440]   I don't want to slag on the patent office
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.800]   because they're in a hard position.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.240]   But it's like, maybe if we actually paid attention
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.160]   and did things the right way, the first time,
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.720]   we wouldn't end up with gigantic messes
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.800]   that could settle down over years in the courts.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.400]   But it's a full employment act for lawyers, I guess.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.000]   I've been on jury deal last two weeks.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.360]   I am so amazed at this system.
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.120]   I think our-- I do have to say our patent office
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:22.880]   isn't very--
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.880]   is pretty disorganized from what I understand
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:26.600]   from reading about it.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.720]   I think we could do something similar to what
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.400]   the open source has done is essentially, companies
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:37.440]   create a pool of patents and a not-for-profit group running
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.120]   a pool of patents.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.280]   And people, companies like Google,
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.320]   spending money, buying patents, submitting it,
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.240]   and then giving it to this open source foundation.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.240]   And essentially using that as a way
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.480]   to circumvent all the problems.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.280]   So if you're a member of this open source, open patent
[00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:57.160]   foundation, you kind of get around it.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:01.000]   So you can use that as a lever.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.760]   Because these are the patents which
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.880]   are more commonly available, easily available.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.960]   More people tend to adapt them.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.840]   More products are based on them.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.560]   That is one way to fight it.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.160]   I don't know how the rules are going to change,
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.640]   but how about creating a new model of using the patents?
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.320]   I think that's more achievable.
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.800]   Almost like Larry Lessick did with Creative Commons
[00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.800]   is a way to address copyright.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.240]   Creative Commons, the Linux Foundation has done that.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.960]   And the Apache Foundation is a good example of that.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.560]   I think people need to kind of think in those terms
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:37.760]   and say, what are the alternate solutions not?
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:43.880]   But that's a really great idea to create this separate system
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:45.360]   for people who want to play in the system.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.160]   But then you've still got intellectual ventures
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.160]   and other companies sitting on these gigantic patent
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.120]   portfolios which are purely weapons of mass destruction.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.320]   And that's the real question is, what a burden on innovation
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.800]   does that present?
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:58.920]   Well, that's huge.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.400]   But what such a system that you describe work as kind of the--
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.280]   well, you've got your WMDs that are funded
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.200]   by your lawyers and intellectual ventures.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.720]   And I've got mine, which are owned by the commons
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.880]   in kind of this open source patent pool.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.080]   Could those things exist in the same world?
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:16.720]   I don't know.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.360]   That's a really cool whole thing.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.440]   I'm just throwing it out there.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.440]   It's really smart.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.000]   Creative commons can coexist with existing copyright
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.640]   licenses and public domain licenses.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.160]   Well, but it's another kind of license, right?
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.760]   We basically-- everybody involved has to play nice.
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:33.560]   And in terms of--
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.440]   I forget that.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:34.920]   Very-- yeah.
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.560]   Well, no, no.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.120]   Let me tell you how long this has been a problem.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.360]   Niele and his article on-- this is my next quotes--
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.880]   Thomas Jefferson, who was the first head of the patent office,
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.320]   besides being our third president, 1790.
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.840]   He argued against patents, once calling them
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.400]   embarrassments to the public, he worried
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.360]   that abuse of frivolous patents is likely
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:56.720]   to cause more inconvenience than is to counter
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.160]   by those really useful.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.000]   In other words, it has been a problem since 1790.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.840]   So we should actually go back to Shakespeare and say,
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.080]   first, let's kill all the lawyers.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.080]   Kill all the lawyers.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.640]   And then move on.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.360]   Linux 20th anniversary, IE we talked about.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.200]   Let's talk about the PC in just a second.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:17.720]   30th anniversary on Friday, August 11th, 1981, the IBM PC
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.440]   shipped 1,500 bucks for the first PC, about $7,000
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.200]   in modern money.
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.720]   And you didn't get much for 1,500 bucks.
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.880]   We'll talk about that.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:28.560]   And for those of you old enough, your memories of 1981.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.440]   But first, I want to talk a little bit about our friends
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.040]   at Go to Meeting.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.720]   We've come a long way since 1981.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.920]   Go to Meeting is, of course, the great online meeting service
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.960]   that we've used here at Twit-- for practically every meeting
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.600]   for the last five years.
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.160]   They've added a new feature that is mind-boggling.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.000]   I just love it.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.800]   They call it HD Faces.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.080]   And you've got to try it to see.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:51.840]   It's-- you're still having these online meetings
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.440]   where you can share your screen.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:57.480]   But now you can have as many as six video feeds.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.560]   High quality, crystal clear, really good quality.
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.360]   Right there, in with the screen sharing,
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.120]   it transforms your online meetings.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:07.040]   Because as you know, seeing somebody's facial expression,
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.720]   seeing what they're thinking, they're raised eyebrow,
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.080]   their curled lip, this all is a value in a meeting.
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.440]   If you're pitching a client to be able to see their body
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.160]   language while you're pitching, for them
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.640]   to be able to make connection with you and see your face,
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.760]   worth so much.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.640]   And now Go to Meeting has this incredible HD Faces
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.600]   technology.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.080]   Good news.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.880]   You can try it free for the next 30 days.
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.760]   You can really see what I'm talking about.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:30.600]   For Mac or PC, here's what you do.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.880]   You go to go to meeting.com, G-O-T-O, meeting.com.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.720]   Click the Try It Free button.
[00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.840]   Use the offer code Twit.
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.560]   You'll try it for 30 days free.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.200]   Throw a meeting.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.480]   Just enjoy yourself.
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.920]   Call a client.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.040]   Call a colleague.
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.040]   Say, hey, we've got to try this.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.120]   I want you to see me.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.400]   Call Mom.
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:54.600]   Go to meeting.com and then use the offer code Twit.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.280]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.480]   It's really fantastic.
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.960]   Even if we're not going to use the Faces or the Screen
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.360]   Shain, whenever we have a meeting with colleagues
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.080]   or vendors or whatever, we'll just
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.720]   say we'll start it with Go to Meetings for Easy.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.640]   You click the button.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.400]   It sends out the email invitation.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.760]   Gives them a conference bridge that they can call
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.240]   or a VoIP line or the video line.
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.240]   And it just couldn't be simpler.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:17.800]   I just love it.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.600]   Go to meeting.com, offer code Twit.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.040]   1981, you remember when the--
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.200]   maybe are you old enough to remember the IV?
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:24.960]   Yes.
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:25.800]   PC.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.320]   Wasn't the first computer?
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:27.960]   No.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.480]   I got a great note from a guy who was the editor of Interface
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.960]   World at the time and was invited to Boca Raton,
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.280]   along with a lot of other press, to see the PC when it first
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.200]   was ready to ship.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.200]   That skunk works down there.
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.400]   They moved everybody out of our mock down to Phyllestridge,
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.240]   Adonestridge, and the company.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.400]   And he said, one of the things that irritated the journalists
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:56.680]   at the time is IBM's co-option of the word personal computer.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.640]   Because it wasn't the first.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.360]   There was apples.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.240]   There were altairs.
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:20:59.840]   There were tomatoes.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:00.840]   PC versus Mac is ridiculous.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:01.640]   I mean, they're all PC.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.120]   They're all PC.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:02.560]   Exactly.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.640]   And yet, 30 years later, a PC still means a Windows computer
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.440]   running on IBM.
[00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.160]   Could have been the junior.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.960]   Could have been worse.
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.720]   The Apple III was out a couple of years before.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.760]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:15.120]   That was their attempt at a business computer, horrible.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:15.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:21.800]   Well, no, I had family that VisiCalc running on one of the apples
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.240]   was a game changer to use a really entertaining phrase.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:24.600]   It was?
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.440]   That was the first killer.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:25.880]   Yeah, right.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.280]   Because it was actually, for a lot of people,
[00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:29.280]   it was a business computer.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:32.560]   But remember, those are the days where the saying was,
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.120]   nobody ever got fired for buying IBM.
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.480]   Until IBM put its seal of approval,
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.320]   I think there were probably the vast majority
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.200]   of American corporations wouldn't consider a personal computer.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.120]   Absolutely.
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.080]   That was the thing that--
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:43.480]   OK.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.480]   But the reason that IBM did this is that Apple IIs
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.760]   with VisiCalc were coming in the side door,
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.000]   taking their business.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.680]   Well, and IT was like, we can't stop this.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.960]   We'd like to, but we can't stop this.
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.200]   They still are trying to stop Macs 30 years later by the way.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.200]   Macs and iPhones and--
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.280]   Can't stop them, guys!
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.600]   So they needed something.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:07.080]   And so they invented the IBM and then--
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.400]   XT, it was the AT, XT, AT.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.120]   The XT and then the AT was hard drive.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.960]   The AT was a 16-bit computer.
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.560]   If I get this right, and then somewhere along the line,
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.920]   there was Lotus 123, which was the IBM's VisiCalc.
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.920]   Look at that beauty.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.320]   Look at that beauty up there.
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.280]   Isn't that sweet?
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.120]   So let me tell you what you would get for $1,500.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:30.120]   It's 16 kilobytes of RAM, not megabytes, kilobytes of RAM.
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.240]   16.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.240]   I think if you wanted more, it was like $500 if you wanted--
[00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:35.240]   $32.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.880]   It came with a cassette port, no hard drive.
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.080]   You could get a floppy for that price.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:44.160]   It was 160 kilobytes on one of those black floppy--
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.600]   you were actually still floppy back then.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.400]   At least they used 5-inch, not the 8-inch,
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.000]   because there was an argument when they were building this.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:49.520]   Really?
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:50.920]   You go to the 8-inch drives?
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:51.920]   Yes.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:52.280]   No.
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.560]   They were talking about that.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:55.760]   You remember that sound that--
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.760]   [HONKING]
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.320]   Thank you.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.080]   That's very good.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.880]   I just spent a lot of time listening.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.360]   [HONKING]
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.080]   Because that was the head hitting the floppy.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.200]   And then-- [HONKING]
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.800]   --as the arms seek back and forth.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.000]   Can you do a modem?
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:08.520]   I can.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.520]   OK.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.280]   [HONKING]
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.280]   You want a 56K?
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.680]   [HONKING]
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:17.720]   What else would you like?
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.200]   Never mind.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:18.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.240]   That's enough.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.760]   I think the famous noises for the technology.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.720]   Famous noises for 30, Alex.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.560]   So you go to get a floppy disk--
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.000]   oh, oh, the monitor.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.720]   11.3 inches.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.600]   I mean, what can you get?
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.920]   You can get a microwave oven that's 11.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.400]   And it was green and black.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.000]   It wasn't.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:37.640]   No graphics.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.120]   No color.
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.560]   Well, there were graphics.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.240]   Yeah, they were--
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.760]   remember they were ASCII graphics.
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:43.920]   Yeah, they were all ASCII-based.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.440]   The block graphics that you would do.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.800]   Can you do an MX80?
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.400]   [HONKING]
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.040]   That's the printer, right?
[00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.400]   The Epson MX-made printer, yeah.
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.320]   [HONKING]
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.320]   Was a noisy world back then?
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.160]   Well, and the keyboards, I mean, let's not forget.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.320]   I mean, they were emulating the feel
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.360]   of a Selectric, which was a lot of mechanical product.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.400]   And these keyboards--
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.640]   Which was a great, great type of--
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.520]   Yeah, anybody who writes for a living who
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.440]   were sort of britus on a Selectric, just still--
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.720]   I have a bucket.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:16.520]   I have seven Alpswish-based IBM classic keyboards.
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.520]   Because I want to make sure--
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:18.840]   You didn't want to lose them.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.880]   And there's multiple vendors who make them now.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.240]   I can type faster and more happily on one of those.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.560]   All right, let me tell you something.
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.680]   I bought a couple of weeks ago, actually, a UNICOMP
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.040]   keyboard, a Model LIM.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.840]   It's like an IBM Model M keyboard.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.560]   A brand with modern key layout, which was different back then.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.560]   The control and the camera.
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.080]   So that way Dan Farber knows you're working.
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.160]   Because here's-- no, but here's the problem.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.600]   I do a lot of phone interviews.
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.080]   It's too loud.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.520]   I had to consider this beforehand.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.360]   The microphone interacts with the keyboard.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.720]   And I can't hear what the hell people are doing.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.480]   I actually couldn't use those after using the mushy keyboards.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.160]   Because on the radio, you can hear--
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.360]   I was like, can you stop this geezer show?
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.360]   Yeah.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.200]   That's fun, man.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.360]   So Tom Fox, who was, at the time, the Techno
[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.960]   Letter of Interface Age, he said there were three things
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.560]   that surprised the editors when they went to see this PC
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:00.240]   and Boca Raton.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.280]   One was that they took the word PC.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:05.800]   The other was, on the Ease, with IBM's choice of system
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.640]   software, surely they weren't going to single source
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.600]   with that vendor.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.760]   We're talking Microsoft.
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.000]   PC DOS 1.25--
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.280]   But they didn't single source.
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.520]   There were three operating systems.
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.440]   You could get DR DOS, couldn't you?
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.280]   PC DOS was the only one that was $40.
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.640]   CPM, I think was--
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.720]   You get Cenix?
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.360]   I don't know.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.120]   But the--
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.040]   They're still going on.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.960]   --CPM was like 240 bucks.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.160]   But this was key.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.120]   I mean, IBM's decision to not build everything itself
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.840]   and to go to Microsoft and to Intel
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:38.600]   and to Epson for components was a watershed in the way
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.040]   that computer hardware was--
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.320]   And that's what Fox said really was the number one thing,
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.960]   was astonishment at this idea of an open system,
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.960]   documenting the bus design.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.640]   They didn't open BIOS, but they made it simple enough
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.800]   that it could be reverse engineered.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.000]   And it was less than a year later that Compaq came out
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:56.280]   with the first PC compatible.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.720]   So that was a huge shift for IBM.
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.200]   Remember, they're the ones who sold--
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:01.040]   Are you bored on?
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:01.960]   Are you going to play you?
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.960]   Yeah, I'm just looking up.
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:04.160]   Like I'm trying to get at everything.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.200]   We're also waiting till you get to KPro, which
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:06.400]   is a--
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:06.400]   KPro.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.640]   --we can do the picture.
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.200]   There we go.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.240]   --bring up the Osbornes.
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.760]   I still have a KPro somewhere.
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.360]   It was-- was it Tim Patterson of Seattle DOS
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.280]   that Bill Gates went to in 1981?
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.760]   He said, hey, you haven't not got a burning system.
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.760]   Because IBM had gone to Gary Killzall and Monterey.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:25.480]   He was flying his plane, so they didn't buy DOS from him.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.240]   They went up to this little company in Seattle, Microsoft.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.840]   They said, do you have a PC operating system, an 8088 operating
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:31.880]   system we could use?
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:35.240]   And Bill Gates famously, even though they didn't sit.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.040]   Yeah, and we got one of them.
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.440]   Call me now tomorrow.
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:42.120]   And he went to Tim Patterson and said, hey, yeah, there it is.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:42.880]   Oh, I wanted you to have this.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.920]   Well, nostalgia destroyed pop culture.
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:46.920]   Say hey.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.760]   All right, all right.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.760]   Moving on, moving on.
[00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:50.800]   Let's get to the 24.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.760]   Moving on.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.920]   And now today we have our iPad.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.960]   Yeah, we got iPad.
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.480]   I love them.
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.840]   All right, well, what do you want to talk about?
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.320]   What's the big story for you this?
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:02.080]   I just want to talk about something more--
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:02.680]   Modern.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.200]   Modern.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:04.960]   I guess you're right.
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:05.440]   I mean, I guess--
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.880]   This new fangled stuff is pretty terrific.
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.080]   There's a lot of stuff going on.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.080]   It's August.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.240]   You haven't fun.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:14.000]   OK, enough of the 20-year, 30-year, 16-year history.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.080]   Don't remind me I'm old.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:16.840]   I know.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:18.840]   Google+ has games.
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:19.360]   Really?
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.840]   Sorry.
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.920]   Last time, I thought this has games.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.760]   Nintendo has games.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.760]   Well, what are you thinking?
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.640]   This is actually kind of a surprise to me, because this is--
[00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.000]   you could have made the argument that Google's social network,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.920]   Google+ wasn't going after Facebook.
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.600]   It was just--
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:35.160]   Really?
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.240]   Oh, hello.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.280]   Until you see the games, and now it's pretty obvious.
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:39.280]   Well, until you see Google+.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.280]   And then nothing better to do.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.200]   You could make that argument.
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.000]   Really, you don't think this is going after Facebook?
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:43.520]   I do.
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.920]   We think the first--
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:45.480]   I think the one--
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:46.320]   You think it was obvious?
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.200]   Yes, of course.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.160]   But boy, when you add these games, I mean, this is--
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.360]   what is Google's interest, though, in games?
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:52.720]   I mean, are they going to put ads in here?
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.760]   What-- why games?
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.000]   Facebook has games.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   We should have games.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:56.560]   Games, exactly.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:56.840]   Really?
[00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.040]   Something people do on social networks.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.400]   It's actually a big part of Facebook.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:27:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:27:59.920]   People use games.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.480]   And you can see I have underneath the game screen.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:01.960]   I've been joking with it.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.600]   These are people I follow, and this is the stupid--
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.560]   the nice thing that Facebook doesn't do
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.640]   is they segregate these game updates
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.640]   into a separate stream.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:10.160]   Thank god.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.080]   Well, what can Google do with those?
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.360]   They can put ads in, which they obviously will do.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.680]   They can sell them and take a cut,
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.160]   and we make it less than anybody else.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.320]   They can take a cut of virtual currency.
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.240]   They can make it possible for me to get a better high score
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.640]   than Scoble in Angry Birds.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:22.960]   Yes.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:23.480]   Yes.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.320]   So there you go.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:27.520]   And they can get people to stop using them on Facebook.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.480]   They can use the user's Facebook to go down, which
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.320]   is, I think--
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.160]   I mean, everything Facebook has, they're going to replicate.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:33.880]   What's missing now?
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.760]   What do they need to do next?
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.800]   Audience size.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:37.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.320]   Audience size.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:38.760]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:39.080]   People.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:39.760]   User base.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:39.920]   User base.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.480]   Well, man, that's actually a real question,
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:44.600]   because the real people who use Facebook right now
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:49.240]   are not the technorati that use Google+.
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.000]   I don't think it's the technorati to move over.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.360]   It's actually--
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:53.120]   they have a wider base.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.280]   I think we just wrote about--
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:55.680]   it's more suburban.
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:58.360]   A lot of more people are trying Google+ than you imagine.
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.600]   This is the suburban crowd.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.640]   Well, yeah, there was a story earlier this week.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.640]   I think it's on one of your lists.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.160]   I think we wrote it that the suburban crowd is actually
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:06.560]   more than the college students.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.080]   You live in the suburbia.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.520]   This is ex-bourbia.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.040]   This is ex-bourbia.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:10.760]   Walk down the street.
[00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:12.680]   People are doing their plasm.
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.120]   So it's interesting.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.720]   I mean, they're going to replicate everything
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:20.360]   we experienced on Facebook and make it slightly different.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.240]   And what was interesting is a couple of weeks ago,
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.160]   and you hear all the technorati talk about Google+
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.920]   and it's exhausting to listen to them, talk about it.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.520]   But I was with someone who was not a non-tech person.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.320]   And one of the things they said really struck me
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:32.320]   is that on Facebook, I've kind of messed it up.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.280]   I have too many people.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.680]   I didn't organize it right.
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.560]   And now I know how to use social network.
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.320]   So Facebook taught them how to use it.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.160]   This is a chance for a reset.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.160]   They want a reset, and they don't want a reset on--
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.880]   they don't think they can reset Facebook,
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.480]   because they've already claimed their name there.
[00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.720]   And so it was an interesting--
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.040]   That's an interesting point of view.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.480]   I thought it was from someone who wasn't.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.760]   Do you think that Facebook beat my space
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:53.760]   because of that, that was a reset?
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.040]   Well, ugly, right?
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:56.800]   My space was just a mess.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.160]   That was a whole-- my space was for meeting people
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.200]   you didn't know, and Facebook was for dealing with people
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:01.720]   you do know.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:03.920]   And I think there's actually a really opening for people
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:05.400]   you don't know.
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.600]   A way to meet new people in new areas.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:11.080]   So that could be an area of social network that could get--
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.520]   reinvented again.
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.520]   So this would be a three-way battle.
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:18.400]   Google, Facebook, and Twitter, Apple Combo.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.880]   It would be a nice three-way battle.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:20.240]   It would be good.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.640]   Now the Twitter's on the iPhone.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:26.120]   And the only problem is just that we don't have enough time
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.080]   in a day to use all of them.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.520]   So we would have to make active choices
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:36.280]   as to how we want to do the social networking, not--
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.280]   all of them is not an option.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.760]   So this is what experience said.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.440]   Experience hit-wise.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.760]   They do analysis of audiences.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.520]   They say that the Google+ subsection is, quote,
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:52.680]   "mysterable married people stuck at home in the burbs
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.600]   with children."
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.080]   That's-- it's cobalt, right?
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:55.600]   Wait, no.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:56.960]   It is cobalt.
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:57.760]   It calls them--
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.600]   It's not necessarily very happy.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:02.080]   It calls them the kids in Cabernet Group.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:04.840]   "Prosporous middle-aged married couples
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:08.080]   living child-focused lies of quiet desperation,"
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:08.600]   by that part.
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:10.480]   This is nonsense.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.440]   So first of all, OK, whatever this says, look,
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:15.560]   Google+ is what has 12 million people now on it.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:16.600]   It was in CNET.
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.200]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.680]   Whatever.
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.080]   But it's so early days.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.240]   I mean, by the time it is.
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:27.120]   Google+, if it works according to plan, which I believe it will,
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:30.520]   is going to become a giant pervasive social network.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.120]   And there'll be these little subsets all over it
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.200]   less like any social network.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:33.640]   Well, it's also--
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:37.200]   it's going to be a network of x group or that group.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.080]   I mean, here's the thing.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.120]   You can't succeed if it is.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:39.680]   Well, you know what?
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.360]   What's success?
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.880]   Does Google really want to make money from this?
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:42.280]   Or do they really--
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:42.800]   That was my question.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.200]   That's the thing.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:43.600]   They don't have to--
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.200]   What's the end game?
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:44.720]   What's the end game?
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.160]   This is their internet explorer.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.560]   Their internet explorer, exactly.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.400]   They're going to give it away.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.320]   Larry woke up and said, just like Bill Gates woke up years ago
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.880]   with that internet--
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.640]   Right.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.560]   His geotic many years ago.
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.880]   And Larry woke up and said, social is this.
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.120]   And that's what they've shifted.
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:01.080]   And so the question is, do they really need to make money?
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:06.080]   Or is it-- to me, it's all part of the phone search phone ecosystem
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.760]   they're trying to build beyond the web PC.
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.200]   They don't want to lose the search data to Facebook.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:11.680]   Right.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.200]   Everything.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:12.700]   Right.
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.960]   Google has always consistently said, we don't care.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.560]   As long as you use the internet more, we will make money.
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.760]   Well, they want you to use their calendar and their mail
[00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.600]   and their phone together with their Google+,
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.920]   and actually, if you look at it, the Google+ mobile app
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.400]   is terrific comparatively.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.720]   The service is a little wonky and a little bit cloochie,
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.640]   but the mobile app is terrific.
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.160]   Really?
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.480]   I think it feels very limited.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.200]   Oh, I like it.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.240]   I think it's really clean.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.360]   You can't click on-- you can't circle people from--
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.360]   Clean and limited are like two sides of the same design.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.360]   I know, I like it.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:42.880]   Typical iPhone user.
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:47.680]   But it is telling that they released Google+ both on the web
[00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.960]   and mobile simultaneously.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:50.440]   Very quickly.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.760]   I mean, people are saying that whatever the trends are,
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:56.080]   the number one trend is-- what do they say?
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.040]   Mobile, social, local, has one trend.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:58.540]   Right.
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:32:59.560]   And Google has that.
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:00.000]   Yes.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.320]   Google owns that now.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:03.880]   Well, I think the other interesting aspect
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:07.760]   is that Google is trying to unify all its products
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.920]   and create a unified experience.
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.800]   Whereas Facebook, on the other hand,
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:15.000]   is trying to do disaggregated experience
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   of Facebook services.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.280]   With Facebook Connect and the personal--
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.440]   Facebook Messenger.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.880]   They're coming out with the Facebook photo app soon.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.640]   Yeah, they have two apps on the iPhone now.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.120]   They have a Messenger and a Facebook.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.920]   Yeah, but now they're going to have a photo app.
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:28.760]   And I think you're going to--
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:29.520]   What's the point of that?
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.480]   Because I think what's happening is that this--
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:32.040]   Poor brand man.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.680]   --one size fit all social network at some point
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.040]   becomes too much.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.040]   It's a really-- yeah.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.560]   So you need to have focused applications
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.080]   for the mobile device to have a focus.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.000]   I think that's pretty interesting
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.320]   to see how they go about doing it.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.360]   I do feel that Google's going to stumble a little bit
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:54.440]   on Google plus for a bit before they get it right.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.200]   You know, it's really--
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.760]   I do want them to get it right because there's
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.840]   three players in the market is always a competition.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:00.840]   Competition is--
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.400]   You're the smart people here.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.120]   I'm just curious.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.800]   I mean, we've got a very smart panel.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.000]   You must have thought about this.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.880]   This really is going to come down to who makes the right moves
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:09.520]   in this chess game.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.040]   Actually, is it Mark Zuckerberg?
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.360]   Is it Larry Page?
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.880]   Is it Steve Jobs?
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.080]   Is it whoever runs Twitter this week?
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.680]   Well, the only thing is Mark Zuckerberg
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:22.480]   has this many 750 or 800 million people on that thing.
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.680]   We'll see how Google plus emerges.
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:25.800]   It's only 20 million people.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.480]   And it's very exciting.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.760]   It's only 20 million in a month.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.840]   True, but people know how to use social networks.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.360]   I mean, Mark Zuckerberg came from almost nowhere
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.600]   to be using these things.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:37.320]   And so I want to see what happens to the next 100 million
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.320]   for them or the next to get to 100 million.
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.160]   And then see what happens.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:42.120]   Well, aren't they-- the growth is slowing considerably.
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.160]   Well, of course, because it's like excitement
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.000]   among tech people.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.800]   A question is, will regular people begin to use it?
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.520]   Well, you got this problem.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.000]   There's only 6 billion people in the world.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.440]   Eventually, you run out of people.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.440]   That's a problem.
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.360]   Yeah, Zuckerberg has a solution to that probably.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:54.560]   Because he hasn't released the--
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.200]   He involves other planets.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:56.600]   Here's the thing.
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.440]   I just was in Asia.
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:34:59.000]   Walt and I went to Asia because we were doing an Asia
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:34:59.680]   conference.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.160]   And we were in Korea and Japan.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.760]   And none of them, not Facebook, not Google plus.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.320]   I mean, are popular.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.680]   In either country, the local solutions there
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.720]   are the popular ones.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.320]   In Korea, they have neighbor.
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.920]   They have all kinds of things that are local.
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.400]   Resilis or could.
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:14.480]   Well, yeah, or could.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:15.640]   That's a Google property.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.920]   But actually, other local things are growing there.
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.480]   And in Japan, Mixie remains the most popular service.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.640]   I think Facebook is 4 million people using.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.640]   It's a very small amount of market.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.080]   So there is growth potential in Asia.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:26.520]   There is.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.400]   But maybe they're not using Facebook's in Google plus.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.160]   It's about maybe they're using their local solution.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.440]   So it's a very complicated thing where you're
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.680]   trying to get the big numbers.
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.080]   Search is kind of that way, too, right?
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:36.480]   By using as much bigger as China.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.200]   Korea, Google's like no percent, like very small percent.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.200]   Same thing in Japan.
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.480]   They do own Yahoo Search now in Japan.
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.400]   So there's an opportunity for growth in areas
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.720]   where you aren't strong right now.
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.560]   Or those countries will do fine.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:50.360]   Those local solutions like a Mixie in Japan will do better.
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:53.040]   So it's not inevitable that Facebook and Google
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:56.120]   are going to march around the world taking over social networking.
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.040]   Is it possible that Facebook will follow--
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.760]   I mean, are social networks disposable
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.080]   if they get unwieldy enough?
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:04.280]   Can Facebook possibly follow my space into obscurity?
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.000]   It's possible.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.480]   I mean, we've seen it before with MySpace and Friendster
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:10.600]   that the cool kids will abandon a social network
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.080]   when it becomes slow or bogged down.
[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:16.040]   Or there's-- and part of that is a perception that's not
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.160]   cool anymore.
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.560]   And I think Facebook has crossed that barrier.
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.280]   I think we are incorrect in assuming
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:25.400]   that Facebook is a social network.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:25.960]   What is it?
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.280]   It is actually a communications company.
[00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.840]   It is the new mobile.
[00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.360]   I think people are not-- they're focusing on the wrong things
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.040]   on that company.
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.880]   We focus on the front page of the company
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:41.200]   after service, whereas what really is is
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.560]   their business is connecting people and finding ways
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:48.320]   to figure out what is the things we like or things we share
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.800]   or things we do and build basically advertising
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.800]   solutions based on it.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:57.280]   I think Facebook Messenger is a good example of them
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.680]   trying to be a communications company.
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:04.680]   And they have 750 million people are the identity now,
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:05.880]   is Facebook.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.520]   Look at-- like, you can't log into any app now
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.600]   without using Facebook Connect.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:12.600]   I mean, they're just becoming pervasive,
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.360]   but in a very strange sort of way.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:16.280]   So speaking of mobile, what do you think of their relationship
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.440]   with Skype?
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:18.320]   How important is that?
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.680]   It's pretty-- you know, it's a pretty close relationship.
[00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:23.320]   Their relationship with Microsoft, Skype,
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.160]   it's part of the whole--
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:28.240]   it's their version of the web, right?
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:32.640]   Which is they are controlling it as a communication channel.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:36.360]   I think that's what scares Google more than anything else.
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:39.600]   It's not how many friends you have that scares Google.
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.800]   It's if you are communicating through the Facebook
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.400]   communication system, you don't quite
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.640]   need Google in that environment.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.520]   Because you're going to suck in all the time away
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:54.320]   from Google into this, you know, that three some--
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.640]   Facebook Dialter is Dialog--
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.480]   And then what about Facebook, for example?
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.760]   Just putting this out.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:01.760]   What if Microsoft handed Bing over to Facebook?
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.680]   That would be it.
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:05.680]   No, it could be-- and they use search on Facebook using Bing.
[00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.800]   There could be lots of things that Facebook could do
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.640]   to get into-- the two of them are moving so closely
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.760]   into each other's businesses that it's a question of whether--
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.320]   there's two kinds of search-- regular search and people's search.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.880]   And Facebook owns people's search and Google owns regular search.
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:22.480]   So the question is how we begin to search in the future.
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:24.320]   What are how many people use docs.com?
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:28.600]   That was the Microsoft web-based office that
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.560]   was tied into Facebook.
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.440]   You don't hear a lot about that with a launch of Office 365,
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.200]   but that's another example of Microsoft's
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:37.240]   tight integration--
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:37.760]   Trying.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:38.800]   --trying with Facebook.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:39.300]   Right.
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:39.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.600]   I mean, that's an interesting pairing.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.120]   Even if people like to crap all over Microsoft all the time,
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:47.080]   it's still an incredibly powerful company with a lot of assets
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:50.680]   that they could bring to bear help in this alliance with Facebook.
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.960]   It's a smart move for Microsoft.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:53.560]   It keeps them relevant.
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.060]   Yeah.
[00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:55.520]   I mean, they're doing some relevant things.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:56.880]   I mean, they connect as terrific.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.640]   You know, the phone is not that bad.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:38:59.440]   It's not the worst.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.440]   It's just not-- it wasn't the first.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.320]   Well, and they've done the same thing with the phone
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.280]   that they're doing with Facebook.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.480]   They've joined with Nokia.
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.000]   Right.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.440]   Again, attempting to keep relevant by partner.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.880]   And the other thing is they have tons of money.
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.120]   I do not go there yet.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.080]   But I do think--
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:11.920]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:15.800]   --because Facebook is as powerful as Google--
[00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.200]   It's Twitter and iOS.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.440]   And it's the same kind of relationship.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.080]   I think it's still-- like, you know,
[00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:24.480]   when you look at the Facebook video powered by Skype,
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:27.480]   there's going to be some interesting stuff happening there.
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.480]   I think Facebook is completely thinking differently
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:31.520]   about the web.
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:35.640]   They are years ahead of everybody else, in my opinion,
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:36.800]   on social.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:41.160]   And there's one thing you cannot forget that Google's
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:45.280]   social efforts are run by two guys who can leave any time.
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:45.760]   Right?
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.360]   I mean, not that they've been--
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.960]   You're saying Victor and Bradley Horowitz.
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.520]   Yeah, because they work for the company.
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:51.960]   They're not the founder.
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.080]   They're not Larry and Sergey.
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.320]   Mark is just there.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.720]   Like, he's not going anywhere.
[00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:56.240]   Right.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:58.840]   And just like, Jack is back at Twitter.
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.000]   He's not going anywhere.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.680]   So to get back to my original question,
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:04.640]   these guys are what powers it is, his brains.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.600]   Like, look, the Twitter DNA and Facebook DNA is all social.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:14.280]   They have had few years to think ahead of Google.
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.600]   Google has great people.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:18.600]   You know, I think Bradley is one of the smartest people
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.160]   at Google right now.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.480]   But Larry and Sergey, I don't think they're convinced entirely
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:24.920]   on the whole social thing.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.640]   There's a lot of lip service there.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.400]   I still don't buy into it.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.640]   You don't go from one day--
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.520]   you're not really a social person.
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.520]   And like, 12 months later, you're a very socially aware company.
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.920]   It's like Microsoft and the internet.
[00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:38.920]   It's like so bad.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.160]   It's such an ash barrel.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.160]   And you know, I think what Omar's talking about a bigger
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.720]   idea is that these focused, founder-based companies,
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.960]   which most of tech companies are still today--
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.440]   we're only 20 years into it, really.
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:50.760]   So the web itself.
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:52.560]   And these founder-based companies,
[00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:56.920]   Jobs at Apple, Mark at Facebook, Jeff Bezos at Amazon,
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:00.240]   and Larry and Sergey at Google, it's a very powerful thing
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.800]   if Mark's just focused on one thing,
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:02.840]   and they're focused on--
[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:03.800]   I don't know.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.320]   When aren't they focused on Google?
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.320]   Self-diving cars?
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.000]   Fucking cars.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.120]   Although that's cool.
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:09.440]   I don't make fun of that car.
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.040]   I think that's pretty cool.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.120]   I'm not making one of their car.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.240]   But they do have a lot of interests.
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:12.760]   Yeah.
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:15.080]   I mean, they've got a lot of irons and--
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:16.280]   And they're interested people.
[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.200]   So that's why they're like that.
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.480]   But they mostly search as what their business is still.
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:21.760]   And so the question is, can you really--
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.800]   if one company is completely dedicated to one thing,
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.840]   and another company has dedicated to several things,
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:27.880]   who wins there?
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.120]   It's just an interesting question if they can.
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.200]   And is it important that the founder, that the visionary,
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:32.920]   the rigid guy--
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:33.480]   I think so.
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:34.480]   I think so.
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.720]   Obsessions really helpful when you make it products.
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:37.800]   Is that what happened with Microsoft?
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:38.960]   Will Bill Gates left?
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:39.800]   Yeah, I think a little bit.
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.240]   I mean, Steve Bombers know Bill Gates.
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.400]   He's a sales--
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.760]   He was an early founder.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.080]   He really was a founder in a lot of ways.
[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.720]   He certainly have an interconnection that was important.
[00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:48.800]   But he doesn't have that vision.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:49.720]   He's a sales guy.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.040]   He's not the tech leader, which tech leaders
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:52.880]   are really important.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.120]   And that's why you see trouble at certain companies
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.160]   and not trouble at others.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.160]   It's not just tech.
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.160]   Like Starbucks.
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.160]   Starbucks.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.880]   You know, how much else comes back.
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:03.920]   Companies starting to do interesting things.
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:05.400]   I mean, coffee's more drinkable again.
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:06.800]   I don't know about that.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.440]   But not all of us are always within walking distance.
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.280]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.680]   That's not true.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.920]   I started my business in a Starbucks.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:15.600]   So I owe them a lot.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:18.400]   But coffee's not that great.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.880]   But there is a thing.
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:23.120]   You have to have an obsession.
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:24.920]   You have a long-term vision.
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:26.520]   You build big companies.
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:27.720]   You have a near-term vision.
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:31.480]   You're going to build some tiny little company.
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:34.920]   Jeff Bezos didn't start this company today.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.680]   He started it 16 years ago.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.520]   And he's still not even done.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:40.040]   He's like--
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:41.040]   It's obvious.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.280]   He's still, you know, like tablets?
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.160]   Like, why are they thinking about tablets?
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:49.480]   So they have these big founders, big winners, big idea guys,
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:52.120]   have this grand vision of the future.
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:54.760]   They want to rearrange the web and the world,
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.640]   according to how they see it.
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.760]   Those are the people who build big companies.
[00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.680]   And I think that's the difference.
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.040]   And Paul, right with that Edward Land.
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.040]   Edwin Land.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:03.520]   Yeah.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:04.720]   Ford, without Henry Ford.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.400]   These companies--
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:06.720]   Standard, Vase, Rockefeller.
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:09.240]   May survive, but they are not the same kind.
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:11.040]   Or Netflix with Reed Hastings.
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.560]   You can really go down the list.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.200]   And then you look at companies that are not
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.360]   the original founders.
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:16.040]   And they struggle.
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:17.880]   Look at Yahoo.
[00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:18.880]   Absolutely.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.160]   Jerry, just--
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.560]   Well, he wasn't the CEO type.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.320]   But you need a meaningful leader in place
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:25.080]   at these companies.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:25.840]   It's also this a huge--
[00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:26.320]   They're young.
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.040]   --between a leader and a manager.
[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.320]   And a leader who's out in front with a flag who
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:32.560]   has everybody following them versus somebody
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:35.520]   who's like managing numbers and pushing quarterly.
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:36.200]   You need both.
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.560]   Well, you need operations, of course.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:38.640]   Paul Graham's always said you have
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:39.360]   to have two founders.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:40.320]   You have to have the visionary.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:41.080]   It often is too.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:41.680]   It's fascinating.
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:42.600]   But it's often too.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:43.600]   It's a ballman.
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:45.520]   That's a good team in its day.
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:46.880]   Vase is the only one who is--
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:48.040]   Evan Biz.
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:50.680]   --alone in a lot of ways, who started it alone with himself.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:52.760]   Yeah, but I think probably he's--
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:53.440]   It's interesting.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:54.280]   He's just the one.
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.600]   He is the next Steve Jobs environment.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.080]   He's quite a visionary.
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:58.560]   He's has--
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.720]   You don't think Sheryl Sandberg or somebody like that is--
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:01.640]   She's a partner with him.
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:02.960]   She's been a good part of him.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.640]   What's interesting about him is unlike a lot of tech founders,
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:06.480]   he went, you know what?
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.600]   I don't want to do accounting.
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.040]   I'm going to hire the best elite expletive business manager
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.960]   I can find that's going to keep me out of trouble and stuff.
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.680]   But not make them full partners.
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:15.280]   Make them managers.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.160]   That's not true.
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:17.000]   She's a point of interest.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:17.960]   You need to have--
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:22.000]   My CEO, Paul Wabowski, is my partner from day one.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.080]   When he got there, he is a founder in my head.
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:27.960]   He's not some hired gun.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:29.400]   That's true, my company.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.720]   This studio wouldn't exist without my business bluer
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:33.360]   because I'm not going to do this.
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:35.680]   There is the business aspect of it,
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.920]   without that you can't really do it.
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.760]   So, you know, Sheryl has an immense role to play.
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:44.840]   I think Ed Shemit had a huge role to make Google work.
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:47.000]   He was a tall, supervision.
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.720]   I don't know if that's so true.
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:50.920]   He's not as adult as the ex.
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:51.920]   But, you know--
[00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:53.360]   You still have to do this all tricks, by the way.
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:55.400]   Strange pronouncements.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.680]   It's amazing.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:57.880]   I'm not going there.
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:01.120]   OK, look, butt cake.
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:02.400]   We talked about this last week.
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.720]   Big, crazy pants.
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:05.520]   He did a great job at D this year
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:08.120]   with the platform, the gang of four,
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.280]   which I thought was a really smart thing.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:09.960]   I think that was good.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.880]   And I love that he left Microsoft out, of course.
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:13.560]   But I thought that was a really smart idea
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.040]   of the way to look at the current state.
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:16.720]   So, he does make some very--
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:17.600]   Oh, he's a smart guy.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.800]   He has an unusual turn of phrase.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:20.520]   Sometimes, yes.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:21.840]   You look like Sean.
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:22.680]   There you go.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:23.840]   That's Rosie.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:25.600]   That was one smart company, not the company.
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:26.240]   Look, Kenny.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.440]   Geezer companies, that was one smart company.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.200]   And the seed for a lot of great things.
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:31.040]   Not a great thing.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.200]   Great people, I mean--
[00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.080]   Sundai Aspero, very important.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:35.080]   The best company ever.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:36.400]   They sell companies like that.
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.560]   Covered ever.
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.040]   Yes.
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:38.520]   Son.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:41.840]   Still, I still kind of feel like how they blew it.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.920]   Like, just that alone would be like a book.
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:46.480]   I go for it.
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:46.960]   Yeah.
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:47.400]   Now many people can.
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.560]   And your co-pius spirit time.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.280]   You can bring both from Scott.
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:49.920]   It'd be great.
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:50.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:50.960]   We're going to take a break.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:51.600]   Come back with more.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:52.240]   What a great panel.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:53.960]   We've got the Ralph Needleman here for the first time.
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:56.000]   So glad to have you from CNET.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.760]   What's the name of the podcast?
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:58.760]   The reporter's around today.
[00:45:58.760 --> 00:45:59.320]   The reporter's around today.
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:00.440]   And you do that one day of the week.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:01.320]   I do it Friday's at noon.
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:01.520]   Good.
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:02.760]   So we'll start stealing your stories.
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.320]   So Sunday will be ready.
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:04.680]   Sounds good.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:05.880]   Make it much easier.
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:08.160]   I mean, links, that's all right.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.840]   Cara Swisher from All Things D and the D Conference.
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:11.640]   I have to have better possible.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:12.880]   You're going to do D Asia.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.280]   D Asia, Asia D.
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:14.720]   Asia D.
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:15.720]   Yes.
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:15.720]   All things.
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:17.600]   Sounds like a rap star.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:18.480]   Yeah, it does a little bit.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:18.880]   Yeah, Asia D.
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:19.640]   We'll probably rap there.
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:20.160]   It'll be great.
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:20.600]   It'll be great.
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:21.120]   We're excited.
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:21.560]   What was that mean?
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:24.840]   Hong Kong on October 19th to 21st.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.640]   Why Hong Kong not Beijing, so?
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:27.400]   It was a long story.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.880]   But we felt like Hong Kong-- we wanted to make it Pan-Asian,
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:30.320]   actually.
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:33.560]   So we've got people from Korea, even Thailand.
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:34.640]   We have people in the Philippines.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:36.120]   So we wanted to make it Pan-Asian.
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.000]   And when you go into China, it becomes a China conference.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:38.640]   It's really true.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:39.880]   It's really true.
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:43.680]   Patrick Norton at techzilla.com.
[00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:47.840]   Good to have you and of course the great Om Malek from Giga Om.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:51.200]   Now, I don't know about you, but if you spend a lot of time
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:54.520]   commuting, as I did for many years,
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:56.120]   there's nothing like audiobooks.
[00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:59.640]   And audible.com, literally, I think, saved my life.
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:02.480]   I would have driven off the road years ago
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:05.120]   if I hadn't had engaging audio entertainment in the days
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.560]   before podcast from audible.com.
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.000]   I want you to try audible.com.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.120]   I think it's just the best way to spend time when you can't
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.360]   hold a book reading.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.640]   I think reading, of course, is still very important.
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.080]   It's how you learn things.
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.880]   And it was always made me sad that I just
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.360]   didn't have the time or the inclination to read.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.040]   Now, audible brought it back into my life.
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.840]   In fact, I've been an Audible member since 2000.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:31.400]   I have over 500 books in my audio library on audible.com.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.360]   I can listen to them on my iPhone, my iPod, my Android phone.
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.120]   If you haven't tried the iPhone or Android app,
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:38.320]   by the way, great apps.
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:41.760]   Audible is such a great resource for anybody
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:45.640]   who's at the gym, doing housework, driving the car.
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:47.920]   You can always listen and get reading done.
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.240]   I still get a couple hours of reading done every single day,
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.120]   thanks to audible.
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:51.760]   Try it right now.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.240]   What we're going to do is we're going to set it up
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:54.640]   so you can get two books free.
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:57.200]   So you really get a sense of whether Audible is the thing
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.520]   for you.
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:02.360]   If you go to audible.com/twit2 right now,
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:04.040]   you'll be signing up for the Platinum account.
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.280]   That's the subscription that I use.
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.160]   It's two books a month.
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.560]   And the first month is free.
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:10.560]   So you can get two books.
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:13.480]   You can cancel at any time, pay nothing.
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.000]   And I don't know where to start.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.640]   There's somebody-- this was a great book that
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:18.960]   is now being made into a major motion picture.
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.520]   I don't know how it's going to be as a motion picture.
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:23.080]   But boy, if you like baseball, moneyball
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.600]   was an amazing story.
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:32.160]   The story of how the Billy Bean was able to--
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:33.200]   It's the Oakland A's.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:34.200]   It's the Oakland A's.
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:34.760]   The Oakland A's.
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:35.680]   Yeah, well, the good team.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:36.640]   I'm a Giants fan.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:37.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:39.800]   But Billy Bean made the A's what they were
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:42.080]   by avoiding conventional wisdom,
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.800]   using stats to find players that nobody else wanted
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:47.320]   and yet make an amazing team.
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:48.600]   The art of winning an unfair game.
[00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:50.120]   You know what's interesting since this book came out
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:51.120]   a few years ago.
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:52.760]   Every major league baseball team now
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:55.000]   uses these moneyball techniques.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.360]   I can't wait to see the movie.
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:58.320]   This is the lean startup ideology.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:58.840]   It is.
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:48:59.340]   It is.
[00:48:59.340 --> 00:48:59.920]   Actually, it is.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:02.080]   It's the lean startup ideology.
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:03.600]   Another movie coming out very soon.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.760]   I like to listen to the book before I see the movie,
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:08.640]   because it makes the movie come to life in my head.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.680]   And it doesn't spoil the movie.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:13.120]   It just enhances it, whereas seeing the movie first often
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:14.040]   does spoil the book.
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:15.120]   I've got to be honest.
[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:18.960]   This is a great book, really good dramatization, by the way.
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:22.120]   Some of the audiobooks on Audible are not just somebody
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.280]   reading a book, but they actually act the book out.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:25.360]   They dramatize it.
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:27.760]   This is probably the best example of the help
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:29.280]   by Catherine Stockett.
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:33.000]   Great movie out right now in a really, really good book.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.440]   I can go on and on, but I'll tell you what.
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.080]   Why don't you try it?
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:37.040]   Go to Audible.com, browse around there.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.960]   85,000 books.
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:40.120]   Pick two.
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:44.560]   Then go to Audible.com/Twit2, and they're yours free.
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:46.280]   I know you're going to love Audible.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:50.320]   Audible.com/Twit.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:53.560]   I'm kind of tempted to read David Mamet's book.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:54.880]   He went from being--
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.040]   he kind of went crazy.
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.880]   I don't know what happened to David Mamet,
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:01.360]   but he's become this crypto-fascist.
[00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:02.880]   His new book is the secret knowledge
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.720]   on the dismantling of American culture.
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:07.120]   It's like an Andrew Keene style book, I guess.
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:09.160]   Anyway, I love to listen to this stuff, too.
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:12.280]   You got to hear from all sides.
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:15.000]   Audible.com/Twit2, give it a try.
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.800]   This was a story, and maybe you guys,
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.200]   because you're all in San Francisco,
[00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.640]   have more to say about it than I do.
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:25.200]   But I was kind of shocked by this story.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.560]   A few-- I guess it's now been a couple of years ago.
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:35.840]   Bart police shot somebody, and it was very, very controversial.
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:39.400]   He was a 45-year-old guy, basically,
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.200]   was lying down at the request of the police,
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:42.920]   and they just came up and they shot him.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:46.240]   And there may well be more to the story.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.000]   The police officer was acquitted.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.400]   It was a controversial situation.
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:52.440]   But it was very controversial.
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:57.080]   Saturday, there was going to be a protest on Bart
[00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.520]   during the busy evening commute.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:00.040]   Actually, because it wasn't Saturday.
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:00.920]   It was Friday.
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:03.440]   Or, no, sir, I'm sorry, Thursday, this past Thursday.
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:07.040]   Bart made a very interesting choice.
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:11.560]   They shut down cell service in the Bart tunnels.
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:13.440]   Now, we should put this into context for everybody
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:14.880]   who doesn't live in the Bay Area.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.840]   Bart is Bay Area Rapid Transit.
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.680]   It serves a huge area of Northern California.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.480]   It's not just a city subway system.
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.880]   It's not Muni is the equivalent of the New York City subway
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:25.600]   system, except unlike the New York City subway system,
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:27.680]   Muni doesn't actually run very well.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:28.600]   It's mostly--
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:29.760]   There's a lot of it's above.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:31.000]   Bart's--
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.960]   As underground it goes out to the East Bay,
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.160]   the South Bay, it really serves the whole region.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.560]   It is fantastically run.
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:39.640]   It's a fantastic means of man-conertation.
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:40.160]   It's like--
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:42.800]   It's really more like light rail than in an inner-city transit
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:43.600]   system.
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:46.440]   So they have tunnels.
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.600]   They were able-- I guess the cell service in those tunnels
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:50.040]   is provided by Bart's.
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.160]   It's spotty, though.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:52.440]   Actually, it happens to be spotty.
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:53.000]   But the--
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.800]   Their theory was, if we cut off cell service,
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.160]   they won't be able to organize this protest.
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:57.960]   Which was crazy.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:59.800]   Yeah, well, obviously they were studying around in Egypt.
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.160]   I mean, it's insane in this country for something
[00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.040]   like that to happen.
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:03.960]   It's just ridiculous.
[00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:05.520]   Is it censorship?
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:06.280]   It's stupid.
[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:06.840]   It's stupid.
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:08.440]   It's actually a lot like the Patriot Act.
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:09.280]   It's stupid.
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:10.400]   It is political theater.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.080]   It is delete expletive.
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:14.560]   We can all go back to-- I can go run and get a flag
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:16.120]   and quote Benjamin Franklin.
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:18.960]   But it is an incredibly poorly thought-out idea.
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:23.080]   What's the chief that said this isn't about free speech.
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:24.080]   It was about safety.
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:27.920]   Yeah, when a politician or somebody in a public role says,
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:29.520]   this isn't about X.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:30.680]   Then it is for sure.
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:31.680]   Now--
[00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:33.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:35.440]   You're right.
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:36.760]   The thing that's so fascinating about this
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:39.440]   is that arguably this isn't illegal.
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:40.840]   It's just really bad.
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:41.840]   It's just a costly--
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:42.760]   Because they own those--
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:43.880]   They own those wires.
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:45.240]   Well--
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:46.760]   Although it's a public agency.
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:49.760]   I mean, the sell companies put the wires in under contract
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:50.280]   or something.
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:52.920]   I'm sure-- I mean, Bart made the decision to turn them off.
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:53.480]   Right.
[00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:56.880]   And they took responsibility for it in their own statement.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:59.640]   They said, you know, we said this is a public safety issue
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:01.920]   because Bart isn't a place for demonstrations.
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:04.160]   Like I said, legally they might be in the clear,
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.520]   but man, it's a bad precedent.
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:06.720]   And where do you draw the line?
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.200]   Electronic Frontier Foundation said,
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.680]   Bart officials are showing themselves
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:11.600]   to be of a mind with a former president of Egypt,
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:12.720]   Hosni Mubarak.
[00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:15.880]   And in fact, the Twitter hashtag was moo-bar-tech.
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:17.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:20.520]   I think the issue is that they did come out
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:21.560]   and say they were doing it.
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:23.600]   So instead of being caught doing it, which was one thing,
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.520]   which was interesting.
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:26.680]   But in hopes that people would understand--
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:28.520]   And so they always pull out this idea
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:29.840]   that we have to save people.
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:33.040]   We're saving regular people against the fascists.
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:36.840]   And it just starts to get into this.
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:38.080]   It does appeal to people.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:40.640]   Like it's why we have all these things around 9/11, which
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:41.960]   is coming up with lots of-- there's
[00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:43.480]   going to be a lot of anniversary discussion
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:46.040]   about this issue of safety versus freedom.
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:48.720]   And I think in this case, it was like--
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.640]   Do you ever see that movie with Tom Cruise at--
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:51.640]   Minority?
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:53.240]   They pre-arrested people.
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:54.240]   Yeah, pre-crime.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:54.740]   Pre-crime.
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:56.400]   It's sort of like maybe all protest.
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.560]   It's prior restraint.
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:53:58.560]   It's--
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:53:59.320]   And it seems--
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:00.880]   I just-- it's censorship.
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:01.840]   It's censorship here and so.
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:04.640]   Call California and our People's Republic of California.
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:05.140]   No.
[00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:08.040]   Because actually, in a lot of ways, New Jersey--
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:09.640]   sorry, I am having--
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:11.840]   New Jersey is just as bad.
[00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:14.640]   No, I shoot as a hobby.
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.200]   I shoot guns, OK?
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:17.440]   And more than 10%--
[00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:19.280]   Am I mean, I'm just a kiss you off.
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:21.520]   Believe me, I'd want to see the light go out of your eyes.
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:22.840]   I do it up close with my hands.
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:24.960]   He's the guy who shot a man in Reno just to see him.
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:25.960]   No.
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:28.120]   But it's always funny because I get people who are like,
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:29.280]   you should leave California.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:31.720]   The People's Republic of California, California is evil.
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:34.320]   And it's like, I'll be at Desert Races with guys who are like,
[00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:37.000]   the California Air Resource Board and the EPA have to be stopped.
[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.280]   And it's like, dude, you grew up in LA in the '70s
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:40.520]   when you could see the air.
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:41.520]   I grew up in New Jersey.
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:43.960]   I might be a little afraid of the water back in London,
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:46.360]   but I couldn't see the air.
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:52.760]   And so the idea that the people's Republic of California,
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:55.640]   the guy that runs the BART police made a stupid decision.
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:57.320]   The chief of the BART police.
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:59.280]   For example, apparently unilaterally,
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.880]   because BART board was very shocked and worried about this.
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:08.120]   And I understand from-- if I was the cop in charge of BART,
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:10.960]   I can see myself making all sorts of bad decisions.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:13.120]   Because look, there's a reason I'm not a cop.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:14.880]   I'd be a horrible police officer.
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:15.880]   I understand that.
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:18.120]   But the guy made a decision that I just
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:19.400]   don't think was very American.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.400]   I also think Congress made a horrible decision
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:22.560]   in passing the Patriot Act.
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:26.160]   I mean, when you have an act that's so ugly, the ACLU and the NRA
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:27.600]   are working together to stop it.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:29.880]   You know, this is probably-- think about it.
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:33.120]   Both the ACLU and the NRA were both like the Patriot Act
[00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:34.520]   is a horrible idea.
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:35.800]   But it's the Patriot Act.
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:37.120]   So I have to pass it, because we're
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:39.360]   going to protect the people.
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.120]   But you're certainly going to get more of that discussion.
[00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:43.800]   It's good to have this discussion, but it's just--
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:45.000]   Well, just so it doesn't happen.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.720]   You know, they could do a lot of things in the BART
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.640]   to make it safer, I guess.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:50.160]   But do that, because it crosses over
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:54.360]   into people's basic abilities to communicate
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:55.840]   and other things that we're supposed to have.
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:57.120]   So the protest was about somebody getting shot.
[00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:58.280]   I mean, yeah, they could do a lot of things
[00:55:58.280 --> 00:55:59.520]   to make BART safer.
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:01.320]   But somebody got shot, and that's what this started.
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:01.820]   Right.
[00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:02.720]   That wasn't very safe.
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:04.440]   So are they going to do it on some other protests
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:05.280]   that's controversial?
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.280]   Are they going to do it on a protest?
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:07.720]   I don't think they'll ever do it again.
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:09.040]   I know, but that's the thing.
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:10.400]   Which protest do you pick?
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:13.960]   Like, do you get those crazy, gay people who want to be married?
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:15.520]   Those are crazy people who want to get married.
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:19.320]   All right, I'll play devil's advocate since this guy's job
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:20.640]   is to protect public safety.
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:22.920]   If he thought, well, this is going to be a real problem,
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:24.880]   because we're in tunnels down here.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:26.080]   We're in trains.
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.240]   It's a closed environment.
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:29.040]   We don't know how violent these people are.
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:32.200]   Maybe he got information that there were planned violence.
[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.680]   So close, so close BART.
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:34.440]   So close BART?
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:36.320]   Or put more police officers there?
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:36.840]   Right.
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:37.840]   But more police officers.
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:40.680]   Because it can't possibly be the cell phone.
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:41.400]   Right.
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:42.840]   The ability to make a cell phone call
[00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:44.240]   is going to be the determining fact
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:46.280]   on the success or the demonstration, right?
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:47.960]   Well, they're afraid of mobs.
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:49.640]   They're not in different kind of mobs.
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:51.880]   They're afraid of people--
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:53.400]   Everyone to the Embarcadero.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:55.360]   Everyone to Embarcadero and kick a trash can.
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.640]   Well, it's so funny, because they're
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:59.160]   so afraid of a flash mob, they forget
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:01.800]   that people were really good at organizing mobs long before
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:04.160]   cell phones were available.
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:06.600]   Or my goodness, wait, how much ham radio gear
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:07.600]   is over in the corner?
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:08.760]   How hard would it be?
[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:10.160]   Family radio service.
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:15.400]   But the little handhold radio, it costs $12 at any radio shack
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:18.200]   best by Walmart or drugstore in North America.
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:20.480]   You could do some pretty good organizing with a radio system.
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:20.800]   You're right.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:23.480]   I mean, you shut this down, and people
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:26.520]   who want to organize will just use different technology.
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:28.040]   They use Blackbird, encrypted BRB.
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:30.440]   The past notes, they'll talk to each other.
[00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:32.120]   They'll clear range time to meet.
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:35.520]   Later, Omen and I are going to do a protest in Petaluma.
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:36.520]   I'm taking yourself away.
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:37.840]   It'd be radical.
[00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:40.640]   Actually, this was the protest thing along with the iPhone.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:42.720]   That's why they gave everybody in San Francisco iPhones.
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:44.640]   They didn't want them to get together.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:47.720]   I took everybody using AK&T iPhones to--
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:48.240]   Yeah.
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:48.720]   That's the problem.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:50.240]   The network doesn't work any way.
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.920]   That's crazy.
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:52.960]   They're all using iPhones.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:54.040]   It's a government conspiracy.
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:56.280]   Top five geekiest cities in the US,
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:59.680]   according to the United States National Science Foundation.
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:02.400]   Actually, they call it their annual Science and Engineering
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:05.240]   Indicators report.
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:06.360]   But they do mention the word geeks.
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:09.000]   They say a geek is any worker with a bachelor's level
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.800]   of knowledge and education in science or engineering
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:14.240]   related fields or workers and occupations that
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:17.160]   require some degree of technical knowledge or training.
[00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:20.080]   The number one-- well, I'll start-- I'll do a countdown.
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:20.600]   OK.
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:22.200]   How about 20 pages long?
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.200]   I didn't even get to the--
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:23.680]   You know what?
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:24.840]   I hate it when they do this.
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:27.400]   And I know that none of your publications do this.
[00:58:27.400 --> 00:58:31.640]   It's a slideshow, which guarantees they get 20 page loads.
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:33.400]   And zero people actually see the actual--
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:35.280]   And nobody sees the actual--
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:37.240]   Number five, Durham, North Carolina.
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:39.720]   15.5% of the workforce are geeks.
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:41.160]   Make sense?
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:43.040]   Yeah, the Derralen–Drallen–Drallen–Drallen–Drallen--
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:43.600]   Very geeky.
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:47.040]   Number four, this surprised me, Huntsville, Alabama.
[00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.120]   That's the territory.
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.120]   It's NASA.
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:53.760]   16% are geeks, 36,000 geek workers.
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:55.360]   Framingham Mass, that's what--
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:56.200]   What's the most money on there?
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:56.960]   Lotus.
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:57.960]   Lotus.
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:58:58.960]   Lotus?
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:58:59.960]   Route 128.
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:01.200]   Lotus is route 128.
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:01.720]   That's what I mean.
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:03.360]   But Lotus is still around?
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:04.840]   Well, at the end, bottom.
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:05.160]   OK.
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:06.080]   But it's route 128.
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:06.920]   There's lots of stuff there.
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:07.920]   Huntsville is interesting.
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:11.280]   Meghan went to Space Camp there once with Larry and Sergey.
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:11.600]   Wait a minute.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:12.560]   Here on MDR.
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:13.560]   It was a long time ago.
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:14.120]   How old were they?
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:16.400]   They old enough that they shouldn't be dressed up
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:17.440]   as astronauts.
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:18.520]   This was after Google?
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:20.200]   No, right before she worked at Google.
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:21.040]   That's hysterical.
[00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:23.240]   Larry, Sergey Piero, Midea, organized it.
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:24.320]   Oh, that's great.
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:25.520]   Elon Musk was on the trip.
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:26.200]   That's just--
[00:59:26.200 --> 00:59:26.720]   It's quite a--
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:27.220]   OK.
[00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:28.000]   That's just weird.
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.520]   I have a picture I'm keeping for blackmail.
[00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:31.000]   Perfectly.
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.360]   Did they have to wear spaces?
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:34.120]   They had their own spaces with their names on them
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:35.120]   that Piero got me.
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:36.120]   Oh, I want this picture.
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:36.720]   Yeah, I have.
[00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:37.680]   Come on, you got to share it.
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:39.320]   I promise not to tell anybody.
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:40.600]   Number two, she said no.
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:41.680]   I was invited, and I said it.
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:42.040]   Did they have a--
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:42.480]   You didn't go?
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:43.640]   I said, did they have four seasons?
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:45.160]   I can't possibly go with my students.
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:48.440]   No, they dropped themselves in pools, and they did swirly things.
[00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:49.440]   Not--
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:50.960]   Oh, the centrifuge.
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:51.520]   They did all of it.
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:52.240]   Where your face goes.
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:53.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:56.000]   That's what you want is the picture.
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:56.000]   No.
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.360]   Larry, like this.
[00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:58.880]   I'm going really fast.
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:00.440]   They did the whole thing.
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.920]   Number two, Boulder, Colorado.
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:03.920]   Not even--
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:04.600]   More Kimimdi.
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.520]   More Kimimdi.
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:06.400]   Oh, that was Denver.
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:07.080]   There's lots of people.
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:10.440]   17% of the workforce is in the Geek Professions 28,000 workers
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:10.760]   employed.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.760]   The number one-- well, that's obvious.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:17.040]   Number one, Geek City in America, San Jose, Sunnyvale, Santa
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:20.760]   Clara, we know it better as the Silicon Valley.
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:22.840]   18.2%.
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:25.080]   So that means one in five people you meet at Silicon Valley
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.160]   is a geek.
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:26.660]   Yes.
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:29.120]   The rest are geek support personnel,
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.960]   spacesuit manufacturers, 165,000 workers
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.760]   in the science, technology, engineering, and science.
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.760]   This comes in surprise to all of us.
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:37.240]   Yeah.
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:37.920]   Shocking.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:38.800]   We've never met a geek.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:42.680]   I watched 20 freaking slides to get you that information.
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:45.520]   Number 17, Bloomington and Normal, Illinois.
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.880]   But not for long if Michael Bloomberg has his way
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:50.760]   by establishing the technology campus in New York City.
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:51.320]   Oh, really?
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:51.600]   Yes.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:52.600]   Didn't you read about that?
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:52.960]   I think it's--
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:53.640]   Tell me about that.
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.880]   I mean, San Francisco is only number 19.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.840]   San Francisco is only number 19.
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:58.560]   Only 9%.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:00:59.600]   That's because there's other people
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:00.440]   who are doing other things.
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.360]   Not really.
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.240]   20% cafe--
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.160]   I'd say many people are not working.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:04.960]   Baristas.
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:05.400]   Baristas.
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:06.680]   It's very big in baristas.
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.120]   And Arbor, Michigan.
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:08.840]   It's an organic selling of kale.
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.280]   Kale is very huge.
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:10.720]   Complicates.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:11.560]   Knock and layer again.
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:12.760]   I work at the Farmers' Gate.
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.000]   Yoga cupcakes.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.400]   Boston, number 15.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:18.480]   Palm Bay, Melbourne, and Titusville, Florida.
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:18.920]   What?
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:19.920]   Again, NASA.
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:20.560]   Number 14.
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:22.240]   I only know Titusville because I had to go there
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.400]   on a vacation recently.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:24.360]   Did you wear a space suit?
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.360]   I was so unhappy that we went there.
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:27.200]   Why did you go there?
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:28.720]   Kagan Lake Space.
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:29.880]   Megan loves the space for the beautiful--
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:30.880]   Ames, Iowa.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.320]   I sat in the car and cried.
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:35.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.840]   You couldn't go under the beach.
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:38.080]   I got to go to Miami Beach.
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:39.720]   That was my space.
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:42.240]   I said, immediately, I'm like, we're driving to Miami Beach,
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.320]   South Beach immediately, and with the gays immediately.
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.160]   Anyway.
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.800]   Moving to Miami.
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:50.760]   Austin Round Rock, number 12.
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:51.720]   I don't want to do anywhere.
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:52.240]   I'm done.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.160]   Can we move on?
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:54.000]   We're going to move on.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.160]   We're going to take a break.
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:57.800]   Whenever-- this is a rule, by the way.
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.080]   It's like, "Muse-Turd Pie."
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:01:59.840]   Remember that song?
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:02.320]   You need a, like, a referee's call.
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:04.000]   Anybody yell out, "Kan" subjects.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.520]   Anybody who complains about the stories
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.600]   gets to come up with the next story.
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.440]   No, that's not my job.
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:10.920]   Oh!
[01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:11.920]   I'm just trying to shed.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.200]   He wants to get to Apple?
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.360]   What do you want to get to?
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:15.000]   Well, good.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.560]   In that case, our next story will
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.880]   be about temporary tattoos fitted with electronics.
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:19.920]   Dad is a great name.
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:22.240]   OK, I have tattoos, but they're not temporary.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:22.880]   I have three.
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:24.600]   Are they fitted with electronics?
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:25.560]   I don't hope not.
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:26.840]   We could retrofit.
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:28.280]   We could retrofit.
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.920]   Actually, I see you have one that's cuticle in the heart.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:30.960]   I have my two kids.
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:31.480]   Little hearts.
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:33.960]   Little hearts, L and A. And then I have one on my leg.
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:34.360]   That's all right.
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.720]   You don't have to show us what you have.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:36.480]   Here, there you go.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:37.480]   Look, they're not agreeing.
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:39.080]   So each kid, you got a little tattoo?
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:39.600]   Yeah.
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:40.880]   Right on the jugular vein there.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:41.800]   Yeah, right there.
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:44.320]   It's an L and an A. And then this is making pancakes
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.160]   one morning.
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:47.520]   Sure it is.
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.400]   Let's take a break and talk about Squarespace.
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.720]   Talk right into Google Church.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:52.640]   What?
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:53.120]   What?
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:55.280]   Who's going to talk about the Google Search Tattoo?
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.240]   Google Search Tattoo.
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:56.800]   Coming up.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:57.560]   Google.
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:59.400]   Something you'd want to stay tuned for.
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.960]   No, no.
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:02.480]   Google Search Tattoo.
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.920]   Actually, can you type in fields and you make money?
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:05.560]   Every time you think.
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.960]   No, just think.
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:07.640]   Just think.
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:08.240]   Just think.
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:08.740]   Yeah.
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:10.320]   OK, I'm looking for this.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.160]   Find me that.
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.600]   And it just gets reflected.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.960]   You know what really is the most disturbing ad campaign ever
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:17.880]   is that the horrible Microsoft Bing campaign, where people
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:20.120]   just seem to sort of go crazy and spewing terms.
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:21.120]   Yeah, I like that.
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:21.600]   You like that?
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.120]   I do.
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:24.520]   It actually disturbs me.
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:27.400]   Did you see the one where the two of them are two people?
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.400]   I think it's from McDonald's.
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.440]   They're saying the same word at the same time.
[01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.320]   We had our thesis.
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.320]   There's a bunch like that.
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:33.560]   I need to watch more TV.
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:34.360]   Was this on Glee?
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:35.440]   Yeah, I'd get off with you.
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.360]   Two people saying the same thing?
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:39.900]   Yeah, it was a copy of actually oddly enough Chris
[01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.960]   Saka's brother did a comedy act like that once.
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:44.480]   And Donald seems to be boring.
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.160]   Chris Saka's brother is a comedian?
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:46.960]   Yeah.
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:48.920]   Chris Saka is a well-known venture capitalist.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:49.600]   And a comedian.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:50.320]   And a comedian.
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.800]   Chris is a comedian too.
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:52.440]   Oh, yeah?
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:52.880]   Have you not?
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.120]   Like a stand-up comedian?
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:55.400]   See, he's a guest you need to have.
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:56.400]   Or he's just funny.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.360]   He's very funny.
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.200]   Is this in premium chicken sandwiches?
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.160]   You should have Chris be French in France.
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:08.000]   By the way, we've learned because Google's YouTube
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.920]   will pull down the show if we have copyright violation,
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.880]   despite the fact that this is about to be fair use.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:16.840]   And I'm giving McDonald's a free freaking ad.
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:17.920]   But they will pull down the show.
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:20.160]   But we've discovered if you run it not full screen,
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:23.040]   but embedded in a web page, it doesn't trigger--
[01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.960]   There are guys at Google right now going, we got it.
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:25.640]   We got to change that.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:26.960]   Resolution on the back cuts is now--
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:27.960]   Right.
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.120]   So these are the--
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.800]   You just said you go first.
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:32.600]   No you.
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.120]   OK, I was just saying.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.000]   Isn't this why I cut the cord?
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.840]   This is why you don't have a cable anymore.
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:40.120]   All right, we'll find a story.
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:40.640]   I promise you.
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.200]   I think it's about the absence of a comma, including the sandwich.
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:44.120]   OK.
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:45.160]   Would you like a cupcake?
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:45.960]   No, thank you.
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:46.800]   Thank you for offering.
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.880]   Cupcake home?
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:48.400]   Anybody?
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:48.880]   Cupcake?
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:49.720]   It's got the twit logo.
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:50.760]   You do want me to shut up.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:51.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:53.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.840]   Let me eat cupcakes.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.960]   You can now put the Squarespace Lower Third Back Up.
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:58.760]   Thank you very much.
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:04:59.960]   Squarespace.com.
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:02.000]   It's the secret behind exceptional websites.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.440]   A great company.
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:04.640]   I love what they do.
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:08.720]   They're Java-based virtual serving technology
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:11.040]   means you never have to worry about bandwidth.
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:12.600]   So they're a great host.
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:15.160]   But they also have the best content management software
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.360]   running on top of it.
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:18.080]   There's a few reasons why you like that.
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.120]   First of all, you don't have to worry about security.
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:21.440]   The patches are automatic.
[01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.680]   You know, I spend every time I log into my WordPress blog,
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:25.720]   I got to do an update.
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.320]   Now you never have to do that with Squarespace.com.
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.200]   The only reason I keep that WordPress blog
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:31.720]   is so I'll know when the updates are.
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:32.320]   Here's what you do.
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:33.600]   You go to squarespace.com.
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:35.640]   You click the Try It Free button.
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:37.800]   All you have to do, you know credit card needed or anything,
[01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:45.520]   just a name for your site, twitcupcakes.squarespace.com.
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:50.840]   A password, om is hungry.
[01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:51.880]   And an email address.
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:52.640]   I am hungry.
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:53.160]   Yeah, see?
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:53.720]   Well, that's it.
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.920]   I'm going to create this now.
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.840]   Look, by the way, I've told you what the site is
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.000]   and what the login is now.
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.680]   I'm going to demand the Twit audience.
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:03.200]   Get to work on this site and create
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:06.280]   a site that will entice Om into eating these cupcakes.
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:07.720]   No, no, no, you can't eat cupcakes.
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:08.600]   It's unhealthy for him.
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:09.600]   He does want me to eat.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.100]   OK.
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:11.040]   No, yes, I have eaties.
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:11.800]   OK.
[01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:15.960]   So create a site that explains why Om should not
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.400]   be considered to these cupcakes.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:18.880]   No, no.
[01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.240]   Oh, once the lid--
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:20.600]   Once the lid--
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:24.360]   Or suggest Keras Next Tattoo.
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:26.120]   OK, I am getting a new tattoo.
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.280]   OK, so that's good.
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:30.280]   So we'll have Twitcupcakes.squarespace.com.
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:32.320]   The password is Om is Hungry.
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.920]   Email address, you don't need to know that.
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:34.560]   You can go in there.
[01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:35.280]   Get to work.
[01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:36.960]   Get to work, kids.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:40.000]   Meanwhile, while they're working on this new Squarespace site--
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.800]   I did this just to show you how easy it is
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.160]   to create a Squarespace site.
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:46.240]   Notice we didn't even need a credit card or anything.
[01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:47.160]   We just created the site.
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:47.800]   Just go to Squares.
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:48.360]   I'm going to do this again.
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:51.120]   It has to be gluten-free and sugar-free, first of all.
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:51.640]   OK.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:51.640]   OK.
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:52.640]   Which is fine.
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:53.120]   The tattoo?
[01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:54.200]   No, no.
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:55.120]   The cupcake.
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:56.240]   The cupcake.
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:58.480]   What do you eat?
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:06:59.320]   Food, health food.
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:01.080]   OK, OK, let's check it.
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.240]   This has a great iPhone and iPad app.
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:05.360]   It makes it really easy to post content,
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:08.400]   to check your stats, to moderate comments.
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.080]   By the way, you can have an existing type and move it
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:11.840]   over very easily.
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:14.200]   They support all the big APIs, moveable type, WordPress,
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:15.160]   type, and add a blogger.
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:18.560]   Oh, and just like the Google Data Liberation Organization,
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.560]   you can get your data back out anytime.
[01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.560]   It's a two-way import exports.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:23.720]   You're never stuck.
[01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:25.760]   Great templates, beautiful photo galleries.
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:26.760]   They've got forums.
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:28.320]   They've got form building.
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:30.760]   This is the best.
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:33.040]   If you're looking for hosting, if you're looking for content
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.960]   management, this is the place.
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:37.640]   Squarespace.com-- and by the way, if you use the offer code
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:39.520]   2-8, try it first for free.
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:42.480]   If you decide to buy, use the offer code 2-8,
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:44.480]   T-W-I-T-8, no space.
[01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:48.280]   And you will get 10% off for the first six months
[01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:51.680]   of your new Squarespace site.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:54.960]   Squarespace.com, offer code 2-8.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.800]   And there it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:01.320]   The first iteration of the twitcupcakes.squarespace.com
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:03.560]   site, om-nom-nom-nom.
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:04.960]   Can you upload a picture?
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:05.960]   I can.
[01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:06.480]   Oh, dear.
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.040]   Please, put some pictures up there.
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:10.840]   Reason number one, they are delicious.
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:12.840]   I'm looking for gluten-free cupcakes.
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:12.840]   OK.
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:13.360]   It's a good one.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:14.200]   It's even good.
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.200]   This is gluten-free.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.600]   So again, no cupcakes.
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.760]   Twitcupcakes.squarespace.com.
[01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:20.040]   The password is om is hungry.
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:23.120]   And if you've got a recipe for gluten-free cupcakes--
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.160]   oh, look.
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:25.760]   Giga-om-nom-nom-nom.
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:28.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.200]   I'm telling you, I'm telling you, this
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.280]   is the best way to do a site.
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:32.280]   Squarespace.
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:33.280]   Now with bean sprouts.
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:33.280]   Dot com.
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:34.280]   Yeah, bean sprouts.
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:35.280]   See, those are good for you.
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:35.780]   Yeah.
[01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:36.280]   Oh, delicious.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:36.280]   No.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:37.280]   Off for code 2-8.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:38.280]   I like bean sprouts.
[01:08:38.280 --> 01:08:41.240]   This is not my last try.
[01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.120]   Unless I actually kicked the bucket, which is--
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.000]   You're not going to your good health.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.640]   You're taking care of yourself.
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:47.160]   You look great.
[01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:48.880]   By the way, you look great.
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:49.440]   You look great.
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:50.480]   You're feeling well.
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:51.480]   Oh, OK.
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:52.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:53.480]   See?
[01:08:53.480 --> 01:08:55.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:59.320]   Oh, what has been seen cannot be unseen.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:01.480]   Now, what I'd like to know is, is this for all more,
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:03.520]   is this Tara's next tattoo.
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:04.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:06.000]   Yeah, you should have that.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.960]   That is a big, temporary tattoo
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.000]   is fitted with electronics.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.040]   Make flexible, ultra-thin sensors.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.560]   That's interesting.
[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:14.200]   I don't think so.
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:15.480]   Is it NFC?
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:16.440]   I don't think I want that.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:16.960]   Neofield?
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:19.000]   It feels like it's been burned into someone's skin.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.480]   There's the cupcakes themselves.
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:22.320]   I'm getting a dancing lady or something.
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:23.600]   I'm going to be dancing a lady.
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:24.080]   I don't like that.
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:24.600]   I don't know.
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:25.120]   Something pretty.
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.320]   I got Twitter.
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:27.320]   Well, tweet.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:28.160]   I think a Twitter thing.
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:28.680]   I'll get it.
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:29.680]   There's a Twitter handle on there.
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.920]   So this is an article at the Great Arms Technica
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:37.400]   in the Nobel Intent column by Kyle Neom.
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:39.720]   It looks like that new Jason Timberlake movie in time
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.520]   where they put people's-- the time they have left on their arms.
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:43.560]   That's a great--
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.200]   Is it looks like it's going to be an awesome--
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:45.640]   It looks like Logan's--
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:51.640]   Yeah, I know.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:52.640]   It's going to be an awesome one.
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.640]   It looks kind of better because there's better cars.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:57.640]   There is actually mercury in the plastic tube they use for the little cars and Logan's cars.
[01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:58.640]   It was a great little movie.
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:09:59.640]   It was an indie movie.
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:02.640]   I don't think it went anywhere where you would get an implant into your wrist.
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:06.640]   It would show you the date and time you were going to meet your one true love.
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:07.640]   It was a great movie.
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:08.640]   But they had to have one too.
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:09.640]   They had to meet at the right time.
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:14.640]   And then you'd meet and your eyes would lock and then you would know you met your one true love.
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:18.640]   Sponsored by E Harmony.
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:21.640]   They're doing some interesting things with this, but it's a boring story.
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:22.640]   So I'm going to move on.
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.640]   The movie looks good.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.640]   Did you know it was the 30th anniversary of the IBM PC?
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:27.640]   No, we heard that.
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:28.640]   Why go into it?
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.640]   Apple is now bigger than Exxon.
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:31.640]   Oh, come on.
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:32.640]   Speaking of Exxon.
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:33.640]   Who cares.
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:34.640]   How about this?
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:35.640]   Carbonite.
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:36.640]   Public IPO.
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:40.640]   You wrote this story on the worst possible day.
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.640]   Actually, the day before would have been even worse.
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:48.640]   They went public on the NASDAQ on the day that Dowdget lost 500 points, right?
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:50.640]   No, it was the day after.
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:51.640]   It was the day after.
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:58.640]   David Friend, who's a friend, their sponsor, sent me a note saying he would have had a lot of fun, but he thought maybe we could have done it on a different take.
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:02.640]   So they originally planned to raise, I think, $122 million in their IPO.
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:03.640]   How much did they get?
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:04.640]   $62.
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.640]   Ow.
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:06.640]   That's got to hurt.
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:07.640]   And you know when it's a good company?
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:10.640]   But it's a good company?
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.640]   Yeah, I like Carbonite.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.640]   The service of the company?
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:15.640]   You don't like it?
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:16.640]   I don't use the product anymore.
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:22.640]   First of all, I think the services behind the time, if I may be honest here, because it's just an insurance play.
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:23.640]   It's just backup.
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:26.640]   It doesn't do any of the cool stuff that Dropbox or Sugar Synchrony these things do.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:27.640]   It's just backup.
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:29.640]   And Apple's going to eat their lunch.
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:30.640]   You know, iCloud.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:35.640]   iCloud, Dropbox, Google Docs, Mesh, Carbonite, I just tried.
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:36.640]   I don't see it.
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:37.640]   Okay.
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:39.640]   Plus, their S1 is kind of a mess.
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:42.640]   I mean, this company has never made money ever.
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:43.640]   They're running out of money.
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:44.640]   They needed to go to the top.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:45.640]   Oh, that's bad.
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:46.640]   Oh, that's bad.
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:49.640]   And the thing is, they actually went back, actually, 30% on the next couple of days.
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:50.640]   Really?
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:51.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:52.640]   I mean, they need this money, somebody from Carbonite out there?
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:53.640]   Sorry.
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:57.640]   They need this money in order to spend it on marketing so they can get more customers and lose more money.
[01:11:57.640 --> 01:11:59.640]   Good, because you know who gets some of that money?
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:00.640]   Yeah, the response.
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:01.640]   Oops.
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:02.640]   Let's move on.
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:03.640]   No, I don't mind.
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:05.640]   You can, no, I think that's important.
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:06.640]   I didn't come to hate it.
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:07.640]   But I'm honest.
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:12.640]   I didn't look at their S1.
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:16.640]   Now, the battle rages between you and everybody else.
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:17.640]   All things D said well.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:20.640]   No, there are others that say October 2.
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:24.640]   The latest rumor is that September, what is it, 4th or 5th?
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:25.640]   7th.
[01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:27.640]   7th that Apple has an event coming up.
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:28.640]   Yes, they do not.
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.640]   But you say they do not, that it will be October.
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:31.640]   October.
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:33.640]   That's what John Petchkowski wrote a story saying this.
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:36.640]   And I was reiterating his story, which he did a couple of weeks ago.
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:40.640]   It's about 11 days ago that it was going to be in October.
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:43.640]   The iPhone 5 launch was going to be coming.
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:46.640]   And then we got caught in the announcement or launch.
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:47.640]   Is it a launch or a launch?
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:48.640]   Is it a launch or a launch?
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:49.640]   Is it jobs there or not?
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:50.640]   And then it was stupid.
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.640]   I made a stupid remark to Arnold Kim who was a very nice guy.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:53.640]   Because I had gotten--
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:54.640]   He's a Mac rumor.
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:55.640]   He's a terrific, he's a great guy.
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:57.640]   And I made a dumb remark.
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:02.640]   Sometimes whenever you do any Apple Store, you get a massive reaction.
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:03.640]   Of course.
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:05.640]   Plus, and maybe it was Friday late.
[01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:08.640]   And I just-- I shouldn't tweet ever on a Friday afternoon.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.640]   This was an excuse, merely excuse for you doing bed YouTube.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:11.640]   Yes, exactly.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:14.640]   The beautiful song I show over, which is one of my favorite songs.
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:17.640]   That's really the only reason you wrote this article.
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:18.640]   Yes, exactly.
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:22.640]   No, I wanted to reiterate John's reporting, which he spent a lot of time nailing this down now.
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:24.640]   So you believe that that's accurate?
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:25.640]   At this moment, yes it is.
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:26.640]   You never know what Apple's going to do.
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:27.640]   You never know.
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:28.640]   This is based on our reporting.
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:31.640]   We had pretty good luck with stories on Apple and John.
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:33.640]   Is it sources within Apple that are cute for this?
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:34.640]   I can't tell you that.
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:39.640]   We believe-- well, and I know who the sources are, and we're very happy with John's reporting.
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:42.640]   John calls it sources with knowledge of the situation.
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:43.640]   Yes, that's the--
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:44.640]   Could be AT&T.
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:45.640]   It could be AT&T.
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:46.640]   It could be AT&T.
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:47.640]   It could be--
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:48.640]   We'll--
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:49.640]   We'll--
[01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:50.640]   --we'll--
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:51.640]   Could be O'Malley.
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:52.640]   High on cupcakes.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:53.640]   I don't know.
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:54.640]   No, it's not a mess.
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:57.640]   Would it be a joint Verizon AT&T announcement, or do you think they won't do that?
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:58.640]   That we don't know about.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:01.640]   So we do-- nothing we don't know we don't put in the stories.
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:02.640]   Right.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:05.640]   You know, all we know is that the event will be in October.
[01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:06.640]   In October.
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:07.640]   The event will be in October.
[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:09.640]   I don't know if they're going to pre-announce it.
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:10.640]   They might pre-announce it.
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:11.640]   They've done it before.
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:14.640]   They could-- the actual launch event of the--
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:15.640]   There's a little app for you.
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:17.640]   So they could announce it in September 7th.
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:18.640]   There's an app for me.
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.640]   We believe that everything is going to happen in October.
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:23.640]   And if it happens in September, we were wrong, or they changed it.
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:24.640]   One or the other, and that's fine.
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:25.640]   We'll say we're wrong.
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:26.640]   We'll be talking about it.
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:27.640]   Apple, it's iPhone 5 launch?
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:31.640]   It's fascinating that one company gets so much attention about just an event.
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:32.640]   I know.
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:36.640]   In fact, there was a fight over whether a rumor or whether it would be September or October
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:37.640]   for a launch of--
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:39.640]   I'll tell you why it's relevant.
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:40.640]   Right.
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:41.640]   Yeah.
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:45.640]   No, but it's relevant because there's a lot of people who are trying to decide, well, should I hang out with this old iPhone?
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:47.640]   I think most people will hang out no matter what.
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:52.640]   But what's interesting about it is that I think there's a lot of stock speculation around the stock too.
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:56.640]   So it's-- you know, you never know where anything is coming from, and anyone who's covering,
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:59.640]   including us, has to be super careful about what we're saying about it.
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:03.640]   And, you know, what's most important is what is in the iPhone 5?
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:04.640]   What's it going to be?
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:08.640]   What's in the iCloud that's supposedly coming, which we believe is also coming?
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:09.640]   So that's roughly something.
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:12.640]   The products are what matter, and we should focus on the product, and not on them.
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:13.640]   Good.
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.640]   Well, let's wait, then, and we'll talk about it when it comes out.
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:16.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:17.640]   Yeah, I kind of agree with you.
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:18.640]   I don't really care.
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:19.640]   Well, I don't not care.
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:24.640]   I just think it's-- Apple really attracts gigantic amounts of attention for almost anything it doesn't--
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:25.640]   I think it's remarkable.
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:27.640]   You have a picture of it's really cool.
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:28.640]   It's really cool.
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:29.640]   I think it's the campus.
[01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:31.640]   Which is actually cool.
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:33.640]   That's a spaceship that lands in Cupertino.
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:35.640]   It actually reminds me of the Pentagon.
[01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:38.640]   Well, I want to know how many years they've been sitting on this property.
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:41.640]   So, look at it, like, is it 125 acres?
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.640]   Yeah.
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:44.640]   They bought it from another tech.
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:49.640]   I bet you they bought it Disney-style, or, you know, all the shell companies, a little bit here, a little bit there.
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:50.640]   Nobody knows what's going on.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:56.640]   But it is-- it is-- it seems like until it is one big-ass former orchard or something.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:57.640]   It is a huge chunk of property.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.640]   Well, as is most of the stuff in Silicon Valley.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:00.640]   It's also pretty cool looking.
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:01.640]   It looks pretty well.
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:02.640]   Did you read this?
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:07.640]   This was exclusive from BroadbandReports.com.
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.640]   Apparently, the FCC accidentally posted--
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:10.640]   It was not an exclusive.
[01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:12.640]   It was not-- it broke up the mail.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:15.640]   It was, I think it was wireless week.
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:17.640]   Okay, we'll give wireless week credit then.
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:23.640]   One of the groups of lawyers working for AT&T accidentally posted something.
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:24.640]   Yes, on the FCC website.
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:25.640]   Whoops.
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:33.640]   In which they basically said, for instance, while the deal to acquire T-Mobile is going to cost $39 billion.
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:43.640]   And one of the pros of this deal was that, "Well, we're going to bring LTE fourth generation wireless networks to 97% of America by this $39 billion deal."
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:54.640]   It pointed out in this letter that the cost of bringing that coverage to 97% of America, if they were just to do it themselves, would be $3.8 billion.
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:55.640]   One-tenth.
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:56.640]   The cost.
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:58.640]   So there goes that excuse.
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:16:59.640]   Right.
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:03.640]   They're spending a lot of money to do something they could have done for one-tenth the cost.
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:05.640]   There's a lot of overlap.
[01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:11.640]   They talk about the overlap between T-Mobile and AT&T's infrastructure.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:13.640]   There's not really two companies joined together.
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:15.640]   They're acquiring the customers.
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:16.640]   They're acquiring--
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:23.640]   Actually, what I think they're trying to do is make sure that there is no remaining company that provides excellent customer service in the competition.
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:34.640]   And once you've eliminated actual real-world evidence of thoughtful, considered customer service, they can go on and continue to drive what little customer service may offer into the ground.
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:35.640]   That's my theory.
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:40.640]   If you even believe all this, does it even matter because they've already bought the congressman?
[01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:41.640]   So, you know--
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:42.640]   No, no, no, no.
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:43.640]   They spent $11 million.
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:50.640]   They spent $11 million lobbying to make sure that wireless internet was not being going to be regulated by the FCC.
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:51.640]   Right.
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:52.640]   That was the $11 million last year.
[01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:56.640]   Now, they have another $11 million to spend on elections this year to buy the congressman.
[01:17:56.640 --> 01:18:01.640]   Just what I don't understand is why these congressmen get sold for so cheap.
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:02.640]   Yeah!
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.640]   You're going to be charging-- I mean, this is a thousand of dollars.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:05.640]   Thousands of dollars.
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:06.640]   They're going, "No, whatever you want."
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:07.640]   They're spending $39 billion.
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:09.640]   Come on, take at least 3.9.
[01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:10.640]   I think it has to do.
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:11.640]   10% of the card.
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.640]   If you want to be the mob, act like the mob.
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:17.640]   Don't get the black bag.
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:18.640]   Yeah.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:19.640]   Get the black bag.
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:20.640]   Do it right.
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:25.640]   By the way, this is the kind of the coda to the BART story.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.640]   Anonymous apparently hacked.
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:34.640]   San Francisco's My BART website and got thousands of names, addresses, and numbers which they planned.
[01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:35.640]   This was a great diversion.
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:43.640]   They said they were going to hack BART.gov and they hacked My BART, which was some BART related service.
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:44.640]   But it is BART.
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:45.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:49.640]   But it was like, "Oh, let's lock down BART.gov."
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.640]   This probably wasn't even the real strike.
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:54.640]   This is probably somebody got bored waiting for the actual--
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:56.640]   Probably all the trains are going to go different places tomorrow.
[01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:58.640]   This is the first time I've actually said "Go Anonymous."
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:18:59.640]   Yeah.
[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:01.640]   Obviously a man that does not commute on BART.
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:02.640]   Yeah.
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:06.640]   Well, I guess so is the people who are on this site are-- it was their information.
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:07.640]   See, that's not good.
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:09.640]   Because then they're revealing the victim's information.
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:10.640]   That's not cool.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:11.640]   That's not cool.
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:13.640]   So is that what they did?
[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:14.640]   Did they reveal this?
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:15.640]   They had a mission of the--
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:16.640]   I just told an ex-site.
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:17.640]   I don't know what they did.
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:21.640]   They had a fax, an email bomb action where it would fill every inbox and fax machine at BART.
[01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:23.640]   This they claimed they'll do this yesterday.
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:30.640]   With thousands of copies of its message claiming the outage was unacceptable, a list of those email addresses has just been posted.
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:35.640]   It would remove BART's website for exactly six hours, twice as long as they cut off the cell phones for--
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:36.640]   Didn't happen.
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:37.640]   That hasn't happened.
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:40.640]   And a physical protest will take place at the Civic Center BART station.
[01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:43.640]   And everybody gets wedgies at BART.
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:45.640]   [ Laughter ]
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:47.640]   Anyway, I'm going to wrap this thing up.
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:48.640]   I think we've covered all the stories.
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:50.640]   I've never came up with anything at all.
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:51.640]   I'm here.
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:52.640]   That's all.
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:53.640]   You're here, and that's all that we care about.
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:54.640]   We love all the bell.
[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:55.640]   This is like a big, big day for me.
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:20:02.640]   I get to see you and Patrick together in a show all over again as a screen saver is found.
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:06.640]   I can just say, "I can need to cupcake now."
[01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:07.640]   No, no.
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:09.640]   It's too sweet already.
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:10.640]   But the OMA is good to see you.
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:13.640]   GigaOMA.com started in the Starbucks.
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:14.640]   See, I didn't know that.
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.640]   That's pretty cool.
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:18.640]   It's called OMBUX on 4-square.
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:19.640]   OMBUX?
[01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:20.640]   OMBUX?
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:21.640]   OMBUX.
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:22.640]   OMBUX.
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:23.640]   So one down.
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:24.640]   Wow.
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:25.640]   Clay and battery.
[01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:26.640]   No kidding.
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:27.640]   That's a good--
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:29.640]   And you were there every day writing your stuff and writing your stuff.
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:30.640]   Yeah, 'til they kicked me out.
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:31.640]   They say, "You can't come anymore."
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:32.640]   That's actually a great story.
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:33.640]   OMBUX.
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:34.640]   I'm going to check in at OMBUX.
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:42.640]   So the Starbucks is not letting people not use power outlets in Starbucks.
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:43.640]   Because they want your battery to run out and get out of there?
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:44.640]   Yeah, and then you leave.
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:48.640]   And I think how many great companies might not be born because of that.
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:51.640]   They're doing a disservice to America, in my opinion.
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:52.640]   Have you reached that column yet?
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:53.640]   Why not yet?
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:54.640]   Just in your Starbucks?
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:55.640]   Your OMBUX?
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:56.640]   Or because I just used it the other day.
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:57.640]   Everywhere?
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:58.640]   You're in the home box.
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.640]   I just have called it OMBUX so that I can be--
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:03.640]   But I think I was in yours the other day and was able to use power.
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:05.640]   But it came out last week.
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:06.640]   Oh, really?
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:07.640]   That was the story.
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:08.640]   It says, "Yeah, it came up with a story."
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:09.640]   People do spend a lot of time there.
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:16.640]   It's an opportunity for Pete's second cup, blue bottle, sight glass, no vifi and then
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:17.640]   captions, these days.
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:18.640]   No, vifi and then captions, really?
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:19.640]   Yeah.
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:21.640]   The trend is not--
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:22.640]   Because they don't want people sitting there camping there.
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:27.640]   Well, they have like 22 college students and would be startup people not actually buying
[01:21:27.640 --> 01:21:28.640]   anything from the event.
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:29.640]   You know what?
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:33.640]   We're going to give free coffee and cupcakes to anybody who wants to use our wifi here.
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:37.640]   If you want to start a company, we've got plenty of room in the brand new Twitbrickhouse.
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:40.640]   Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, there's a certain business manager that's now--
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:45.640]   Oh, I think we can do a little mini co-working space here and space allow.
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:47.640]   Use our wifi, have cupcakes.
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:49.640]   You should sign up on loose cubes.
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:51.640]   There's AirBnb for business.
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:52.640]   They're loose cubes.
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.640]   Yeah, I did a story.
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:55.640]   That's a cool idea.
[01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:56.640]   That's a cool idea.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:57.640]   You should re-rave, man.
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:58.640]   You should run an invite camp.
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:21:59.640]   Yeah.
[01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:01.640]   And that's a great idea.
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:02.640]   We don't need to invite him.
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:03.640]   Just read his column.
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:04.640]   It's all there.
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:05.640]   You can use our wifi.
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:09.640]   We rented something from AirBnb next week, so you can come there if you'd like.
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:10.640]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:11.640]   That's cool.
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:14.640]   Cara Swisher, thank you for coming all this way off insti.com.
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:15.640]   It's a pleasure.
[01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:18.640]   And it's always a pleasure to see you, and thanks for bringing the family, too.
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:19.640]   That was fun.
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:20.640]   They'll be back soon to play your video game.
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:25.640]   We have a new game console, Arcade Console, which we're so happy about.
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:28.640]   Yeah, I had to drag my kid as like nails.
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:32.640]   It's Maine, but it's got like 800 games on this real console.
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:35.640]   Who may, what's the guy's name so I can give him credit?
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:37.640]   Joe Huckabee.
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:38.640]   Huckabee.
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:39.640]   Twitter Arcade.
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:43.640]   Yeah, he made this Twitter arcade machine and brought it this yesterday.
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:46.640]   It's been the biggest time sync ever.
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:49.640]   I'm leaving my nine-year-old here until next week, and I'll come back next week.
[01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:50.640]   Yeah, it's fantastic.
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:51.640]   It'd be great.
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:52.640]   So thank you, Joseph, for doing this.
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:53.640]   Thank you, Ralph Needleman, for making it down here.
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:55.640]   Up here, I hope you'll come back.
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:56.640]   I might.
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:57.640]   Cupcakes?
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:58.640]   All right, cupcakes, yeah, I'll come back.
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.640]   And to my old pal, Patrick Norton.
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:04.640]   So good to see you again and we'll see you next week for our grand opening.
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:06.640]   It's the official opening of this.
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:07.640]   Is there a party?
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:08.640]   There's a little party you can come?
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:09.640]   Yeah, we'll invite you.
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:11.640]   We'll bring the nine-year-old in the back of the corner.
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:12.640]   No.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:13.640]   You know what?
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:14.640]   That's a good idea.
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:17.640]   We should put a quarter's thing in there and then we can make a little money on the side.
[01:23:17.640 --> 01:23:18.640]   That's a great idea.
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:22.640]   We do this show every Sunday afternoon at 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time at live.twit.tv.
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:26.640]   I do hope you'll watch live because we then you can join us in the chat room.
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:28.640]   You can be part of the live crowd.
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:31.640]   You hear all the expletives, undelied.
[01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:33.640]   Oh, I forgot.
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:35.640]   Tom Merritt, the week ahead.
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:40.640]   Let's see what we're going to be covering all next week on TNT, our new show at 2.30
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:43.640]   Pacific 5.30 Eastern on live.twit.tv.
[01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:44.640]   Tom?
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:45.640]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:48.640]   Here's a look at some of the stories we'll be talking about on Tech News today in the week ahead.
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:50.640]   Tuesday, August 16th, Internet Explorer.
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:52.640]   It turns sweet 16.
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:56.640]   Perfect opportunity to upgrade from IE6 if you're still on that old thing.
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:24:04.640]   Also on Tuesday, Toshiba's Cosmo F-755 delivers glasses-free 3D for $1,700 in a laptop.
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:09.640]   Wednesday, August 17th, LinuxCon kicks off in Vancouver, the 20th anniversary of LinuxCon
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:10.640]   at the Hyatt Regency.
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:15.640]   Also, Wednesday, August 17th, Nokia and Microsoft hosting a special event which they swear
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:19.640]   will not be the introduction of the first Nokia Windows phone.
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:24.640]   And Thursday, August 18th, Verizon expands their LTE coverage to places like Albany, Tucson,
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.640]   and expanded coverage in Salt Lake City in Boston.
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:28.640]   That's a bad sign.
[01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:29.640]   That's a look at the weekend.
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:30.640]   Dr. Leo.
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:31.640]   Thank you, Tom.
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:32.640]   Great.
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:34.640]   I'm glad we got that one in before the show was over.
